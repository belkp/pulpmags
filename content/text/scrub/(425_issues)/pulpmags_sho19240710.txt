 which tooth brush do you buy

            isnt this first picture brought home to you vividly at times 
            toothbrushes-lying exposed on a counter picked up and
            thoughtlessly fingered then put back for you to buy even
            those packed in cartons are taken out to be seen and thumbed

           just contrast that unsanitary handling with the clean owens
           staple-tied tooth brush each one is sold in a sparklingglass
           container every feature of the brush may be seen without
           dangerous exposure or handling

             notice the small brush trimmed to fit the teeth bristle tufts are
             wedge-shaped-to clean thoroughly in every crack and crevice the
             large end tuft cleans around the usually unreachable back molars

            the gracefully curved handle makes correct brushing easier the
            improved staple-tied process holds every bristle tuft securely
            into the handle by a hidden staple handles come in six differ-
            ent colors an individual brush for each member of your family

           you cannot get all these improvements in any other tooth
           brush made yet the owens in the protecting glass container costs
           you no more than ordinary tooth brushes-  and  cents
           each for childs youths and adults sizes see it at your druggists

important every owens tooth brush is delivered to the
customer in a sanitary glass container this method of packing is the
most sanitary ever devised for tooth brushes and the glass container
is meant to be thrown away when the tooth brush has been removed

   let this simple truth guide you
   to natural beauty

 we urge you not to over-
 look one simple truth-
 soaps function is to cleanse
 not to cure or to transform

   dermatologists agree on this
 additional important point
 too only by cleansing the skin
 thoroughly yet gently and
 safely can any soap help to
 promote beauty and only
 pure soap can cleanse thor-
 oughly and safely

  you know already that
 ivory soap is pure-that it
 contains no medicaments no
 coloring matter no strong per-
 fumes if we had felt that
 any additional ingredients
 would improve ivory you
 may be sure we would have
 used them long ago

   but perhaps it may surprise
 you to know that simple wash-
 ing with ivory is the very
 finest treatment you can give
 to your skin

   a face bath of ivory and
 warm water once or twice
 daily followed by a cold rinse
 gently removes the film of
 dust oil or powder thoroughly
 cleanses the pores and brings
 a fresh lovely natural color
 unusually dry skins often
 need a small amount of pure
 cold cream

   the millions of friends of
 ivory and the multitude of
 women who have been using
 much more costly soaps have
 welcomed the new graceful
 cake of guest ivory fash-
 ioned for slim fingers this
 dainty white cake is genuine
 ivory soap-with all of ivorys
 traditional purity and mild-
 ness-as fine as soap can be
 yet guest ivory costs but five
 cents

save or invest

suppose you are a person of moderate
means and suppose you are still young
enough which means  suppose any age
up to ninety to have the chief goal of your
life still before you are you scrimping to
save money for
that goal or are
you trying to put
your little margin
to work for you

henry ford in his
autobiography sets
the problem very
neatly when he
says

  it is possible even
to overemphasize the
saving habit it is
proper and desirable
that everyone have
a margin   

but it can be over-
done    most
men who are labori-
ously saving a few
dollars would be
better to invest-
first in themselves
and then in some
useful work   

young men ought to
invest in themselves
to increase creative
value after they
have taken them-
selves to the peak
of usefulness then
will be time enough
to think of laying aside as a fixed policy a
certain substantial share of income

  in other words money as such is not
wealth and money which is idle or hoarded

 is the advice to young men first to invest in
 themselves did you ever think of your
 education-that is your education in its
  broader aspects-
 as an investment in
 yourself yet that
 is just what it is
 because any train-
 ing that is training
 will increase your
 value to the com-

 production means
 ideas broadening

 are by putting

the trouble at tres pinos

  a complete novel

  by j allan dunn
  author of the men of the mesa mesquite the lightning kid etc

          these was really trouble at tres pinos and slim marvin rode
          right into it but slim was not the sort to mind trouble
          in a good cause and he got it-night raiders cattle rust-
          lers bad men and all their accompanying villainies

slim marvin rode blithely
toward caroca the county seat
in search of a job the last one
had been spoiled for him by the
advent of a new owner who cared
little for cattle and less for the west be-
ing intent only upon getting back the mon-
ey he had advanced on a mortgage the in-
terest of which had been only intermit-
tently paid by a man who was a good cat-
tleman but a better spender

  there had been words between slim and
the mortgagor who had seemed to enter-
tain the curious idea that because he had
not reaped the financial profit he antici-
pated his ranch hands should be willing
to accept a loss in the wages due them

  the memory of what he had told the
new owner helped to keep slim in a good
humor his phrasing had been brief and
crisp and eminently to the point it had
got under the thick hide of the man who
had paid him in full and dispensed with
his services after slim had told him that
he would rather sift cinders in hell than
work for a hombre whose nature would
contaminate a coyote-or words to that
effect

  so with his best horse and saddle under
him his second string left with a friend at

  cio

a neighboring ranch a nice pay-check in
his pocket slim had no cares he was
a good cowman-none better-and he had
small fears of not landing a job-as soon
as his money gave out meantime he
meant to sleep some eat sweetened pies
and cake gamble treat any friends he
might make or find at caroca and gener-
ally relax after long weeks of work

  he had tried out his own county with-
out finding an opening that suited him and
now he was adventuring into compara-
tively new fields only once before had
he been to caroca and he associated that
visit with a measure of ill luck that he
hoped ardently to redeem on this occasion
he had got into a poker game with cer-
tain individuals who made a profession of
that pastime and had convinced slim for
the time being that he was merely an ama-
teur he remembered the features of
those individuals and he burned to once
more sit with them at a table where the
chips clicked and the limit was not men-
tioned

  slims name had grown up with him
bestowed upon him the first day he ap-
peared a stripling of seventeen astride a
half-broken broomtail mustang at the fall
roundup that was ten years back and
short stories



slim had developed in many ways slim
was scarcely the sobriquet for him now
but he was lean and his
waistline was still ten
inches less than that of
his chest as he sat in
the saddle his shoulders
seemed ultra broad and
when the wind flattened
the cloth of his shirt
against his shoulders it
disclosed flat masses of
muscle that could work
like ropes in well-oiled
sheaves

  good to look at was marvin no girl
had ever called him handsome but he sug-
gested the sun and the wind virility and
friendliness with eyes that could chill and
a jaw that could jut upon occasion into a
welded firmness and insistency that caused
his fellow riders to speak of slim as one
who did to take along girls usually
looked at him twice at least

  slims singing intentions were better
than his execution his voice was bet-
ter in speech than song but the day was
fine and the wind blew free the mesas and
the sharper peaks of the esquelitos moun-
tains stood out sharply defined beyond the
plain down which he rode on his way to
caroca a song bird was warbling as
sweetly as any mocking bird in his own
home state below the dixie line his bay
mount with the three white stockings and
the blaze down its roman nose was going
strong on springy pasterns the mesquite
waved lacily and slim was constrained to
express himself in sentiment-something
he steadfastly abjured in everyday af-
fairs this was vicarious slim was no
poet

hej name it was cherokee mary

she was sweet as a cherokee rose

though her manners were often contrary
she was light as an elf on her toes

she could dance like a zephyr-blown thistle
she could smile like the witch that she was
and when she got mad she could bristle
and cuss like a good one because

although she was cute as a fairy
the cutest gal ever i saw

yet noboddy wedded with mary
for-she was a cherokee squaw

  and im no squawman pete he con-
fided to the bay whats mo i aint
pinin to hitch up to any woman brown
red or white me i think too much of
niah libutty hawss if i was married

now id have had to take what that son 
a gun offered me back to the ranch stbad
of tellin him to his face where he-all
headed in an you an me wouldnt be
lopin along this fine mawnin with one
hundred an eighty bucks in our pockets
hawss lookin forward to apple pie that
aint made out of dried apples fo fou
git one you sweet-toothed caballo sures
we hit caroca reckon this is owl can-
yon an were half way there

  owl canyon thrust itself out of the plain
in unusual fashion two walls of rock hon-
eycombed with caves so that the weath-
ered fronts resembled sponges the dirt
sloping back from their crests to common
level again and an irregular passage be-
tween the walls midway a spring of
water gushed slightly warm slightly sul-
phurous but refreshing at that stage of a
ride made dusty with alkali and sufficient
to cause a little oasis of grass and low
trees

  usually there were cattle there and
sometimes tracks showed where deer came
down from the distant hills to drink the
waters that instinct told them was good
for them but it was close to noon and
all four-footed things save those pressed
into the service of man were enjoying
what shade and coolness they might find

  slim on his seventh stanza which told
of the horrors of an indian mother-in-law
checked song and horse simultaneously as
he rode out of a bay in the cliff following
the scanty strip of shade and saw the
tableau staged on the turf near the spring
two ponies grazed in the background
their riders had apparently dismounted
for a drink one was a man not as tall
as slim but much heavier clad in a shirt
with an aggravated pattern of plaid gen-
erally affected by the film variety of cow-
boy rather than by the genuine variety
he was wearing worn leather chaparejos
on bowed legs leather gauntlets and over
all a cartridge belt that holstered an ivory-
handled gun his stetson hat lay on the
grass slim took a dislike to him at first
sight of the swarthy face almost as dark as
a mexicans and the sneeringly trium-
phant features to say nothing of his action
which aroused in slim a consuming desire
to make a third in the tableau-which he
did

  the man had seized by the wrist a girl
slender in riding togs of khaki breeches
brown boots linen shirt of russet brown
with a tie of bright scarlet there seemed
to have been some sort of a previous scuf-
fle for her dark hair was disarranged and
the trouble at tres pios

long strands of it hung to her waist she
was sunbrowned but color flamed high in
her cheeks and slim caught the flash of
spirit in her eyes as he off-saddled and
leaped to the rescue

  she was half the mans size and weight
but she defended herself with a despera-
tion that held off his advantage once
she scored with a rake of her fingernails
across his leathern cheek that brought the
quick blood and a curse as she all but
broke clear while he strove to get an arm
about her

  the oath was but half delivered when
slim cracked the attacker neatly over the
elbow with the barrel of his colt and slid
the gun back into holster while the other
letting go the girl swerved to face the
newcomer he was rubbing his tingling
temporarily useless arm and swearing in
earnest

  shut up snapped slim pronto
mister or ill put a hole through yo wind-
pipe 

  the man conscious of his lame arm siz-
ing up slims calm countenance that was
only a mask for flaming eyes that shone
like steel checked his tongue looking at
the cowboy with venomous eyes that
rolled in yellowish whites slightly blood-
shot

  slim had barely glanced at the girl he
was not interfering as a personal matter-
save as the man had sworn at him directly
-but as one of ordinary range chivalry
it would have been the same if the girl
had been an old crone-even the mother
f cherokee mary

  for a man to handle a woman brutally
was not permissible that was the code
of the west and the other had broken it
slim intended to administer punishment
but first he swept off his sombrero to the
lady ignoring the scowling and now silent
assailant knowing that the others gun
arm was out of commission for the time
being sure also that there was small doubt
about the mans will to speed bullet-or
knife-to slims vitals

   looked like to me that you all might
be annoyed some by this coyote he said
in his soft drawl that took nothing away



from his suggestion of efficiency rather
enhanced it against his lithe and sinewy
figure and the lights of battle already burn-
ing in his eyes yet he was a little abashed
at the beauty of the girl it smote him sud-
denly like a light flashed in a dark room
her eyes were a purplish gray large of
pupil and long of curling lashes her nose
short and straight showed above lips that
were most clearly designed-even to slim
that youthful but sincere misogynist-for
the tantalizing of all men and the ultimate
reward of one this though at the mo-
ment they were set in a half sneer that did
not relax as slim spoke to her while her
eyes were anything but friendly

  i suppose you meant well she said
but it was not at all necessary for you to
interfere i am quite capable of taking
care of myself

  like all men who are women-shy slim
was particularly susceptible to their use of
feminine weapons he had no idea of
their instinctive exaggerations he was
taken aback feeling like a fool and fancy-
ing he looked like one conscious of a jaw
that sagged in sheer amazement

  had he stumbled on a quarrel that was
going to be eventually ended by a recon-
ciliation the more satisfactory for the tem-
per and violence that led up to it  he had
heard of such things-usually between
married folks he knew of one or two
examples personally combinations of bul-
lies and viragos that had helped him ac-
quire his bachelors degree did she like
the roughness of this man was she by
any chance his wife he saw no wed-
ding ring on the brown but shapely hand
and- it was incredible that a girl who
looked like her could endure such famili-
arity  there must be some special reason
for her utterance

  the ardor that on her behalf had
fanned the flame of his chivalry wavered
and blew strong again but he left her
out of the affair from that moment

  im right sorry i disturbed you all he
said gravely and the note of sarcasm was
hard to distinguish though the girl looked
at him as if she suspected its presence
then her glance changed warning leaped


into it slims back was to the man
might have spoken but he whirled at the
first hint of caution

  the others gun was out of its holster
before slims hand started to swoop down
to the butt of his own weapon the odds
were all in favor of the first to draw

  stick yore hands up cowboy paw
the sky the stranger said his sloe eyes
glittering evilly his uncouth face twisted
with rage and the desire the intent to kill
he was more beast than man at the mo-
ment slims first dexterous blow had left
him half crazy with one set purpose-to
get even slim saw that he meant to fire
whether he lifted his hands or not

  sled raynor had started in as ranch
blacksmith and wound up as foreman
partly by natural ability partly by his
bullying tactics backed by personal prow-
ess that made him able to boss the ordinary
run of hands and aided by a cunning that
was efficient though of a low order

  he made the boast and held the reputa-
tion of being the fastest man with a gun
in caroca county-also the worst so far
as real manhood was concerned but this
last was not generally mentioned sled
had his following and it was not scrupu-
lous but he was proud of his gunplay
proud of his speed and his strength and if
anyone had told him that a man could
stand with his back to him and then beat
him out with a gun draw to the level sled
would have laughed loudly before he pro-
claimed the other a liar and laid bets to
prove his own superiority

  stick em up you-

  the pause came as sleds eyes widened
in astonishment with something of the ter-
ror of a bully who finds
himself beaten at his
own game

  slims gun cama out
of leather in a blue
streak his elbow stif-
fened close beside his
hip forearm almost lev-
el he wore his gun
low

  there was the merest
jerk as the barrel settled into position with
its ominous muzzle like the eye of death
lined on sleds heart-just a fraction of a
second ahead of sleds own weapon that
was still slightly deflected toward the
ground

  under his swarthy skin sleds pigmen-
tary cells reacted like those f a chameleon
he turned gray with the fear of the grave
upon him while he quailed and sobered at

the menace and contempt in the eyes of
slim all the urge of the mescal he had
drunk in caroca that morning died out of
him

  by a tremendous effort he checked the
rise of his gun an inch more and slims
colt would belch fire and lead sled
dropped the ivory-handled weapon in sign
of defeat in token of surrender in a mute
plea for mercy

  slim stooped supple as a big cat picked
up the gun broke it sprayed the cartridges
on the turf and handed the weapon to the
girl she took it in a sort of daze at the
swift vision she had had of sudden and
violent death and its diversion by the swift
action of the drawling stranger

  she stared wide-eyed as slim ejected
the shells from his own colt into the palm
of his hand pocketed them returned the
empty gun to holster and deliberately
slapped sled raynor across the face

  this was a challenge calculated as much
to smooth the rebuff he had received from
the girl as by a desire to give sled the les-
son he ached to administer the girls
snub had penetrated farther lay deeper
than slim imagined

  the color came back to sleds face the
sting of the blow roused his spirit the
fear of death was taken from him and the
other was delivered into his great hands
he came at the lighter man with the bel-
low of a bull fists half open clutching for
a clinch that slim avoided sending sled
staggering with a smash to the jaw that
rocked his head slim ducking a wild
flail landed his left full on the mouth
splitting a lip breaking the skin of his
own knuckles against the others teeth

  from the standpoint of  a sporting spec-
tator it was a pretty but one-sided fight
slim had all the best of it he had no
ring to hem him in and he eluded sleds
rushes as easily as a banderillero avoids
the charge of the bull his first two blows
had taken away some of sleds new-found
confidence the bitter hemlock of defeat
had actually been handed to the bully in
the moment when his gunplay proved in-
adequate he rushed and roared and
flogged in a blind rage one eye promptly
closed and rapidly blackening his ribs
drummed in a tattoo that did his wind no
good all his best blows warded off
dodged ducked by the assailant who
danced about him with arms shuttling in
and out

  the girl stood apart with small fists
clenched at her sides her face a riddle that
was hard to read she had dropped the

short stories k
    she
the trouble at tres pinos

gun resentfully on realizing that she had
apparently been made a convenience of
and she watched the swift short combat
with eyes that missed nothing her lips
parted her slender body tense with excite-
ment

  once or twice she gasped and caught
her lip when at last slim got home with
a jolt that shot from hip to point with the
propulsive force of slims shoulder mus-
cles behind it sled hit the grass quiv-
ered surged vainly in an attempt to rise
and lay still his nerve connections shat-
tered

  slim looked at his man measuring his
length and then he walked away without
a backward glance ignoring the girl until
he had mounted then he once more
swept off his sombrero touched spurs to
petes flanks and loped away while sled
got staggeringly to his feet and the girl
gazed after him with curious speculation in
her eyes

lim met the same poker players in
caroca before he had been there
many hours and once again the
fatuous pride of the amateur card-player
was humbled by the technique of the pro-
fessional against which the best of luck
was ground as against a grindstone his
second night found him with his money
vanished and his experience a little ex-
tended he sat between two worthies who
whipsawed him beautifully tilting his
raises until he was forced to drop many
a good hand by their persistency only to
see a lower win

   he lost the last of his dollars on a show-
down swallowed the drink that the win-
ner of the last jackpot had bought accord-
ing to card custom rolled a cigarette and
declared himself through

  empty as a last years birds-nest
gents he said with a smile now ive
got to git me a job mebbe ive learned
enough sense to keep away from a game i
dont know how to play-not havin a heap
of practice-but i doubt it ill probably
be back some time soons i git me a roll
anyone know of someone aimin to hire
a hand

  the players did not but a man stopped
him near the door

  if youre lookin for a job he said
joe walsh is in the dance-hall takin a
whirl he owns the t p outfit i heard
him early this evenin sayin he needed a
rider got some colts he wants busted
you look like you could ride some

  my laigs are long enough if thats

what you mean said slim im much
obliged to you for tellin me i wish i
could ask you to have a little liquor with
me suh but im clean what sot of a
lookin gent is this walsh

  the man described him briefly but ac-
curately and slim readily picked him out
as the dance ended and the partners went
to the tables for the inevitable order

  walsh was a good looking chap with a
weak chin and a ready but somewhat vacu-
ous laugh that was encouraged by the li-
quor he had drunk he was fairly sober
but his talk was inclined to babble and his
attentions to the synthetic blonde with
whom he clinked glasses had long since
passed the merely friendly stage

  slim knew that in all probability the girl
would leave walsh as soon as the music
started for the next dance there were at
least six men for every girl and while
some of them were dance-shy it was not
considered good form for any man to at-
tempt a monopoly of girls hired as public
entertainers at least during business hours
the girls regarded this custom as a set
rule and as the jazzy orchestra of mexi-
cans struck up the blonde diplomatically
disengaged herself with a smile and a side-
long look at slim that was clearly an invi-
tation but slim slipping into a seat next
to walsh disregarded it

  the girl was not without her good looks
and walsh after an ineffectual clutch at
her gazed at slim with eyes that were be-
coming vacuous but held a hint of re-
sentment at the latters intrusion

  if slim had danced with the girl he
would have lost all chance of a job with
the t p outfit but he had no fancy for
it though he liked dancing well enough on
occasion dance-hall girls were to him
impersonal objects he was sorry for
them though he knew that in the main they

rancher seemed to pull his features to-
gether and his loose lips tightened im
lookin fo a job slim added

  walsh surveyed him with a glance that
took in the others evident efficiency visi-
bly stamped upon him from dented stet-
son to high-heeled boots

  i can use another man he said got
some colts that need breaking after that


short stories v

line-riding been losin stock lately you
aint afraid to shoot-cae it was neces-
sary 

  reckon not drawled slim what
are you all paying

  walsh countered with a question that
showed he had business sense for all the
tell-tale signs of weakness written on his
smooth-shaven face and the odor of whis-
ky on his breath slim told of previous
employ and a bargain was made

  i aint goin out to tres pinos till to-
morrow morning said walsh you
need an advance

  they got my last pay-check divided up
between em in there said slim with a
laugh nodding toward the adjoining
gambling room but i got my room an
my hawss paid fo up till termorrer i ate
a good supper an i reckon i can make out
without drawin none i suah hate to do
that my belts full of catridges an i
got plenty bull durham an papehs so
im set

  there were things about walsh that
slim rather liked one of them was the
way in which he respected slims inde-
pendence and did not press the loan

  have breakfast with me he said
we can talk things over and have a
drink now to cinch the contract

  slim accepted the man who brought
the whisky told walsh that some friends
were waiting for him to make up a game

  promised em id play he said see
you later ill find out if my lucks any
better than yours with a reluctant look
to where the blonde was dancing with a
burly and none too agile cattleman the
owner of the t p outfit at tres pinos
lurched over the floor and disappeared

  slim finished his drink and rolled a
cigarette he had landed a job which
was the main thing and gave him content
but there were certain things about it that
provided food for thought he was not a
professional bronco buster a job usually
performed by a specialist trailing from
outfit to outfit but he had no doubt of his
own ability to handle unbroken colts it
was the suggestion that stock was being
taken from walsh that interested him it
held a hint of adventure that appealed to
him walsh was he considered the type
of man apt to be lax in his handling of
ranch affairs he had brains enough if he
cared to concentrate them upon business
and not depreciate them with alcohol and
affairs with dance-hall girls that of
course was his own affair and none of
slims but the latterwondered what sort

of foreman he would find at the ranch
unless that individual was essentially cap-
able he did not think the t p outfit likely
to be paying many dividends it does not
take the loss of many steers to swallow up
profits

  the dance ended the blonde refused
a drink with her partner which meant a
percentage loss to her and his dissatisfac-
tion his eyes followed her resentfully as
she made for the table where slim was sit-
ting but he accepted the situation and van-
ished in the direction of the bar

  i wouldnt dance with that bear she
told slim as she took the seat that walsh
had just left most of em dance like
they were crushing rock its a treat to
get a partner thats light on his feet she
flirted with the set of her dress at the
shoulder strap pouted as she saw the ef-
fect was lost on slim asked him for the
makings and rolled a cigarette deftly as he
could have done it himself save for a
certain hardness like a mask enhanced by
her makeup she possessed beauty and a
measure of individual charm that had not 
been altogether tarnished beyond doubt
she was a favorite and used to having her
favors appreciated her singling out of
slim a newcomer had been noticed she
considered him with a sidelong glance be-
tween darkened lashes

  arent you going to buy me a drink
she asked slim flushed a little under his
tan

  id like to he said but im flat as a
sheet of papeh just hired out to the
t p outfit because my roll done evapo-
rated

  joe walsh hired you hes a good
friend of mine he promised to get up
a picnic for me out to the ranch

  slim eliminated all expression from his
face he might have made it too blank
for the girl looked at him sharply a
ranch where girls of the blondes type were
invited out on pleasure parties by the own-
er did not coincide with his idea of a prop-
erly run outfit play was one thing but
pastimes of this type were better kept away
from the range

  youre from the south aint you
she went on im from geogia tnysef

i was bohn in savannah her accent
was suddenly assertive and to slim it
sounded somewhat spurious though he
was too polite to pass even silent judgment
he knew mighty little about girls this
one made him uneasy though that she had
chosen him as a favorite was patent even
to his lack of conceit i like southern
the trouble at tres pinos



boys she continued they know how
to treat a lady no matteh in what circum-
stances they happen to find her youll
have a drink with me and tell me yo

name 

  slim looked at her smiled and shook
his head

  i dont mind tellin you my name he
said its robert marvin-slim they
call me mostly but i reckon id ratheh
wait till i can pay fo the treat thankin
you just the same

  the girl flared up the spark had
started some time since when her wom-
ans instinct had told her that slim was
not falling for her blandishments she
had noticed smiles and looks between girls
at other tables that meant slurs later
against her powers of fascination slim
showed well in a womans eyes they
sensed his physical strength and mental
cleanness in a different virile way he
was as graceful as any woman that he
had not responded to the advances of the
girl who was assumed to be the main
feminine attraction at the cactus did not
lessen his attractiveness to these worn si-
rens but it gave them a desired tool with
which to probe her and she knew they
would not hesitate to use it

   slim is right she said her voice a
trifle shrill her nos-
trils dilating as she
rose slim on man-
ners and slim on di-
nero whats the idea
of sitting in here if you
cant buy a round if
you want to bum drinks
you stand a better
chance in the bar cow-
boy

  her hands were on
her hips and the keen edge of a brittle
temper showed in her eyes as she looked
contemptuously at him and then glanced
round slim sensed that she was spoiling
for a row hoping to find a champion his
face hardened and his eyes were like bits
of ice when she met them again their
chill seemed to affect the girl she shiv-
ered and turned the action into a shrug as
she walked away the virago in her mo-
mentarily subdued until she heard the tit-
ter of her mates

  slim slowly turned brick red challenged
as a bum and unable to disprove it he
felt that the eyes of all the room were upon
him he developed a cold rage at the girl
behind his heat and knew that he had
made an enemy of her she might try to

use her influence with walsh to lose slim
his job not that slim bothered over-
much about losing a job but he had cot-
toned to walsh somehow for all the oth-
ers condition he did not think walsh
was the man to fire a good hand on account
of the dislike of a dance-hall girl he did
not believe that walsh sober was infatu-
ated with la rose one half so much as
la rose was trying to get walsh into her
web by hook or crook slims experience
of such women was largely vicarious but
what he did know caused him to consider
them hard as nails where business was
concerned and their business was one
side of what men considered pleasure

  still the taunt she flung at him rankled
it made him refuse more than one invita-
tion from men he had met and treated
while his money lasted and he left the cac-
tus early and abruptly his new employer
busy at a game of stud poker slim went
to the stable where pete was corraled and
saw that the bay had been fed and watered
properly before he strolled to his hotel
it was too early to turn in he had noth-
ing better to do than talk to pete who was
at least a good listener so slim squatted
down in the starlight where pete pulled at
his hay inside a shelter and shade shed
stretched along one side of the corral and
divided into stalls for feeding purposes

  shed as soon knifed me as not pete
he said softly ill say shed be some
catamount when she gits into action its
a safe bet shes no friend of mine from
now on

  it was a safe bet la rose stung by the
looks and whispers of the other girls had
her chagrin made superlative by the fact
that the broad-shouldered narrow-hipped
cowboy with his clean manliness and frank
eyes had somehov broken through a hard
and bitter shell to instincts she had not
experienced since her girlhood and she
hated and despised herself for response to
that involuntary appeal here was the
type of man she-as a girl-would have
intuitively desired for a mate all that
sort of thing was long since over

  slim had looked at her with cold eyes
he had made her afraid made her feel
where he placed her she had humiliated
him she hoped but not more than she was
herself humiliated

  he aint the kind to take up with my
sort she told herself thinks im dirt
under his feet damn him ill get even
with him if it kills me

  women of her type having cast away
delicacy are the more sensitive of any de-


short stories

predation by another excitement to
them means forgetfulness and la rose
craved for ascendancy over men slim
had touched a side of her long unrespon-
sive and his fancied contempt spurred her
beyond reason

  she had no especial fondness for walsh
with walshs foreman she had had an af-
fair which threatened to terminate before
she desired it the man had grown cold
she had seen her power over him slipping
and sought to bring him back by using
walsh that was her motive for making
the owner of the t p outfit promise her a
picnic and now slim had hired out there
so she had a triple reason for going-to
show the foreman that she could bring
down bigger game than he was at the
same time to flaunt her triumph in front of
slim whom somehow she would contrive
to again humiliate and to tighten her hold
on walsh she might get him to marry
her-one way or another it began to
look as if her attractions were on the wane
it was up to her to make hay while her sun
still shone to marry walsh to discharge
the foreman and also slim that would
wind up matters beautifully and show her
tittering gossiping mates that la rose
still queened it over all of them

  of the three men she liked the foreman
best he was a blackguard who bullied
her but la rose craved a master even if
he were cruel

  she gripped fiercely the arm of her
clumsy but complimentary partner so that
the man looked at her in surprise

  whats eatin you he asked yore
eyes look like a pizen snakes

  she forced them to become languishing
but she had not fooled the man he
dropped her for the rest of the evening
after he had bought a round when the
dance ended

  i wonder who shes gunnin for he
asked himself these
gals are all hell for ex-
citement me im not
mixin in

  la rose watched the
door the foreman of
the t p had promised
her he would be there
she knew of no reason
why he should stay away
just because walsh had
come to town she had
meant him to see her dancing with walsh
but now she would try and work up a
quarrel between him and the stranger who
had rebuffed her so firmly the fore-

man would not know that the other had
been hired after he had quarreled with
him he would keep him out of his job-if
he still wanted one worse than he did the
doctor or the undertaker there were
notches on the handle of the foremans
gun

  but h edid not appear she did not
want to ask walsh about him and walsh
was taken up by his game even la rose
dared not invade the gambling room but
she looked in and saw that slim was not
there that he had left the cactus-and
charged that against his score three men
had failed her in one evening her spite
was the more bitter for being restrained
women like la rose craved hectic emo-
tions it helped them to forget realities
that sometimes came to them in the early
mornings when the wind swept clean and
sharp across the sage from the mesa
charged with sweet herbs and pungent
cedar and when little children gathered
sand lilies in hot and grubby hands

  la rose flung herself into all the ex-
citement of the cactus dance-hall became
the center of it danced a mad pas seul
drank hard liquor instead of her usual
synthetic creme de menthe and two hours
after midnight burst into a fit of sobbing
as one of the girls with the eyes of a saint
and the soul of a devil-if a devil has a soul
-pushed the pianist away from his seat
played some simple chords and sang in a
childish voice an old old song

golden years ago in a mill beside the sea
there lived a little maiden who plighted
her troth to me

the mill zvheel it is silent now the maids
eyes dosed be
and all that now remaineth are the words
she sang to me

  do not forget me do not forget me
  think sometimes of me still

  and when the morning breaks and the
    throstle awakes

  remember the maid of the mill

  saccharine sentiment tawdry and tar-
nished the more for the time the place and
the singer but la rose sobbed with her
head on a table

  must have been her favorite song when
it first came out said her principal rival
i remember my mother singing it to me
when i was a kid

  a knife flashed from la roses bosom
and the rival fled that was la rose a
prey to her emotions with memories of a
wilful youth and a spirit always haunted
by the ghost of what-might-have-been
the trouble at tres pinos

ii

  slim had stretched himself out beside
pete there was sufficient bedding in the
stall to temper the hard clay beneath but
comparative softness of mattresses mat-
tered little to slim pete was company
it was better there than in the stuffy little
hotel room the breeze blew in on him
and he could see the stars beneath the
eaves of the tiled roof of the shelter

  he lay there with a bent arm for a pil-
low and thought of the girl of owl can-
yon not deliberately it started with a
renewed satisfaction at the beating he had
given the bully and then her face beauti-
ful baffling in its expression monopolized
his musing she had warned him even
though she had snubbed him and she
was the most beautiful-and the most dis-
turbing-element that had so far entered
his life he could not get rid of her

  he didnt like that and he tried without
success to dismiss her with thoughts of his
new job and speculations as to what it
would be like but he had little to base
these last upon-save the reference to his
shooting ability he had heard vaguely
of organized cattle rustling in caroca
county which might make things exciting
but these matters would not crystalize he
could not herd his fancies the girls face
again obtruded fading only before drowsi-
ness that was natural enough seeing that
he had sat up most of the night previous
and the night before that trying first to
multiply and then to hang on to his stake

  he was practically asleep when voices
aroused him his senses became instantly
alert but he did not move two men-
riders by their hats and their walk pro-
claimed vaguely silhouetted against the
out-of-doors as they entered the open shed
-glanced in where pete turned his wise
head to look at them and swung it back
indifferently to his feed slim on the
floor was indistinguishable not to be
looked for there was the click of a
matchhead against a nail the odor of to-
bacco smoke

  then came their voices low-pitched in
the next stall

  seen anything of the chief asked
one time he showed up i want to

draw some money theres a game ont

that looks good to me

  you wont git none out of the chief
ternight

  why wont i  he stayed behind to
collect for fifteen fat three-year-olds
didnt he i helped deliver em didnt i
i got something cornin to me aint i
the speaker was truculent partly drunk
the other expostulated with him

  we got to git- back to the ranch
hawsses are tired an we got to ride some
to git back by breakfast

  aw to hell with the ranch an break-
fast too why dont the chief pull
somethin worth while stead of pickin off
these picayune bunches theres money
cornin to me and i want it

  and spile the whole layout wouldnt
be healthy for you if you did that folks
see you blowin money round like you was
a millionaire stead of a ranch hand an
theyll begin talkin

  let em talk ill tell the chief straight

out the way i feel about it-

  tell me what

  a third man had come into the shed and
stood at the end of the stall where slim
lay wondering what rancher was going
to miss fifteen steers in the morning the
newcomers voice was harsh and threaten-
ing

  if you boys cant keep yore tongues
from clackin well have to have em tended
to he threatened roughly

  there aint no one round here de-
fended the grumbler a bit lamely

  thats got nothin to do with it you
know the rulesu f youve got any kick
cornin-an you aint-you put it up to
the council theres big things movin
and we dont aim to have them spiled by
any loose-jawed punchers you boys git
yore hawsses an well light for home
ive been busy figgerin how to put dincro
in yore pockets while you been lappin up
booze come on

  slim could dimly see the horse the last
comer had ridden standing ground-
anchored in the corral the two others
silenced brought their mounts out of stalls
at the far end of the shed the chief
	short stories

remained at the head of slims improvised
bedchamber and slim took no chances on
shifting in the rustling straw

  that the fifteen steers had been stolen
he held no doubt also none that any sug-
gestion of an eavesdropper would call for
shooting first and investigation afterward
though the voice of the chief seemed
vaguely familiar he could not place it he
had heard many new voices the past couple
of days and nights the matter was none
of his immediate business rustlers he
had no use for as a matter of his profes-
sion but he had his moments of discretion
and all the cowboys inherent dislike of
horning in-for all his swift championing
of the girl in owl canyon that was
quite a different affair from this he had
no proof against these men save casual
talk or talk that could easily appear cas-
ual even if he had been employed to look
out for cattle thieves

  the two others came up leading their
already saddled mounts left in the corral
while their owners liquored up as many
others had done all three mounted with
the despatch of long custom and were off
stirring up the soft dirt of the corral into
a cloud that mantled itself about them as
slim slid out of his stall for a closer look

  if pete had been saddled he might have
followed them not figuring on needing
the bay before morning he had taken his
saddle into the office of the stable as it
was they were outbound for the ranch
and as he told himself it was not he who
had lost the fifteen steers the night was
chilly he had not noticed it so much in
the stall with pete as an impromptu stove
but he did now and decided that the hotel
bed with its blankets was the better place
for the sleep he still sorely needed

riendships between men are
more rapidly more frequently and
more firmly formed than between
women in these comradeships of men
their instincts are as surely to be trusted
as those of women under other circum-
stances unless a woman comes between
-and not always then-such sudden affili-
ations are apt to knit into bonds that last
a lifetime untouched by jealousies the
habit and the certitude of choice date back
to primitive days when it was essential to
quickly distinguish between friend and foe

   particularly is this true in frontier life
when there are no conventions no inter-
weaving of business diplomacies or social
obligations a mans judgment of his fel-
low is unwarped even as it is sharpened

by the lack of other credentials and tem-
pered by indifference as to references or
past records

  for a while as slim and walsh rode
out toward tres pinos together the latter
was uncommunicative he had not been
able to eat breakfast and he confided to his
new rider that he had a splitting headache

  i wish youd taken an advance from me
last night he said id be that much
ahead of those sharps that trimmed me last
night either my lucks no better than
yours at cards or we both play the same
game-which aint as good as theirs is

  lil of both i reckon slim assented

  the fresh air of early morning and the
action of the ride gradually alleviated
walshs day-after symptoms his eyes
were still muddy and he had recourse to
a hair of the dog that had bitten him but
he grew more cheerful and communicative
the two took a mutual liking to each other
walsh had a whimsical way of self de-
preciation that was alluring and slim
liked his face for all that its markings told
of weakness and indulgence there were
one or two lines that suggested bitterness
and he wondered at these now and then
a fleeting look of hardness passed over the
features of the owner of tres pinos as
if he had unpleasant thoughts but slim
decided that the man was his own worst
enemy with plenty of good qualities that
might have been better developed under
different circumstances his follies had
not made him less amiable and there was a
distinct charm about him-as there was
about slims own straightforwardness and
buoyancy of perfect physique

  hope youll like it at tres pinos said
walsh well do what we can to make
you they say we set the best table in
the county got a chink cook but my
sister runs the commissary and shes a
wonder his face clouded

  ive made a full-sized ass of myself
he went on ruefully you know the
blonde i was with-reckon you danced
with her she sure can lift a light and
lively hoof and she can wheedle a man out
of his back teeth especially if there was
any gold in em i dont know as i ought
to say that la rose is square enough
i reckon and shes got to make her living

  she wants to get out of the game shes
in asked me would i help her and of
course i said yes fair enough but i
promised ill get up some sort of a picnic
for her out to the ranch that was easy
enough last night but well theres nothing
of the snob about my sister belle but she
the trouble at tres pinos



draws her lines an i reckon a gal that
dances at the cactus is outside of em on
top of that la rosell hold me to that
promise if i dont set the day shes
liable to show up with a crowd of her

friends she
say anything
about it to
you 

  slims  eyes
twinkled and
crinkled at the
corners as he
nodded and walsh groaned

  if belle took a notion on her own ac-
count to help her out it ud be different
but she aint strong on me goin to the
cactus at all its a fact i usually come
home broke an the worse for wear you
-you wouldnt want to invite la rose out
some sunday on yore own account you
could say she wanted to buy a hawss
mebbe we could fix things up that way
i dont reckon shed come fo my ask-
in said slim i didnt git on right well
with her last night an id sure hate to
git in wrong with yore sister right off the
jump walsh groaned

  reckon  got to draw out my own hoof
funny you didnt get along with la rose
i dont go to the cactus moren once a
month on an average an she always
seemed aprime favorite with all the boys
slim turned the talk you said some-
thin about losin stock when you hired
me he said you all been havin trou-
ble with rustlers 

  walsh turned in his saddle with his face
suddenly grown hard and stem

  reckon i was drinking moren i fig-
gered makes a man talk foolish an loose
you better forget that marvin

  i sure will said slim and kept his
wonder to himself that a man who had
been missing fat steers should want to keep
quiet about it

  well be home inside of an hour
walsh spoke up presently as at mid-
morning stopping at a willowed spring to
breathe and water the ponies they halted
amid the first slopes of the foothills toward
which they had been steadily riding ive
got a good ranch walsh went on be-
longs to belle and myself half an half
old man left it that way plenty of
water good shade lots of native grass an
open range back of it atop the mesa full
section under wire t p beef fetches
top price the old man always kept the
stock up with thoroughbred bulls and ive
done the same weve got a lot of land

under water an in alfalfa modern meth-
ods all through thats our plan were
aimin to get the right sort of hands wholl
stay through with us expect to make the
place cooperative we havent got that far
yet he added and his voice trailed off
lost its note of pride while his volatile fea-
tures dulled

  with the other silent slim finishing his
smoke pictured belle walsh idly enough
unconcerned in the matter outside of his
appetite and its satisfaction she would
be older than her brother he imagined
taffy-colored of hair with a stout and
shapeless figure a prime cook and house-
keeper but inclined to be fussy as to the
condition of mess-hall and bunkhouse
she would be generally intent upon keep-
ing the riders in their places which meant
away from the ranch-house there only
the favored foreman by right of estab-
lished unwritten law might claim the
privilege of evening entertainment and
sometimes take his meals but so long as
the grub was good that did not bother
slim and he did not mean to bother the
lady

  they entered a draw that gradually nar-
rowed to a gulch back of the mesa that
ever loomed up before them like a great
wall a dark cloud was slowly rising and
advancing against it the face of the
mesa was startlingly displayed its vivid
hues glaring under the sun in shades of
red with three great pines plain in the im-
mediate foreground as if they stood on
the very verge of the mesa cliff they
were old and their shafts towered high ire-
fore a bough branched off one was bare
of fciage lightning blasted the two oth-
ers tufted with dark but vivid green

  walsh pointed them out as they crossed
the sparkling shallow creek that suddenly
looped its way across the draw with big
trout darting broad-backed and powerful
of fin for shelter from the invading hoofs

  tres pinos he said pride once again
in his tones they named the place for
it before my dads time folks claim
theyre three hundred years old thats
what the indians say great landmarks
look prime against that cloud dont they
that looks like a cloudburst but we ought
to beat it home youll hear this crick
singin when it breaks

  by thunder thats belle now seen
us cornin

  slim saw a rider on a pinto horse and
the rider seemed slim as a boy in the
garish light the racing object stood out
theatrically half enveloped in the cloud of
short stories

dust it raised and which trailed away be-
hind holding a vivid color of its own as
the reaching cloud obscured half the heav-
ens and the sun overhead illumined the
other half

  slim chuckled to himself at his precon-
ceived notion of walshs sister no stout
taffy-haired woman of middle age would
have ridden the mustang like a whirlwind
the ponys glossy hide gleamed silver and
copper there was a fleck of brilliant
orange color at the girls neck flaring long
before there was any chance of distinguish-
ing features yet there came over slim a
curious feeling the premonition he de-
fined as a hunch developing into certainty
as the oncoming rider catapulting down
that narrow trail tossed up an arm in
greeting while walsh shouted a welcome
genuine affection between these two slim
told himself and suddenly felt an out-
sider unattached and lonely

  here was the girl he had rescued from
the bully he had considered that she had
been both rude and ungrateful despite
the visions of the night he had ordered
himself to forget her and now his heart
pumped furiously so that he could feel the
hot blood tingling to his finger-tips and
stealing beneath the skin of his tanned face
flooding his brain a little until he felt con-
fused and a little giddy no girl had ever
made him feel that way before he re-
sented it he was a little frightened at it
somewhere inside of him just as a wild
horse shudders at the touch of a human
hand fearful of loss of liberty

  but she was a beauty that smote him
again fairly between the eyes as the stone
from davids sling smote goliath she
wore no hat but her black hair was sleeked
around her shapely head like a helmet of
shining leather her breath came swiftly
with the speed and excitement of the ride
and her eyes shone they were violet to-
day rather than gray the silken necker-
chief the color of burned orange the only
high note in her dress heightened the hue
of them complemented the golden trans-
parency of her sunkissed skin flushed with
healthy rose brought up the carmine of
her lips

  a gypsy girl a disturber of mens hap-
piness surely rather than a caterer to
their comforts her brother had called
her a wonder and only that word described
her slim told himself somewhere out of
the past came a song he had heard a mexi-
can singing in a jacal to the twang of a
guitar slim hadnt noticed the words much
but they had stuck and now they leaped

out of his brain to fit the girl before
him

  eyes like stars that shine so bright
  in the azure depths of night

  voice that thrills like song of lark
  breath as sweet as breeze that blows
  oer the jasmine and the rose
  twixt the twilight and the dark

  it was the first time that slim had ever
been deliberately and personally senti-
mental something had happened to him
this slip of a girl glancing at him as if she
had never seen him before as if she did
not care if she never saw him again while
he- inwardly he fumed with a com-
plexity of feelings and felt himself
somehow bound

  slim marvin is goin to ride for us
said walsh hes the kind we want
goin to start in bustin colts up to you
to keep him contented sis

  the girls eyebrows went up slightly as
if she were surprised at her brothers en-
thusiastic endorsement of an untried em-
ploye she gave slim a cool little nod-

like a queen might hand out to a beggar
he fancied

  a good hands always welcome at tres
pinos she said with irritating emphasis
i think i saw mr garvin tuesday in owl
canyon he must have been on his way
to caroca

  the names marvin miss said slim
not garvin there was anger back of
his quick flush but he followed her lead
she might fear that he would take ad-
vantage of the affair at all events she
showed plainly she did not want it re-
ferred to but i dont remember meetin
you all he drawled seems like i
should have

  that got him a gleam from her eyes-
direct he could not decide if it meant
surprise anger a certain admiration or
more positive amusement she was baf-
fling and he was vexed at wanting to solve
the riddle of her girls had always repre-
sented unknown quantities to him so far
and he had been content to let it go at that
this one puzzled him and at the same time
the trouble at tres pinos

challenged him it was annoying to feel
this way funny too that this girl and the
one he had met just before la rose
should both show dislike of him any-
way he had assured her he was not going
to say anything about what had happened
in owl canyon

  he dropped back letting brother and
sister ride together he could see that
they soon got into talk that hinged on seri-
ous matters the girl relating indignantly
something that had happened the maij an-
gry receiving it wrath fully then slumping
suddenly with a shrug of his shoulders
while the girl flared up and rode ahead in
a flash of anger she pricked her pinto to
a lope that took them to the narrow trail
that wound up the right hand cliff to the
tench above

  she could hardly have told her brother
of the owl canyon episode after practi-
cally denying it before slim still she
might have eliminated slim from her ver-
sion it was single trail now and when
the men reached the bench the girl had
vanished into a grove of cottonwoods that
screened off the main portion of the t p
buildings slim came up beside walsh
who rode on in gloomy self communion
and they loped in silence by fields of em-
erald alfalfa growing vigorously under
irrigation the whole ranch bore signs
of careful planning though there were
hints here and there of carelessness-tools
left out a broken lateral gate a windmill
that squeaked

  though walshs face was somber his
brows were creased and his mouth and jaw
firmer than slim had so far seen them
he ventured a remark

  likely stand second crop i reckon

  yep walsh shook off his depression
alfalfa does fine belles goin in with
the car to caroca after dinner nothin
you left behind 

  my hawss is packin all i own cept my
second string pony left him in the next
county ill send fo him sometime or my
friendll ship him oveh

  the big cloud was perilously close to the
sun ominous the three pines were still
in vivid light the middle one showing al-
most white blasted and barked by a light-
ning flash that had spared or only seared
the other two it looked not unlike a great
gallows slim thought the fancy height-
ened by the presence of a buzzard on the
outstanding horizontal limb

  they trotted down a narow lane between
two corrals while the sky began to darken
more and more and things became strange-



ly silent like the world under an eclipse
the advancing cloud was dense enough to
blot out any sun

   bellell lay off that trjp i reckon said
walsh as they emerged in full sight of the
long low ranch-house verandaed fresh
painted a big stone chimney at one end
curtains and window boxes giving evident
signs of a womans competent direction
these were enhanced by the comfortable
wicker chairs in orderly array on the porch
and the unusual flower garden within a
whitewashed picket fence where old-fash-
ioned flowers stood their vivid blossoms
strangely flat in the light that had lost all
shadow as the fringe of the cloud reached
out and veiled the sun

  a man came out from a small shack that
had a sign on it-office-advancing
toward them to suddenly stop and stare at
slim who gazed back with his face as
hard as granite his body easy in the sad-
dle suddenly alert hand falling back in-
stinctively toward his gun butt

  for a moment the mans bruised face
was devilish then it twisted into shape the
eyes still smouldering malevolently though
the mouth with its cut lip formed into

what was
meant for a
grin as walsh
called out
hello sled
heres slim
marvin used
to be with t-
in-a-box over in the next county goin
to break those colts for a start hes on
the payroll slim this is sled raynor
foreman

  slims watchful eyes were glinting like
mica flakes in granite but raynor only
nodded at him with rough acknowledg-
ment that was outwardly friendly

  we sure need a good buster he said
glad to meet you marvin grubll be
ready soon some of the boys in two
of them ridin wire an the rest on cavvy
theyll bring in those colts kind of wor-
ried id have to break em myself youll
find a couple spare bunks in the bunkhouse
take either of em make yoresef at
home chows in the leanto back of the
house

  slim was plainly dismissed-with anoth-
er puzzle it began to look as if belle
walsh and sled raynor had mutually
agreed to say nothing of what had hap-
pened why she did not seem the sort
to permit insult

  what about this fifteen head sled lie


short stories

heard walsh demanding as he rode toward
the bunkhouse belle tells me they were
run off last night its plumb funny i lose
attle whenever i go to town plumb fun-
ny they always happen to be three-year-
lds slim caught the reply assured al-
most insolent

  aint it thets jest how it did hap-
pen

  no one ridin herd look here sled
- walshs voice thickly passionate
stopped his sister was coming down the
path between the tall larkspurs she had
changed into a gingham gown and a hat
that fitted snugly pulling on gloves as
she came

  im going to eat in town joe she said
her voice cool you and sled can talk
things over by yourselves

  raynor had pulled off his hat but the
girl paid no attention to him beyond the
reference in her speech she must have
caught the note of quick rage in her broth-
ers halted speech she passed so close to
raynor that she almost brushed him but
he might well have been the gate post
and his swarthy face turned almost purple
with the bruises black upon it at the slight

  there was thunder in the air storm
about to break loose but slim fancied that
all the tenseness did not come entirely from
the atmospheric conditions

  you cant go in now sis thet clouds
goin to break inside of a few minutes
youll never make the crick till it goes
down

  ill go round by the big bridge she
said coldly ive got my slicker in the
car and im eating in town raynors
been eating in the bunkhouse she added
pointedly as she left the two gazing after
her it seemed to slim that she was skirt-
ing deliberately on the edge of some dan-
gerous topic as if she dared raynor to tell
why he had eaten in the bunkhouse while
walsh was absent yet she had clearly
avoided it before

  and the fifteen rustled steers the
three men in the corral shed the one
they had called chief there had been a
moment last night when he had wondered
if sled raynors had been the voice he had
thought he recognized but it was not
the girl turned-called back

  theres a message on your desk joe
i found it skewered to the front door this
morning i kept the knife that fastened
it

  there was challenge in that it was
likely she did not expect slim to hear it
though he was not sure about that but

his ears were good walsh swung from
his saddle calling out for someone to
come and fake his horse as he strode up
the path to the veranda raynor following
a cowboy with a face the color and tex-
ture of a walnut bow-legged from the
saddle came hurrying to the horse the
girl had disappeared

  slim unsaddled pete hurriedly turned
him into a corral toting his saddle and
warbag for the refuge of the bunkhouse
the storm was on them

  he heard a flivver engine starting furi-
ously as it was given gas then the sound
was lost as a javelin of lightning rived the
great curtain that was sweeping out to the
plain and thunder pealed and crashed and
pealed again heralding the tremendous
downpour of the rain hissing as it struck
the ground the trees swayed rivulets
started here and there confluent hurrying
to the creek that would become a raging
torrent in the next few minutes

  in the midst of it racing with the storm
was the girl who had found the knife-
skewered message on the door

  the interior of the bunkhouse was as
dark as if it had been night and it was
empty a flare of lightning showed it-
stove and table bunks and benches a few
chairs odds and ends of personal belong-
ings about slim dropped his heavy sad-
dle to the floor

  there was trouble at tres pinos-that
was very evident-and slim marvin had
a surefire hunch that he was destined to
take a hand in that trouble

the girl and her brother sat together
in the big living-room before a fire
where pine burned briskly for the
nights on the mesa bench were cold the
ranch boasted an electric plant for pump-
ing and lights and the electricity was veiled
by tasteful shades of parchment the
quiet refinement of the room again evi-
denced the taste of belle walsh

  there was no one else present ray-
nors privilege had seemingly been with-
drawn or he had not chosen to exercise it

the faces of
brother and sis-
ter were grave
the girl held a
paper in her
hand a square
of wrapping pa-
per on which
were roughly scrawled a few words in
printed letters

  the paper showed a slit near its top

  recefltfok f

 -the imettawk
the trouble

she fingered a cheap hunting knife the
blade worn and the vulcanite handle
scarred

  how much longer are we going to stand
for this sort of thing joe she asked
the whole county scared by a mob that
steals cattle and calls itself the night
hawks they say in town no one knows
who belongs to it or who doesnt and
they are all afraid to talk about it

  raynor had no night herd out claims
he thought they were safe in the lower end
of the gulch not half a mile from the line
fence and this the third bunch weve lost
this year three thousand dollars wont
cover the loss what are you going to do
about it fire raynor-or are you afraid
of him

  she flashed the final query passionately
her brother covered his face with his hand
as if to protect it from the fire

  i cant fire him belle he said wearily
ive got my reasons but im not afraid
of him if that is what you mean id like
the chance to kill him he added with a
spurt of energy the girl looked at him
sadly then her face brightened with re-
solve

  your new hand thrashed him on tues-
day she said quietly he told you his
horse jumped at a rattler in the road and
fell over the cliff thats what he told the
rest of the boys and marvin hasnt said
anything to the contrary so far

  what slim beat him up you saw
it how did it happen

  raynor was trying to make love to me
marvin thought i didnt want him to he
saw me fighting with raynor and he inter-
fered

  sled making love to you the yellow
coyote walsh was not wearing a gun
but his hand made an instinctive gesture as
he sprang up his face flaming he start-
ed to stride toward the door while his sis-
ter watched him curiously he stopped
turned flinging up his arms in an impotent
motion

  sit down joe she said tell me
about it ive got a right to know ray-
nors got something on you he almost
said as much when he swore id marry him
before he was through-and be glad to
her voice carried a contempt she seemed
unable to curb entirely what is it joe

  walsh hesitated standing by the fire
forearm on the mantel head on it kicking
at a log

  i heard some things in town today
joe thats why i wanted to go why i
wouldnt wait ill tell you about them

  cio

at tres pinos	

presently but tell me about raynor first
before he does

  he turned a haggard careworn face to
her

  ill tell you belle ive hoped there
was some way out there isnt any but
hell not marry you hell not lay his
dirty fingers on you again the mangy
breed

  breed 

  his grandmother was mexican-or in-
dian hes got me in a cleft stick belle
hes been bleeding me but i didnt dream
hed touch you-except as you lost with the
steers

  you think hes mixed up in their being
rustled ive suspected that that ties
him up with the night hawks

  mebbe theres people use that name
for a mask hes hinted at it-at the
power back of him hinted i should join
-that id have to its been raisin hell

with me belle i-

  go on joe well work it out

  we cant unless-but that would leave
you in the mess ive gone over and over
it his fists clenched opened he looked
like a young man suddenly stricken grown
old

  we can joe and we will even if-
we have to go away from here

  she spoke with an effort her brothers
face lighted dulled again

  ill go with you anywhere joe she
said he flashed her a look of gratitude
of love but his features were pinched he
nerved himself to an effort

  you cant go far on the road i may
have to travel sis it may lead to the
penitentiary it may- they hang for
murder in this state he ended abruptly

  murder her face blanched her
chin quivered as she caught up her under-
lip with her teeth in characteristic gestiue
you i dont believe it and her chin
grew firm as her eyes flashed

  it was this way belle i dont know
so much about it after all he went on
hurriedly like a man resolved to a con-
fession and anxious to get through with it
i had been drinking of course  was
drunk it was after the spring roundup
-not that thats any excuse we kept it
up late and raynor said there was a fan-
dango on at a place just outside the town
said he could take me if i wanted to risk
it but hed not take any more because the
mexicans were not over fond of us ming-
ling in with their rackets and i could talk
spanish of course he speaks it like a
native
short stories



  they did resent it though the dance
went on there was one chap who pre-
tended to take offense because i threw a
gold piece at the girl who danced its
the custom of course but the gold drew
attention he said a lot of things in span-
ish raynor told me to swallow them but
the state i was in-wed been drinking that
rotten pisco its like fire in you gets into
your brain-i said something back

  sometimes i think it was all planned
im almost sure there was dope in my last
drink i cant remember the rest of it
i know the mexican drew a knife i can
almost swear to that though raynor says
he didnt i can remember a shot-
walsh spoke with frowning brows striv-
ing to conjure something definite out of a
hazy memory after that-i dont know

  i was outside struggling with raynor
who was trying to get me into the saddle
he said i had shot the man and killed him
that my bullet went through his head be-
tween the eyes-god

  the door of the cantina opened and a
mob came out howling we were in the
saddle riding like devils with a pack after
us we got clear up to the old adobe on
the spanish grant and wed lost them
the ride had sobered me-with the thought
of what id done still i couldnt remem-
ber drawing my gun or pulling trigger-
till i looked at it raynor had it took
it away from me after the shotting one
shell had been fired-only one but that
was enough it had killed a man

  he rested his head on his crossed arms
on the mantel now and his shoulders
heaved the girl went over to him and
slid her arm about him coaxing him back
to his chair sitting on the arm of it pre-
sently he spoke again in a flat hopeless
voice

  raynor seemed decent about it he
said he could fix it that the man was
wanted anyway for smuggling if not
worse and he did hush it up i couldnt
tell you i had to get the money you
kept our books so-that first bunch of
steers we lost-i stole my own cattle belle
our cattle god help me

  since then raynor has used his hold
over me he may belong to the night

hawk gang or he may have used that for
a cover but hes taken our steers connived
at it and he laughs in his sleeve at me
hes threatened covertly hes even sug-
gested partnership and now-hes dared to

think of you ill-

  she clung to him soothing him telling
him she didnt believe that he had commit-
ted a crime that it would all come to light

   hes got it all written down witnessed
left with someone wholl use it if anything
happens to him my hands are tied if
i killed him it would all come out just the
same youd be disgraced belle ive
drunk to forget it ive shown the yellow
streak ill never touch another drop an-
other card i swear it but whats the
good of that

  leave it to me joe well find a way
well get at the truth you didnt kill
anyone if you were drunk drugged
someone else could have used your gun or
they could have used their own and then
fired a shell from yours to make you think
you did it

  he looked at her with the face of a
drowning man who has grasped a plank
out of the smother and then he found it
only a straw sinking into despondency

but the girl was fired with resolution
she communicated some of it to him
well wait joe i can handle raynor
youll not encourage that snake i
wont stand for it

  leave that to me joe were fighting
for your life for our happiness trust a
womans weapons raynor wants this
ranch he wants--me hell not force
the issue when it means losing everything
he may be bluffing he cant bluff us
joe well not lose out on a bluff

  for a time he sat silent then he got
up

  youre the better man of the two
belle im glad ive told you ill do
what you say

   she kissed him clung to him for a little
what did you hear in town he asked
it was wing that started it joe i
dont think its just curiosity on his part
but there is little goes on that that china-
man doesnt know about-more than one
suspects and wing has been devoted to
the trouble at tres pinos

me ever since i nursed him through pneu-
monia last winter i really saved his life
that night he was delirious he had stood
it up to the last minute of endurance and
he would have crept away to his bunk in
the cookhouse and said nothing even if he
had died if his delirium hadnt sent him
out in the snow where i saw him from my
window

  people call chinese eyes inscrutable
but ive seen a lot in his he came to me
yesterday after you had left it cost him
something he was terribly afraid all the
time we were talking-not long you
know how he talks in his pidgin english
lmissy something not all right along of
you along mister joe i sabe you take
laundry in town tomorrow you take
jplong hop lee-he my cousin he be-
long along same society you tell him
iwing send you maybe he tell you some-
thing

  of course the laundry was just an ex-
cuse but it was a good one i saw hop
lee he had been expecting me and
he was frightened too afraid of the
night hawks i suppose

  you sabe raynor foreman your place
he said you sabe him no good plenty

bad no good
along your
place no good
along your
brother i
heap sabe no
can speak too
much china-
m a n get in
plenty trouble too much easy you very
good along wing that all same good
along me sabe bimeby maybe you
get in heap trouble i talk along some more
not now

  and that was all i could get out of him
he talked laundry and nothing else ev-
erything was no sabe and his face was
just a mask but his eyes were kind
joe

  i dont see where that helps us much

  neither do i not now but they
were both afraid and they went out of
their way to say something to cheer me
up they dont take risks for nothing
they dont talk for nothing

  that wasnt all i heard i had a long
confidential talk with mrs jaynes you
know that mr jaynes and she lived in
mexico city and that he has always been
close to president diaz well theres
trouble in the air nearly always is
porfirio diaz rules with a heavy hand and



it is easy for any glib talker and fighter to
stir up the peons into a revolution

  theres one on foot now and diaz is
letting it grow so that he can get all those
who are against him in the ranks of the
discontents and then crush them with one
blow his spies know all that is going on
mrs jaynes likes both of us and i think
she guesses that things are not over good
with us in a financial way a mexican
federal agent has seen mr jaynes in re-
gard to negotiations about ammunition and
the possible purchase of a gunboat from
our government and-this is where we
come in-the federal troops are on the way
to the border theyll make headquarters
almost across the river from caroca pre-
liminary to swooping down on the rebels
theyll need beef jaynes will recom-
mend you theyll pay top prices for old
cows and theyll pay cash

  joe if we could do that get raynor
out of the way somewhere sell off the
stock 

  go away run away and leave tres
pinos

  she nodded her lips firm pressed yet a
little tremulous

 no im not going to run away
youve stiffened me sis i dont think i
killed that man well stick by god
well stick ive told you and that helps
a heap but well sell that beef too
well have money to fight with raynor
stealing those steers with what he might
do has had me nearly crazy like taking
it from you you know how slim the bank
account is and a note coming due ive
been gambling like a fool to try and make
it up

  weve got to do more than get raynor
out of the way i can do that by sending
him with a shipment on the reservation
contract i meant to go myself afraid to
trust him with the steers or the money
but most of the hands are his choosing
hes made it rotten for the good ones who
wouldnt stand for his methods weeded
em out and i had to accept his reasons
you wondered why i let em go

  that was your end of it joe

  there are a few i can trust it might
be managed that new chap marvin
you dont seem to like him belle seemed
to me you were pretty cool the way hed
acted funny sled stood for him the way
he did

  sled raynor wont want him to say
anything about what happened at owl
canyon it would make his men jeer at
him or lose confidence in him anyway


short stories

hell ask marvin to say nothing and i
didnt know that i was going to tell you
joe but i had to to make you tell me-
everything so i-discouraged him

  ill say you did think hell keep
quiet 

  she nodded her face away from her
brother

  mighty fine chap hell do to take
along it aint fair to snub him because
he did you a favor

  there was a curious little smile on the
girls lips before she replied there was
a minute when i wanted him to kill ray-
nor joe but he beat him to the draw and
he took his gun away and handed it to me
then he fought him bare-handed hed
make a good prizefighter i think i was
afraid his interference would work wrong
with raynor hed been hinting things to
me too they nerved me to talk to you
tonight but he only sulked  suppose
he was thinking up excuses for the boys
it was a wonderful fight joe marvin
can take care of himself

  by jings i believe you do like him
after all belle

  the firelight flushed her face perhaps 
something else

  you ought to make it up to him some
way belle him and me are goin to be
pals you oughtnt to have snubbed him
you need a pal joe a man pal be-
sides me and-if i snubbed him the
smile was again on her lips it was only
for his own good

  ill be jinged said her brother you
women are beyond me

  im going to find the right one to travel
along with you some day joe

  not much not while ive got you
dont you go thinkin of gittin married
me she laughed and left him tak-
ing up the night hawks receipt throwing
it into the fire he did not notice that she
had not replied to his remark

  that wasnt quite all  heard today
joe they are talking of getting up a
crowd of the owners those who have had
cattle stolen to clean out the night hawks
the cattlemens association will finance

it pay a big re-
ward

 they wont
ask me if they
guess how my
steers went he
said grimly i
cant join em the
way things stand

  you cant refuse them joe but thatll

work out its late im going to bed
good night joe

  after she had gone walsh sat late by the
fire his thoughts were bitter ones but
they strengthened his face it was mould-
ed into resolve when at last he followed her
example

colt was purely a technical name
for an unbroken horse as applied
to the roan that stood stiff-legged
and flat-eared in protest against the rope
that held and choked it while slim reached
carefully for the loose end of his single-
fire cinch beneath the brutes belly

  the roan was all of four years old a
wise rangy looking beast of hammer head
that was half concealed by the blindfold
it was sick with rage since the moment it
had been driven with the rest of the cavvy
into the corral then segregated with others
that had managed so far to hold the free-
dom of the range it was afraid-afraid
of the man smell and the man noise the
whirling rope and tightening noose and it
had fought valiantly for all its fear it was
far from spent yet though it had only
quivered when slim gingerly set the sad-
dle on its back one helper held the rope
high heels dug into the soft dirt of the cor-
ral two others had helped adjust the
bridle and the heavy bit the roans head
was high too high to be handled he had
suddenly tossed it up from the clutch o
the helpers and they waited their chance ta
get another hold

  the horse had shown all signs of being
a twister and they left the rope on him un-
til the last moment after the saddle was
cinched slim had not expected to break
horses and his single cinch was not what
he would have chosen for the job but it
would do rather than borrow another sad-
dle the roan had quivered when first
blanket and then leather had been placed
upon his back after that and the up-
swing of his head on a neck of steel lie
stood taut lips drawn back nostrils wide
to show their crimson lining he was
game and he meant to put up the fight of
his life against the servitude of the sad-
dle slim had picked the horse as the
hardest job of the bunch in hand meaning
to tackle it while he was freshest

  the helpers were plainly anxious of
their own minor risks in the performance
they had been turned over to him by ray-
nor still surface friendly but not trusted
by slim belle walsh had been right
raynor had taken him aside the night be-
fore after supper while she and her broth-
the trouble at tres pinos



er talked together in the ranch-house and
suggested that byegones should be bye-
gones

  i reckon id have acted the same way
if i was in yore place the foreman said
course you dont know all the circum-
stances youre sure quick on the draw
an handy with yore fists but-ill put it to
you square an fair we need a good hand
here an if you stay you can easy see it
wouldnt do me no good with the boys be-
in foreman to have a yarn like that passed
round you got all the best of it how
erbout callin it quits

  suits me said slim and it did since
he had determined to remain and watch the
trouble that was brewing at tres pinos
raynors plea was specious he had un-
doubtedly accounted for his bruises an-
other way the best way to get out of it
was to make a pact with the new rider or
slim might destroy much of the bullys
prestige

  walsh does some of the hirin ray-
nor continued but i do the firin if you
like the job its all hunky with me fo you

to stay

  lies like the clock ticks slim told
himself hes jest about as fair minded
as a sheddin rattler if he ever gits a
good chance to put me away hell tackle it
or git one of his hands to try to

  the men ropers and riders and the rest
were he shrewdly suspected most of them
on the ranch because of their sympathies
with raynor it is not always as easy to
tell strains of mixed blood as one might
imagine even by a range rider where all
faces are burned dark by sun and wind
and rain but where indian blood is
strong the eyes are telltales and it was
such a sign that made slim suspicious that
half a dozen at least of the hands had an
admixture of blood that came from the
south side of the rio grande raynor
amongst them there were plenty of
good mexicans plenty of good indians it
was the mixture of yaqui and peon and de-
generate white man a mixture that never
blended and in which vice like crude oil
was apt to be always on the surface that
slim marvin with others of his kind had
scant use for

  but he said nothing even when he be-
gan to believe that raynor had not tried
to give him the best men for helpers in
the breaking corral walsh did not ap-
pear but it seemed as if general opera-
tions had been suspended to watch the new
hand tackle his dangerous job no buster
lasts long broken limbs are the least of
his troubles a broken neck may finish
him but rupture is sure to claim him he
may have to sit a horse until the blood
comes out of nose and ears and mouth
there is always the chance of a leg smashed
against the corral fence by a maddened
horse ribs crushed by a rearing fall a
chest perforated by the steel core of the
saddle tree and horn on the range bust-
ing holds the fascination of a bullfight and
usually the work is done by a traveling pro-
fessional for high wages

  it looked as if every man on the t p
except the boss was perched on the top
rail aside from the helpers raynor sat
astride a chute gate the chinese cook
peered through the bars the tall and
taciturn englishman who seemed to at-
tend to all the machinery on the ranch
squatted with his grasshopper legs and
brick-red face atop a hinge pole of the
main gate humped up smoking a briar
pipe

  interest was usual enough and this at-
tendance might be flattery it might be
lax discipline on the part of raynor it
might be a special custom-or it might be
something else that raynor hoped for
a spill slim was certain there had been
few friendly overtures made to the new
hand in the bunkhouse overnight the
silent britishers attitude had been after
all the most cordial

  slim felt the general wish the almost
universal hope that the roan might worst
him but these hostile statics only made
his lean face a little grim and his eyes
hard and frosty he was quite sure of his
ability to ride the horse-given fair play

  he caught the swinging cinch with its
steel ring threaded through the latigo strap
and drew it taut while the roan grunted
and instinctively blew out against the pres-
sure

  git hold of his head slim snapped


short stories

his drawl gone in action git that rope
off him stan ready to take off that
blindfold-an dont take it off till i give
the word

  the helpers got grip on the bridle at
cheek straps while slim set his knee against
the roan watching for the first jump
hauling on the latigo gaining inch by inch
making his turns still the roan stood
with only the restless nostrils the slightly
twitching ears and flanks that shivered
once in a while to show that it had any
idea of what was going on

  slim gathered reins and mane into his
left hand close to the withers facing the
saddle he swung a stirrup toward his
toot but set only enough heft upon it to
hold place while his right hand stole up to
the horn

  the roan would break out into an equine
tornado the moment that blindfold and
cheek grips were released he knew he
had to get into the saddle at lightning
speed or counteract a whirl by drawing
himself flat to the withers until the jump
was ended and then fling leg over cantle
he put a little weight on the stirrup the
saddle creaked slightly as the roan leaned
away and his weight came on the horn
slowly the roans back was arching like a
cats the rope was off

 now

  the helpers sprang bck raced for the
rails one with the blindfold slim and
the roan fought the first round in a whirl-
ing pillar of dust out of which they
emerged with the roan sunfishing like a
rodeo untameable shifting to wild bucking
round the corral

  there was no shouted slogan of ride
him cowboy no words of either en-
couragement or even excitement though
the struggle was dramatic enough-while
it lasted the end came swiftly the
roan threw itself and slim took saddle
again as it sprang up foam flying from
its bitted jaws its hide streaked with sweat
eyes wild rearing starting a series of pro-
digious leaps

  at the third of these the cinch broke
and man and saddle went flying through
the air to land with a dull smash while the
roan went careering triumphant at having
rid itself of the burden it feared would
master it a rope sang and the roan was
checked snubbed to a post flung to the
dirt

  two or three men raynor among them
advanced slowly to where slim lay with
the dust settling down about him his
head was tucked in like a turtles and for

a moment or two he was motionless he
sensed the silence his brain working fast
to a conclusion of foul play

  the cinch was nearly new of good 
manufacture a woven web that ended in
the stout leather through which the ring
was reeved the latigo strap was of
sound hide pliable well-oiled he had
inspected the saddle the night before to
offset the lack of hospitality in the bunk-
house now he fancied he had better have
left the inspection until that morning

   instinctively out of long experience he
had fallen on his shoulders and while the
breath was jolted out of him there was
no other damage done he retrieved his
gun which had flown from the holster
went over to the saddle and carefully
looked at it

  hurt any  asked raynor and to slim
his voice held disappointment

  slim did not answer him he was look-
ing at the latigo the break-if it were a
break-was curious it was diagonal and
while such a thing -was barely possible
from a badly cured hide it looked more
like a cut than a tear of fibers except for
the last inch of it to slim someone with
a thin blade had sliced slantingly into the
leather with careful if diabolical skill cut-
ting on a long slant two thirds of the way
through and then pasting or gluing it to-
gether working in a little dirt and grease
to hide the damage

   on a direct pull it might have lasted for
hours with a ramping twisting devil
like the roan it was a certainty that it
would break within a few minutes as it
had within a few inches of where the strap
went under and through the latigo
ring

  slim exhibited it since his rage did
not call for immediate action without a
real target his southern drawl was pro-
nounced

  there was nothin wrong with that lat-
igo lahst night he said i overhauled
it mysef

  raynor stepped out truculently backed
by the presence of his men

   you sayin one of this outfit did that
he demanded

  his hand hovered above his gun butt
but did not descend slim was eyeing him
with a look that was cynically suggestive
of past humiliation

  i didnt do it fo a fact said slim
an i suah reckon its goin to be hahd
fo me to say who did it i aint the kind
to go huntin fo trouble he drawled while
the lookers-on held their breath to listen
the trouble at tres pinos

but in case i happen to run into it i aim
to ride it sames im goin to ride thet
roan hawss soon as i fix me a new latigo
i dont believe in showin off none but
i-

  he stooped all eyes upon him and
picked up an empty tobacco tin that one
of the hands had tossed empty to the
dirt it was bright red and it made a bril-
liant streak as slim suddenly tossed it into
the air the blued steel
of his gun caught the
light before fire spurt-
ed from the muzzle
and the tin at the
height of its flight
jerked as a bullet tore
through it twice more
slim hit it in its zigzag
fall once again just
before it touched the
ground

  whats thet play fo if it aint showin
off sneered raynor

  jus to express my appreciation of a
practical joke-if cuttin thet latigo was a
joke well let it go at thet though
theres been too big an audience here this
monin to look jest right to me theres
two ways of bein popular i see a bull
fight once at juarez an the toro was the
mos popular thing in the ring he was
there to git killed ill call this a joke
unless any hombre wants to announce it
aint in which case he added and his
voice rang like the stroke of an anvil i
got two shells left in my gun

  whats the matter asked walsh
coming in through the gate that the lanky
englishman had swung opein for him
anyone hurt

  not yet said slim

  the crowd had melted away with the
exception of raynor and the englishman
tapping out his pipe on his heel

  my latigo busted said slim you
got a new strap an a riveter  thet roans
a likely hawss i wouldnt wondeh but
what there was a little eagle in him some-
wheres

  ill gk you a strap said raynor and
disappeared walsh looked uncertainly at
slim noticed the punctured tin and turned
it over with his foot before he threw it
out of the corral

  thought you might have started a
shootin scrap he said

  slim shook his head jest the oppo-
site he said and reached into his shirt
pocket for the makings walsh crossed
glances with him for a moment hesitated



and then offered a match or the quirly
slim completed with one hand he said
nothing but slim had read something in
his eyes

  shes told him he decided and
walked toward the roan now hitched to
the corral fence it snorted and tried to
wheel

  all right my son said slim i aint
goin to huht you jes make you useful
caballo you an me are goin to be
friends

  the helpers came back with raynor and
the latigo with which slim replaced the
broken strap

  ill keep this fo a souvenir he said
lets git on with the roan no need to
blindfold him this time hes part broke
already

  he finished his mornings work with-
out audience outside of the imperturbable
englishman smoking his pipe in him
slim sensed friendliness raynor left
and the helpers did their best four colts
were turned into the right road for ser-
vice before the triangle clanged for grub

  after the meal with most of the hands
absent on their various businesses the
englishman joined slim as he sat on a
bench before starting in again

  good show what said the other
my names walters marvin didnt get
a chance to talk to you last night turned
in early had to go over the car after
miss walsh brought it back quite a bit
of a job

in wonder walsh dont kick me off the
place fact is miss walsh is sorry for
me thats the sort of chap i am mar-
vin the women get sorry for me god


short stories

made them that way i went the other
way to the devil old chap

  he stalked off and slim watched him
with friendly gaze it was just as well to
have someone to depend on at the t p-
outside of walsh-and he felt that wal-
ters-if that were his own name-for all
his self depreciation had good stuff in him

there was a difference in the at-
mosphere of the bunkhouse that
night not all of it could be at-
tributed to slims display with his gun
that he calculated would be most likely
to affect the men of mixed blood but
while they treated him with a certain half
sullen respect it was a silent one after
the supper meal they foregathered with
raynor at one end of the table and started
playing monte with a pack of greasy cards
noisily enough among themselves but
there were others who nodded at slim as
they came in while one or two spoke
these it seemed were not without their
feelings of fair play toward a newcomer
who had acquitted himself well the out-
fit appeared to be split into two factions
those who blindly regarded raynor as
something more than foreman and those
who remained neutral in their regular jobs
walters the englishman mute most of the
time sat next to slim offered him a well
read magazine slim was no longer an en-
tire outsider two hands had gone to town
in the afternoon and these he had consid-
ered as raynors immediate followers

  the fifteen stolen steers still bothered
slim though he fancied he now remem-
bered the man who had been called chief
a vague memory of a voice across the
poker table where he had spilled his check
grew stronger but he still felt that ray-
nor had something to do with the deal
the steers had been placed in home pas-
ture by raynor preparatory to shipping
part of a car that was being made up he
had had the choice of place and he had
neglected to place a night herd ordinarily
not necessary within wire but with the
rumors of rustling that were about and had
even reached slims ears in the next coun-
ty it would have been a wise precaution
then there had been raynors almost in-
solent reply to walsh the foremans swag-
gering attitude generally slim kept his
ears open to the general talk while he
turned the pages of his magazine reading
automatically sometimes the page was
obscured by a phantasmal illustration
nothing at all to do with the story a pic-
ture of belle walshs face always with a

sentence whispered in the back of his iwain
-she told him about the fight after all
slim was far from a fool it was plain
enough putting things together that ray-
nor had some hold over walsh and that
explained the reluctance of the girl to have
slim interfere she knew of that hold or
suspected it he had been her champion
once and he stood charged to help her
again but not to make a mess of things
to bring matters to an untimely head by be-
ing precipitant slim decided that what
he needed now was the combination of a
cool head good ears and a quiet tongue

  he had an idea that he had another
friend outside the bunkhouse in wing the
presiding genius of the mess-hall more
than once he had noticed the genial china-
man regarding him with eyes that were
distinctly approving the cook might ap-
preciate the scene in the corral but slini
did not analyze the reason for the friend-
ship it might never come to more than
an extra slice of apple pie perhaps one for
pete an inveterate equine lover of sweets
nevertheless it seemed worth having

  there was some jesting with the fore-
man that struck slim as not altogether
void of sarcasm though it might be ordi-
nary bunkhouse jealousy of raynors
privileges	

  mighty nice of you to spend an eve-
nin with us
said one we
dont often see
so much of
you aint you
goin over to
the big house
ternight 

  im shy of dinero retorted raynor
im takin up a collection you want to
jine in -

  i aint much on mexican games said
the other and by the tone of his voice
slim had little doubt that this man at
least resented a little the probability if
not the fact that he was working on an
equality with men of mingled breed slim
went on reading listening the gamblers
voices rose and fell raynor seemed to
be winning on the turns of the cards the
four men at slims end of the table began
to talk in comparatively low tones but he
heard them distinctly though they appar-
ently took it for granted that he was ab-
sorbed in his magazine walters behind
a cloud of smoke set out his cards at can-
field

  wonder if theys anything straight
about this revolution
 the trouble at tres pios



  revolution nothing they dont call
em revolutions across the river they call
em demonstrations they have to happen
every so often old porfirio holds em
checked up so hard theyre bound to buck

  i mighty nigh got demonstrated agin
a wall one time they kin call em what
they durn please but im tellin you they
spill blood an fire when they git goin
thats the time you want to watch out
fo a spigotty

 thats south american wah-wah
greaser

  one of them looked a little apprehen-
sively toward the other end of the table

  to blazes with them said the speaker
spigotty dago or greaser you cant
trust none of em

  youre dead wrong there jest as
good as any folks cept the breeds
they agreed on that and slim felt bet-
ter if there ever came a time when issue
was taken against raynor there would be
more than one or two against his crowd
six counting walters not counting wing

  probably git some news from town
when the boys git back

  i aint goin to wait up haf the night
to git it

  hear thet rumor about the cattlemens
association

  what the voices dropped lowar
still slim believed the precaution taken
more against the monte players than him-
self he could still hear fairly well in
scraps when raynor and his crowd did not
make too much noise

  he heard bits about the night hawks
about a big reward a vigilante organiza-
tion and piecing them together he drew
a right conclusion he arrived also at a
pretty definite conclusion that whatever
there was of inside crooked work in the
stealing of t p cattle these four men
were neither in on it nor were they mem-
bers of the more or less mysterious night
hawks

  there was a near row at the table end
it was curious that none of the men he
fancied as breeds had other than eminently
american names but the admixture might
be slight and it was not at all uncommon
for half breeds to take surnames that sug-
gested saxon blood whether legally or not
raynor threatened one of slims helpers
called taylor snatching his cards from
him taylor flourished a knife that
seemed to come out of his sleeve but
dropped it as the muzzle of raynors gun
came above the edge of the table

  if i didnt need you raynor snarled
id shoot the lungs out of you

  the other mumbled something and ray-
nor shot a quick look down the table as
if realizing that lie had said something im-
prudent he saw nothing that did trot
reassure him and the incident passed

  slim was genuinely tired with his day
he turned in early and soon walters
crawled into the bunk beneath him one
after another followed the card game
continued until someone expostulated
loudly and forcibly from a bunk raynor
went outside after turning down the lamp
but those who had played with him sat
round the stove where wood was burning
slowly under balanced drafts slim half
asleep felt the cold breeze as raynor came
in again with the two who had gone to
town it was late he knew by the shift
of moonbeams on the wall the lamp was
out now all had gone to bunk but these
three and the room echoed with the varied
snoring of the slumbering hands

  raynor was talking in a low tone us-
ing spanish slim listened in glad of his
working knowledge of that tongue he
guessed the conversation the end of more
vital matters discussed outside but it was
interesting enough if only for the cor-
roboration of his idea about the foreman
unmasked in his fluency

  they might as well offer fifty thou-
sand as ten said raynor no one will
ever collect it

  im not so sure of that dios ten
thousand american pesos is a big sum 
you thinking of going in for it  came
in raynors voice

  me heart of the virgin no
then keep watch on your tongue or you
may lose it a dog may eat it

  there was silence the scuffling of men
undressing in the dark creaking of bunks
and silence slim did not go to sleep again
that night ten thousand dollars was a
lot of money one might buy a good out-
fit with half that amount even aspire to
think of marrying-someone with proper-
ty rights of her own for instance and
if the collection included the elimination
of raynor bueno muy bueno

  the englishman surprised slim the next
morning finding a chance to talk apart

  hear those two chaps who went to
town come in last night with raynor 
yes you awake 

 dont sleep much thought you
might not be snoozing either your
breathing was mighty easy over me hear
what they said understand it


short stories

  yes you habla espaiiol

  yes not saying so round here rot-
ten work going on in this county marvin
some of it slops over on this ranch cant
understand it all dont need to theyre
booking walsh and hes a decent sort
sister is-well shes sorry for me let it
go at that im more or less of a rotter
but i draw the line at stealing-what 
youre straight as a bit of string ray-
nors crooked as a hounds hind leg will-
ing to wager his right names more like
herrara ive heard odds and ends
nights when im awake going over the
bally mess ive made of things

  well you heard em these black-
guards stealing cattle all over the shop call
themselves the night hawks no one
knows who belongs getting afraid to
talk about it now the cattlemens asso-
ciation are after them and it looks as if
our little pal raynor might be one of the
bally ringleaders seemed to be afraid a
bit what  thought the other party
might squeal ten thousands a nice lit-
tle parcel of spondulix

   you and i now suppose we get a rum-
ble about something land our man
more with him maybe what say if we
go halves on what we collect  both work
together im not quite the ass i look and
almost anyone would look silly beside you
and your gun what price us old
scout 

   slim could see that walters had intend-
ed to let him in on the overhead talk even
if slim had not chanced to know spanish
and he warmed to the britisher whether

they would be
able to trap
raynor and
through h i m
the heads of
the night
hawks was
another mat-
ter but it was worth trying and he re-
flected that he had more than a suspicion
he knew the man called chief

  he nodded

  youre on old chap righto

it was sunday morning and the out-
fit lounging generally some had
gone to town but most of them loafed
mending leather or clothing cleaning
jguns skylarking walsh was in caroca
trying to make final contract for the sale
of beef to the mexican federal forces who
were now camped close to the border he
had kept this quiet not even raynor

suspected the possibility of such a
deal

  the t p riders gaped when a roadster
came down the lane from the gate that
opened on the main road there was a
vision driving alone and most of them
knew the lady at least by sight la rose
in summer costume stunning to their eyes
though her complexion like her costume
was a trifle pronounced

  slim shaving meticulously by a mirror
hung to a nail outside the bunkhouse door
saw her reflection and promptly drifted
inside he did not think she would be es-
pecially eager to see him and his action
was natural enough the car slowed by
the gate of the garden then came on la
rose liked the flowers but suspected the
reason for their existence it was only on
the way out that she remembered talk of
walshs sister and she had almost turned
back she had seen nothing of walsh on
the road or in caroca but she hesitated
to call at the house and drove on to where
the men rose as one from the bench and off
the top rail of the opposite fence glad that
from sheer custom they had on their glad
shirts those who had sombreros swept
them off gallantly as she surveyed them
with a smile walters stepped for-
ward

  his manner evidently impressed her as
a brand of politeness not common to the
neighborhood

  ive never seen you at the cactus have
i  she asked her eyes roving for sight
of walsh or raynor or slim she was
still vindictive but walters with his un-
affected gentility checked her a little he
was a distinct type as a string to her
bow he might be efficient and she was a
little afraid of him

  i didnt know id find you there he
said and got a dazzling smile for reward
my error can i serve you

  she was not quite sure whether he was
mocking her or not with his melancholy
eyes here was a man who had seen life
remittance man of course but appar-
ently working a phenomenon a puz-
zle that intrigued her-a little she made
up her mind to see more of him

  im looking for mr walsh she said
i rather think he expects me

  she raised her voice which was well
modulated hoping that raynor might be
within hearing knowing that some of these
men considered her more or less the fore-
mans girl sufficiently so not to try to
mine his claim the long englishman
with his horse-face was different she
the trouble at tres pinos



rather thought hed cut in on raynor if
she tried to make him slim dropped out
of her mind the man called taylor went
in search of raynor currying favor and
found him looking at a wirecut on his
horse

  johnny bulls trying to steal yore gel
he said

  raynor looked at him in surprise
whats eatin you he asked what
gal

  la rose shes here in her john
henry come out to see walsh she says
ses he was expectin her

  thatsa damn lie raynor hurried
off la rose called to him gaily she
was chagrined at the news of walshs ab-
sence but she was not going to spoil her
day raynor was the next best bet to
pit him against the britisher might be bet-
ter fun than the cowboy whose name she
did not know she considered slim as
dumb where women were concerned any-
way he didnt matter so much with bet-
ter game in hand

  walters knew by bunkhouse gossip of
raynors leaning he was shrewd enough
to debit la rose with her desire for flirt-
ing and its complications he had not
trailed the world without acquiring wis-
dom and he turned away despite her al-
luring glance raynor caught it and his
face grew darker this was his girl he
did not relish interference and the word of
walsh rankled

  thought you werent cornin he be-
gan youre late

  la rose gave him an admiring glance
gasping a little at his cleverness she let
him help her from the car draw her away
from the crowd

  whats this about walsh trying to
start somethin you cant finish

  youve no strings on me sled ray-
nor youre hurting my arm

  ill twist it off if you try to make a fool
oitt of me rollin yore eyes at that brit-
ish dude

  hes a gentleman anyway

  well im not as for that dude ill
spoil him if he monkeys round you now
then what about walsh

  he invited me out here

  i dont believe it if he did why aint
he here to meet you

  he had let go her wrist and la rose
was beginning to enjoy herself

  i didnt set any special date

  raynors face began to twitch ill tell
him where he heads in you too you
lay off walsh

  since when did you give me orders

  im givin em to you now you came
out here to see me sabe well take a
ride together in thet car of yourn back on
the mesa ill git the chink to put up
some lunch

  this did not suit la rose things were
not going as she planned raynor was as-
serting his masterful manner and she felt
something of the old lure of it

  im not going she said if walsh
isnt home ill call on his sister

  that was bravado but raynors coarse
guffaw stung her pride and unleashed her
temper 

  think shed have anything to do with
yore sort raynor sneered

  la rose in a fury slapped him across
the cheek her jeweled ring struck the
lip that slim had split and which was bare-
ly beginning to heal blood spurted and
as la rose started back alarmed at the re-
sult of her blow but still angry raynor
started for her but he checked himself
pressing the loose ends of his neckerchief
to the cut

  ill fix you fo that you hellcat he
said there were flakes of fire in his dark
eyes and his voice was low and deadly
the girl shrank further off watching his
clutching hands suddenly afraid

  youll leave me alone im through
with you she panted forgetful of the
cowboys a dozen paces away watching
them

  im not through with you

  i know too much about you sled ray-
nor she said and her voice grew shrill
with terror

  yah what you know he stood in
front of her covering her from the little
crowd in the front rank of which stood
walters his left hand stroking his gaunt
chin his lank figure seemingly slack
though there was a light in xhis too often
vacuous eyes la rose backed against
the fence of the corral at bay raynor
had boasted to her that the hands at tres
pinos were his tools and with walsh away
she became panicky womanlike she
seized any weapon

  weve got a new dancer at the cac-
tus she said shes made friends with
me calls herself la paloma she knows
you

  la rose had made no definite threat it
was probably that she suspected more than
she knew but raynors face turned to
that of a devil as he heard the name of the
girl who called herself the dove far
from a dove was teresa hernandez a


short stories

hawk too wild even for raynor to tame
it was she who had danced at the cantina
the night raynor had dragged walsh away
after the quarrel and the shooting

  ill slit your throat before it cackles
too much he said his eyes bloodshot
murderous and la palomas after-
wards

  she believed him for all the sunny day
and the onlooking cowboys it all swam
before her eyes a little

  youll swing for it she gasped as
raynor made motion toward his belt the
devil inside of him rejoicing at sight of the
frightened woman who stared at him in
genuine horror neither of them noticed
walters strolling toward them hed
scare her into line thought raynor flash
theknife on her he drew it halfway
from its sheath at his belt then sent it
back as la rose cowered

   ill do better than that he said grim-
ly ill send in yore name to the night
hawks my lady they wont slit that
pretty throat of yores mebbe but theyll
do worse than that you wont want to
call yoreself la rose after they git through
with you

  she blanched under her rouge at the
name of the masked riders of the night

 oh my god she moaned as raynor
grinned at her

  rotten bad form to frighten a lady
raynor what

  walters wore no weapon his hands
dangled low at his sides there was a
flame in his light blue eyes that held ray-
nor for a moment before he stepped back
crottching at the hips his bruised face
cruel his hand darting to his gun

  you damned dude he said and la
rose shrieked

  it was raynors love of making a man
cringe when he had the drop on him that
saved walters the englishman stood his
ground as the foremans gun came out of
its holster and he let the muzzle nose its
slow and deadly way upward - on the
cry slim his face clear of lather his dress-
ing finished sensing the note of distress
sprang through the door of the bunkhouse
colt in hand taking in the situation as the
cowboys stirred the whole action swift as
the turning of a hand

  raynor

  the foreman half turned he had wal-
ters covered anyway and there was an im-
perative accent to the calling of his name
that warned him he saw the glint of
blued steel in the hand of the new hand
there were thirty yards between them but

fear laid a hand on his shoulder and his
pulses slowed in that instant walters

                        tt

deftly kicked the gun out of his hand it
went flying over the bars into the corral
the englishman offered his arm in courtly
fashion to the girl and she took it glad of
the support as he strolled off with her
raynor was left with distorted face con-
vulsed with rage humiliated conscious of
the menace of the gun in slims steady
hand of slims watchful gaze

  then the weapon was holstered and
raynor strode up to slim fists clenched

  damn you he spluttered youre
fired ill give you yore time git yore
hawss an fog out of here pronto the
dude goes too

  slim laughed quietly i wouldnt
think of leavin till yore eye gits well
he said softly the words braked ray-
nors fury makes you look sot of one-
sided slim went on his head on one side
as if he contemplated whether it would
not be a righteous deed to restore balance
by a second attack man who hires me
fires me he drawled thets a rule of
mine i reckon walters feels the samej
way erbout it

  waitersll have to wait till walsh
makes him out a check said raynor
the two of you can go together it
was a lame way out of it but better than
none slim had worsted him walters
and la rose were walking toward the
flower garden belle walsh stood on the
porch surveying them curiously she had
vaguely heard the shriek from the back of
the house where she had been in confer-
ence with wing over culinary matters

  raynor wheeled lunged into a lane be-
tween two corrals he entered one re-
trieved his gun saddled and mounted his
horse and rode off toward caroca pre-
sumably to meet walsh and ensure the dis-
charge of the two hands

  slim went back into the bunkhouse he
was still clear of la rose content that
walters had taken her off though he did
not suppose that the girl would want to
have anything more to do with him he
had brought matters to a climax that might
the trouble at tres pinos

 lose him his job that did not worry him
 so much as the thought that his useful-
 ness might be destroyed in aiding walsh
 and his sister it all depended upon how
 strong a hold the foreman possessed over
 his employer walsh would be loath to
 lose him he felt certain and walters
 was a man hard to replace with his knack
 with engines

   it would all be settled when walsh got
 back from town it was no use borrowing
 trouble and slim did not see how else he
 could have acted therefore he shrugged
 his shoulders and gazing through a side
 window saw a scene that rather staggered
 him belle walsh was coming down the
 path to the gate walters imperturbable
 was halting to greet her la rose hanging
 back uncertain of her reception

   the englishman had secured the danc-
 ers right name-and that was curious in
 itself for no one else in caroca knew it

   miss walsh will you permit me to in-
 troduce to you miss margaret baker
 he said the words were carefully cho-
 sen and the emphasis as carefully placed
 it neither offended la rose nor deceived
 belle walsh she looked a little search-
 ingly at walters and then at margaret
 baker she took in the rouge the gown
 the perfume and since she was far from a
 cool it is probable that she placed the
 dance-hall attraction with fair accuracy
 perhaps she saw more than most people
 did perhaps la rose showed a diffi-
 dence an appeal that was half shrinking
 rather than her usual defiance the soul
 of the innocent girl in her gingham gown
 may have caught a glimpse of the soul of
 the other that showed an aspect unknown
 to her little world it had not been all
 pretence when she had told walsh she
 wanted to get out of it all

   and besides walters was a favorite
 belle relied on his discretion in such mat-
 ters she was not narrow minded

   i am glad to meet you miss baker
 she said wont you and mr walters
 come up to the house and have some ice
 cream wings made some and its pleas-
 ant on the porch

   la rose went up between the flowers
 with her eyes moist to the danger of their
 make-up she was subdued and gentle
 and the hostess did most of the talking
 she did not ask her guest what she was
 doing in caroca but she did find out where
 she came from and soon the two were
 talking about gardens with walters strok-
 ing his chin between them it was a cu-
  rious conclave

  i thought something had happened
belle walsh said once it sounded like
a shriek and that brought me out it was
fortunate i did and saw you

  shriek of laughter  rather think
said walters raynor was really humor-
ous had to be for me to see the joke
dont you know

  when la rose left her voice shook a
little im not fixed sos i can entertain
you she said but if  see any way of
getting even ill grab it

  shes just about an angel she told
walters as they latched the gate while
wondering cowboys whispered and whis-
tled softly

  these demonstrations ceased as the
englishman came up with the girl on his
arm they had seen a touch of his qual-
ity and to cross him meant crossing
slim marvin still inside walters un-
conscious of any hitches told la rose that
he wanted her to meet his friend

  saved me from sudden death and all
that when raynor started trouble he
said and called slims name aloud pre-
senting him as mr marvin there was
no enmity now in the eyes or the heart of
la rose true hospitality had almost
wrought a miracle

  im glad to know your name she said
to slim i saw you call the turn on ray-


nor

  slim begged her not to mention it while
walters slipped inside and came out buck-
ling a gun belt about his waist

  im going into town with you he said
to la rose

  how will you get back 

  the old man lias the car he said
he said hed not likelybe coming back
till late ill find him and you might
run into raynor

  she knew he meant walsh by the ranch
term of old man and she hoped they
would not meet him on the way things
had changed since morning as for ray-
nor-the fear of his threat was still upon
her though she had tried to shake it off
she knew its possibilities

  if raynor meets us she prefaced
hes got it in for you

  i know one end of a gun from the
other walters answered laconically and
the girl felt confidence in his ability to
take care of himself he had placed him-
self in jeopardy for her sake greater than
he would generally risk she fancied at
least she hoped it was for her sake not
just because she was a woman i heard
what raynor was saying to you as  cunc
	short

up walters went on dont you bother
too much about that a whole lot of that
night hawk palaver means nothing

  you dont know she said

  know quite a lot theyve rather shot
their bolt y know cattlemens associa-
tion after them and all that sort of thing
dont you worry

  i wont if you tell me not to she
said it simply without coquetry i dont
know what joe walsh will think of me
having visited his sister hell be furi-
ous

  why

  i imagine you can guess if you want to
try im not her sort you know what
i do for a living

  dance your feet off look here miss
baker im glad to say that miss walsh is
a friend of mine im a bad egg and she
knows it i try not to be a cad but im a
long way from being a saint a sight
further off than you are

  youre a man

  theres jolly well no difference wom-
an gets the worst of it thats all and
im mighty glad that you are a woman
by jove i am a friend of mine is a
friend of miss belles or i wouldnt have
introduced yon

  you mean you really want to be a
friend of mine

  well start at that she looked at
him with the searching glance of a woman
often deceived but he met it imperturba-
bly with a little nod that warmed her

walsh came back from caroca
walters with him in the car tri-
umphant thanks to jaynes he
had been in touch with an empowered
member of diazs staff and laid plans for
a highly satisfactory deal he was sure
now of selling his excess beef at a good
price the mexican federal troops were
coming up close to the line at a point al-
most opposite caroca a tentative price
and quantity had been discussed he
could get rid of all his grade stock and
financially shelve his worries without
the ancient prejudice and grudges of the
oldtime ranchers and cattlemen walsh
knew that the word of a mexican gentle-
man was a bond and the officer he had
spoken with was of hidalgo blood

  he was able to throw off his worry about
raynor to a great extent the foreman
had found him demanding the discharge
of walters and slim and walsh had ef-
fectively denied him

  no time to talk about such nonsense

stories

sled ive got a big deal on hand need
every hand ive got let it blow over i

want you to
deliver the
stock to the res-
ervation ill
be busy while
youre gone
itll all be for-
gotten by the
time you get back

  raynors eyes narrowed hed deliver
the steers and collect the money whether
hed turn it over to walsh or not he was
not so sure he did not like walshs man-
ner it was a little too confident he
seemed to be getting out of hand but he
said nothing more about firing slim or
walters when he had seen walsh and
the englishman leave town he got busy in
quarters that he knew as excellent sources
of information seeking to find out what
walsh meant by his big deal what he
learned caused him to grin complacently
as he began to lay his plans he too
would have to be busy before he started
for the reservation so busy that he was
willing to leave la rose alone for the time
being he would take with him his own
special crowd from the hands at tres
pinos what he had to say to them after
thqy got away would quite restore his pres-
tige it was late when he got back to the
ranch the next day he greeted slim and
walters with a surly nod

  walsh telling the news to belle paid
scant attention at the time to what she
said about her guest after she had gone
to bed however he whistled softly and re-
solved to keep his peace if walters were
really taken with la rose his own little
entanglement was over with she was not
a bad sort he told himself and walters
knew his own affairs best

  all he had to do was to time things
properly it would take raynor all of
ten days to go to the reservation and back
ample time in which to round up deliver
and collect spot cash for the diaz contract
once that was signed and he had lee-
way on the reservation delivery ray-
nor would lay no hands on the mexican
pesos he began in his new found con-
fidence to almost believe that raynor had
been bluffing him as soon as he had
money in the bank he meant to start some
inquiries about the man he had killed with
money he could employ the right people to
find out the exact truth of the affair

  the reservation steers were rounded up
and raynor departed apparently the
the trouble at tres pinos

foreman knew nothing of the projected
sale to the mexican commissary and
walsh breathed a sigh of relief

  he summoned slim to the ranch-house
the night that raynor left and told him of
the deal

  im making you acting foreman slim
he said your salary goes up to ninety
may stay there you dont know the
place yet but harper does and hell tell
you where the stock is ranging three
hundred head including cows at sixty dol-
lars straight war prices start round-
ing up tomorrow weve a week to de-
liver i can get some drivers later well
hold em in what we call little park in-
side the wire dont have to cross the
river theyll take em over on this side
ill go with you of course

  here was a different walsh from the
man slim had first met forceful and sure
of himself slim rejoiced not only for
the sake of his new made friend but on
his sisters account

  she met him at supper and her mood
was gracious

  ive got a delayed acknowledgment to
make to you mr marvin she said

  oh call him slim broke in her
brother

  she hesitated flushed a little then did
as she was asked and the sound of his
nickname on her lips was music to its
owner

  its an apology as well she went on
ive told my brother about what hap-
pened in owl canyon there were rea-
sons for the way  behaved some day
joe will tell you about that i hope you
must have thought me very rude ill try
and make amends joe says you are to
be acting foreman youll take your
meals with us of course as many as you
can and come over evenings

  here was heaven for slim striving to
say the right thing and getting tongue-
tied she laughed at him and after sup-
per sang and played for both of them
she asked him if he knew any of the span-
ish cancioncs and slim took his courage
in both hands

  i cant sing he said no moren a
crow but mebbe you know this one 
f te spoke the lines in spanish and walsh
snickered softly

  i cant speak spanish much less sing
it said the girl but ive got a transla-
tion of that it ought to have a guitar
accompaniment but ill do the best i can
she played a few chords and began to
sing

  eyes like stars that shine so bright

  in the azure depths of night

  voice that thrills like song of lark

  breath as sweet as breeze that blows

  oer the jasmine and the rose

  twixt the twilight and the dark

  slim wondered if she were a little self-
conscious as she sang he hoped so but
it was hard to tell in the half light where
she sat the song seemed at once to
bring them nearer and to separate them
he was only a rough rider schooled well
enough but better versed of late in the
crude ways of the bunkhouse and mess-
hall the free and easy life of the range
than in places like this room with its sym-
bols of refinement walsh was not very
different from him he comforted himself
but walsh was an owner and slim only a
cowboy

  yet he found himself at ease finally
after the singing vyas done and walsh busy
at letters and accounts she got him talk-
ing of hunting and fishing and showed
herself as no novice at either she loved
the open saddle and rod and gun blan-
ket and slicker and campfire she knew
them all

  he went back to the bunkhouse walking
on air building castles in the same un-
stable medium and he was up at dawn
flinging himself into the work raynor
and the night hawks were forgotten in
the task at hand

  followed glorious crisp mornings with
the steaks broiling and the coffee simmer-
ing potatoes frying biscuits in the camp
oven walters installed as cook for the
little outfit swift riding after the scat-
tered bunches of barren grade cows cull-
ing the steers shouting across arroyos as
the stock plunged to escape the roundup
and the ponies slid down on their tails or
climbed like goats as keen for the work as
their riders

  and always early belle walsh loping

out from the
ranch doing her
share on a wie
old cowpony al-
most as good
as a man stay-
ing till sundown
going back to
the ranch again with a cheery wave of
hand that slim came to think was meant
for him more than the rest

  she was more than making amends he
felt sure of that sometimes she found
opportunity to be with him through the


short stories

day and there were glances besides the
hand waving when they parted

  then walters served the savory supper
and afterward told them in his jerky ef-
fective way many tales by land and sea
adventures credited always to someone
else but which slim guessed were largely
personal experiences so to bed tarp on
the ground blankets over and boots in
with the owner to save frozen wrinkles in
the morning sometimes walsh stayed
out with them two nights of the five he
went home with his sister to be near the
telephone

  all slept like logs unmoving but slim
dreamed and in his dreams his difficul-
ties vanished and he became an ardent
wooer a faculty that left him utterly un-
daring when daylight came and belle came
loping over the rise after breakfast but
he thought that she knew how he felt and
perhaps understood why he hesitated to be
more bold

  by noon of the sixth day the full ship-
ment was assembled in little park a bowl
in the breakdown of the mesa with a spring
in the center and good feed between the
sage and mesquite clumps they were in-
side wire but slim ordered night herd
the day was sultry the sunrise had brok-
en through in murky crimson and saffron
and he did not like the look of the weather
he remembered the day of his arrival the
three pines standing out against the big
cloud the center one blasted looking like
a great gallows and the downpour that fol-
lowed

  the stock was to rest quietly till the next
day set for delivery slim was responsi-
ble and he took no chances

  storm may set em millin if it
comes after nightfall he said theres
enough of em to stampede and ive seen
less break plumb through three strand
five wouldnt hold em and we dont
want to lose em the way other stocks been
lost off this ranch well split the night
herd

  he was quite sure of the men under him
they were good hands content with their
wages and their jobs and now beyond any
possible influence from raynor if they had
ever been susceptible which he doubted
he supposed he would have to give up his
authority when raynor came back but he
was not sure of that walsh had meant
something when he said his foremans
wage might be continued and he had done
well he knew that aside from walshs
commendations

  storm masses assembled seemed to dis-

solve all through the morning and soon
after noon the weather grew more omin-
ous dark slatey vapors piled up back of
the mesa the cattle were uneasy at their
grazing there was no air stirring and
every move of the men brought sweat
from their skins there was little to do
but lie held them all for the night watch
even walters who rode well enough
walsh left before supper approving slims
plans leaving them in his charge

  ive got some phoning to do in winding
up the business he said report things
in good shape for one thing thanks to
you you wont stay a hand long slim
you know how to manage

  belle walsh had not come out the
mexican commissary colonel with one or
two companions were to come out to the
ranch to inspect and pay over the money
and she had plans to attend to for their en-
tertainment

  be sure to be on hand slim walsh
said as he left need you to help talk
to em i cant do it all and you know
the lingo

  so does walters how about him
sure might have known hed talk
mexican never says much that hombre
but he knows a heap both of you show
at lunch harper can run things out here
till inspection

  it did not cool off at nightfall as usual
there was a mist over half the sky and
no stars visible a moon was due around
midnight but slim did not think they
would see much of it the air seemed
heavy compressed under the sheer weight
of the black cloud mountains behind the
mesa over it now with streaks of light-
ning flickering through the mass and now
and then a low rumble of thunder

  shell be moren jest a cloudburst said
harper when she comes well bp swim-
min herd stead of ridin yes sir well
be duckfooted befo mornin who goes
on first

  well shoot for it said slim and the
dice were rolled on a blanket by the light
of the fire walters had got a pile of
wood enough for the night an extra tar-
paulin to keep it dry though harper
vowed it would float off once the storm
broke

  i know em when they come this time
of year he said reglar noahs ark
floods think they was a lake over you
an someone pulled a slide out of the bot-
tom

  two men mounted and rode round the
dark mass of the herd the sound of
the trouble at tres pinos	

their crooning mehncholy songs came to
the others a word or two of the cowboys
lament 

oh as i walked down the streets of

  laredo

as i walked there in laredo one day

  tobacco glowed save where harper
softly mouthed his harmonica the fire
burned sluggishly as if lacking oxygen and
the clouds imperceptibly moved eastward
a pall above them shifting in a wind that
was screened by the vapory bulk

  i got a hunch said harper as he
tucked his harmonica away i sure got a
hunch this is a hoodoo night you heed
me hombres theres goin to be trouble
at tres pinos befo mornin i felt this
way befo once was the night i went an
got married an another time we got
mixed in with some rustlers an rode the
leather offn our saddles fo we got clear
nother time-

i thars frogs down in the spring to do
the croakin said the man next to him la-
conically go down an jine em cow-
boy

  trouble at tres pinos the phrase
stayed in the front of slims mind he
had used it himself and now it came with
a premonition he set down to the weather
and his own nervousness in handling the
cattle through the night

  the two riders were walking their
horses round and round the herd that
 stood unfeeding snuffing snorting and oc-
casionally pawing at the ground

  harper not to be balked delighting in
his own chronic pessimism started a new
isubject

  fine weather for the night hawks
he said if they got wind we had this
herd here all ready to stampede theyd
save the storm the trouble drive em
over the line an sell em to the greasers
theyd buy price ud likely be better
than a regular deal

  what would we be doin

   shootin off our lil guns one bullet to
every fifty agen us its a night hawk
night im tellin you

  slim shifted uneasily the possibility
was not too remote he knew the deal
had been kept quiet but there was no tell-
ing where it might have leaked none
knew the sources of information of the
night hawks it was said that there was
at least one active member on every outfit

  jolly rum thing happened once down
in the south seas said walters as he

 cl

made his pipe draw to his satisfaction
in the new hebrides at a place called
aoba called the traders graveyard
too only there were no graves the
natives who killed em buried em in their
bellies there was a copra planter by the

name of heywards-

  silently slim blessed the englishman
as the rest craned to listen to the yarn
there was no sense talking about the night
hawks that sort of thing made for bad
shooting if anything should happen
they would listen to walters all night
with his talk of pearlers and poachers
cannibals and wizards club houses lined
with skulls and grisly tales of idol drums
beating up for head hunting raids

  a few heavy drops fell spitting in the
fire ceased the gloom seemed to deep-
en a livid tongue of flame that lapped
the forward edge of the cloud showed it
far advanced when the rain came they
would be in the middle of it they
dragged their slickers to them and put
them on while walters yarned on

three men came out in a car to
tres pinos that night late just be-
fore walsh was ready to go to bed
well satisfied with the way everything was
going belle had sat up with him walsh
had been uneasy at the gathering storm
consulting the ranch barometer that gave
an ominous reading

  i think i ought to go out to little
park he said

  why slim can do everything cant
he

  he surely can mighty good man
too good to be a hand

  i dont think he will be long

  thats what i told him myself like
him sis

  he asked the question without special
meaning and stared as he saw a swift blush
sweep over the girls neck and face but
she did not hide her head or turn away
she nodded at him conscious of her tell-
tale banner of rose

  by jings he said softly like that
is it couldnt suit me any better belle
id pick him fo a brother-in-law without
hesitatin hell do to take along but
dern his hide hell have to stay here at
tres pinos ill be jinged i lose you fo
housekeeper two men wont be much
more troublen one will they 

  youre a bit premature joe she an-
swered him more composedly

  aint spoken yet he will ive seen
it in his eye saw it the night you sang
short stories

that song in here hes a bit shy best
men usually are that way

  including yourself  belle parried
thinking that she had seen the look her
brother spoke of long before in owl
canyon even when she had snubbed slim
for joes sake

  me im cut out fo a bachelor im
not shy im too easy too liable to be
taken in by some designin female who
wouldnt know a saddle tree from a waf-
fle iron think we better leave it to slim
tonight

  of course and youre tired

  i am sis been under a strain theres
leen times i sure craved a drink but thats
out and i wouldnt wonder but what we
were out-of the woods

  the raynor matter was taboo between
them by mutual consent she smiled at
him

  im sure of it joe shall we go to
bed

  it was then they saw the headlights of
the car outside halting shut off heard
steps on the porch they looked at each
other in a quick alarm the dead mexi-
can for all their affected cheer stalked a
constant phantom through the secret places
of their minds

  joe went to the door and admitted the
visitors two were big cattlemen the
third the sheriff of the county

  were a bit late walsh but its im-
ortant and we had to go to other places
the speaker was a tall gaunt man with
strong features iron gray hair mustache
and goatee of the old-timer it was hes-
keth a close friend of the elder walsh
while the latter was alive

  walsh produced cigars saw them seated
belle reassured by the talk of other vis-
its slipped out to make coffee

  wont keep you long said hesketh
its about this night hawks matter
theyve got to be cleaned up im repre-
senting the cattlemens association in this
we came to an agreement at the last meet-
ing a special one you werent there
we didnt want to say what it was about
in the notice cant be too careful of a
leak i trust my hands but im hanged
if i know or not whether some of them
havent been mixed up in it cant keep
track of em when they say theyre goin to
town i suppose you didnt think it im-
portant like the rest weve seen tonight

  we want you in with us weve voted
jlen thousand dollars to be given to the
men who turn in the ringleaders under-
stand there are three of em one called

 the chief weve got the funds and if
 we hadnt wed raise em by special as-
 sessment

  youve got that shipment rounded up
you were talking about to me 

  he did not mention diaz but he was in
walshs confidence he had helped in
the preliminaries walsh nodded

  holding them in little park he said
deliver em tomorrow

  tidy amount there for you got a
night herd one you can trust

  yes

  weve heard a few things youre in
with us on this of course in your own
interests

  walsh hesitated as his sister came in
with the coffee

  my brother will join she said we
were talking it over the other night
good thanks for the coffee miss
belle we need it its going to be a
bad night and we may be busy were
looking for some action tonight walsh
id ask you to come along theres thirty
of us ready for a start when we get back
but i recommend you to go over to little
park whether youre sure of your men or
not never can tell when those night
hawksll swoop theyve probably real-
ized their time is getting short bound to
have heard what were up to

  he leaned forward and shot out his
question what do you know about your
man raynor is he in charge of your
herd at little park

  little bunches of muscle showed along
the line of walshs jaws as he set them for
what might be coming he did not look
t his sister

 why he asked though raynor
aint there hes taking a bunch over to
the reservation on the beef contract
humph ever thought he might be
mixed up in the steers run off from you
you told me it almost looked like inside
work one time

  walsh spoke slowly picking his phrase
ive got no evidence that way he said

  when did he start with the reservation
bunch walsh told him

  figure he ought to be there by this
the trouble at tres pinos	

  ought to be there yesterday at the lat-
est deliverys due tomorrow they
wont inspect till then i didnt get the
whole contract theyll wait till its filled
from other ranches i allowed two days
for red tape they use it plenty over to
the agency

  the three looked at one another and
nodded the sheriff coughed and spoke
for the first time jerking his head toward
the third man

  pritchard here says he saw raynor in
town last night or thinks he did

  i aint certain said pritchard i ran
out of gas outside of padillas fonda an
went in to get some padillas got a car
there was a bunch of men in the bar talk-
ing mex some of em went out as i
went in one of em sure looked like
raynor

  thats all said hesketh rising bow-
ing to belle as he finished his coffee
well be going along made time in the
sheriffs car but i wouldnt wonder if we
all forked saddles tonight its going to
be a wild one

  gun belts showed on all of them as they
stood up

  take my advice and go out to little
park walsh said hesketh as they left
an take a good slicker along youll need
it

  walsh watched the car lunging off
through the night heard the first patter of
heavy rain

  youre going joe

  i think id better heskeths advice is
usually good theres something on foot
if that night hawk bunch wants to make
a quick haul before they get stopped ours
is a tempting proposition only five men
with slim i hate to leave you alone
thats foolish theres wing and
nothing to be afraid of ill go to
bed

the steers that had been destined for
the wards of the nation were herd-
ed in a narrow glen recessed on the
mesa top two days journey from tres
pinos two men guarded them though

only one was on watch and he sleepily
cursing his luck at being left out of the
fun

  as the rain began to come down hard
he went over and woke his companion set-
ting his watch the only one between them
ahead an hour he had no intention of
getting wet

  it is not that late said the other in
spanish you are a liar pedro and if
the moon was up id prove it to you

  its up but you cant see it for the
clouds compadre

  then what in the name of god is the
good of standing watch and getting
drowned when you cant see the hand be-
fore the eyes let the steers watch them-
selves they cant get out of the gulch
its wired

  you wouldnt say that if raynor was
here

  raynor he works for us tonight
let us rest it is an evil night i heard
an owl after i lay down the worst of
luck if things go wrong it will not be
with us here are fat cattle we know
the hidden way through the mesa we
might even take them to the reservation
and get the money we could say the
storm hindered us

  luis you have the brain of the arch-
angel michael i will share what is left
in the flask with you good mescal and
then we will rest

  with the tarpaulins left by their absent
comrades spread over them the pair rid-
ers in the pay of tres pinos members of
the night hawks on picket duty snored
in unison

out from caroca clad in ponchos
of oiled cloth hiding them from
chin to knee save as they flapped
in the gallop like wings a masked caval-
cade swept through the dark stormy night
racing toward little park where slim and
walters slickered but with their gun belts
outside rode round the restless herd in
their turn at night watch

  it was slim who first caught sight of
walsh in a gleam of lightning that showed
	short stories

up the hides of the restless herd like wet
satin their tossing horns and restless eyes

  thought id ride over said walsh
everything o k

  alls well so far were holdin em
its sure goin to be a wet night every-
thing all right to the ranch

  yes

  miss belle there alone

  with wing she wanted me to come

  slim said nothing a vagrant wish
came into his mind that she had not been
left at tres pinos without her brother
but there could be no danger at the ranch
somehow he felt there was trouble in the
night

i we just went on watch he said fin-
ally

  good ill ride with you

  theres coffee by the fire under a
tarp said walters

  fine but i-

  he never finished the speech out of
the black night a horde of horsemen
swarmed a shouting mob that split about
the herd guns fired stabbing the gloom
lightning flared and the rain poured down
as men struggled out of blankets and
sought their saddles

  riderless horses careered charging the
stampeding cattle clang of breaking
wire shot after shot seven men against
five times as many fighting against des-
perate odds as the thunder rolled and
crashed

  the herd once broken started toward
the fence where the wire had been already
cut to give passage to the raiders though
many of them blundered against the wire
in their frenzy from fire and storm the
rest poured through the gap toward which
they were driven while the majority of
the night hawks seemed bent on exter-
minating the men in charge of the steers

  whether they recognized walsh identi-
fied him as the owner was hard to say
tremendous bursts of electric discharge
levined through the clouds or lit up their
under surfaces and all the rain-soaked
earth with the steel rods of the water glit-
tering in the instant before darkness once
more shut down

   so brilliant was this display that it mo-
mentarily illumined all unmasked faces
bringing them out of the blackness as viv-
idly as a photographers flashlight

  yet all this was so mingled with the
speed and twisting of the horses upflung
necks rearing bodies men bending from
their saddles to fire or riding close to their
mounts manes while they reloaded that

distinguishing individuals was largely a
question of chance

  slim tmd walters were the closest to-
gether when the rustlers came charging
and shouting through the fence in their
well planned offensive surrounding the
herd driving them off while they wiped
out all witnesses of their crime that
raynor was in this slim did not doubt
and he guessed that the reservation deliv-
ery had never been made the foreman
and his followers had got wind of the sale
to the mexican federals and knowing
every inch of the terrain had watched the
gathering of the herd and waited until the
last moment when they could strike most
efficiently then the weather turned in
favor of their deviltry with its own fear-
ful artillery and barrage of wind and rain

  as he saw-while lightning glared a
ghastly blue-the t p steers leaping
through the gap where the wire had been
nipped plunging through breaking strands
that gave before their brutish madness or
piling up against it in a living wave slim
firing at the ponchoed figures whose dis-
guise made it easy to distinguish friend
from foe sought for the foreman

  here was a mans affair raynor ar-
rayed against tres pinos would be fair
game to slims gun the hold slim fan-
cied raynor held over walsh could be
wiped out and a good riddance but all
the raiders were masked with black silk
kerchiefs tied above the bridges of their
noses hanging down to join the batlike
ponchos from beneath the short folds
hands were thrust to hold reins and shoot
as the robber cavalry systematically went
about their butchery

   not without their rebuffs on his right
slim saw walters coolly discharging his
gun with deliberate aim waiting for the
lightning flashes that came in fast succes-
sion the englishman would probably
never acquire the cowboy seat but he rode
like a polo player weaving through the
men who opposed him and sought to shoot
him down in the wild turmoil of gale-flung
masses of rain peal after peal of deafen-
ing thunder bellowing of cattle bawling
of men crack of pistols plunging gallop-
ing horses

   slim felt the swift sear of a bullet at his
right side judged it had grazed his ribs
felt a warm gush of blood against the
chill of his slicker envelope his hat was
gone by bullet or wind and the rain pelted
at him obscuring his sight plastering his
hair down on his forehead what of the
rest of his guard of walsh he could not
the trouble at tres pinos	

tell even walters was lost in the mad
melee now but he saw ponies galloping by
in the glares their saddles empty reins
trailing heavy stirrups clattering and
could not tell in the brief glimpses to which
side they belonged he hardly was con-
scious of these things they were thrust
upon his vision while he was actively oc-
cupied in looking out for his especial op-
ponents in the wild phantasmagoria where
everything seemed madly out of focus dis-
torted leaping out of the dark in a mad
chaos

  his roan bucked and he guessed it
stung by a bullet though it did not falter
a missile thudded into the wood of his
left stirrup and splintered it though it did
not touch his foot now and then he
caught the yells of the raiders at first
they had been meant to start the cattle
now they were calling to each other to kill

  one loud voice bellowed close to him

  spurts of flaming powder gas shuttled
through the night hell fingers pointing the
way death had gone there came the
shrill neigh of a pony mortally hit a
buffet came to slim not seemingly severe
as if someone had flipped the side of his
head at his left ear almost instantly
there came a numbness that passed away
again but blood was pouring down his
cheek to be washed off by the pelting rain
a lock of his hair lank with the wet had
gone the top of his ear was torn away

 if he got out alive from these odds these
men intent on murder balked in their de-
sire only by the fury of the elements and
the night he would carry a souvenir of it
to his grave it was a dose call death
had literally whispered to him and passed
on

  raynor he could not find how could
he expect to despair blent with rage as
 he saw riders closing in on him heard the
near hum of the bullets they sent while
he in the tense defenceless moment of re-
loading broke his gun riding like an in-
dian elbow crooked about the horn
crouching on one side of his leaping roan
ihe thrust cartridges into the cylinder with
fingers that were stiff from the rain
clumsy so that he dropped two of the
shells he had taken from his belt and
straightened up again with only four loads
between him and the men who rode to sur-
round him

   the last flash had shown the cattle all
through the wire displayed little groups
where one or two men fired at half a score
perhaps broke through the ring with empty
gun perhaps went down-and not alone-

 to the soaking earth guns still cracked
 outside his own particular affray his com-

rades were not yet all killed though none
of them could long survive

  clean em up

 that came from the night hawks
leader with a flash from the side of his
ponys neck came with a blow as - the
bullet bored its way through slims left
forearm numbing it so that he could bare-
ly hold the reins he dropped them over
his saddle horn and rode with his knees
swinging the snorting roan straight for
the dark bulk whence shot and voice had
come

  this was not raynor but it was the
voice of the man who had been called the
chief in the corral shed slim was cer-
tain of it sure of its inflection it had
been unmistakably in command

  the other reared his horse with spurs
and curb to shield the shot he expected
but slim wild with the pain of his dis-
abling wound desperate in the knowledge
that soon he must go plunging out of his
saddle to oblivion yet cool enough in his
intent and its performance roweled his
own mount the roan knowing this
called for supreme effort charged the op-
posing steed with weight and battle squeal
with drumming hoofs and chiseling teeth

  the horse went down and a shot came
up from the ground as the leader crashed
and fired upward as he struck dirt slim
fired back to a target behind the flash and
the struggling horse pawed its way up and
went charging off dragging by one stir-
rup a man who would never pull trigger
again

  one shot more-hit or miss he could not
tell-a swerve in a wild hide-and-seek-
only two cartridges in his gun-one arm
useless-the roan tiring a little perhaps
from loss of blood-it was very close to
the end slim wheeled a little in his saddle
he seemed to see the next flash of light-
ning through a veil down by the fence
the cattle seemed coming back leaping-

  by the eternal god these were not cat-
tle but men riding like the whirlwind
short stories

  

  shouting cries of grim triumph as they
j came no ponchos or masks on these

    weve got em boys yah-yah-yah
  the hoarse gutturals of excited men who
  sight their human quarry after long suf-
  fering and resentment men who rode with-
  out thought of quarter or pity hardened
  with the cruelty of justice

    the lightning was gone but ray after
  ray shot white arrows into the night
  winked out and on again the cattlemen
  hd electric torches that they switched on
  and off as they rode their guns barking
  biting while they picked out their targets

    the eyes of the horses shone like great
  jewels as the rays picked them out and
  then shot dazzling into the faces of the
  riders taken by surprise then conster-
  nation as they knew themselves outmatched
  and their leader no longer able to rally or
  direct them the night hawks sought
  safety in helter-skelter flight it was
  every man for himself pursued by the
  avenging posse of the cattlemens associ-
  ation the raid broken a failure the boast-
  ed power of the night hawks snapped

    a lone rider low in the saddle raced
  past slim a dull blot in motion until the
  lightning revealed him every hair on the
  horse slick with rain the mans black
  poncho like the hide of a broaching por-
  poise his black mask roughly moulding his
  features hat brim low

    on the horses flank showed the hip

brand of the
tres pinos
ranch-t p

 it was hard
to be sure of
color in that
momentary
glimpse of pal-
pitating fluctuating light but if the horse
were a buckskin it was raynors the one
chosen by him for his first string pony in
preference to his own incidentally it was
the fastest horse on the ranch

    and slim had seen something else that
  gave him fresh strength and energy to top
  the tide of relief that had come with the
  charging legion of the cattlemen-a wire
  scar half healed a triangular wound that
  was unmistakable it was raynor making
  toward the ranch

    he remembered that belle was there
  alone-save for wing the scene in owl
  canyon projected itself on the screen of
  memory belle struggling in raynors
  grasp slim to the rescue-then and now

    he felt the roans quarter give a little
  as lie wheeled him about on his hind legs

but the game and sturdy mustang leaped
to the chase in full stride that seemed
again unfaltering raynor was well away
lost in the darkness but the roan followed
a trail that his senses found though slims
could not behind them the shots and the
shouting died away as they swept round
the shoulder of a hill the rain was ceas-
ing or passing over a strong wind blew
half way to the zenith there was the mer-
est hint of a moon striving to shoulder
through the flying wrack the air was
suddenly cold and sweet and slim re-
sponded to it alert forgetful of his
wounds his loss of blood a champion go-
ing to the rescue of the girl he loved he
felt no real fear of the outcome only an
elation a confidence that he would over-
take raynor in time and shoot it out-to
raynors finish

   he did not believe that raynor thought
he was being followed any more than he
imagined he had been recognized one
faint flutter of lightning showed the fore-
man well ahead well forward in the sad-
dle using the most of the buckskins speed
he was gaining on the roan

  let out a link petey slim bent
and patted the neck that stretched out
rigid as a bar while the sound hoofs
drummed the sodden turf and the belly
broomed spray from the clumps of sage
through which they plunged

   up went the roans head with an impa-
tient movement that seemed to say i am
trying but it was plain that he was
doing his best and that it was not equal
to the pace of the buckskin it was too
far to risk one of slims two precious
shots he knew know that the bullet had
either bruised or broken one of the bones
of his left forearm it was no more good
to him than a stick to reload without
halting was impossible hard to accom-
plish with one hand under the best condi-
tions and the buckskin was drawing
away

  slims buoyancy vanished like the gas
from a punctured balloon unseen in the
night his face became gaunt and wan and
old strained lined deep while his imagina-
tion ran riot as to what the fate of belle
walsh might be at raynors reckless re-
lentless hands that night as best he knew 
how he prayed

  the roan began to falter to shorten
stride to go lame in its off hindquarter
when slim patted its neck he had felt
the wound high on the crest that first
had stung it but it was plainly hit in the
flank or the quarter like himself it had
the trouble at tres pinos

been losing blood and it was bearing his
burden straining every energy working
the great pump of its heart to the utmost

  petey you got to make it-somehow
you got to hawss god make him last

i	cant do it afoot that devil of a sledll
get her god help us git through-an
damn him

raynor felt that he had- got clear
away from the disaster that had
l engulfed his companions overtaken
the organization of the rustlers wrecked
his own plans that he had devised so cun-
ningly and given out to the members of
the night hawks

  the men he had taken with him when
he left the two on watch over the reserva-
tion shipment were by now either dead
badly wounded captured dead their
presence would damn him alive he knew
they would squeal his game was up in
caroca county but he could still sting
like a crushed hornet

  he might be able to get away with the
reservation stock-though not by deliver-
ing them to the agency for he knew the
agent there would have all the news before
he could get there he would have been
warned and offers of rewards would soon
be made for him he would have to re-
join the two and drive the cattle through
secret mesa ways to where he could sell
them that was risky but possible but
his grand coup had failed and he was an
outlaw

 walsh he hoped that walsh had
been killed and then hoped that he had
not he might still milk walsh from a
distance under threat of the penitentiary
and the gallows as for the girl-he had
meant to marry her to get possession of
the t p ranch ultimately the night
hawks organization was only a temporary
affair to him a money supplier a source
of excitement belle walsh he did not
crave from any personal physical choice
he would like to master her but he knew
he would soon tire of her girls like la
rose like la paloma were more in his
line

  there was a grudge against la rose
that would have to be let go now later
he might run across her and he would not
forget

  but belle walsh here was his im-
mediate revenge on walsh who otherwise
might slip from his clutches if he had come
out of the fight raynor had some money
at tres pinos in the mattress of his bunk
hed get that there was a bottle there as

w

well a flask of mescal strong stuff that
would put courage into a cripple quite
a little money winnings at monte from the
pigeons he plucked in the bunkhouse
games his share of raids his private steal-
ings from walsh

 damn walsh hed get even damn
the girl who flouted him and told him to
stay away from the house she was stuck
on slim marvin he was pretty sure he
had put a bullet through slim marvins
head but if he had been mistaken and slim
still lived why he would be welcome to
belle walsh-after sled was through with
her

  she would be in her room asleep wing
didnt count save that the fool chink left
the back door to the kitchen open of a night
no need to lock doors at tres pinos they
considered though he believed that walsh
locked the front door from force of habit
every night but the back would be open
and he knew the lay of the house down-
stairs he knew where the girl slept if
her door was locked-it would not matter
he would take her by fright and force
let her scream and scratch as she would-
this time

  he had no idea that he was followed
he might not have much time for what he
planned but he would have enough the
fight was still going on the cattle would
have to be rounded up again there would
be long flight and pursuit walsh would
wait to know his cattle were safe before
he came back-if he was able to

  better let the reservation stock alone he
decided the surprise attack of the cat-
tlemen showed too plainly that he had been
suspected spied upon even as he had
spied on slim working at the round-up
riding with belle he might run into a
trap he had better strike across the bor-
der

  he reached the ranch headquarters
pulled up in front of the bunkhouse and
got down from the half-blown buckskin
he did not turn on the light but crept to
his own bunk and found his cache paper
money in a compact package the flask of
mescal from which he took long gulps
gasping as the fiery stuff stung tongue
and palate and throat while its fumes
mounted to his brain

  outside again he listened fancying he
heard hoofbeats deciding it was only the
drip and splash of rain from roofs and gut-
ters

  the back door was open as he ex-
pected he crossed the kitchen feeling
his way striking some object against a pan


short stories

of rising biscuit stumbling over a chair
a door opened a voice that squeaked a
little called out

  who that that you misteh walsh

raynor tore
off his mask
its m e
wing raynor
got a message
for miss
walsh from
her brother
just rode in from little park its im-
portant

  the chinaman was plainly suspicious
he sniffed as if he smelled the fiery mescal
on raynors breath

  missy belle she in bed asleep he
said whasse mally you no give message
in moning

  she wont stay in bed when she hears
it said raynor you give it to her
wing come here and ill tell it to you
dont want to shout it all over the
house

  a little less doubtful wing switched on
the light in his room then in his spotless
kitchen entering in padded slippers to
where raynor sat on the table swinging
one leg trying to appear nonchalant
though he was chafing with the delay

  gimme a drink of water wing he
said casually

  he caught the extended left arm at the
wrist and pulled wing to him his gun
barrel fell on wings head and the china-
man crumpled up and fell like a wet rag
unconscious and bleeding raynor picked
him up easily in his arms flung him on his
own bed bound him and gagged him with
strips of cloth he found in the kitchen he
turned out the light in wings room
locked the door taking the key from the
inside and keeping it he picked up the
heavy glass that had not broken when
wing dropped it and poured into it half
of what was left in the flask swallowing
it then he hesitated and finally emptied
the pint container

  last of all he turned out the kitchen
switch and stole through the pantry into
the big living-room which was also dining-
room the stairs were to his right
through the big porch windows came a
subdued light there were gleams of pal-
lid moonlight on the porch

  raynor listened at the foot of the stairs
hearing nothing but the ticking of a clock
water dripping in the kitchen

  with the face of a grinning fiend he
commenced to climb a dim bulk that lost

  itself as he progressed little creaks of the
treads proclaiming his slow and cautious
progress at the head of the stairway he
paused again turned to the landings right
and tried the handle of a door it moved
but it would not open

  bolt or lock held him with an oath
he stepped back there was a little stir
inside the room the girls voice calling

  whos there

  raynor made no answer he took a
backward step or two and flung himself
at the panels shoulder first they gave a
hollow sound but they resisted cursing
he launched a kick with all his drunken
might something gave or started to
give and with two more kicks the lock
catch tore out its screws through the splin-
tering wood as he came through the
doorway with his leering face the room
was suddenly bright with light belle
walsh had touched a button by the bed
where she sat up from the pillows her
eyes shining bravely a gun leveled in her
hand at the intruder

  put up your hands raynor or ill
shoot she said and as he lurched for-
ward pulled trigger

  the shot went wild raynor had moved
too swiftly snatching a cushion from a
chair and jerking it in the same motion
fairly for the bed while she flung it
aside he reached  her wrested away her
weapon

  yah you an yore popgun he jeered
the girl drew the quilt about her her eyes
widening as she began to realize she was
at bay against this beast

  there was a slight scuffling sound on
the stairs it ceased raynor turned
slowly wondering whether wing could
have managed to get free a little stupid
his brain sluggish from the quantity of
strong alcohol he had taken so rapidly into
his system behind him the girl cowered
hope lightening her face that swiftly dulled
again as she saw slim his hair lank about
his forehead one side of his head bloody
blood dripping to the floor from the use-
less arm reel against the doorframe his
eyes were set his face racked with pain
and exhaustion as he strove to summon
the reserve he had already drained heav-
ily

  raynor laughed

  heres where the best man wins slim
an where you lose damn yore soul

  he fired deliberately just as a blaze
was beginning to come into slims tired
eyes belle screamed and raynor fired
the trouble at tres plftos

  again at the figure slumping to the floor

the wounded
arm was put
out as uncer-
tain prop to
the failing
knees slims
face growing
gray as the
blood drained
away behind the tan lips opening a lit-
tle shut again as the jaws clamped and
from the floor streaking upward there
came a spurt of fire-another the emp-
tied revolver clattered sliding along the
floor stopped by a rug where raynor
clutched the fringe convulsively as he
strove to rise-and could not

  slim propped himself by the door frame
his voice sound hollow as the voice of a
ghost

 got-here-in-time reckon-i-
jus made it-honey

slim blinked at the room  daylight
now and he was no longer by the
door where he had slumped when
raynors shot got him in the shoulder
the second had missed as he had fallen
or maybe he had got raynor first any
way he had got him

  same room but he was in bed in-

  someone came over from the window
and stood beside him

  good man what  got your eyes open
have you got to keep quiet doctors
orders

  slim opened a mouth that seemed some-
how rusty at the hinges moved a strangely
feeble tongue and spoke in a foolishly
weak voice

  raynor

  youre not to ask too many questions
old chap but ill tell you what youve got
to know

  you better or ill run a high fever

  im not your only nurse old chap
im just relief mealtimes youve got a
better one than i am and shes a regular
tyrant what  be on duty in a few
minutes

  raynor  you nearly put his light out
but he wasnt quite dead when the crowd
got here one chap they said was the
leader was shot through the brain

  i shot him they called him chief
he was a chap named kirk won my
money down at the cactus i recognized
his voice couldnt see his face

  it was kirk all right and that ties



  you up with another chunk of the reward
seems i bagged the third man they were
after as the jolly old ringleaders he was
dead too the chaps were a bit excited
three of our chaps got hurt besides four
or five of theirs so they took raynor
while there was some life left in him and
hung him up to the middle one of the three
pines

  none of ours killed harpers the
worst off and they say hell pull through
you remember miss baker used to
dance a bit at the cactus  she is out here
helping to nurse the boys over in the bunk-
house by the way she and i are going
to get married next month congratula-
tions in order and all that sort of rot
thanks old chap dont tire yourself by
talking you can talk to your other nurse
in about three minutes all shell jolly well
let you

  you see the reward was worded ten
thousand dollars for the apprehension of
the three main johnnies or for such infor-
mation as shall cause them to be appre-
hended something like that that makes
three thousand three hundred and thirty-
three dollars and thirty-three and one-third
cents for me and six thousand six hundred

and sixty-six-

  slim interrupted him nothing of the
kind halves or nothing our agree-
ment was to split	v
the englishman nodded

  correct mighty sporting of you just
the same we got all the cattle turned
em over next day some of them were a
bit cut up but they were all for commis-
sary and the troops didnt seem to care
walsh got the money everything is
happy and the old goose honks aloft you
know wing got a crack on the jolly old
bean thats healed up days ago though
he insists on wearing a bandage round the
cocoanut badge of honor-what 
hold on days ago whats the
idea

  nothing but the natural flight of time
it will wing old chap youve been in
bed for ten days doped up a bit most of
the time to give the patches a chance to
graft in he looked at his wrist watch
sorry but my times up shes always
punctual if she catches me talking
therell be wigs on the green thats her
prerogative from mow on youre a lucky
dog slim but you deserve it

  there were light footsteps outside and
walters placed a finger to his lips

  mums the word old chap i havent
told you a thing let her do it all over


short stories

again he nodded again and winked
slipping out of the door as a girl in crisp
white linen came in she was not a nurse
because she wore no cap and because she
broke all regulations by giving a glad cry
as she saw slims eyes open

  slim

  the kiss which was mutual was quite
spontaneous so were those that fol-
lowed

  i cant put my arms round you hon-
ey slim finally said seems neither of
em work real well a statement that
was corroborated by two fast healing per-
forations one in the left forearm and an-
other through the right shoulder enough
to have spoiled any mans shooting but a
lovers

  belle walsh responded as he wanted her
to though she protested it was against the
doctors orders for him to be excited

  excited honey if you jest knew
how rested i was specially about money
money she thought he was getting
delirious but his eyes laughed at her

  ive got nigh five thousan dollars coin-
in to me honey enough to buy into a
ranch mebbe or start one of our own

  it wouldnt have made any difference
dear she told him not to me

  slim sighed happily

  it sure would have to me now im
goin to hurry up an get well walters
tells me hes goin to get married nex
month i dont see why i should be left
out in the cold like that jest because i
happen to be sick fo a spell

  you are not to talk about anything ex-
citing if you do ill leave you

  thatll excite me mo

  ive got something that will put you to
sleep sir

  you wouldnt try to make me take
it

  would you refuse me anything
  such talk is silly to those not taking

place in it but it was eminently satisfying
to both these two

the shadow had passed from tres
pinos la rose-miss baker now
until she became mrs walters-had
got some hints from la paloma that ray-
nor had deceived walsh into thinking he
was a murderer but she declared that she
hated all gringos and would not testify to
anything definite it was wing who came
to the rescue when belle questioned him

  allee light i talk now night hawk
all gone layno him dead chinaboy
not aflaid now i speakee layno all
same makee fool of boss one time boss
get too much dlunk go along with layno

hell fight like hell i think he makee love
same way

  which recommendation may or may not
have had something to do with the finale
of this story which ends-even as it
does in the movies-in a clinch
the fadeout

by charles tenney jackson
author of mountain law the horse of hurricane reef etc

in a central american port the haunt of many exiles-

voluntary and involuntary-the spotlight kid was in a

        position to see many a drama played out before his eyes
        this time he took a part-and played the red to win

o	that is america  very good
-but what is it to me

  senor brown wiped his monocle
across the dirty sleeve of his tropic
whites and glanced superciliously
about the dirt-floored shed which was the
motion picture house of puerto amero

  spotty larue otherwise the spotlight
kid up in the projection booth sighed
patiently as he slipped the old news reel
from home back in the film can he hated
this broken adventurer brown brent
the operative of the united states depart-
ment of justice nodded silently across the
projector magazine hidden in the booth
above the main exit the two could look
down through the narrow ports at the fig-
ure of brown a suspected fugitive stand-
ing in the center aisle of the empty theater

  on the bench sat el comandante don
rafael who had watched the secret show-
ing of this last season news film and its
effect upon senor brown his jackal the
spotlight kid and brent the detective
realized that brown had acted well his
part

  spotty switched off the projection arcs
the grimy little house was lit by the moon-
light through the canvas walls and the
palm fronds touched them in the evil-smell-
ing breeze from across a sluggish jungle
river

  spotty shrugged not for nothing was

he himself an exile and an underling to
el comandante in this obscure port of
broken men but brent hadnt come for
him-his old job was forgotten not much
anyway but brown-whoever he was-
the white crowd marooned here to work
for the fruit line company would be glad
to get rid of senor alberto brown a
hopeless pest this brown

  so spotty the other derelict merely
grinned at the man trap which was being
set below him

  brown the bachcomber unshaven
dirty slightly drunk as ever arose from
the bench and touched a soiled handker-
chief delicately to his lips then looked
about at the toad-like figure of the district
comandante who grinned back at him com-
placently this nonchalant pose was quite
too evident the federal detective hidden
in the booth listened for the next satiric
comment of this senor alberto brown de-
barred from the colony club a hanger-on
of the native cantinas and a pest about the
wharves of the fruit line company

  brown was affecting his old insolence
with that absurd piece of glass at his eye

  i fail to see why i am invited here don
rafael for this private showing of a bally
american news film very intrestin no
doubt but- then the derelict stopped
reeled slightly and sat down

  he had not noticed that mrs esterly




short stories

was back of him in the dusk spotty larue
the operator up in the silent booth had
gasped in amazement when she came from
under the gallery this pink-and-white
woman from home in a film of a gown
and white shoes just as she had come from
the ball of the hotel de jos extranjeros-
what could she be to this drunken drifter
of the latin american ports

  don rafael laughed shortly the de-
partment of justice man up in the booth by
spottys projection machine glanced at the
operator meaningly down below el
comandante had arisen with an oily court-
esy to mrs esterly and senor brown
had slumped in the seat

  run the film again operator observed
el comandante

  it is unnecessary said mrs esterly
bluntly i was standing there i saw
he is not the man in the picture

  she says it well grunted the federal
detective

  brown was coming back by the center
aisle with a grave drunken dignity passing
the dainty woman with the merest glance
of disinterest the portly commandante
called after him

  ah then-senor brown  tomorrow
evening we shall run the picture the
american officers from the destroyers will

be on shore for
the dance at
the hotel we
have such little
e n t ertainment
at puerto
amero for dis-
tinguished
guests they
will be glad to see this news reel senor
brown-from america that place-the
marines in column senor-the officer
group saluting ah for a homesick man
it will be much senor

  the renegade was staring at him now
whitefaced and with fever-brilliant eyes
he stumbled as he turned and suddenly
mrs esterly stepped to him a hand to his
arm and turned defiantly upon the grinning
native official

  it is not so just a likeness don
rafael what do you mean by this 
she clung to the tall adventurer in the
soiled whites allen it is not you-no
ah-allen el comandante gestured
up to his watching operator in the booth
the name i believe of the missing amer-
ican paymaster it is sad

  he lit a cigarette the man and the

woman were passing under the booth to
the exit the spotlight kid above heard
a throbbing whisper when they were out
on the stones of the moonlit embarcadero
with the closed silent shops on one side
and the fruit line wharves along the other
by the waterside

  a broken fugitive from home nothing
unusual the kid was hardened to these
moochers who tapped you for a drink a
bed a peso but this pink-and-white
woman from the hotel with him

  brent of the department of justice was
swinging down the gallery stairs to join
don rafael spotty larue had closed the
door and was behind them

  well we might as well arrange for the
extradition papers grunted the detective
wearily he is major allen hurd of the
marines paymaster short fifteen thou-
sand in his accounts and vanished at
havana last april the races got him
if nothing else was needed this woman
gave him away who is she

  don rafael shrugged as to that he
did not care at least he was willing for
the united states operative to think so
it was enough that he got this insolent
vagabond out of his path after what hap-
pened last month when senor alberto
brown had slapped the dons mouth be-
cause of his remark concerning mrs
esterly

  shes at the bottom of it i reckon
divined the sleuth professionally women
and fast horses and the american bars in
havana looks that way she trying to
cover for him

  forget that will you murmured kid
larue theres one whos on the level
i seen em all and this pink one is right
leave her out will you

  friend of yours  queried the detective
interestedly

  the spotlight kid laughed a friend
of his-any woman of the hotel crowd
why in three years no nice girl from
home had so much as spoken to him he
just saw them afar off on the club ver-
andas or along the embarcadero or hot
nights at his little theater when he ran the
pictures which the fortnightly steamers
brought a friend of his-the outcast liv-
ing on the beach

  even the comandante laughed now at
the idea of a white girl from the states
being a friend of his jackal concerning
spotty larue of don rafaels picture
house the few white women of puerto
amero-wives of fruit company officials
or sojourners at the hotel-had long since
the fadeout

said all there was to say clerks and hus-
bands had supplied the rest

  no good hung out with the native
crowd what can one expect of a drifter
in the carib ports an exile from home
they said after slipping a knife into some
welching bookmaker in new orleans
somebody added that don rafael had
aided his getaway and in return spotty
larue had helped the don on a number of
queer profitable deals in the lotteries
and running a chink or two perhaps back
up into home-lands hundred millions
perhaps in the dons dope deals too

  quien sabe rather a pity a nice-
looking boy to have been a racetrack tout
and petty gamester and then underling for
this trafficking port tyrant don rafael
one had to give him up as the sort of an
american of whom one is not proud in an
alien land he had gone brown and the
american crowd was pleased that he had
the good taste at least to admit it and
keep away from them which spotty was
pleased to do self-exile had become quite
profitable this last year-chink-running
and all

  why tonight he was grinning blithely
behind this perspiring detectives back at
the joke of it brent on his man-hunt for
tlie defaulting paymaster of marines
major hurd who had masqueraded as
albert brown one-time captain of anzacs
overseas and a remittance man in puerto
atnero temporarily stranded no one had
cared enough about senor brown to guess
at his mystery as he slipped down from
respectability to the beach until he had
his drunken row with el comandante in
dulas barroom

  particularly had senor alberto brown
annoyed spotty larue when he had joined
the renegade white crowd of puerto
amero brown had not concealed his
contempt for the comandantes underling
and spotty had dragged senor brown
drunk and reviling him out of the cantinas
got him to bed in his shack at a native boat-
mans place nursed and cared for and
cursed the fellow and got only satiric con-
descension in return

  and but one thing stuck in spottys craw
-just one he knew brown was ameri-
can all right the monocle the drooping
anglicized mustache the drawling speech
-bunk grumbled spotty id stand
tor everything except him bawlin out my
pictures the news reel film from home
his land-and mine ill bust him one
some night when he gets fresh whats
eatin him



  and so tonight when don rafael had
lured the gentleman-pest of the cantinas

into the empty
theater and a
united states
secret service
man had ar-
rived from
new orleans
by the same
steamer which
brought the
f o r t n i g htly
films spotty
felt relieved brown was going to get just
what was coming to him and by the
news reels from home which he had de-
spised don rafael had happened to see
that old news reel in havana which first
betrayed the vanished major allen hurd
and the don had communicated with the
american authorities big joke on senor
brown who had derided the picture news
from home when the spotlight kid
caught the drift of the game he grinned
wickedly more than that joyously and
defiantly why should he care for this
drunken ill-humored outcast yank or
briton greaser or canuck whom the long
arm of justice was reaching for or for
his boss of the moment don rafael calles
the law and the censor of puerto amero 

  inside the kids silk shirt was fifteen
thousand in good notes--the secret share
of his pickings in various grafts-and in
the stream that good white ship bound for
home if the don had ever dreamed that
his jackal had saved his loot he would have
gone to jail on some trumped-up charge or
to the river strange things happen to
-friendless white men in the jungle ports
who live outside the pale of their breed

  the lotteries and the little wheel spin-
ning every night at dulas-who could
guess at the secret strength which withheld
the gambling kid from these chances so
that he could lug his bankroll home and
lose it at latonia

   home with its greatness and its follies
how he had hungered every fortnight
when the news reel came along with the
program picture the kid hated art and
despised drama a centuryof society or
westerns couldnt give him a kick

  but when the magic of the news reels
leaped out in his dirty little theater with
the palm fronds flicking the wall out would
come the kids sweaty face past his pro-
jector

  luv o mike oh you pore hog-tied
spigs you dont know-but you white folks


short stories

our

down there why dont you yell
tierra our land-

  the few fever-silent and cynical whites
and the stolid peons couldnt hear him for
the whir of his machine and hed sink back
cursing them didnt it mean anything to
em

  a thousand feet of home and yester-
day here in this alien sticky heat and
smells

  men who had died women who would
never smile again buildings that had
crumbled

  why take tonight now this strange
affair of senor brown and the dick whod
come to get him

  there had flashed out broadway and a
golden tower above the blessed traffic
murk minnesota and the leap of a ski
champion above the piney snow a texas
rodeo a mob of beauty contest girls at
atlantic city-and then por el amor de
dios the flash of thoroughbreds past the
wire at lexington

  oh to be young and live it all again
home-with a bank-roll too an owner
of a string perhaps the college clothes

and all swing-
ing past the
grandstand
where the girls
were a glory of
silks and sun-
shine  and the
betting ring in a
roar when the favorite broke the tape

  it was worth loneliness and heat and
exile saving skimping grafting on his
crooked employer pinching a bad peso
here and a good one there nothing worth
while in living except that dream of going
back and meantime his little pictures
theyd kept him straight to the white
breed those flicking phantoms of the
u s a kept him from going as this
cynic renegade senor brown was going to
the last degradation fever drink despair

  he hated brown brown sneering at
his little pictures brown whom he
dragged out of the muck and loaned shirts
to no decent white man in puerto
amero would help brown brown had
cursed them at the club and reviled them
at the hotel and gone his swift descent a
stretch at atlanta would do him good the
kid was thinking now as he listened to
brent

  naturally i could not recognize him
in that picture of the marines a lot of
difference senor between a clean up-
standing american officer at salute when

the flag goes by and a bum like this brown
got a mustache now too sure about it
eh

  don rafael smirked before the operative
from washington

  ah there is no doubt in havana in
the theater of my friend heintzmann who
distributes to us senor i stood by some
american officers when this reel was
shown they stared they whispered
major hurd said one poor old allen
commented another wrong in the ser-
vice lamented a third i enquired senor
brent ah there with them at quantico
was our fine drunk gentleman-pest when
he first came here you would have seen him
so when he insulted me senor over the
senora esterly

  she knew him tonight all right called
him allen but how did you persuade her
to come and look at the picture

  who murmured don rafael can
tell about a woman  she thought she
could help-or she feared who knows
and the american officers will identify
him tomorrow night you will guard that
news reel of the marines eh

  si si the spotlight kid yawned they
didnt know he was to vanish tonight
fading away out of this rotten hole for-
ever fifteen grand-and health and spirit
youth and humor all saved to stage that
grand comeback when the winter racing
opened-home

  si si it made him grin his bank-
roll in his shirt his knife at his belt and
that white ship waiting for the ebb-tide at
dawn from where the three stood on the
silent embarcadero he could see the lights
of the american destroyer squadron an-
chored calling in homeward bound from
panama

  tomorrow the kid would just be faded
out of the picture in this fever hole that
crooked bookie whom he knifed in new
orleans-well three years is a long time
if he got well it didnt hurt him now and
if he had died it didnt hurt him at all

  this broken officer would fade out too
only differently well life is a wheel
and the little ball spins and drops-on the
yellow black or red the long shot noses
past the field and you cash your ticket

  he left the department of justice man
and the comandante when they turned into
the colony club grounds and sauntered
past the fruit line wharf toward that rag-
ged little shack where he boarded with old
lua here lived also the pretty mestiza
girl rosita they didnt know he was
leaving either theyd miss him his jokes
the fadeout



and cheeriness still theyd forget too
a brown one or a pink one-you fade out
of the picture and they soon forget you

  hed get his packed bag and old joe
the boatman would slip him out to that
fruit line ship mooney the purser was
expecting him mooney would owe the
kid a hundred when he slid over the rail
mooney bet him that two years ago that
hed never save his money and get away-
clean mooneyd be surprised at spotty
larues being able to come back in this
rotten hole when everything white was
against you

  mooney just didnt know about the phan-
toms of home flashing by spottys eyes
week after week the long exile through

  the spotlight kid swung on the wharf-
piling a moment to watch the moonwash
on the river sort of dreaming he just
forgot for a time that this was the last
night of this piking business for him go-
ing to be a man now who could flash a roll
on the mob an owner with a string of
bangtails at the tracks his hand waving
cheerily to the girls in the stand the
light of his smile up to a pink-and-white
one somebody like this pretty little
widda whod been hanging around the
hotel

  the kid came to suddenly for he knew
she had come before him mrs esterly in
her filmy gown she spoke with quiet di-
rection as if shed known him a long time
instead of being the only white woman who
had said his name in two years

 spotty youre american arent you
i was they gave me the gate-but
im cornin back

  he grinned and slid off the post she
stepped nearer and seemed wondering how
anyone could be blithe in this fever hole
and exile so pink and white and per-
fumed-as if she had come out of one of
his pictures

  i tried to get in your picture house
spotty its locked but i saw you out here
i want to destroy that film-the one that
has the marines and senor brown

  a-friend of yours

  yes she answered evenly major
hurd-he is there his brother officers

their eyes he cant stand it it will be
the last blow drink and despair are bad
enough but his good friends of the ser-
vice seeing him down and out-

  hes never seemed to care a damn
murmured spotty
watching her hungrily
a girl from home-a
pink-and-white one

  oh you dont know

sitive and you-he
said tonight of all the
men here youd been the
only one swho ever tried
to help him

from killing himself long before i came
and found him you and your pictures
p or el amor de dios my pictures

  i know she looked gravely at him
but if you could just see it was his
home too he was trying to make you
all think he was a foreigner-an austral-
ian he-every little flash of america
hurt him so like a stab of a knife
spotty like-like-fingers pointing at
him accusing tonight with all his sar-
casm and jeering hes crushed every-

  the kid watched her in the moonlight
oh if a guy had a girl like this one to
follow in his downfall to plead for him
well there was only one bet-she must
care a lot the kid almost grumbled

her to think that she was his just like

and cheery and that barroom derelict-

he couldnt come back-

gan suddenly you and mell breeze

embarcadero outside the theater ill

a bad hombre i never saw him sober so
i dont know then suppose we shanghai

dicks can arrange their papers

  if we only could oh spotty-you

  you and me spotty waved his hand
to her on the embarcadero say a girl
from home and her tears falling but
hed made her smile why this pest friend
of hers-they would get him away give
him his chance somewhere then-well
who knew  some sunny afternoon spotty
might see this little widda in the grand-
stand and wave to her him in his college
clothes and all an owner with a string
of nags and mrs esterly would remember
that spotty had done the right thing for
her friend down in that rotten hole when
he got to the dark little theater spotty knew
he was crazy about her a pink one from
home well play the pink to win

  he turned upon the embarcadero white
and silent under the palm shadows from
the plaza to the fruit line wharves where
the river glittered opening to the carib
sea but under the grimy whitewashed
marquee of his theater the kid halted
the wide doors were open a cigar glowed
within and as the spotlight kid stared
over the dim rows of benches he saw the
leap of phantom figures to the screen

  he ran within and whirled to look up
through the port came the dancing spot-
light and beyond he saw the yellow broad
face f the owner don rafael by the
whirring magazines

  the kids glance went to the empty
benches there half-way down sat brent
of the united states department of justice

   the secret service man turned as spotty
 reached him

   oh you-the operator the don and
  running this thing again i want to spot
 that man surer going to study his face
 want the fleet officers tomorrow to point
 to him with absolute identification then
 turn this senor brown up for them he
 cant get away anywhere even if he knows
 i want him

   no grunted spotty not a chance
 to the jungle

   he looked back uncertainly at the door
 mrs esterly would come but no chance
 to steal that film can now fate had
 tricked them play the yellow to win

   the kid stood staring at his screen it
 was glowing now with home the news
 reel and first there flashed out an apple
 orchard of yakima with the busy pickers
 a new england girl with her prize
 thanksgiving turkey a dirty coal carrier
 locking down the soo a bunch of con-
 gressmen investigating a steal broadway

 the atlantic city
 bathing beau-
 ties the texas
 rodeo and min-
 nesota snows
 the satin-skinned
 t h o r oughbreds
 passing the wire
 at lexington-
 and then the
 k i d muttered
 here they come
 -the gobs and leathernecks

   but they heard another voice behind
 them and brent turned with him

   so that is america

   the tall adventurer in the dirty whites
 stood in the aisle adjusting his monocle
 the light from the curtain reflected on his
 white gaunt face he came on a step and
  now spotty saw that mrs esterly clung
 to his shoulder as the two passed she
 whispered

   he followed me i had him at my
 rooms and he wouldnt stay-

   senor brown swaggered past as if he
 did not know that kid larue and the
 detective were there down until his sil-
 houette obscured the margin of the pic-
 ture the woman was pleading and
 senor brown reeled a bit

   hell flop muttered spotty riding
 on the end of his nerve then he swung
 up and back to the booth stairs the
 yellow-faced comandante grinned evilly
 when the kid burst into the room
the fadeout	

  what the hell you doin im the op-
erator here-

   the owner can run a reel can he not 
spotty dashed to the side port he saw
the three brent slumped in his seat
senor brown gaunt and feverish pointing
at the screen mrs esterly sobbing on a
bench before him

  for there was no mistaking what was
to come the derelict of the beach was
holding forth the naked wreck of honor

   he would evade no more fight no more
deny nothing a defaulting american
officer flaying himself with a grand ges-
ture of cruelty he would punish himself
with a last agony

  and then came the merciless magic for
which they waited

  a winter road and distant barracks a
flag so tiny that one could not make it out
and then a column of men swinging on
growing to gigantic stature devil-dogs in
full kit leathery necks and hobnails slog-
ging the frozen dirt swinging on to pass
a group of officers at the roadside

   and the flag was going by the officer
group was snapping to salute a winter
sky a sky of home-you could almost
make out the features of the gray clean
silent phantoms

  the spotlight kid was staring down
brent had leaned forward in his seat mrs
esterlys eyes were turned upward to senor
brown who had come before the screen

   for he was saluting with a terrible grav-
ity as if to the man who had been and
now was not honor there clear-eyed
alert honor of an american officer his
honor now a ghost fading away from
the picture his own shadow huge gro-
tesque wavering was blotting those fine
phantoms his hand raised again in sal-
ute-then they heard a cry

  mrs esterly was springing toward his
side

  the kid could not see well what was
happening but don rafael suddenly
laughed across the snapping spotlight be-
hind the moving celluloid

   this is very good it saves the trouble
and he is out of my way-and the senoras
muchacho he is shooting himself-

   a pistol cracked down in the body of the
theater

   spotty whirled to face the comandante
he just heard the satisfied laughter as the
don turned toward the control switch
heard and turned himself from the stair-
way where he had started
the yellow to win

  down midway in the dim theater brent
  cio

of the secret service sprang up as the
ghosts of home and yesterday vanished
from the screen he dashed back toward
the stairs and up for it appeared as if a
million demons were swarming through
the narrow projection ports of the booth
they were erupting searing light brent
thought once he saw struggling figures over
a machine upon which were descending
swiftly exploding circlets of celluloid

  he fought to open the door which
seemed locked then it burst wide and
a figure hurled itself into him knocking
him down the stairway someone who
smelled of scorching flesh and cloth and
who was choking in the deadly fumes of
burning gun cotton and camphor com-
pound

  out o here gasped the spotlight kid
this dump is gone you cant live in
that stuff the comandante-he fired
the film somehow oughtnt ever touched
those magazines-and there goes a bad
man gone good

  he leaped over brent and ran forward
down the aisle the dick got up gasped
and retreated before the inferno of the
burning projection booth a man could
not breathe on the stairs

  kid larue had dashed to mrs esterlys
side then he stopped faltering senor
brown tall and gaunt stood quietly watch-
ing the fire above the main exit

  why say the kid turned to her
didnt he-

  i jerked his arm down he was mad
with fever and tried-

  spotty pointed at the screen cloth
major i see what you hit that hole
would fit into a barrack wall about two
thousand miles north of swan island wire-
less station wide shootin major come
on this gasll get you oh my little thea-
ter 

  he hurried them around behind the
screen and out to the moon-flickering palms
along the embarcadero then across its
dust to the wharves of the fruit line the
derelict soldier of misfortune muttered
when the kid dragged him near the waters
edge between two galvanized metal ware-
houses somewhere came shouts and a
gleam of red fire across the road

  el comandante whispered mrs es-
terly staring back

  never mind therell be a mob of
spigs from the police hotfootin in soon
and mrs esterly this major hurd has
got to go on the fruit liner see

  he cant oh spotty i told you why
short stories



  sure he can ill fix it with mooney

  and s o  e d a d
  joe is waiting
  now with his
  skiff right under

-	this wharf beat

      ss-m it

  the tall man steadied to a grim dignity
old chap i thank you but really you
know-

  oh drop that line with me major
muttered the kid tiredly your pal the
little widda here has put me next

  mrs esterly laughedstrangely staring
at spotty oh you dont know yet
he caiit go without repaying the money
he lost but if we only could beat that
detective out with it oh allen would
come back-wed fight up in civil life he
would-id help him so

  the spotlight kid began to stammer
again to his pink lady

 we you mrs esterly-

  im not mrs esterly im mrs hurd
his wife spotty i learned he was down
here a month ago i followed-to help-
to try and save him spotty nobody

knows at the hotel only you-

  the kid looked quietly at her he
hated art and despised drama give him
the real stuff from life he watched the
tall man who shivered weakly with the
drink fever and despair his restless eyes
fixed on those far destroyer lights where
honor and cleanness were in safe keeping
the kid turned from him to the woman
and sighed after some brief thought

  oh well no i didnt guess must
have been in kind of a dream only i
thought you were a widda and someday-
well i thought maybe id see you-home
youd be up in the stand and id own a
fast one wed watch the goat scamper
past carryin the jack oh well-no mas-
ter mrs hurd

  she hardly knew what he was saying
for she was trying to still a sudden pitiful
tremor of the broken man she loved

  the kid blinked at the two she must
he grand this pink one from home her
arms now about the derelict as if her
faith her love could save a man after all

  no no esther hurd was whisper-
ing i cant go back but he began to
sob strangely with her as if something
had broken past his cynical stubbornness
mid savage hopelessness a man must
have fine honor to be so crushed at the
stains upon it

  hurd staggered from her caresses a
moment his hand out to the younger man

   spotty old chap tcant begin fo tell
you-what you meant to me-you and your
pictures you said it boy-our land but
i cant go back the officer cant take me
perhaps but i wouldnt anyhow

   spotty pressed his hand and dropped it
he turned to mrs hurd now you see
that ship you two hop it passports i
got the grandest in the world a hundred
of em with the mugs of a dozen presidents
on em show em to mooney-and turn
em in at washington fifteen grand-
uncle sammyd laugh his head off if he
knew some ramblin gamblin wreck o
fortune turned the stuff back for him
she failed to understand even when
spotty slipped his leather to major hurds
nerveless hand then spotty you
mean-to send us home

  tell mooney to fix it and say pay
that boy a hundred for me he bet me
a century id never do my comeback he
wins

  the old boatman awaiting spotty larue
had poled- his skiff to the landing ladder
hurds gaunt face watched it for an in-
stant and then when he tried to speak he
suddenly collapsed the kid caught him
and lowered him to the thwarts then
shoved the bankroll within his inside
pocket

   thats good saves a lot of fool talk
mooney put him to bed goodby mrs
-hurd

  oh spotty we couldnt and that
detective-

  im gamblin again that dick wont
get a boat out o here in two weeks by
that time the major and you have fixed
that account in washington all to the
jake then you say

  she was half-way down the ladder and
staring back up at him the spotlight
kid was laughing softly blithely listen
 this stuff wouldnt do me any good im
a gamblin fool back home the gamed
get it all in a month but im backin you
-and him-to win

  spotty you mean it and oh come
home some day-to us well pay you
back sometime-when weve fought up
again

   all right sure out of your first mil-
lion-

  and because he was laughing again-at
himself but she thought it was at her-
she turned a hurt quivering face up to
him

  his pink-and-white one was in tears
and the kid knelt on the wharf as she
the fadeout

i

stood on the ladder below him he put
his hand under her chin and gently lifted
her eyes to the moonlight

  just once all my goodlookin janes
from home have faded out of the picture
-for me so i just want to look at you
once more-close up thats all

  he watched old soledad joes skiff fade
into the moonwash

  he still sat on the wharf piling when
dawn came over the misty carib sea the
white fruit line ship had slipped out on
the ebb and was turning north past the far
twinkling lights of the destroyers to-
morrow they too would be homeward
bound

  someone came across the wharf planks
behind spotty and grunted tiredly brent
looked weary and disgusted

  why say-operator i told those damn
flapfoot soldados that been diggin in the
ashes that you must have gone with the
comandante they found him twisted to
an ash in the melted gear of that picture
machine

  well you know those magazines had
five thousand feet of celluloid in em
theres nothing burns faster except nitro
what happened to his niblets anyhow 
he fell on the arc did he and tangled the
film back into it

  say youre a good guesser spotty
smiled slowly don rafael flopped-must
have got something wrong with his-heart

funny aint it
many a time i
told him to let
my machine
alone

  the washing-
ton man watched
him reflectively
say bo did i
ever see you be-
fore  around
the tracks or the
training camps i recall some job in new

orleans when a bookie got nicked with a
knife the rail bird that did it just faded
away-

  the spotlight kid laughed again this
reminded him apparently

  he climbed off the piling and walked
away from the detective to the end of the
wharf he took his clasp knife from its
sheath and examined the point attentively
then wiped it on a shred of cocoanut husk
then he swung his arm back and pitched
a fast one out over the surf-line toward
the white ship homeward-bound really
what he threw had a fadeaway when it
hit the water and it made him remember
that this month the yankees would start
spring training at san antone

  and in april the fast ones would be
shipping to the northern circuits to condi-
tion for the big summer racing

  oh my little theater he came back
grinning to the secret service man if i
only had my little theater back some of
these hot nights sometime id see babe
lean against a fast one

  you must like it down here in this
hole mumbled brent now this senor
brown hiding out-i can understand him
but a live bird like you and there aint a
game you could get into here except the
roulette at dulas dont you ever think
of pinching a roll and blowing home
who-me the spotlight kids blue
eyes widened humorously why im no
gamblin man  this senor brown even
he gypped me and you too hell cash
a ticket he owes at washington and then-
the devil you say yelled brent
hows that

  i won-on the red murmured spotty
but he won-on the pink i reckon the
game was fixed against me well therell
be fast ones and pink ones long after you
and me have faded out of the picture i
wonder if i could beat that dirty tramp
freighter down to rio  peelin the spuds
or something

chapter i

the time and the place

mcpacken was not much of
a name for a town but it
was the name of that town
doubtless it was good enough
for what it designated for
there is no question that there was a cer-
tain dry-salt substantiality in the sound
suggestive of corned beef and cabbage
with such concomitant comforts as rail-
roaders especially favor and road-weary
men of the range swing down from dusty
saddles to enjoy

  the town lay close by the sprawling ar-
kansas river colloquially called the ar-
kansaw at a point where the santa fe
trail of earlier days crossed that stream of
deceptive shallows and wide-spreading
bars of silt-white sand now another
santa fe trail ran past its door a trail
wood-girded and steel-bound whose roar-
ing caravans made echoes among its

planked buildings trailing scents of allur-
ing opulence out of their precious freight
rushing eastward from the orange groves
of distant california

  other scents true streamed from less
romantic trains which jolted and thumped
through the town with shrieking flange on
curve grinding brakeshoe against laboring
wheel scents of an industry to which men
one knew and met on the street laid their
hands home-binding intimate smells such
as only cattle trains leave after them to
speak of another sort of opulence truly
occidental for mcpacken was a town
that had been established on cattle and
grown on cattle and filled its stores and
banks and homes and barber shops on cat-
tle from the very time that it welcomed
the first dusty herd from texas to its
pens

  mcpacken had lived and done well on
the distinction of being the last loading-
point to which texas cattle were driven
into kansas for shipment to eastern mar-

 
the cow jerry

kets it had not been permitted to boast
long of this peculiar favor of changing
conditions the day of the texas cattle-
men who brought their beef to the north-
ern shipping-points on foot across a thou-
sand miles of dusty trails foraging them
on the country as they passed had come
to an end shortly after the founding of
mcpacken on the arkansas the rail-
roads had gone to texas after the cattle-
mens business and the business of others
along the way contrary to the expecta-
tions of everybody the town did not die
with the passing of the last driven herd

  texas cattle had been brought to kan-
sas to fatten on its peculiarly succulent
grass for many years before mcpacken
and the railroad upon which it lay graced
that illimitable land mcpacken was a dot
in the very center of the richest grazing
country chance had put it down at a place
where each succeeding change seemed only
to work its profit and contribute to its
strength where herds formerly came to
be loaded into trains they arrived now on
board of trains to be dispersed among a
hardy set of business adventurers known
as feeders these cattle were pastured
along the broad river valley and brought
to perfection for the butchers block on
their day they were driven again to mc-
packen loaded and shipped their going
and coming their stay between all leaving
an accretion of profit in the town

  that was the reason for mcpacken and
that was the way it grew all that was

not so very long
ago as time runs
under the bridg-
es along the ar-
kansas there
are men still
stumping
around who
rode after those
long-h o r n e d
herds of strang-
ers from the nueces as young chaps able
yet to take car of a mans ration of steak
with their own teeth some of them have
foreheads extending to their crowns by
now many are grizzled and whiskered
and galled by the saddle of time but most
of them are going strong measured by
events it was a long time ago for things
move fast along the arkansas counted
back by leap-years not far

  at the time this parting in the pages of
mcpackens history is made the town was
rt its greatest consequence and prosperity
as a center of the native and imported cat-



tie industry it was the hub of a wide
sweep of open range into which only a
few daring adventurers had pushed for-
ward with fence and plow these home-
steads were mainly along the river the oc-
cupants of them looked upon with a curi-
ous questioning interest not wholly un-
sympathetic as people who lent themselves
to some heroic but misguided experimen-
tation out of which little good to them-
selves or humanity at large could come

  this was the attitude toward all agri-
cultural adventurers in the valley of the
arkansas at that time shared by cattle-
men and town dwellers alike there was
no hostility no unfriendliness every-
body would have been glad to see them suc-
ceed but nobody expected them to do so
their low sod houses were lonely markers
to the cowboys who rode from distant
ranges to mcpacken their struggles with
oxen and lank teams against the tenacious
sod a never-ending source of mild enter-
tainment for those rovers of the prairies
who twisted in their saddles to look back
as they galloped on to the towns de-
light

  agriculture it will be seen then did
not contribute anything of consequence to
the prosperity of mcpacken in those days
the little which the people who followed
that industry bought and sold in the town
would not have been missed if it had been
withdrawn entirely for mcpacken did not
look to the earth for its supplies it was
a place that lived out of tin cans and bot-
tles and threw them down in the back yard
when it had emptied them

  the railroad had established a division
point there with shops for emergency re-
pairs to cars and engines a roundhouse
for stabling and grooming the steeds of
the iron trail and a system of water-works
to serve these various enterprises all of
this with the smoke and noise gave the
place a comfortably progressive atmos-
phere in addition to adding to its citizen-
ship many artisans trainmen engine wip-
ers and subsidiary attendants upon the
aristocracy of railroad life

  there was the river the railroad along
its shore where cottonwoods laced with
wild grapevines made green refreshment
for eyes weary of summer heat glimmer-
ing over vast prairie lands beyond the
railroad mcpacken the town seemed to
empty upon the railroad as one river emp-
ties into another its principal street hold-
ing the little red depot like an island in
its mouth one stood on the station plat-
form and looked upon all the consequence
short stories



of mcpacken which was no doubt much
greater than it appeared

  beer kegs lay heaped in pyramidal pile
on this platform at all times if not empty
ones waiting a train full ones waiting a
wagon this pile of kegs seemed to be a
proclamation to all who arrived or lin-
gered or passed by of the towns defiance
its aloofness in its wickedness from appli-
cation of the commonwealths laws

  yet this was a wickedness of sullen de-
fiance rather than one of lurid depravity
a wickedness that bribed county officials
with the left hand while it dispensed beer
with the right practice common to kan-
sas towns of that time taking mcpacken
all over it was not a bad town for its fron-
tier situation it had all the material but
never made much of its opportunity

  between the railroad and the beginning
of town there was a wide strip of unoccu-
pied land owned jointly by mcpacken the
county and the company as that princi-
pal institution of the country was called
here the county highway entered mc-
packen from the west a road that ran
past the small sod houses and stubborn
farms and lost itself finally in the trails
which split from the ends of it like rav-
elled strands of a lariat it was a dusty
trampled gray stretch of beaten ground
with hitching-racks along the sides of the
buildings which stood at the beginning of
the principal thoroughfare prominent
on the corner of this trampled common the
cottonwood hotel stood and in front of
the hotel the place which concerned itself
with beer kegs and defied the sovereign
state

  that was the beginning of mcpacken
as one saw it from the railroad station the
hotel on the left the saloon on the right
there were two cottonwood trees of con-
siderable girth and spread of limb in front
of the hotel a pump and watering trough
for horses between them here the side-
walk was double width part of it being
the hotel veranda covered by a wooden
awning to the curb

  two benches fixed solidly against the
wall flanked the door of the hotel offer-
ing accommodations for no fewer than
twenty loafers at certain hours of the
day these were filled especially at eve-
ning when the railroaders day was done
and the withdrawing sun left it cool and
pleasant there then angus valorous
macdougal night clerk dish washer po-
tato parer and waiter in a pinch appeared
with sprinkling can gave the sidewalk
planks a wetting down leaving behind him

a pleasant odor of allayed dust remini-
scent of a shower

  at such hour the railroaders and chance
guests from the range planted their chairs
in the street and cocked back with feet on
the sidewalk edge where they viewed at
pleasure the passing life of mcpacken
that was the original motion picture enter-
tainment very popular in its day in kan-
sas towns and other towns a great deal
bigger than mcpacken

  at the hour of this opening scene in
mcpacken and on the veranda of the cot-
tonwood hotel there was very little wit
and wisdom being discharged anywhere
along the length and breadth of santa fe
street as the main avenue was called it
was mid-afternoon of a withering hot
summer day heat danced and wavered
over the unpaved street glimmered in dis-
torting vexation above rails and ballast
roadbed there was a smell of jimson
weed and fennel and oil from the rail-
road spiced with invigorating nip of cot-
tonwood leaves like bitters in an insipid
drink

  the sound of hammering came out of
the railroad yards
where orrin smith
the section boss
was working his
gang of terriers
putting in a switch
it was a deep
whirring musical
note that of sledge
on rail as some
sweating jerry labored to bend the stub-
born metal for the curve of the lead yet
subdued in that summer furnace that vacu-
um of heat about which nature did not
appear to concern itself at all not even
with a zephyr strong enough to turn a
feather in the road

  two figures enlivened the somnolent
front of the cottonwood hotel this drowsy
hour side by side upon one of the benches
flanking the open door even a stranger
would have known by her bearing of
authority that the woman was the boss of
that concern and that no man was boss of
her

  julia cowgill was a quick and eager
woman rather meagre of frame and tall
with a persistent prettiness in her gaunt
face gray was stealing away her black
hair and she took no pains to hide the
peculation there was a look of alert-
ness and searching in her face as if she
lived a continual quest for something
some said it was money there were more
jkindly souls who believed it was only rest

  the man beside her was not much of an
example as men go although he had a per-
sonality that generally drew a second look
especially when he spoke he was a small
man wearing a sandy little mustache with
a sharp little nose that seemed to have been
pinched while in a plastic state his head
was broad somewhat flat on top well
suited to the long line of parting and the
cowlick that he had trained into his abund-
ant black locks a flowing crepe necktie
adorned the low collar of his broad-striped
shirt the glory of which was not shadowed
by either coat or vest

  there was a rich note in his voice that
suggested a song laughter seemed to lie
so near the surface of him that he had only
to open his mouth for it to appear in his
eyes for banjo gibson was a man who
looked at life as a sort of one-sided joke
and humanity as an arrangement of comi-
cal figures paraded for his diversion there
was nothing much in him but a laugh

  im glad to see you back again ban-
jo mrs cowgill said i said to goosie
last night when i heard you talkin to an-
gus thats banjo gibson ill bet any-
thing thats banjo gibson if i hadnt
been so tired id a slipped on something
and come down

  just as well you didnt pleased as id
a been to see you i know how it is here
at the hotel-your days like a rubber sack
the more you put in it the longer it
stretches

  yes its so long and such worthless
help in the dining-room i had a girl out
from hutchinson-she flew up and quit
me in the middle of supper yesterday be-
cause bill connor got fresh well she
said he did i dont believe it

  little old bill i remember him well
they tell me hes got a run now 

  yes hes makin regular money him
and goosie theyre engaged goosie she
was so put out over what the little freckled
flip-tail said about bill i looked for her to
throw his ring in his soup

  some peoples born to make trouble
said banjo with discreet mental reserva-
tion bearing on bill connors behavior
toward the new girl

  i wish i could put a man in but them
railroaders wouldnt stand for a man
they seem to think biscuit-shootin is
stricly a ladys job

  it aint a mans job banjo declared
with feeling though i had to come down
to it while i was gone it was after that
quack shook me up in cheyenne



you mean to tell me you waited table
banjo

  if youd a happened through chadron
out in the sandhills of newbrasky about a
year ago youd a seen a feller back of the
pie counter in the railroad eatin house
youd a thought was runnin me a purty
tight race for good looks

  id like to a seen you workin at that
job mrs cowgill said the light of her
toil-harried spirit in her eyes a little smile
showing at the corners of her large thin
mouth

  im thankful we was both spared the
sight banjo said with a deep sigh for a
shame lived down if not forgotten i
worked nights and that helped some hand-
in out slam sangwiches and coffee to the
passengers that rushed the counter after
the last train we fed passed through i
didnt have anything to do but stand out
pie ready for the freight crews it wasnt
much work only the blowin was hard on
a mans lungs

  blowin  she repeated severely in her
way of putting a fresh guy in his place
what do you mean blowin to cool
the pie

  no maam i mean dust thats what i
mean thats the sandiest land in crea-
tion the wind blows so steady and hard
you can lean up agin it and go to sleep
they do right along up there in that coun-
try

  oh you get out ive heard the same
thing said of kansas but i never saw any-
thing do it but a horse

  banjo laughed a little more out of po-
liteness than humor nobody likes to
have a spike put in his joke

  i used to parade up and down before
them six pieces of pie he said blowin
off the sand believe me or not that aint
no lie i never found any other way to
keep them cuts of pie clean and eatable

  sprinklin tobacker juice over em
said she

  i used to blow till i was blue in the
face said banjo but looked up to find
mrs cowgill was not so much as smiling
she was looking down the track where
orrin smith was herding his jerries put-
ting in the switch sharp alertness bend-
ing her nice eyebrows together in a bunch

  youre the beatinest man banjo she
said but there was little praise less en-
couragement in her tone for a man of
humor such as banjo gibson home from
his adventures afar a woman was cross-
ing the railroad beyond smiths gang
mrs cowgills interest was there

cthe cow jerry
          ii
short stories



  where did you go from there she
inquired the woman having passed out of
sight leaving at least a divided portion of
mrs cowgills interest behind

  i rambled back to wyoming i had a
lot of good friends in wyoming theyre
the dancinest crowd
of people up there
you ever saw kep me
fiddlin till i nearly
forgot how to pick a
banjo at all but plac-
es are so darned far
apart in that country
it wears a man out travelin around i
never would a been able to make it
around to all of em if a feller hadnt made
me a gift of a horse one of them little
pinto horses with spots on him the kind
they call a calico horse back in missouri

  you must a stood well with them
banjo

  yes i picked up more money there
than i ever made before in my life and i
guess i could a married one of them cow-
girls and settled down if id a cared
enough about any of em to take a chance
theyre too big and wild for me im here
to say they sling a mans heels off of the
floor when they swing and slap him to
sleep if he gives em any slack i like a
girl my armll reach around and i like
em that can take a joke

  banjo looked rueful his tone was in-
dignantly resentful

  it might a been better for you banjo
if youd stayed up in that country and
settled down on a ranch

  maybe i would if they hadnt got to
shootin the country up the way theyre
doin youve read in the papers about
that rustlers war theyre havin there i
guess  darn reckless the way theyre
slingin lead around

  i heard some of the boys talkin about
it the other night they said them wy-
oming cowmen had sent out word to all
the limber-jims on the range to come up
there i dont know how true it is but
there was a cowhand in here from the
cimarron yesterday on his way to abilene
headin for cheyenne thats what some
of the boys said i guess its gettin too
peaceable and quiet in this country for
some people

  ill take mine where a man can ride
along the road at night with his girl with-
out a swarm of bullets clippin his hair
banjo said his deep voice vibrant with the
moving memories of past perils theyd
a put a bullet through my fiddle if id a

stayed in that country feller did slam
one through my banjo-head one night when
i was seein a lady home from a dance
he said it was a mistake lot of good
his pologizin d a done me if that bul-
letd a went through my gizzard i left
there after that

  i dont believe theres been a shootin
here since you went away mrs cowgill
said reminiscently yes i guess there
was too some drunken cowhands killed a
man that worked on a travelin paint gang
but none of em didnt amount to any-
thing

  no man dont amount to much when
hes got a hole drilled through his bellus
banjo sighed

  theres that woman again said mrs
cowgill her voice sharp with resentful
suspicion

  maam banjo inquired looking at
her in startled surprise

  up the street just cornin out of the
racket store shes been runnin all over
town today-she came in on nine this
morning id like to know what shes up
to flippin around that way

  one might have gathered from mrs
cowgills hostile attitude that other women
had come to mcpacken in days past and
flipped around to the public detriment and
mrs cowgills own personal embarrass-
ment  and that she resented virtuously
such invasion mainly if not entirely on
account of the stranger going about her
mysterious business without first coming
to the cottonwood hotel which was a
piece of unpardonable impertinence

  i see her said banjo shes a
peach

  she may be a punkin for all you know
mrs cowgill rebuked him scornfully she
bore down on him hard as if banjo gib-
sons erring judgment in the appraisal of
ladies was a thing of notorious public
cognizance a mockery and a merry jest

  um-m-m-m said banjo deep in his
chest a safe and noncommittal sound 

  shes headin here mrs cowgill an-
nounced still severe but a little mollified
by the prospect of having her curiosity
served at last

  the strangers foot was on the porch

chapter ii

the girli

her way seemed hesitant and apolo-
getic for all the brave dash she
had made from the door of the
racket store the flush that burned in
the cow jerry



her face was not all due to the scorching
heat that beat up intensified by the re-
flection from mcpackens dust-white
street as she stood an indecisive moment a
little distance from mrs cowgill and
banjo gibson seated in comfort on the
green bench beside the hotel door

  was you wantin to see somebody
mrs cowgill inquired turning casually
feigning a business interest that she did
not feel suppressing a greater one that
she would not confess

  im taking subscriptions for a work-
a book-this book the girl said appeal-
ing from face to face with serious brown
eyes may i sit here a little while and
tell you-show it to you	

  mrs cowgill moved along a little al-
though there was ample room at her end
of the bench signifying by the shift that
the stranger was to sit beside her and
not by the side of banjo gibson banjo
found it necessary for decorum and com-
fort to edge along a little way himself
putting a space of half a yard between
himself and the hostess of the cottonwood
hotel it was not quite far enough to
give him a view beyond her he shifted a
yard more pretending that his shoestring
needed tightening turning up his eyes in
sly measurement of the girls obvious good
points as he leaned

  banjo was confirmed in his first opinion
by this adroit exploration to look at her
was refreshment to be near her a placid
joy

  banjo did not hold it against her that
she stood at least a hands breadth taller
than himself being accustomed by this
time to the handicap that nature had placed
upon him but slewed in respectful atten-
tion on the bench to look at her across
mrs cowgill

  the girl was holding a dumpy thick
book with red cover and black lettering
clasped in both hands its called a
thousand ways to make money she
said looking in an appealing way from
face to face

  mrs cowgill took the book from her
she held it in her hand unopened gazing
at it steadily and silently presently she
turned to the agent who smiled in timid
expectancy

  was you in there tryin to sell jake
smolinsky one of them books  mrs cow-
gill demanded rather than inquired

  if you mean that little old man that
makes a noise like a clock going to strike
i was the agent confessed the smile go-

ing from her lips a sort of comicalsolem-
nity taking its place

  well child a thousand ways to make
money wouldnt be more than half as many
as jake smolinsky knows already mrs
cowgill said softening in her judgment
as banjo was glad to see

  the lady agent sighed it looks like
the rest of the people in this town are just
about as smart as he
is she said

  you didnt sell a
book all the time youve
been runnin around in
this broilin sun

 not a one the
agent replied but brave
in her failure banjo
could see no tears within a mile of her

  i suppose anybody ought to be glad
to know a thousand ways to make mon-
ey mrs cowgill reflected how much
does it cost

  only two dollars and immediate de-
livery-hopefully no wait

  two dollars for a thousand ways to
make money banjo marveled over the
bargain and id nearly give my -my
ankle for one sure-shootin way

  if youd like one of the books sir
the lady agent said leaning to look at
him

 well hum-m-m-m two dollars
hum-m-m-m banjo turned it off with
his noncommittal rumble and let it rest
two hard dollars in the jeans were better
maybe more certain without a doubt
than a thousand theories for making more
in a little red book with black letters on
the back for if they were legal ways
they were ways involving work a condi-
tion for obtaining money to which banjo
gibson was unalterably opposed -

  did you ever sell any of them books
anywhere asked mrs cowgill

  yes ive sold a good many-about
fifty-three i think ive got a good many
left though-over at the depot in my
trunk

  where did you start from child
  hutchinson

  how long ago

  about two months

  and youve only sold fifty-three clear-
in maybe a dollar on a book

the lady agent nodded assent slowly
it takes you a long time to find out you
aint got even one way to make money
mrs cowgill said but rather more in ad-
miration thart pity or reproof

  ive never been whipped i never will

       
short stories



be the lady agent declared very reso-
lutely

  some peoples that way mrs cow-
gill said nodding her head as if she un-
derstood the trait very well i wish
somebody- where are you headin for
from here

  im heading in here as the railroad
men say i guess if i cant sell any books
ill have to stay

  ever teach school

  no but i could is there an opening
here

  i dont know i dont suppose theyve
hired the teachers yet its nearly two
months before school opens i just won-
dered you look so young for a travelin
book agent i thought you might be a
teacher workin through vacation how
did you come to take up sellin books

  i guess i was talked into it i bought
the western half of kansas for a hundred
dollars

  you paid too much even if you got a
deed said banjo

  i believe you the lady agent agreed
leaning over in her attentive way to look
at him fairly as she spoke

  just for the right to sell them books
out here mrs cowgill asked

  thats the scheme i paid another
hundred dollars for a hundred books put
them in my trunk and started out

  where from honey

  banjo was pleased to see mrs cowgill
softening more and more how that girl
could go tramping around kansas with
books to sell or anything to sell and not
run out of stock in a week was a mystery
to him

  i started from kansas city

  what was you doin there before you
bought in on that fool book

  i suppose i might as well tell you
said the girl turning frankly to mrs cow-
gill a person cant be a mystery in a
little town especially when shes got to
find a job i wasnt doing anything be-
fore dad went broke in the real estate
boom then i sold some of my trinkets
to raise the money i blew on the books
and thats all there is to tell except my
name

  mrs cowgill waited perking up a little
with expectancy to receive it

  louise gardner the girl introduced
herself maybe thats it and maybe it
isnt

  that aint nobodys business but your
own mrs cowgill granted with easy
indifference

  thats right banjo declared with
strong emphasis he seemed ready to
stand in defense of her name true or
false against all aspersion and doubt

  you never waited table mrs cow-
gill said she spoke as if the young
woman had neglected a duty or an oppor-
tunity at least

  i could do it is there a job here
do you want a girl

  i can only afford to pay five dollars a
week room with my daughter-shes about
your age it may not look like much but
it beats trampin around in the hot sun

 not anything like it said louise gard-
ner

  ill not say it aint heavy and hard while
it lasts but the rush dont last long

  that will be all right louise said
cheerfully

  banjo looked at her queerly what did
she mean was she going to take that
job

  theres time for a girl to do her wash-
in and sewin in the afternoon mrs
cowgill seemed to argue for the place that
she had to be filled just as if the candi-
date held back instead of sitting keen and
hopeful a new light bright in her eyes

  that will be fine louise declared
im ready to begin right now

chapter iii

goosie and others

odessa cowgill commonly
called goosie was a sentimental
young lady who played the par-
lor organ when louise gardner first
met her she was singing a mournful song
as she laid out cutlery on the long table
where the regulars assembled at so much
a week to replenish their fires and keep
up a head of steam for the railroading life

  there is no doubt that suds and soup
and steaming dishes of a boarding house
where heavy railroad fare is served do not
contribute an atmosphere for aesthetic de-
velopment i f
beauty thrives in
such environment
it must of neces-
sity be rugged
that was the or-
der of goosie
big broad-faced
boisterous and strong

  she was a hearty happy girl with a big-
spreading mouth who enjoyed deeply the
sad songs of separation broken faith and
blighted homes which were current in that
the cow jerry

day her greatest pleasure was to sing
them when her duties threw her alone as
now it was her melancholy enjoyment
at such times to put herself in the heroines
part with bill connor the fireman to
whom she was engaged standing off in a
dim and tearful background holding out
appealing hands watching her drift hope-
lessly to ruin and desolation

  she knew that bill would in plain and
unromantic action take her by the neck
and choke it out of her in such case thats
all the sentiment there was in bill yet
it gave her a dear diversion a serene sad
happiness to figure bill off in the back-
ground holding out his hands she shiv-
ered in unhappy ecstasy

  goosies mother broke upon her song
bringing the strange girl into the shadowy
dining-room

  goosie this is louise gardner the new
dining-room girl louise this is odessa
my daughter goosies her pet name
shes been called by it so long she wouldnt
hardly answer to any other by now

  goosie put down the undistributed cut-
lery offering her hand with frank equality
hello she said when did you come
in 

  i came  the nine this morning
louise returned with the readiness of a
regular railroader

  take her to the room and let her fix
herself up youll have to lend her some
of your aprons till she can get some made

  goosie led the way to the stairs which
came down beside the door connecting
dining-room and office vastly relieved to
know she was going to have help that hot
evening eager to get the new girl out into
a strong light to see if her tpomplexion
was really as good as it looked

  mrs cowgill turned to the kitchen from
which a moaning long-drawn note of
lamentation sounded as if somebody there
labored in a bondage that rent the heart
to bear a tall spare negro woman was
standing at the stove frying chicken she
turned at mrs cowgills approach her
prolonged note diminishing falling away
like the whistle of a fast-running train
rounding a woodland curve the cook
grinned her solemn face glistening with
sweat

  i done got all the chicken on mis
cowgill she said

  youd better go out and cool off a while
when you take it up rachel mrs cow-
gill suggested with a sort of reticent
grudging kindness

  i aint none so hot rachel replied



cheerfully druther have it hot than
them cold winter days when the win
snoops under the doo and gives me the
rheumatis in my legs and the misery in
my back

  aint angus come down and started on
them putaters yet mrs cowgill inquired
sharply

  yassum hes out there on the poch
josselin em around playin train like hes
always a doin

  mrs cowgill set her foot against the
screen door which had fringed paper
tacked along the top to make a commotion
among the flies waiting a chance to wing
into that paradise of alluring scents it
was equal to opening the door against a
driving rain some of it was bound to get
in

  mrs cowgill let the door close gently
to stand beside it with displeasure coming
over the strained look of worriment and
longing in her tired face angus valor-
ous macdougall was sitting on the edge of
the shady porch twenty feet or so beyond
her a large bucket of potatoes beside him
a pan to receive the pared ones standing a
little way along between bucket and pan
angus had a string of the humble vege-
tables stretched out like a line of freight
cars headed by an immense potato with a
protuberance that served for the engines
smokestack

  angus valorous was chuffing and hiss-
ing equal to any
switch engine be-
tween argentine
and mcpacken as
he pushed his little
train slowly along
entirely absorbed
in the pastime so
childish and ridicu-
lous for one of his growth and years

  is that what i pay you for mrs
cowgill broke out in wrath her voice ris-
ing sharp and high

  angus valorous started guiltily ashamed
of being caught in the indulgence of a
pleasure that he should have left behind
him with his knee pants unconscious no
doubt in his rather thick-headed and total-
ly unimaginative way that his overwhelm-
ing ambition was only illustrating itself
in this homely concrete form angus
valorous lived for nothing in life but to
be a conductor that ambition was in his
round soft head when he was born it was
in his round hard head now that he was
nineteen and big enough to be thirty-nine
he scrambled the potatoes toward him let-
o

short stories

ting some of them fall confused and red
behind the ears

  is that what i pay you for mrs
cowgill demanded again coming forward
in long strides as if she meant to assault
him dont you know we have supper
in this hotel at six oclock you great
big good-for-nothing lump of mutton

  aw keep your shirt on angus re-
torted twisting his head to scowl at her
growling from the corner of his mouth
all youre payin me aint goin to break
nothin but your heart if you dont like
it you can git another man

  angus spoke in explosions great sar-
casm in his tone great contempt in the
slewing of his mouth he threw down his
knife and stood facing mrs cowgill jerk-
ing at the strings of his coffee-sack apron
as if through with the job

  angus was a short-built young man
heavy in the thighs his shoulders thick
his arms short and strong his black hair
was brushed to such a polish that a spider
would have needed a hand-line to climb it
his face was round and boyish his little
snub nose quite comical in the midst of his
present bluster but for the black whis-
kers which crowded his fair ruddy skin
so thick and so fast-growing that no
amount of shaving could keep them out
of sight angus would have looked in the
face like a hearty full-blooded boy of
twelve as it was he looked twelve with
the whiskers of forty-five

  he was the son of doctor macdougal
one child of many children doctor com-
petition was sharp in mcpacken angus
had been crowded out to shift for himself
when he should have been finishing the
grade school he could not get a job as
brakeman-even conductors in their con-
sequence and grandeur must begin there
-until he became twenty-one the cot-
tonwood hotel was a very good place to
fill the intervening years which angus had
breasted until only two now stood between
him and his happy day of matriculation in
the college of conductors

  it was the habit of people native to
mcpacken as well as those of transplanted
stock who remained in its atmosphere a
little while to be outspoken and inde-
pendent a superior might be acknowl-
edged on a job scorned and condemned
for the pull that put him there but in no
other connection social or civil angus
valorous was simply living up to the
standards of mcpacken when he bristled
before mrs cowgill and stood on his
rights as a man if he had acted other-

wise he would have been despised not
alone by the men of mcpacken but by the
women and children and mrs cowgill
first of all

  aw go ahn said angus jerking at
his apron-strings go ahn if you
want somebody else to do your dirty work
for you go and git him thats ahl i
got to say

  mrs cowgill stood regarding him in
towering scorn knowing very well that
angus had no more notion of quitting than
she had of discharging him

  whatever sense you had when you was
born leaked out of you before they could
bring a teacup to catch it in she said
go to work and dont give me any more
of your slack

  to relieve angus of the necessity of
carrying his bluff any farther and to save
her own dignity in the bargain mrs cow-
gill left him with that humiliating asper-
sion she marched through the kitchen
and dining-room heading for the office
from which she heard the faint tinkle of
the little desk bell she was in no hurry
to attend the caller as she went along she
speculated on whether it might be a cow-
hand wanting a cigar or a railroader a
plug of tobacco or an agent wanting to
sell something or some fool that didnt
know what he wanted she was by nat-
ural bent a little uncharitable in her esti-
mation of mankind

  as she passed the wash-room-fitted
with modern plumbing supplied with
water by the railroad water works-she
stopped at the sound of a snorting ablu-
tion familiar in her ears

   is that you myron she called

   yup a soapy cheerful voice replied

  whatre you doin home this time of
day

   run out of shingles the soapy voice
replied

  wasnt there any more in the lumber
yard 

   schudy broke a wheel couldnt get em
over till morning honey

  well when youre through wastin
water in there you go on out and saw up
some of them ties

   yes pet

  mrs cowgill went on to the office
myron cowgill under the shadow of
whose name the hotel lady lived came
from the wash-room damp and uncombed
with towel lint in his long brown mustache
a cheerful even a glad light in his mild
blue eyes

  myron produced the bowl of a corncob
the cow jerry



pipe from a pocket of his bagging over-
alls tapped it in his palm to dislodge the
shingle nails brought the stem of it out
of the ruler pocket along his leg connected
the parts and fired up pipe in mouth
he went out through the kitchen to begin
operation on the gritty hard oak ties
which the thrift of his wife secured
through a pull with the roadmaster to
supply fuel for her kitchen range

  mrs cowgill heard the summons of the
little bell again as she paused at the foot
of the stairs to call goosie she resented
the insistent ring there was something
imperative about it that seemed to place
her in an inferior position she went
along deliberately turning her eyes on
this and that making out that she came
casually she wanted the bell-ringer to
understand that she was a necessity in
mcpacken not a convenience

  the insistent ringer of the little desk
bell was  less important person than
yerney carr station agent in his white
shirt and pink sleeveholders mrs cow-
gill put off her resentment edging around
the counter with a smile vemey was an
important railroad peg in mcpacken he
was not the man to call her out without
sufficient reason	

  theres a big stock extra in five sections

coming the
agent announced
without prelim-
inary greeting
theyre bring-
in three thou-
sand head from
texas over
west of the bra-
zos where
theyve got a
big drouth
ive heard
the cowmen talkin about it she nodded

  first of a lot of em they say the
agent said i thought you might want to
make some preparations for takin care of
the bunch thatll be corninwith them five
extras

  ill have myron kill some more chick-
ens thanks verney

  theyre goin to flood this country with
them texas cattle theyll eat these cow-
men up here holler

  this rangell take care of just so many
and no more ive heard the cowmen say
the texas men have to lease from them
you know verney or pay so much a head
by the month for usin their grass 
guess its a good thing for our people all

them cowhands coinin in here too theyll
spend their money here in town

  and raise hell at all hours the
agent spoke like a man with unpleasant
recollections

  itll liven things up mrs cowgill
said mcpacken will be more like it
was when i came here and opened the ho-
tel theres no harm in them texas boys
if you take them right

  i know ive got one sweet time ahead
of me the agent said with what seemed
unwarranted feeling theyll be all
night unloadin them five trains-the first
ones due to arrive about seven

  ill take care of em as long as they
come weve got to go out of our way to
serve the cattle trade

  everybody in this country has to the
agent said with anything but pride or ease
of dignity in his part of the service

  its the business that counts there
wouldnt be anything here without it
oh i dont know about that the
agent said loftily im gittin darn sick
of seein these spider-legged cowhands un-
der sombrero hats with guns hung around
on em dont ever shoot anything with
em not even themselves

  a guns about the same to them as a
watch is to a railroad man verney

  a railroad man needs his watch but
no man needs a gun slung on him in this
country

  its custom more than anything the
boys wouldnt look the same without their
guns id kind of hate to see them go
but some of them are i saw cal withers
ride by a little while ago with only one gun
on him i remember when he used to
carry two and a knife

  darned old fool this bunch of cat-
tles cornin consigned to him hes been
gettin messages all afternoon

  its a handful for cal if hes bought
em i hope he dont go broke again
lot of his men with their toy pistols
swingin on em rode in a while ago to re-
ceive the cattle ill have to be right
there on the spot till the last cars empty
too bad mrs cowgill said indiffer-
ently much obliged for cornin over to
tell me verney she brought a box of
her best brand of cigars from the show-
case the agent picked two with critical
deliberation for such services as this to
the cottonwood hotel his smokes cost
him nothing

  wild bunch said the agent turning
to go back to the red depot and await the
arrival of the vexatious texans


short stories

  men or animals she laughed

  both the agent answered over his
shoulder from the door

chapter iv

a texas man

there was nothing in common be-
tween the railroaders of mcpacken
and the cowhands who rode in to
refresh themselves with its shabby enter-
tainment even the most prominent drov-
ers some of whom risked more in one sea-
sons speculation with the caprices of na-
ture and the markets than the combined
railroaders of mcpacken earned in a year
were looked upon with a sort of patroniz-
ing tolerance by conductors and brakemen
when they loaded for kansas city and
rode in the caboose on stock-shippers
passes

  the railroaders prided themselves that
the world came to mcpacken every day
if it did not always stop and get out for a
look around it roared through with an up-
swirling of dust that made its passing all
the more important the latest slang was
ready in the mouths of the railroaders
they could make sport of cowmen and
cowhands in an unknown tongue

  a superior caste to range men and
grangers according to their own rating
these railroaders of mcpacken yet every
one of them was serving cattle living and
prospering on cattle but for cattle they
would not have been there at all

  peace generally prevailed between rail-
road and range although an outbreak came
now and then there was no public dance-
hall in mcpacken that being an institution
belonging to the days before the towns
beginning but there was the big saloon
with its three beer-jerkers on busy nights
and sundays where the soil was always
raked for the seeds of trouble

  it was the custom still to carry guns on
the range in those days a habit that had
become a tradition rather than a neces-
sity the railroaders with few excep-
tions stuck weapons in their hip pockets
when going out for the evening railroad
taste favored that style of weapon known
as bulldog on account of its short and
chunky build being adapted to gentle-
manly concealment it was considered
boorish in railroad society to make a show
of ones weapon but there were men
enough with guns stuck around them in
mcpacken every night to line up a con-
siderable battle that such general en-
gagement between railroad and range

never had taken place was the marvel of
all peaceable citizens

  there were staid and respectable rail-
road men who had their families and
homes in mcpacken who neither mingled
in the swilling nor mixed in the barroom
brawls forerunners of the substantial re-
spectability that railroad men as a class
came in time to enjoy in those days es-
pecially out on the edge of things as in
mcpacken a railroader was a man with a
reputation for roughness a notoriety that
he fully enjoyed and sustained in mc-
packen they were young men mainly
car repairers wipers switchmen machin-
ists brakemen and firemen who had a
pride in their calling a glowing satisfac-
tion in theirgenerally hard name

  on the other hand there were the cow-
hands as the
men who fol-
lowed the herds
were commonly
called in and
around the
town several
hundred of
them could have
been rounded
ol	m	up within a

three-days ride of mcpacken youngsters
full of cayenne and vinegar with a snort
and go to them such as free youth has in
any calling anywhere there was a
sprinkling of older men among them
hardy wiry ones who had ridden the long
trail from texas to montana following
slow herds over perilous ways

  things were coming easier to the cow-
boy gentry in those mcpacken days the
railroad was no longer a thousand miles
away lights and liquids were within three
or four days ride at the farthest these
encroachments of civilization had shown
their influence on the cowboy habit which
was growing somewhat gentler due to fre-
quent breaks perhaps in the long periods
of drouth or maybe coming of the fact
that something easy to procure is no longer
ardently desired whatever the cause the
effect was- apparent to the older citizens of
mcpacken who had recollections of times
not very far back when revellers made
night a torture in the town

  altogether the effect of business meth-
ods which were supplanting the old-time
make-or-lose gamble of cattle raising
were showing amazing results not alone in
the taming down of cowboys but in
stabilizing an industry left hitherto de-
pendent on chance this worked out to
the cow jerry



the advantage of mcpacken and all within
it more cattle more railroaders more
railroaders more money turned loose ev-
ery pay-day to make eveiybody glad

  mrs cowgill was pleased to hear of the
five trains coming into her port with cat-
tle from the burned-up range of texas
every carload brought in lean meant some-
thing more than a carload to go out again
fat in the fall more trains more lay-
over men for the cottonwood hotel it
was all very comfortable and satisfactory
as mrs cowgill contemplated the future
near and far standing there where the sta-
tion agent had left her with arms across
the pages of the open register

  she turned over in her mind the chance
of the cattle trains arriving when the agent
expected them knowing the ways of such
trains as well as any railroader she con-
cluded at last to spare myron the slaugh-
ter of more chickens the trains would
not begin to get in before nine or ten
oclock more than likely out of a mis-
guided sense of loyalty the texas cow-
hands would peg on up the street and get
their supper in the lone star cafe

  while mrs cowgill was revolving these
thoughts and arriving at her wise conclu-
sions the nearest of the five cattle trains
was still a hundred miles distant from mc-
packen on top of this train back a few
cars from the engine to give the cinders a
chance to cool before they hit him a young
man was sitting his prodpole between his
knees watching the kansas landscape as
the train jogged by

  tom lay lander was favorably impressed
by the state they had left the region of
elms and maples along the streams the
dark-green fields of corn and mellow stub-
ble-lands where wheat shocks stood amaz-
ingly thick it seemed to him accustomed
to the thin yields of that sandy postoak
land beyond the brazos now they were
passing through a paradise of prairies big
enough it seemed to pasture all the starv-
ing herds between the panhandle and the
big bend it was an empty country as
far as he could see shaggy with gray-green
short grass heaved in gently-rounded hills
that looked like the backs of gigantic buf-
falo it looked like a place where a man
might turn out his herd with nobody to
set bounds to his coming and going

  tom laylander knew that it was not so
that men of his calling had all that coun-
try under their control in one way or an-
other  that bounds were set and respected
and that a stranger with five hundred-odd
starving cattle such as the thirty cars in

that train of his contained must go where
he was apportioned and pay what he was
asked better than starving down on the
brazos he reflected better than hanging
on there hoping for the rain that had been
nearly three years in coming except an
aggravating shower now and then

  the bones of many a herd whitened that
sandy country set with its tenacious
never-dying postoak trees hundreds of
his fathers cattle had gone in that miser-
able way while the old man had hung on
in the belief that his losses would not equal
the expense of running away from the
drouth hoping for the rain that never be-
fore had played him quite such a disas-
trous trick

  it had broken the old cowman at last
and put him in his grave young tom
had picked up what was left and set out
for kansas in the hope that he might save
enough to return to texas after the drouth
was broken and start another herd kan-
sas was a good place to retreat upon in the
day of necessity but texas was the only
place to live the only place because it
was the only place he knew

  calhoun withers the biggest cattle
speculator in the southwest had come into
that famine-stricken neighborhood and
pretty well cleaned it up at his own price
it was a bone and hide price withers had
said that was all the cattle of that coun-
try were worth his purchases were com-
ing along behind tom laylander twenty-
five hundred head or more

  withers as an old friend of tom lay-
landers father had advised the young man
not to sell at these famine prices there
was going to be a shortage in cattle with
good prices as a consequence that fall ow-
ing to the unfitness of the texas supply
for the butchers block load he advised
and ship to kansas where he had range
to rent at a reasonable figure

  tom had been in the mind for this all
along and here he was on his way to gam-
ble with kansas for the remnant of his
herd he had arranged to pay withers by
the head for the use of his range settle-
ment to be deferred until the cattle were
sold it was the young adventurers hope
that his bones and hides would become
beeves in the course of three or four
months

  mrs cowgill woke in the night to hear
them unloading the cattle into the white-
washed pens the high-pitched tremolo of
man and steer sounding lonesome as the
plaint of creatures which belong by right
to wide and distant places wailing in the
short stories



dark for home there always was some-
thing in that wild cowboy note more of
melancholy than jubilation to mrs cow-
gills ear like coyotes she often thought
shivering and howling in hunger of a win-
ter night in bleak places among the snow
why this thought always came to her with
the sound she did not know only that it
was so

  it was evening before laylander got his
herd across the river and spread in the
green and abundant valley the cattle
were being held there for their first feed
on kansas grass by two cowboys who had
accompanied laylander from texas they
were mounted on horses borrowed from
withers

  toms intention was to pay these boys
off as soon as they had worked the herd
out to the range he was to occupy and
let them go back home or find employment
in kansas as they might elect he planned

to do his own
herding such as
might be neces-
s a r y withers
had said he
could handle the
cattle alone on
that range
where the feed-
ing was so plen-
tiful they did
not travel far

  laylander wanted to sniff bay ruin and
feel the barbers shears around his ears
once more it seemed a long time since
he had enjoyed those luxuries his beard
felt long enough to hide a rabbit he was
greatly cheered by his hopeful outlook as
he rode one of witherss horses to mc-
packen to leave his mane and tail as he
said in the barber shop

  the regular boarders in the cottonwood
hotel took their meals at a long table that
extended in state down the middle of the
dining-room casual guests such as
drummers and cowhands did not share
this table dhote goosie cowgill who
usually combined the duties of reception
committee and waiter piloted them to the
small side tables at which two or four
might sit in such-comfort as the stale pie-
crust atmosphere of the dining-hall offered

  the railroaders and other regulars were
pretty well cleared out of the dining-room
when tom laylander arrived goosie be-
ing engaged in an exchange of wit with
the roundhouse foreman did not see the
hesitant stranger as he paused with a ques-
tion that amounted to an apology for his

intrusion near the door louise gard-
ner who had taken to her new job with
confident alacrity caught the arrivals eye
and beckoned him on with hearty signal

  back up said a brakeman who saw
the signal from his place at the long table

  the few others at this common board
looked up from their various engagements
and laughed the brakeman his essay as
a humorist thus approved repeated the
sign looking across at tom laylander
who stood in confusion his big hat in his
hand

  she wants you to make a couplin with
that flat down there on the house track
the brakeman explained

  laylander grinned going on to the table
where the new biscuit-shooter waited a
chair pulled out to receive him

  oh leave her alone goosie laughed
you was green once yourself

  whos green  the brakeman feigned
a large surprise that girl learnt biscuit-
shootin in college theyve got a class
of em down at lawrence

  whatre you sore about windy the
roundhouse boss inquired with patronizing
contempt did she step on your steak

  ya-a y clinker-puller the brakeman
sneered

  a little shack got his neck broke in ar-
gentine last week tryin to stretch himself
out to pass for a man the roundhouse
boss returned his sarcasm sharper than
any knife on the table

  while this passing of pleasantries across
the table between the railroading caste was
going on louise was taking stock of the
customer bound for her table it seemed
to her that a window had been opened to
the broad prairies admitting a cool wind
with the soft indefinable scents of lonely
places in it there was such a frank confes-
sion of unworldliness in this young mans
face

  it was a plump face boyish ruddy
through the brown of wind and sun freck-
led a little in keeping with the sandy hair
the young man came walking on his toes
as if afraid he might disturb somebody
his gun against his thigh spurs tinkling on
his freshly polished boots his scarlet
neckerchief made a fine effect along with
the tawny gray of his cougar-skin vest
both of them carried from texas in his
gripsack on top of a cattle car reserved
for an hour such as this

  he was a tall and slender youth young-
er in appearance than in fact as the new
biscuit-shooter could see yet with some-
thing of competence and assurance in his
the cow jerry



forehead rather narrow and combative
and in his blue eyes small with light lashes
peculiarly noticeable arched by sandy eye-
brows as delicate and long as a girls

  the young texas man took off his re-
volver before seating himself hanging it
on the back of his chair in respect to the
hospitality of that house perhaps or may-
be in observance of the ancient custom
among armed men when they sat down to-
gether to bread whatever the purpose
or the prompting louise gardner thought
better of him for the act she seemed to
get a little look into his simple ethics and
to find them strongly enforced by honor a
quality that did not speak from the faces
of many who filled their bunkers at mrs
cowgills board

  as for tom laylander he felt that he
had been served a banquet even before
louise brought him the bread and butter
he felt so glad he wanted to whoop he
thought it must be because he was away
off up there in a strange country kind of
lonesome and cold around the gills and
she had spoken to him in that friendly un-
derstanding way

  he looked after her when she went to
the kitchen carrying her tray beside her
in the way he had come in carrying his
hat he just sat and looked drawing in
his breath

  tom was not more than half through
his supper when one of the men that he
had left with the cattle came in looking
for him breathing hard as if he had run
across the river excitement pushing out
his eyes louise saw laylander rise at
the first hurried words and buckle on his
gun he picked up his hat and started for
the door stopped seeming to consider the
situation the cowboy arguing earnestly
hand on the young mans shoulder as if
to stop him in some unwise design

  presently laylander returned to his sup-
per the cowboy with him louise noted
as she served the other man that his news
had filled tom he did not seem to have
room for another bite it was indigestible
news it had brought a cloud to the young
mans clear eyes a lowering portentous
shadow over his good-humored face
louise hoped it might not be as bad as his
face reflected it whatever it might be
she moved his plate aside and slipped the
pie before him he thanked her with his
eyes but did not touch the pie

the cowboy finished his hastily gob-
bled meal and left in as much of a hurry as
he had cqme plainly on the young drovers
order laylander buckled on his gun
cio

again and stooped to get his hat from un-
der the table where it had been kicked in
the excitement of the conference

  dont you like pie louise inquired
coming forward with her tray

  yes maam i love it laylander re-
plied red from the stooping for his hat
and something more but i just got
some news that kind of took away my ap-
petite for pie if youll excuse me maam
i noticed it youre one of the texas
boys that came in with the cattle last night
arent you i hope it wasnt about your
cattle stampeded or something

  it was about my cattle maam lay-
lander replied his eyes on the door the
desire big in him to be gone

  im sorry she said her hands busy
among the dishes her eyes lifted for one
sympathetic glance i used to hear so
much about the foolish things cattle do on

the range-

  they wasnt to blame maam he cor-
rected her with grave courtesy ive

been turned a trick-

  louise saw him stiffen as for a jump
his words broken off there and left hang-
ing mrs cowgill was bringing a man
into the dining-room
with considerable im-
portance a tall heavy-
shouldered gray man
with broad red suspend-
ers over his gray wool-
en shirt a colored cot-
ton handkerchief awry
about his neck he was dusty and saddle-
soiled but full of loud words and boister-
ous animation his big voice ringing in the
dining-room audible to its remote corners
he was belted with a pistol a shaggy gray
mustache drooped over his mouth

  excuse me maam said laylander
going forward to meet the man under mrs
cowgills solicitous convoy

  louise could feel trouble in the air
trouble in  the way the young texan
stepped out to meet this man the new
guest stopped when he saw laylander
squaring off as if to stand on the
defense

  colonel withers is it true youve sent
the sheriff out and attached my cattle
laylander demanded

  you seem to be posted about right
withers replied

  they stood set each waiting for the oth-
er to make a move each knowing the man
before him well enough to understand what
a false start would bring

  i dont owe you or any other man in


short stories

kansas a cent colonel withers what
kind of a trumped-up trick is this youre
tryin to throw over on me

  i dont trump up tricks bud youll
learn to pick your words better if you hang
around where im at for a while maybe
you dont owe me anything personally but
your old daddy owed me ten thousand dol-
lars long enough to make it an heirloom
ive been waitin four years for him to
send a herd into this state but i never
could git a twist on the old wolfs tail so
 trapped the cub

  i never heard of any debt owin to
you the young man said he spoke more
in challenge than denial the ruddiness
lading out of his face

  likely not kid but the longer you live
the more youre due to pick up ive got
old tom lay landers note for ten thou-
sand dollars and its a good and legal pa-
per im out to collect on it

  you tolled me on to ship up here so
you could levy on my herd tom charged
indignantly

  you guessed it withers replied ex-
ulting in the success of his deception

  debt or no debt colonel withers it
was a low-handed sneakin trick it was
a trick thkt no man outside of a thief and

a liar-

  withers spun half around hand on his
gun presenting himself side-on like a
fencer

  any man that spits them words in my
tace has got to eat em he said

  you know the way to the door tom
laylander replied

  calhoun withers called colonel from
his auctioneering days turned and march-
ed toward the door followed by young
laylander whose courage was as high as
his honor mrs cowgill was thrown into a
frenzy of consternation by this sudden
shaping of tragedy among her peaceful ta-
llies she lifted her arms in impotent
signal of distress running to the long table
where the few railroaders lingered over
their late supper

  stop em stop em some of you men
she appealed cal withers is goin to
kill him and his supper aint paid for

chapter v

flagged

rs cowgills fear was pre-
mature and unfounded while
she stood making her appeal for
interference to the railroad men who had

no concern whatever in what might hap-
pen to either of the combatants beyond the
entertainment their engagement might af-
ford the little desk bell began to clamor
an insistent and imperative call

  mrs cowgill ran from the room fol-
lowed by the railroaders who came crowd-
ing and jesting goosie was in the midst
of them as gay as if going to a fair
louise stood a few moments beside the
table hands on the dish-laden tray as if
to lift it and go about her duty let tra-
gedy run out of the door as it might

  she felt a cold numbness settle over her
a shocking realization of the sacrifice that
youth was marching out so passionately
white and erect to make to honor she
had no doubt that laylander had been
cheated out of his property or was in the
way of being cheated by a groundless
claim but she could not see how he was to
help matters any by killing or being killed
in the dusty road before the hotel door
she ran after the others hoping to see
somebody come between the angry men
and send them away without a fight

  laylander was before the desk waiting
for mrs cowgill who was just edging
around behind it as louise reached the
office the railroaders were bunched
where they had stopped just inside the of-
fice door not rash enough to allow curi-
osity to draw them into danger angus
valorous in his white shirt without a col-
lar the neckband open on his whiskered
throat was pushing after mrs cowgill as
if to lend his assistance in the crisis which
seemed to confront the establishment
withers had gone out to the sidewalk
louise saw him stand there a moment
then turn to the right and saunter non-
chalantly past the window out of sight

  i wish to pay for myself and the other
gentleman that ate with me laylander
said his voice calm and steady

  itll be a dollar mrs cowgill told
him a flutter in her tone a greater flutter
in her heart which as she said when re-
calling the experience felt like it would
wear itself out against her ribs

  laylander put the money down at the
sight of it all of mrs cowgills concern
for herself was dissipated the humane and
gentle part of her nature pretty well hard-
ened and driven back out of sight by fron-
tier boarding-house life for twenty years
and more impelled her to grasp the young
mans hand

  dont go out there dont you go she
begged cal withers has killed three or
four men in his time-they say hes a
the cow jerry

man that never takes chances hell not take
any chances with you hell drop you
the minute you step out of that door
thank you maam said laylander
too proud in his anger and outraged feel-
ings to be embarrassed by her restraining
hand that was a very nice supper
maam im much obliged

  he drew his hand away gently thought-
ful of her a kind stranger who wished him
well and started for the door

  dont go out there mrs cowgill
leaned over the counter and stretched her
arms out in womanly appeal the desper-
ation of his situation growing on her as

she pleaded go
to law and fight
him but dont try
to do it with your
gun

 laylander was
at the door his
hand on the screen
to push it open he
jpaused long enough to face around to her
in grateful acknowledgment of her con-
cern he lifted his hand to her in a gal-
lant little salute and smiled

  cant some of you men stop him
mrs cowgill demanded of them savagely
turning to windy moore the brakeman
the roundhouse foreman and three others
who made up the little crowd its mur-
der-its murder

  angus valorous reached under the coun-
ter and drew out a club a stick such as
brakemen used in those days for coupling
cars and setting brakes he made a dash
for the end of the counter with it in his
capable fist mrs cowgill threw herself
in front of him denying him passage

 not you-i dont mean you one
boys enough to be killed

  she cornered him behind the counter
ipushing along close to the window where
angus stood glaring and white holding
his club in both hands like a ball bat lean-
ing over as if calculating his chances of
jumping the counter and making for the
door mrs cowgill caught him by the
suspenders and held him prisoner

  laylander was in plain view through
the screen door standing where he had
stepped to the sidewalk hand close to his
gun he was looking down the street in
the direction withers had gone

  somebody make him come in here
mrs cowgill begged

  the railroaders did not respond they
spread out a little moving toward the door
for a better view indifferent to anybodys



safety but their own louise went to the
front of the office where she stood lean-
ing against the counter feeling as weak
and breathless as if her own life depended
on some quick action of which she was
not capable she was only dimly con-
scious of other people in the room the
dread that chilled her was so benumbing
and intense she saw laylander walk
slowly across the broad sidewalk under
the hotel awning hand hovering over his
gun fingers spread stiffly awkwardly for
such a tremendous emergency it seemed
he stepped carefully like a man wading a
shallow rapid rocky stream head turned
to watch down the street

  through the window at the end of the
counter louise saw withers and three
other men all armed starting across the
street at a point about opposite the farther
corner of the hotel they were walking
in the same cautious way feet raised high
at every step heads twisted to watch the
lone man who was wading out into that in-
visible stream of death as it seemed to
louise to face them and fall

  the railroaders craned their necks no-
body spoke angus valorous held by
mrs cowgills determined hand was beat-
ing the counter in quick savage blows of
his club like a caged gorilla venting its
impotent rage myron cowgill came pipe
in his mouth moved by a slow curiosity to
stand behind the railroaders a thin
stream of smoke issued from the bowl of
his pipe to be drawn slowly out through
the screen door

  laylander was about a quarter of the
way across the broad dust-smothered
street his left hand a little before him
his feet lifted slowly and put down care-
fully he was watching cal withers and
the three men along with him as he went
withers had come to the middle of the
street and stopped

  louise gardner moved a little nearer the
door she was taut as a wet rope choked
with the indignant voiceless protest against
one mans foolish courage and four mens
shameless threat the others who stood
watching the oncoming tragedy were silent
angus valorous ceased his clatter to look
breath held for the first shot - mrs cow-
gill stood clinging to his suspenders her
eyes big with the terror that paralyzed her
ready tongue

  laylander reached the middle of the
street there he squared around to face
the little bunch of men twenty yards or
less along the dusty way backing from
them a little as if the distance did not


short stories

agree with his method or to give himself
more time to calculate his chance against
this unexpected number as if in deri-
sion of this maneuver but in fact to pro-
voke laylander into firing the first shot
withers jerked off his hat and flung it
sailing into the space that lay between
them

  laylander fell into the trap that would
give withers an excuse in law for shoot-
ing him down he slung out his gun and
put a bullet through the hat before it
struck the ground

  louise saw laylander skip and leap as
a boy prances to dodge rocks and confuse
the aim of his assailants when the others
began to shoot she saw the little spurts
of dust around his feet and the jerking
motion of his arm as he threw a quick shot
in reply

  stop her stop that girl mrs cowgill
screamed

  angus valorous beat a frenzied tattoo
on the counter with his club as louise
dashed open the screen door and ran into
the street between the fighting men before
laylander could steady himself for a sec-
ond and more effective shot

  theyll murder her mrs cowgill
cried out her voice broken by alarm

  she hurried to the door angus close
after her club in his hand

  louise stood facing withers her arms
stretched out in commanding gesture as
if she barred the way to both his bullets
and himself

  shes flagged him said windy moore

  the shooting stopped with the appear-
ance of louise in the road mrs cowgill
and angus rushed in to enforce her de-
mand for peace everybody thought it was
a good time to go out and hear what was
said windy moore the brakeman led
the way from the hotel banjo gibson
came at the head of those who started over
from the saloon there was such a crowd
between the lines in a few seconds that
any more shooting for that occasion was
out of all safety bounds

  withers put up his pistol somebody
handed him his hat he jerked it ungra-
ciously from the man who had picked it
up beat the dust out of it against his leg
put it on and stood glaring at angus val-
orous as if the blame for the whole dis-
turbance lay on his head nobody ap-
peared to be hurt on either side although
laylander was lost sight of for the mo-
ment in the crowding forward and the up-
trampling of dust

  if i ever saw a low-down houn on two

legs said mrs cowgill im lookin at
one right now four of you to pile onto
that innocent boy no more shame in you
cal withers than a dog

  when your opinions needed maam
itll be called for withers said the sting
of her reproach bringing a surge of blood
into his face

  put up that gun angus valorous
commanded lifting his club against one of

witherss men who stood with his weapon
drawn as if he wanted to go on with the
fight the fellow looked with a sort of
startled surprise at the bristling young
man with the unsullied new club put
it up i said angus repeated in the deep
harsh voice of a terrible man

  the cowboy seemed to be charmed by
the peculiar weapon that menaced his head
he fixed his eyes on angus with startled
staring attention as his hand moved slowly
to restore the pistol to its place

  if you ever pull a gun on me ill bust
you wide open angus threatened

  the people who had crowded up to see
and hear pressed around withers and his
men in that questioning silence peculiar to
a crowd that has arrived when the thing
is over there is an expression in such
silence of feeling cheated out of some-
thing and a question of whether it is go-
ing to begin again laylander approached
pushing his way apologetically among
those who stood near mrs cowgill

  its a handy thing to have a lady friend
around to do your fightin for you with-
ers said

  the lady is a stranger to me but no
man can speak a slight against her where
im at laylander replied

  mrs cowgill put herself between them
as the others fell back to make room for
the show they had hoped all along would
open again

  shes the same to me as my daughter
mrs cowgill declared you keep a still
tongue in your mouth when you speak of
that girl cal withers

  maam i dont need any he-woman to
tell me my business withers scored her
with a look as he spoke you got
the cow jerry

through this time bud turning to lay-
lander but youre not apt to be so lucky
the next time i catch you away from the
women folks i just want to say this to
you kid youre standin where the roads

you to pick the one you take

  ill be found right around here till i

rachel mrs cowgill declared

  youll stay some time withers said
passing over mrs cowgills challenge to
his honorable auctioneering title

  ill law you ten years but ill get them
cattle of mine laylander said

  youll never live ten seconds if i meet
you in the road

  there never will be a better time than
right now colonel withers

  thats right said windy moore
you might as well have it out right
here

  four to one the way cal withers al-
ways fights ive heard it said and ill bet
money he could clean you up too mrs
cowgill said im not goin to have any
fightin and scrappin in front of my hotel
now or any other time if i can put a stop
to it

  the city marshal appeared at that mo-
ment he had a word or two with cal
withers who started off in the direction
of the saloon his men shouldering up
around him their heads together in close
talk

  they look as mean as misery banjo
gibson said

  laylander looked around for the girl
who had imperiled her life to save his
own she was not there windy moore
who had an eye for every direction saw
what was passing in the young mans
mind

  i saw her skim across to the hotel he
said

  the crowd scattered the sun went
down red as a clinker from a fire-box
with clouds banked darkly in the north-
west threatening rain mrs cowgill
looked strangely at angus valorous as he
returned to the hotel beside her his good
sound club in hand it was as if she had
seen the man rise up in him and was puz-
zled to account for it by any reasoning at
her command

  tom laylander under tow of banjo
gibson returned to the hotel and sat on a
bench beside the door from that haven



they saw withers and his men get on their
horses presently and ride away lifting for
a time at least the constraint of watching
from laylanders troubled mind

  she run right up to the room goosie
whispered as she stood with her mother
looking into the deserted dining-room

  well said mrs cowgill in meaning-
less empty way ill send angus to clear
away the dishes

  didnt she make a sight of herself
goosie said shocked beyond all bounds

  i spoke my mind to cal withers her
mother returned with wide irrelevance
itll cost me money but i can live with-
out his business and i spoke my
mind

  when she sent angus valorous to help
goosie with the dishes mrs cowgill gave
him that queer baffled questioning look
again she went outside to take the cool
of the evening on the bench along with
banjo gibson and the young man from
texas whose fresh honest homely face
made her think of a pink cosmos flower it
was so plain and yet so good to see she
did her best to assure him that he was
among friends at the cottonwood hotel
no matter what might wait for him out in
the road

  business was slack at that hour cow-
hands did not begin to come in until much
later in the night after they had made the
round of the town angus valorous-
commonly called by her angus vlors
after his own pronunciation of the sonor-
ous word-would take care of them as
always she puzzled again over that un-
expected showing of the man in him think-
ing in her own strange way that he must
have grown up in the night without her
noticing it

  she looked in at the window to see if
angus valorous
had returned to his
duty behind the
desk angus was
there he had tak-
en three cigar box-

--j i t es from the show-

case put the ink-
bottle on one of them making an engine
of it he was pushing this little train
forward and back the length of the short
counter between showcase and wall fat
little mouth puckered black-whiskered
cheeks rising and falling in the rapid ex-
haust of his chuffing engine the world and
its business its comedies and tragedies
shut out of his thoughts as by an iron
door

chapter vi
one thing and another

the parlor of the cottonwood ho-
tel was in the front of the house
opposite the office it was a room
that was a sort of left-over suitable for
nothing else but a parlor small and
i pinched with two lean windows looking
out on a cottonwood tree the sidewalk and
the end of the watering trough drum-
mers sometimes used it for a sample room
making it gay with red underwear silk pet-
ticoats and neckties of assertive hues

  there was an organ in a corner of the
room with work on the top of it similar
to the headboard of an old-time walnut
bed it was a very grand organ having
many stops and starts all of which were
known to goosie like the toes on her feet
when goosie played it and sang senti-
mental songs her tears fell down upon the
keys

   mrs cowgill liked to sit in the parlor
on rainy days such as this and watch the
cowhands come and go on their drenched
horses mud to the fetlocks in the street
that was dust but yesterday water slith-
ering from their slickers not much gaiety
in them and no regard for anybody who
wanted to cross on foot banjo gibson
was sitting at the other window facing
mrs cowgill in amiable propinquity
banjo was living at the cottonwood hotel
on his means he would continue on that
arrangement until his wad of sixty dollars
was gone which would be a good while at
five dollars a week for room and board
the current rate for regulars at that house
which was a high rate for that town and
that day sufficient to keep the vulgar in
their proper place

   it was that slack hour in the afternoon
between dinner and supper-there was no
such meal as luncheon in the heavy econo-
my of the cottonwood hotel-when cook
and dining-room girls as well as mrs
cowgill had a little while to catch their
breath mrs cowgill encouraged the girls
to make use of the parlor during this lull
their presence there giving the house an
air of liveliness and continual business
goosie frequently pumped the organ in the
afternoon and sang her sentimental songs
although she could not merge herself so
completely and comfortably with the lost
ladies of the ballads when there was any-
body around as she could when alone and
in a darkened place

   mrs cowgill had a son a knock-kneed
shambling long-armed stuttering chap of

twenty-four or five who had a regular
run firing a through freight she called
him herby but everybody else called him
pap he was laying over today and he
also was in the parlor spread out on the
sofa in the elegant repose of a man who
could afford it he had blue sleeve-hold-
ers with tassels pap had a naturally leer-
ing and goggling look about him which
seemed to mock and discredit everybody
and everything they said he talked slow-
ly and thickly his worda catching fre-
quently like a knot at the end of a rope

  so these three lights of civilization were
in the parlor of the cottonwood hotel en-
gaged in a three-cornered talk the subject
of which was tom laylander and his ad-
ventures in mcpacken

  i sent him to judge dockum mrs
cowgill said i knew if his case was to
be won judge dockum could win it

  itll be five or six weeks before court
meets said banjo and them cattle
theyre out there with nine or ten deputy
sheriffs herdin and watchin over them
it dont matter much it looks to me who
wins with all them costs to pay wont
be nothing left

  poor feller he paid them two men that
helped him bring the cattle up from texas
and he had to put down a hundred dollars
before judge dockum hed touch the case
it left him strapped

  i hu-hu-hope you aint carryin him
on said pap

  he paid a week in advance but his
times up today well i wouldnt shut
down on him even if he didnt have a job
got a jobfc has he banjo inquired a
laugh in his words as if he saw humor in
the necessity that drove a man to that pass

  funny the way that boy hunted high
and low over this town for work and
couldnt find it anywhere mrs cowgill
soliloquized yes oh yes he got a
job this morning starts in tomorrow he
told me

  cow job banjo inquired

  no too bad it aint but lie didnt
want to leave town he said i think the
poor boy wants to be here in hopes hell
meet that old rascal withers and shoot it
out between them

  from what i hear of withers he aint
so long on the fight as you might take him
to be banjo said

  hell fight all right mrs cowgill
corrected him seriously and glumly enough
the trouble with him is he wants to have
a sure thing that boy never will meet
him alone cals always goin to be care-
ful to have two or three limber-jims with
him when he comes to town i saw him
in yesterday morning with that same gang
he had the other day but tom was out
hustlin around for a job and didnt even
know he was in town

  maybe he wasnt lookin for him very
hu-hu-hard said pap

  dont fool yourself banjo advised
seriously that boy hed wade through
a river of wildcats for a crack at that old
crook

  he wont make the mistake of shoot-
in first next time though mrs cowgill
said confidently i posted him on that
well when he goes to work maybe hell be
kep out of the way cal dont come to
town except to do his business with the
bank and buy his supplies hes only
around here in business hours i hope to
mercy we can put off that shootin match
till tom beats the case in court

  what kind of a jobs he got pap
asked

  it was funny the way he went around
town huntin work mrs cowgill said ig-
noring the importunities of banjo and her
son bound to begin at the beginning and
move all the trifles out of her way clear
down to the end he was wearin that
old white stetson-well it was white once
-with the crown pushed up as high as it
would go his gun hangin on him like he
was out to kill he went to the round-
house first and struck ford langley to
take him on ford said he looked like a
toothpick under a toadstool with that big
hat on his face kind of peaked the way
its got since this trouble struck him ford
sent him on to the shops and the boys
there got onto the joke and passed him
along from one fool thing to another
they kep him trottin two or threp days be-
fore he caught on they were kiddin him
banjo gibson laughed a care-free head-
back mouth-open laugh that rang with an
appreciation of life pap seemed indif-
ferent to the further adventures of the
texas cowman ignoble creature at the
best

  he tried the livery
stable and the stores and
i believe he even tried
the bank mrs cowgill
continued

  whered he pick up
a job banjo asked
trying politely to bring
the evasive narration to an end

  jerryin orrin smith took him on the
section



  the hu-hu-hell you say said pap

  banjo said nothing he looked sort of
foolish his face coloring a little as if he
had heard something obscene

  he asked me for board when he come
in at noon and i told him id let him stay

  the hu-hu-hell you did said pap

  ive been kind of thick with that feller
i kind of took up with him banjo con-
fessed regret humiliation in his tone

  well he didnt know any better than
to go to jerryin hes as green as grass
mrs cowgill excused him

  jerryin banjo derided id ruther
git me a tin bill and shovel mud with the
ducks

  it was funny mrs cowgill reflected
the humor of the case bright in her eyes
when he come back today he said he was
goin railroadin

  the hu-hu-hell he did damn jerry
pap was so moved by the fellows pre-
sumption that he sat up his greasy coun-
tenance inflamed his pop eyes leering

  whatre they payin the jerries now
banjo asked indifferently

  two-and-a-half on this division east
of here only two mrs cowgill replied

  youll be losin a lot of railroad men
if you make this hu-hu-house a dump for
jerries pap warned her

  therell only be him and orrin no-
bodys got any kick cornin on orrin his
boss even if it aint such a very high-up
job ill put him and tom off together
at a corner table and louise can wait on
em nobodyll notice well i dont care
if they do hes a good decent boy he
didnt know what he was doin when he
took a section-hand job

  let him go over to ryans with the
rest of the jerries pap suggested indig-
nantly

  hell stay right here in this house till
he gets good and ready to leave said mrs
cowgill

  she closed her mouth very tightly on the
declaration her thin lips fitting like some
excellent piece of joinery pap knew what
it meant when she spoke and looked that
way a switch engine couldnt move her

  pap went to the office and helped him-
self to one of the best cigars in the case
which was no great drain on the finances
of the establishment he sat on the porch
smoking mrs cowgill could see him sit-
ting there gloomy and disgruntled as much
out of sorts over her harboring a common
jerry in that house as if he had been called
on to share his bed with a stranger

the cow jerry
short stories



  louise came to the parlor door looked
in and started away	

  was you lookin for something lou-
ise mrs cowgill called

  the rest of the kansas city paper
louise displayed part of it with a nod and
friendly smile to banjo who waved his
hand airily

  i aint seen it mrs cowgill returned
indifferently but i expect myrons got it
off in a corner somewhere that man hell
read anything hell let business go any
day to set down with a book or a paper
and read

  mrs cowgill was censorious and severe
she had no pride in her husbands facility
with an accomplishment that was only a
business adjunct to her and loosely
grasped at the best

  oh well let him read it then said
louise unwilling to snatch one of my-
rons few pleasures out of his hand she
entered the parlor and sat on the end of
the sofa

  if hed do more of his readin on his
carpenters square as i tell him maybe i
wouldnt have to slave my head off run-
nin a hotel mrs cowgill said bitterly at
war on every point with all manner of
printed matter that was not pressed into
steel now there goes herby over to
the saloon banjo i wish youd go after
him and tell him to let that slop alone
tell him i said hed better remember hes
got to go out on his run tonight and to
let that slop alone

  banjo was not reluctant to go he felt
that he could carry a shot or two very
cheerfully that gloomy day himself

  t guess hes just goin over to play a
game of seven-up said he rising mak-
ing preparations to follow well lou-
ise howre you stackin up

  im as gay as possible mr banjo
mr banjo mrs cowgill repeated in
comical astonishment as she might have
exclaimed over finding a ribbon on the
handle of her frying pan then she
laughed shrilly in sudden outbreak accord-
ing to her habit very little change in her
facial expression indicative of mirth ex-
cept her wide-stretched mouth

  i thought you might be in love said
banjo facetiously you kind o look
like youd been losin sleep if you need
any advice come to me

  thank you mr banjo louise made
him a little bow a merry light in her agate-
clear brown eyes

  i never heard you was a love doctor
banjo mrs cowgill said her fit of

merriment had brought a flush to her
cheeks as brandy starts its fires under the
eyes of one not accustomed to its use per-
haps laughter intoxicated mrs cowgill in
like manner so unaccustomed to her lips

  banjo laughed in his own loud way the
machinery being well oiled and easy to
swing in his case it was a pleasant
sound tuneful contagious one scarcely
could help laughing with banjo gibson let
the matter that moved it be as trivial as a
gnat he waved his hand jaunty and
care-free as a troubadour should be at
next sight of him he was picking his way
across the muddy street

  well he ought to be posted in love
matters if he aint mrs cowgill re-
flected watching him with a sort of aloof
and impersonal interest as she might have
watched a rooster engaged on a similar
expedition hes been married to three
women he ought to know something about
love

  young as he is louise marveled tak-
ing the chair lately vacated by the nota-
ble under discussion what became of
them all

  two of them run off with other men
and one divorced him mrs cowgill re-
plied banjo gibsons simple history suc-
cinct and ready on her
tongue

  hes had a lot of ex-
perience for a little
man said louise look-
ing after him with new
interest but his losses
dont seem to trouble
him very much

  no nor make him
any wiser hes as light in the head as
smoke well if there aint maud kelly

  louise leaned to see a tall young
woman wearing a mans sombrero a rub-
ber cape around her shoulders was cross-
ing the street a little below the point
where banjo gibson had forded it she
was stopping now and then to sling the vis-
cous mud from her feet with a vigorous
forward kick which did not add to the
decorum of her march

  it was plain that public opinion had very-
little weight with maud kelly she was
careless of the curious eyes fixed on het-
up and down the street she crossed over
to the hotel where she stamped the rough
of the mud off and continued on her way

  who is she  asked louise

  her fathers one of our retired men
lives here in town he used to be a cat-
tleman and a big one in his day but he
the cow jerry



lost most of his money in mines mauds
got a job in the court house deputy county
treasurer fine one to be trustin with all
that money

  she seems to be rather strong-minded
louise ventured she was looking at
maud kellys back as she went swinging
up the street

  i dont think shes got much of any
kind of a mind shes just daredevlish
and dont care anyhow well soon be rid
of her in the treasurers office shes go-
in to resign her job in a month or so to
ie married shes marryin a man named
cook baggage-smasher here on the road
hes a big fine-lookin man with a brown
mustache hes got a good job too bet-
ter than brakeman he makes good money
but i dont think its the kind of a job the
man that marries that girl ought to have
-home one day and away two the man
that marries maud kelly wants to be at
home every day

  i wish i was a citizen of this town
id go and apply for her job

  yes itd be more suitable to you than
dining-room work if goosie had the
education youve got i wouldnt keep her
around this place a minute why dont
you try for the job anyhow mr mont-
gomery the treasurer he stops in every
morning on his way to the office for a cigar
-he says i keep the best in town ill
speak to him about it in the morning i
wouldnt doubt hed hire you in a minute
i never did that kind of work i dont
know a thing about it but i believe i could
handle the job all right

  of course you could nothing to do
but make out tax receipts and take in
money i could nearly do that myself-
i could if i could write and spell a little
lietter

  there are mighty few things you
couldnt do said louise with more sin-
cerity than flattery she had seen enough
of julia cowgill to know that she was a
highly competent woman indeed

  ill speak to him about it in the morn-
ing for you its a good place to get mar-
ried from better than a dining-room re-
spectable and nice that is if a girl wants
to make it that way of course goosie
shes doin well with bill connor hell
get his engine next year and they can live
in style down in argentine but every
girl in dining-room work cant do that
well goosie aint a hired girl its like
marryin a member of the firm

  yes theres a big difference said
louise

  she had felt this difference from the
first in the attitude of the regular boarders
who were familiar with her standing
there they attempted familiarities with
her which they would not dare with the
landladys daughter subjected her to
coarse jokes and boisterous humor from
which goosie was supremely exempt

  ford langley roundhouse foreman was
one of the leading humorists of the dining-
room he was as persistent as one of
those gnats which dance and dart before
the face when one walks at evening along
a woodland path

  langley was playing up to goosie
plainly in the hope of supplanting bill
connor employing all the small flatteries
of a sycophant the most favored trick
langley had among his crude devices was
showing goosie in light superior to the
green girl

  langley would wink and smirk and pass
remarks about educated biscuit-shooters
he had many witty things to say about the
thousand ways to make money that such
a superior person knew of which biscuit-
shooting was the surest and best langley
was an under-sized dark-visaged man
with a nose sharp enough to work em-
broidery as mrs cowgill said he had
been reduced from engineer and hoped to
mount to that exalted station again in his
day louise took langleys banter with
outward indifference only now and then
giving him a cut with some clever retort
that turned the laugh to her side these
little flashes of repartee her ready efforts
to please everybody with her service no
matter how gay or how glum raised up
certain champions for her who were not
silent in her defense louise would much
rather have had them keep their peace

  goosie was friendly but cynical and im-
patient after the way of people who know
much about some common thing and hold
all the rest of the world ignorant and in
contempt try as she might louise could
not march up to the swinging door be-
tween kitchen and dining-room with a
loaded tray on her palm held at shoulder
level back up to it
and give it a kick
with anything ap-
proaching the art of
goosie

  louise had to take
the door slowly
pushing it with her
free shoulder and
edging through goosie marched out while
it was on the swing from her competent
short stories



and practiced foot louise was afraid to
risk more than half as high a stack of emp-
ties on the tray as goosie bore in triumph
to the kitchen sink where angus valorous
washed them in the midst of a clatter from
which he drew no knowing what simula-
tion of jangling freight trains and puffing
engines

  there was no romance and mighty lit-
tle dignity in the labor of carrying on food
at the cottonwood hotel perhaps there is
not much romance nor dignity in such a
job anywhere louise did not doubt that
goosies complaint of the unequal distri-
bution of work due to her assistants want
of bone and muscle and inability to master
the art of kicking open a swinging door
had led to mrs cowgills suggestion about
the court house job there was hope in
the outlook louise knew for mrs cow-
gill was a woman with a pull if her pull
with the county treasurer was only half as
strong as it was with the division superin-
tendent of the railroad louise believed
mrs cowgill could land her in maud kel-
lys place without putting her influence to
much of a strain

chapter vii

a lowly man

one day of sun turned the mud of
santa fe street into dust again
not so deep and comfortable under
a horses hoof as before yet plentiful
enough to give the two cottonwood trees
in front of the hotel a gray and familiar
look banjo gibson was sitting on the
green bench outside the door when the
whistle at the shops announced the close
of the railroad day and the men began to
arrive for supper as they passed him
banjo had a hearty word for everyone
and they were no less cordial although
somewhat patronizing and indulgent as
toward an inferior who had the special
license of a peculiar gift or genius which
lifted him almost up to their plane

  bill connor came in from his run the
first time banjo had seen him since his
return banjo had left him a wiper in
the roundhouse when he went away from
mcpacken two years before to follow the
fortunes of the medicine man now bill
had grown in bulk and consequence but
banjo knew him the moment his foot
struck the sidewalk under the awning

  it was a delightful reunion at least for
banjo he exclaimed in the wondering
pleasure that an accomplished flatterer can
make so pleasing to the object of it as he

looked bill over from his little black cap
with green visor to the soles of his oily
big shoes they were talking that way
banjo all laughter bill grinning tolerantly
his broad face sooted and black when tom
laylander came in from his first days
work as a section hand or jerry as the
men who made the road safe for the wheels
were called in derision

  hello mr gibson tom hailed
warmly and ingenuously pausing a mo-
ment a smile lighting up his face

  banjo cut short his animated talk turn-
ing slowly as if an unwelcome imperti-
nent hand had been laid on his shoulder
he looked blankly coldly into tom lay-
landers face seeming to say now who
is this rascally vagabond only he did
not say anything just stood that way
haughtily coldly displeasure contempt
in his sneering little face he turned to
bill connor again having cut the impu-
dent jerry to the bone

  tom laylanders face burned with the
insult his heart seemed to drop so low in
his mortification that it hit the ground
he went on lame of foot from his high-
heeled boots which were made for the
saddle and not the ballast bed of a rail-
road his hands were blistered by the
tamping-bar that he had swung with the
killing vigor of a greenhorn for the long-
est ten hours he ever had lived

  laylanders pistol was buckled around
him as he had worn it all day much to
the entertainment of the jerries the lea-
ther of his belt sweat-soaked and sagging
his body galled from the drag of it he
wondered what he had done to forfeit the
friendship of banjo gibson quite inno-
cent yet of the barrier that he had raised
between himself and other railroad men
when he went to work for orrin smith on
the section

  the jerry to the better paid more pleas-
antly employed railroad men was a sort of
clown a comical low fellow to be laughed
at and treated with jest and regarded with
complacent self-felicitation on ones nat-
ural and social superiority over him
these more fortunate servants of the same
master drew a rigid social line this was
as pronounced between conductor engi-
neer brakeman fireman shop mechanic
and the like on one hand the jerry on the
other as between white men and black

  mrs cowgill was fully cognizant of this
social division she knew she was going
squarely in the face of public prejudice
when she took tom laylander to board as
a section hand it did not need paps ob-
the cow jerry	

jections nor banjo gibsons scorn to tell
her this but she liked the boy she did
not have the heart to hurt him by pointing
out an inferiority that was not his that he
did not and could not feel

  but she would draw the line with tom
no other jerry could sit at her table or
sleep in her beds railroad men washed
up and put on clean collars and clean
clothes before coming to supper they
went out in the morning to the shops look-
ing like gentlemen their greasy garments
in neat rolls under their arms she knew
how the jerries at ryans came and went
in the same clothes day after day sneak-
ing a bar of soap from mrs ryan on sun-
day to wash their shirts and overalls in the
river nobody could blame a railroad
man for refusing to sit with such a crowd
at the table goosie would not wait on
men like that

  it was a big concession therefore to
lodge tom laylander after he had fallen
to the low estate of section hand it was
not mercenary she had plenty of board-
ers without him it was nothing in the
world but that assertion of tenderness and
humanity that dies so hard in peoples
breasts living in most of us long after we
believe we have smothered it in the inter-
est of our business and social success

  tom came to supper as fresh as a pink
tidy in a clean shirt and necktie his cou-
gar-skin vest hiding his suspenders from
the ladies eyes mrs cowgill believed he
even had gone to the trouble to shave
orrin smith the section boss had finished
his supper and gone goosie had put a pair
of cowhands at his table she was sitting
at the foot of the long common table tak-
ing her supper with bill connor every-
body else had cleaned up his pie and
gone

  mrs cowgill led tom to a little table
in a secluded corner even farther away
from the center of activities than she had
iutended it was a pleasant situation be-
side a window the evening wind was
blowing the draggled lace curtains bring-
ing in with it a scent of curing prairie hay

  after you wait on tom take your own
supper mrs cowgill directed louise
goosie shes about through shell catch
anybody that happens in

  tom hung his gun on the back of his
chair and stood a moment hesitantly def-
erential as if he could not bring himself
to sit down first in the presence of a lady
his face was red from the heat and sweat
of the day which something that he had
put on it out of a little bottle with a rib-

bon around its neck had stimulated this
was a lotion thought to be very balmy and
refreshing to the freshly shaved railroad
face it was in strong demand at earl
grays drug store

  youre late mr laylander there
isnt much left louise said

  anything the cook can throw on a dish
will do tom replied growing redder as
if the lotion struck deeper every moment

  liver or steak louise inquired try-
ing to look and feel detached and indiffer-
ent as became her profession but fighting
a great deal harder to keep from smiling
in the ingenuous young mans face i
could get you some french fried if you
like them

  i love em tom declared with such
ardent simplicity that the smile could be
restrained no longer

  louise looked up tom still standing
beside the chair tall and bashful and red

looked down each smiled into the oth-
ers eyes and both felt more comfortable
the constraint removed the way to some-
thing friendly even steak and liver made
clear

  i recommend the steak said louise
itll hit me fine maam said tom
hand on the back of the chair as respect-
fully as if he waited for the roadmaster
or the section boss or the governor or
somebody equally high and important to
depart but im not in any kind of a
hurry tom protested you go ahead
and get your own supper first

  certainly not louise returned so de-
cisively it made the young man start as if
cal withers had taken a shot at him
through the window but ill take it
along with you-if you dont mind lou-
ise proposed smiling away the confusion
her apparently snappish refusal had
brought upon him	v

  ill be honored and delighted said
tom ive been wantin to have a little
talk with you ever since you stepped out

there in the road-

  wait till i bring on the supper she
suggested

  tom found himself up against a ledge
	short stories

when it came to going into the subject of
his obligation to louise for stepping be-
tween him and cal withers when the odds
stood so heavily against him that day it
was past and it deserved nothing but to
be forgotten she said

  thats easy to say miss gardner
maam but not so easy done i owe you
nothing short of my life theyd a got
me that time i didnt know he was goin
to bring out a bunch of them

  they say its his way but forget
about it mr laylander she put her
hand on his with a quick hovering touch
like the lighting of a bird looking her ap-
peal for no more thanks into his eyes

  ill have to let it pass then with this
said till youre better paid he yielded
please just call me tom im nothing at
all but a common jerry now

  and im nothing but a common bis-
cuit-shooter  call me louise but why do
you say youre nothing but a jerry a
jerry is the same as any other railroader to
me

  not to everybody said tom shaking
his head sadly it didnt strike me that
it was such a poor and low-down job till
that little banjo gibson man refused to
speak to me this evenin he acted like
id given him a mortal insult

  oh that little loafer

  he was standin talkin to that man
over at the table with miss goosie he
was plumb mortified and ashamed

  how do you know it was because
youre a jerry 

  i asked that angus boy he was in-
sulted too he said a jerry didnt have
any business hornin in amongst railroad
men

  it appears that were both social out-
casts then tom they kid me because
i fell from book-agent to biscuit-shooter
and it seems like a comical sort of one at
that they guy me till i feel like break-
ing dishes on them sometimes especially
ford langley he seems to have a dia-
bolical sort of pleasure in turning the
laugh against me

  louise laughed but it was only a pre-
tense as tom laylander must have been
very stupid indeed if he had not seen

  ill speak to the scoundrel he said
the fire of indignation in his eyes

  please dont-he isnt worth it let
them laugh theres nothing else in life for
them they cant think who knows but
you and i may have our own private little
laugh one of these days  maybe well not
always be biscuit-shooters and jerries

  yes youll rise up and pass on tom
said in his quaint soft way of speaking
i can see it in the cards you will but
for me i cant see anything more than a
trampled trail crisscrossed till it makes
my eyes ache to try to read it

  louise looked across the little table into
his face startled alert a question or
rather an appeal in her concentrated at-
tention another man had appeared for
a moment from behind the ingenuous sim-
plicity of this texas cowboy he had
spoken and stepped back again leaving
the curtain that masked him scarcely agi-
tated to show that he had passed tom
was looking out of the window his thin
whitish eyebrows drawn making little
wrinkles run across his narrow combative
forehead from the bridge of his nose

  trampled trails she repeated thought-
fully but theyre broader when theyre
trampled tom and easier to follow
along

  i mean when a lot of people have got
the start over you and gone ahead he
explained they trample out the tracks
of the thing youre tryin to overtake and
throw your rope on mixin it up so you
cant tell whether youre on the right road
or a blind one that spreads out to open
range and nowhere in the end thats
what bothers a man maam-miss lou-
ise

what have you been following tom
that youve lost in this crisscrossed road
tom turned from the window and met
her inquiring perplexed eyes with a look
of leaping eagerness in his own

  i started out to make a man of my-
self miss louise i wanted to get an
education in my head and turned out some-
thing better than a cowman down among
the postoaks on the brazos circum-
stances miss louise jerked the rope out
of my hand the animal i thought i was
about to throw and brand loped off and
left me gappin after it like a fool i dont
guess ill ever overtake it any more
how long were you in the university
tom

  i left in the middle of my junior year
miss louise but how did you know
the brand must be so dim on me by now
itd take a spyglass to see it

  not so dim she said do you plan
to go back

  no ill turn my face elsewhere miss
louise ill go on tryin to pick up some-
thing on the start ive got while im wait-
in for the road to run a little plainer un-
der my feet
the cow jerry



  but you could go back tom
maam said tom the cowboy in
complete possession again staring into her
animated face with bewildered eyes
when you sell your cattle i mean
when i sell em maam i aint even
got em to sell

  you will have them youre bound to
beat that old thief

  my lawyer says well beat him he
says the note withers holds over me was
outlawed in this state five years-ago if it
never was paid but i tell you miss
louise if my father ever owed that man
ten thousand dollars that long ago it was
paid

  he ought to have been careful to get
his note back she said

  they were awful careless about such
little things in those days miss louise
little things it seems to me a lot of
money to loan on nothing but an unse-
cured note as withers says this one
was

  no not so very much in the old
days when cattlemen were makin money
that wasnt any more to my father than
ten dollars would be to one of these self-
admirin railroad men they just handed
such little sums around among themselves
without a line of writin most of the time
that was only small change in the days
range cattle paid

  it was a careless way to handle small
change anyhow

  yes it does seem so tom admitted
gloomily withers says my father bor-
rowed it when he had a herd up here on

kansas grass a long time ago i never
heard about it if he did ive wrote to
mother to search the old books itll be
down there if father ever borrowed mon-
ey from withers and made his note for
he was a careful man about writin down
his records i didnt tell mother id been
attached i just said colonel withers had
put in a claim

  that was better than the whole truth
t think have you seen withers since
that-since he put the attachment on your
herd 

  i havent had the pleasure of meetin
him said tom with peculiar stress

  i saw him here in town swelling around
with two guns on today he had a gang
with him four or five limber-jims as mrs
cowgill calls them they trailed after
him wherever he went like a lot of
dogs

  im not astonished to hear of it said
tom

  tom her hand on his again in that im-
pulsive open and ingenuous way of ar-
resting attention and holding it i cant
ask you to keep out of his way im not
going to ask you to dodge him but dont
hunt him up tom please dont hunt him
up if you see him here in town some
evening spreading it around that way just
let him strut-dont rush out and begin
to shoot

  id like to do most anything to please
you miss louise said tom his face very
red as if what she had asked of him made
him ashamed

  withers will try to provoke you to
make the first break the way you did be-
fore dont you see his scheme they
say its his old trick to have the slim ex-
cuje of defending his life it puts the law
on his side technically as the lawyers say
what i mean is let him start it next time
let him come to you dont you go to
him

  circumstances i expect would have to
control my actions miss louise i see
the point of your argument and ill try to
keep it in my mind id rather not have
any ruction with him till after the law dis-
poses of my case

  it would be much better it would be so
much more in your favor and remem-
ber if you do meet him let him make the
first break youd just as well have the
law on your side as his

  thats mighty good advice and ill do
my best to follow after it miss louise

  so they sat over their supper and talked
those two inferiors among the railroad
aristocracy jokes both of them to the
hogheads and shacks and clinker-pullers
mainly because they were people who had
been up and had come down

  bill connor sitting beside goosie easy
in that proprietary feeling of a man who
knows his situation is secure lit a cigar and
flipped the match contemptuously toward
the table where the jerry and the biscuit-
shooter sat

  looks like shes took a kid to raise he
said

chapter viii

fanning bullets

orrin smith gave tom a little
fatherly advice that night on the
proper costume and deportment of
a jerry as a consequence of it tom ap-
peared next day clad in blue overalls and
brogans when the gang arrived at the
place where the days work was to be done
tom left his gun on the handcar with the
jerries dinner pails smith said he had
no objection to any of his men wearing
guns coming and going to work but he
didnt want them encumbered by weapons
out on the track a mans enemies were
not likely to seek him there in the pres-
ence of so much company said smith

  tom accepted the bosss view of the
case cheerfully there was not much of
a texas look about him that day except
his old dingy-white stetson which bobbed
around among the jerries miscellaneous
headgear as prominently as a white duck
in a flock of gray ones mike quinn
toms working partner wore a narrow-
brimmed little dicer with holes cut in the
sides of it to let the air in to his brain he
said he advised tom gravely to lay
aside that fine costly sombrero for festive
occasions and get himself one that would
not represent such a big investment or be
so subject to damage from contact with
black oil and the hard knocks of a track-
mans life

  tom was respectful toward mike quinn
and his advice as he was toward all sug-
gestions serious and jocose offered by
his fellow toilers this readiness to lis-
ten his polite bearing and soft speech
quickly made a way for tom where a
flippant smart fellow would have found it
hard going the gang adopted him very
much in the way that a household adopts a
strange animal and took a vast pride in
the distinction of having the only cowboy
jerry that ever was known

  the jerries were proud of toms re-
fined and deferential manners proud of
the pistol that he wore to and from work
and hung on the lever of the handcar
proud of his big sombrero which he re-
tained against all argument to get him out
of it at first after a week they would
have felt hurt and affronted if tom had
appeared in any other hat

  section gangs in those times were made
up mainly of old-timers who had followed
the steel from the lackawanna to the
santa fe grizzled men with thick arms

and mighty chests good dhrinkin men
as they described themselves with pride
nearly all of them were irish who had
come to america young and stepped from
the ship to the ties they were a craft to
themselves as distinctive as sailors with a
speech full of terms applying to their trade
mystifying and foreign to the ears of the
uninitiated a careless spendthrift hardy
set of rovers veterans of the army that
pushed the rails across desert and moun-
tains not insensible of the romance of
their past or the sacrifice of their service
to their kind

  few of them ever rose to be bosses or
more than straw-bosses at the best owing
to their illiteracy they never learned
any more about railroad building and
maintenance than the routine of their daily
toil nor cared to learn they were land
sailors who had learned the ropes it was
not for them to be captains and they knew
it very well

  once in a while there was one to be met
like mike quinn mike was a reading
man although as good a drinking man as
ever breasted the bar he could discourse
about the pyramids and the missouri
river about napoleon and brigham
young he followed politics and read
the prize-fight news to the jerries under
the cottonwood trees at mrs ryans
boarding house beside the track it took
a crafty man at an argument to get ahead
of mike who would come around with un-
expected quips and turns

  trainmen were greatly amused by the
sight of tom laylander in his big hat

humping over a
tamping- pick in-
finitely diverted
by his gun swing-
ing on the hand-
car lever at the
side of the track
they called him
the cow jerry
the news of his presence on the section at
mcpacken went up and down the line

  firemen stood in the cab doors to look
at him as they passed some of them mak-
ing facetious gestures of drawing a gun
or swinging a rope brakemen on the
tops of freight trains varied these to tom
questionably comical antics by whooping
and prancing around in imitation of a
bronco

  all of these cracks at him on the part
of the intellectuals taken in addition to the
general run of mockery and derision
thrown at the jerries in passing began to
the cow jerry



nettle tom after a while all railroaders
were alike to him these on the trains only
fellow-servants of the same master served
by the section men it seemed small busi-
ness to tom this imitating the pumping
of a handcar driving spikes lining track
which so amused brakemen and firemen
conductors and engineers to their ever-
lasting credit and respect in tom lay-
landers memory never stooped to these
mocking frivolities

  where it hit tom was its intentional
insult and malignancy or perhaps insolent
exultation over men placed by chance or
misfortune or choice and proud enough
in their selection in this lowly way of
earning their daily chuck he resented
this attitude strongly often speaking his
mind on it to mike quinn who as regu-
larly came forward with his philosophy to
calm his indignation

  consither the source said mike as
the man said whin the jackass kicked him
and let it pass

  it took all of mikes philosophy as well
as such of his own as he could command
to hold tom from pitching a rock at
windy moore when he went by prancing
and making derisive pantomime leaning
over and shouting cow jerry ya-a-a
ya-a-a

  this happened every second day when
windy passed windy was not a very
high man in the aristocracy of trainmen
being nothing more than brakeman on the
local freight which was the very begin-
ning in fact of the long and bumpy road
to the conductors seat in the cupola of a
caboose windy had a long way to go
before arriving among the great but he
was ages in the evolution of labor above
the lowly state of section hand

  let ye stand on your dignity lad and
lave em pass mike advised if the
poor crathurs get any pleasure out of their
prancin and dancin and posthurin around
let em have it theyre a lot of poor
ignorant fellys that never read a book of
histhory in their lives savages they are
lad the nagur savages in the wilds of
africa makes faces at strangers and
prance and mock and posthure in insultin
capers the same as these poor brakeys do
tryin to provoke the first blow

  these boxcar lads think theyre the
important men in railroadin they are
not jtake away the section boss and his
gang for tin days and lave the thrack go
where would these fine lads land in the
ditch with the freight cars on top of
them and not one among the lot with sitise

enough in the head of im to dhrive a spike

  its the lads on the thrack that count
in railroadin nobody else take you and
me spikin these ties what would hap-
pen if we spread the rails or dhrawed em
three or four inches out o gauge aither
way where would windy moore be
when the ingin sthrook the spot sailin
through the wind like a mateor rammin
the head iv im in the ditch let em go
i tell ye lad let em pass

  this argument aside from mikes preju-
dice in favor of his own calling had con-
siderable truth to enforce it tom realized
but it did not excuse the offense nor pal-
liate the sting he studied the worst of-
fenders windy moore among them mark-
ing each man well as the days passed
they became familiar figures both on the
road and in the streets of mcpacken he
waited for them to try some of their funny
business with him when they stood man to
man on the ground

  this never happened while the cow
jerry was an object of great entertainment
and ribald mockery to brakemen and fire-
men going by at thirty or fifty miles an
hour he was no funnier than any other
man when met on the streets in town
trainmen passed him there without a word
or wink as oblivious to his presence on
earth it appeared as one of the myriad
leaves on mrs cowgills cottonwood trees
if there was no spoken insult in this pass-
ing him over as if he did not exist there
was no aggression tom was satisfied to
have it that way in town he would have
been happy and comfortable if they would
have given him the same peace out on the
road

  let them have their joke said tom even
at his expense though what there was so
diverting and comical in the aspect of a
man who had ridden the range all his life
coming down to railroading he could not
see for it was a come-down on his part
it would have been just as much of a come-
down to laylander shoveling coal into an
engine firebox or trotting the tops of box-
cars as tamping ties on the section rail-
roading was all railroading to him one job
as respectable as another all of it far be-
low the freedom and independence of the
range

  it was a comfort to tom that he was not
to be a regular railroader that he was us-
ing the job as a temporary bridge to cross
the few weeks which lay between him and
the recovery of his cattle it might be
well he considered if he could enter into
the spirit of the thing with the trainmen
o

short stories

and show them that he also looked on his
present occupation as a joke

  this notion pleased him he went
grinning around at his work while he
turned over certain schemes for expressing
his appreciation of their humorous banter
to the passing brakemen windy moore in
particular the more he thought of it the
better it pleased him mike quinn asked
him if he had found a purse

  toms opportunity to put his plan of
responsive appreciation into practice came
when he had been a little more than a
month on the gang the jerries were go-
ing home from their days work of picking
up joints when overtaken by the local
freight which came pounding toward mc-
packen with a long train of empties gath-
ered at way stations during the day the
local was late the engineer in a great
sweat to make in to mcpacken out of
humor with the dispatcher for laying him
out everywhere for the numerous stock
extras which had kept the rails hot that
day

  this thing of overtaking a handcar and
forcing the jerries to look lively for a spot
to drag it off their excited flinging of
shovels and bars to lighten it if they had
time their shouts and agile jumping
about always amused trainmen as no other
bit of comedy in the days work there
were always two or three old jerries in
every gang who went to pieces in a pinch
of that kind invoking the protection of the
saints laying hold of coats dinner pails
tools flinging them without regard or di-
rection or the assistance or impediment of
the urgent work in hand

  orrin smiths crew was no exception in
this regard there were three handcar-
loads of terriers in his gang proceeding
that evening in close order toward the tool
house most of them smoking comfortably
pumping with leisurely stroke standing so
thick that few could get more than one
hand on the levers

  smith was riding on the first car watch-
ing back for the local which he knew had
not passed and was hours late it caught
them on a straight piece of track with
plenty of time to get the cars off but the
nervous old-timers strewed the right of
way with shovels picks and dinner buck-
ets flinging them as if they jettisoned the
cargo of a floundering ship

  this scene of excitement ahead of them
the bright pails flashing covers flying off
coats sailing with arms outspread gave a
seasoning to the humor of the situation for
the trainmen which even the crusty en-

gineer unfixed his face to enjoy the
fireman came to the right-hand side of the
cab-the jerries were going off the rails
on that side-where he stood grinning
as the engine flashed by he made the sign
which commonly passed in such cases
smashing his right fist into his left palm
spreading his hands with an upward motion
of dispersion complete obliteration illus-
trative of a burst rocket nothing left but
the smoke thats whats going to hap-
pen to this gang of jerries one of these
days smart as you are well get you yet
so this sign of collision and dismember-
ment meant

  windy moore was standing on top of a
boxcar about midway of the long train
leaning against the wind his loose over-
alls flagging around his skinny legs as
he approached the jerries scattered around

their hastily removed handcars picking up
their coats looking for pipes that had been
lost in the wild throwing off windy came
over to the edge of the car roof where he
leaned derision wide in his mocking face

  tom laylander was standing by smok-
ing a cigarette he was in a glow of
quickened blood the little flurry having
been quite to his liking a welcome break
in the monotony of a long and grinding
day his pistol was in its scuffed holster
against his leg his big hat threw a slant-
wise shadow across his face jerrying
wouldnt be a bad job at all if there was
more of this kind of stuff in it he thought
and there came windy moore across his
moment of pleasure leaning out to fling
his taunt and jeer

  cow jerry ya-a-a yelled windy
moore singling tom out for his malicious
witticism as always

  windy passed in a roar and swirl of
dust his long-drawn ya-a-a-a streaming
after him as seeds fly out of a milkweed
pod when it is held to the wind tom
pulled out his gun between puffs on his
little cigarette and threw a shot over the
top of windy moores boxcar plugging
another one after it so fast it followed
the same hole through the air

  the bullets must have whispered some-
thing new to windy moore something
that he could hear above the roar and jan-
gle of the loose-jointed freight he
stooped and dodged fanning the wind as
if fighting a sudden attack of hornets
looking all the time for some place to go
there never was a little brakeman on that
division with such urgent business behind
him as windy moore had for the next
few seconds tom laylander standing
back at the other end of the quick-stretch-
ing distance emptying his gun over the
boxcar that windy rode

  the train was going fast but not fast
enough for windy he was near the end
of the car but it was the wrong end the
ladder was on the side of the shooting cow
jerry windy even outran the train when
he broke for the forward end of the box-
car where he grabbed the top bracket of
the ladder and swung himself to safety on
the opposite side

  stop shootin at that man orrin
smith yelled his face white in the fear for
his job that rushed over him

  the caboose jerked by leaving the jer-
ries in sudden silence

  what do you mean shootin at that
man smith demanded his order to hit
the grit and look for another job plain to
his excited eyes

  i wasnt shootin at him tom cor-
rected his boss grinning in the pleasure of
recalling windy moore fanning the bul-
lets away from his ears i was only
shootin to-wards him

  dang the difference dang the differ-
ence  said smith who was a notably tem-
perate man

when you shoot at a man you hit him
tom explained thats the difference
mr smith

  smith was a man with thick sloping
shoulders like a bottle his voice was
in the front of his mouth his words came
out with a blab like the bleat of a sheep

  theyll report it theyll report it the
minute they hit town well git them
cars on-git them cars on

  smith looked mighty glum the rest of
the way to the tool house sitting on the
water keg with his foot beside the brake
the jerries were silent throwing a ham
into the little old handcar with unusual
vigor they looked at tom with slanting
glances rolling their eyes keeping their
faces straight ahead they acted like a
crowd of boys accessory to a disastrous
prank by one of their number anxious to
prove by their present conduct that they
were in no manner implicated nor to blame

  smith brought the handcar to a stop
before the tool house door foot on the
brake he looked up with reproachful sever-
ity at tom who was swinging to the
ground

  youre fired said smith

  im sorry if i hurt your feelins mr
smith tom said rather jolted by this
unexpected ending of what he had meant
to be nothing more than a pleasant prank
you and your dang gun shootin
around here

  yes sir said tom feeling decidedly
foolish

  ill give you your time this evenin
im through with gun-toters on my sec-
tion

 san franciscos chinatown yields another mystery for the police to solve

 and shows once again how different are the standards of the east

it was a hurry-up call from detec- 
tive lyons of the chinatown squad
that took me to the san francisco
police station that rainy morning in
march otherwise i wouldnt have
stirred from my rooms a peace ban-
quet given by members of the four
brothers tong which i had attended as a
guest of my old friend chen wan had
kept me up late the evening before i
hurried through my dressing and left my
comfortable bachelor quarters only because 
detective lyons very mysteriously in-
sisted that he must see me at once

  i found lyons at his desk in the de-
tective rooms he was leaning back in
his chair his feet on the desk a big cigar
gripped in one corner of his strong jaws

i remember noting that he appeared per-
fectly calm yet there was an odd texture
to his florid skin that made him seem al-
ways red-faced and perspiring at sight
of me he swung his feet to the floor with
a bang and moved out an extra chair

   lo minturn nasty morning

  i sat down did you get me out of
bed just- to tell me something i could see
from my window

  lyons grunted and glanced around the
room we were alone he looked stead-
ily at me for a space seen chan wan
lately

  last night

  say anything-particular

  why no i replied and i remember
how his sharp eyes searched my face
why

  for reply lyons picked up a sheet of
paper and handed it to me i knew in-
stantly that it was from some chinese for
i have never known a caucasian to use
that peculiar rice paper it was written
however in english and in a rather fem-
inine hand

  i read the letter out loud

    mr lyons-you better watch out for
  chan wan svme bad chinese have
  hired ah hing to kill him i tell you
  because chan wan is friend mine long
  time also killing makes bad business
  for chinatown

from a good chinaman

  surprise as i read this letter was
swiftly overshadowed by dismay and
alarm chen and i were old friends hav-
ing met years ago when i was doing under
cover work for the treasury department
and later while i was studying oriental
languages at the u c he was one of
the finest types of the younger chinese
that i have ever met quiet perfect in his
manners impatient at times with the old
customs of his people and somewhat too
eager to have them adopt american ways
i knew that his fearless fight against the
the hand at the window



iniquitous tong system had made him many
powerful enemies in
chinatown and that more
than once his life had
hung by the merest thread
now it seemed definite
plans had been made to
murder him

  well lyons harsh
voice broke in impatiently
what do you know about
it

  no more than you
i replied you know
chen has tried to stop the
tong wars that he has
tried to get them to go
back to their original ben-
evolent purpose and that
there is a price on his head placed there
by the gang of professional blackmailers
and killers who have gained control of the
hep ben tong and corrupted it to what it
is today and you know as well as i do
that if chen wan is murdered it will be
one of the blackest deeds in all of china-
towns black history

  youre excited scoffed lyons get
down to earth do you know this bird
they have hired-this ah hing

  there are many ah hings in china-
town i replied testily the ah as you
know is merely a meaningless syllable
hing is the given name without the fam-
ily name we cannot identify him ah
hing alone is about the same as saying
hey john 

  i suppose i know him mused lyons
but not by that name what do you make
of the letter any idea who this good
chinaman is who wrote it

  not the slightest i judge from the
phrasing that it was written by some
chinese who uses broken english thats
all i see

  fine all we gotta do is find a chink
who uses broken english minturn youd
make a big killin as a deteckative listen
would a chink who uses broken english
be able to write such a good hand and
wouldnt he-or she-misspell a word now
and then of course this letter was
written by some educated man-or woman
-who slung in them queer phrases just to
throw me off the track

  i looked the letter over again i be-
lieve youre right i agreed and then
threw the letter back on his desk but
what of it what does that signify
lyons leaned back in his chair his big
blunt fingers began drumming on the desk

i dont know he said shaking his head
i wish i-

  he stopped abruptly at the sound of the
hall door being opened i dont know why
we looked around so sharply i remember
thinking that it was probably one of the
detectives coming in for day duty or per-
haps someone calling to report a theft
but it wasnt as the door swung back
slowly we saw an old chinese standing
hesitantly in the doorway

  he was an old man with hideously gaunt
face and burning eyes a shabby blouse
and cheap cotton trousers hung loosely
over his frail body i remember the
thought came to me that i had seen this
man before but that was nothing there
is something about every chinese that re-
minds one of some other

  the caller lifted a bony hand and re-
moved his greasy cap hullo he said
tonelessly

 hello hoppy snapped lyons
whaddye want

  old hoppy i remembered him then
chinatowns oldest opium smoker a piti-
ful relic of a day gone by

  mista lyons said hoppy in that
same toneless voice my name-ah hing
i saw lyons big shoulders and bullet
head draw in his eyes stabbed at the let-
ter lying on his desk flashed up at me
warningly then switched to the face of
old hoppy hing

  come in he ordered shut the
door

  i started to my feet but lyons motioned
me down the old man meanwhile shuf-
fled in and closed the door he stood
now by lyons desk his gaunt face ex-
pressionless save for the burning eyes-
eyes in which lay all the tell-tale scars of
the confirmed hop

  i remember the sense of relief that
swept over me then opium smokers are
notoriously untrustworthy ah hing had
been hired to slay chen wan a man
against whom he had no enmity some
memory perhaps in his drug-darkened
mind had awakened at the last moment
and instead of carrying out the evil plot
he had come to tell lyons all about it

  i looked at lyons and prayed that he
wouldnt bungle things face to face now
with the big rough-handed detective ah
hing might lose his courage and back out
i could see that his hands-long bony
hands dangling beneath the frayed sleeves
of his blouse-were trembling violently

  all right ah hing said lyons
eagerly tell us all about it
	short

 ah hing gulped nervously chen
wan-

  yes said lyons as ah hing hesitated
tell us about chen wan

  jus now-i killem

  never can i forget the unearthly mono-
tone in which the old man uttered that
sentence it was like some ghastly ir-
revocable voice from the tomb in the
dead silence that followed i became aware
of shuffling steps out in the hall some-
one laughed boisterously

  then lyons and  were on our feet
the big detective seized ah hing by the
shoulders a crushing grip that made the
old man quail he tried to draw back
from the officers out-thrust jaws and
blazing eyes

  you did it eh you did it you damned
yellow murderer

  ah hing nodded his head stupidly i
killem he repeated in that same expres-
sionless voice

  lyons stared at the man for a moment
then released him swiftly the detectives
big hands went over ah hings body look-
ing for weapons finding none he shoved
the old man down into the chair i had
vacated

  are you sure about it i spoke up
is-is chen dead

  ah hing raised a bony hand ku kwo
shan lok he said in that same ghastly
tone he is dead

  who paid you to do it demanded
lyons the truth now

  ah hing shook his head no pay
he muttered no pay and then in his
broken english he told how he had gone
down the hall and rapped on chen wans
door chen had admitted him without
question as chen turned around to close
the door ah hing had struck one swift
savage lunge with the chinese knife-and
the thing was done

  i shuddered at the picture drawn so cold-
bloodedly by old hing the act was so
utterly wanton chen had known all along
that his life was in danger yet because it
was against his principles he had steadily
refused to hire gunmen to protect him he
had trusted ah hing and ah hing had
taken advantage of it what the old man
lacked in strength he made up with his
devilish oriental knowledge of just how to
wield the long blade

  his reason for coming direct from the
scene of his crime to confess was typical
of chinese reasoning im ol man-no
money-no fiends mebbe soon i die any-
way

stories

  lyons turned to me i dont think he
worked alone but theres no use in trying
to get anything out of him now well hit
for chinatown right now ill phone the
wagon from there lord man i wish i
didnt have to do this chen wan was my
friend-the whitest man in chinatown
at that i caught old hing by the shoul-
der whirled him around why did you
do it  i flung at him in angry cantonese
why did you kill chen wan

  at the sound of his own language com-
ing from my lips ah hing started vio-
lently his eyes
blazed at me for
an instant then
shifted no
sabby he mut-
t e r e d no
sabby

  y o u speak
falsely i cried
in the awkward
phrasing of the
cantonese
listen to me ah hing-for the murder
of my friend chen wan you are going to
prison and you are going to have a rope
put around your neck and hang until you
are dead hear that now tell me all
quickly who paid you to do this thing
a spasm shot through ah hings wasted
frame without looking up at me he spoke
in that same dull monotone but he spoke
this time in his own cantonese

  chen wan was my enemy i have
killed him as was my duty as for your
prison i do not care i am an old man
it is time for me to die tsau kom lok
we were soon on our way to chinatown
lyons and i together ah hing trailing
along some distance behind in the charge
of squadman darwood

  chen wans rooms were on canton
street but like so many buildings in china-
town there was an alley entrance i was
not surprised when lyons went down this
alley to the rear of the building where
chen roomed

  lyons paused there in the drizzling rain
and busied himself lighting a cigar but i
knew that all the time his sharp little eyes
were taking in the surroundings-the nar-
row alley the shadowy stairways fire-
escapes and irregular roofs there were
quite a few chinese about for an alley in
chinatown is not always a dumping place
more often it is a very narrow but very
busy thoroughfare it was a motley
stream ranging from a fat and repulsive
butcher in filthy overalls to a dignified old
the hand at the window



merchant in crinkly black satin and carry-
ing a gold-handled umbrella but they were
all moving no one seemed to be inter-
ested in the stairway that led up to chens
rooms

  these rooms were on the second floor of
a small brick building just across the alley
from where we stood i noticed that his
two windows were closed save for a space
of several inches from the top and that
the shades were down i said nothing
about this for lyons knew chen wans
habits as well as i the two of us having
visited chen many many times when
lyons crossed the alley i waited until he
had vanished in the stairway then fol-
lowed once out of sight i quickened my
steps and caught up with lyons as he
turned off the stairs at the second floor

  the main hallway narrow gloomy and
deserted so far as i could see was in the
form of an l chen wans door was
around the corner at the extreme end of
the hall lyons paused at the head of the
stairs as though listening but i could hear
nothing save the -monotonous drum of the
rain on the tin roof then we started
down the hall our footsteps making no
noise on the matting that covered the
floor

  we were almost to the turn in the hall
when i got a shock i could not say that
i saw the man my mind was on the
ghastly thought of what we must face in
chen wans room my gaze on the broad
shoulders and bullet head of detective
lyons just ahead of me yet as we passed
the embrasure of a deep and gloomy door-
way i was sure that i caught the flash of
slant eyes and i felt more than saw that
someone crouched there in the shadows

  one learns many lessons in chinatown
and i had learned enough that i refrained
from turning my head around the cor-
ner out of sight i caught lyons by the
arm and with my hands cupped over his
big ear whispered what i had seen i
knew by the look that flashed over his face
that he was thinking the same as i-that
anyone hiding in that gloomy hall was not
there for any good purpose

  then i saw him turn and look down the
hall toward chens door this door
dimly visible in the half-dark was at the
end of the hall as i have said and facing
us at the left of the door was a very
narrow passage that served only as an
outlet to the fire-escape on the alley lyons
knew this and i felt that i knew what
was passing through his mind i was not
surprised when he motioned for me to be

silent turned and tiptoed back to the cor-
ner

  lyons was just turning the corner when
i heard chens door open astonished i
whirled around and shrank back against
the wall

  there was a light in chens room sil-
houetted against that light two people
stood in the open doorway one was a
chinese girl whom i instantly recognized
as lo shan a tea-server in the east wind
cafe she was clad as usual in odd but
modest chinese pantaloons and tight-fit-
ting blouse of blue satin embroidered with
silk that glistened in the light her black
hair done in that queer oriental style was
aglitter with ornaments of gold and jade
she was crying

  the other person was chen wan

  what reaction i may have felt on dis-
covering that my friend chen was alive i
do not recall for chens door was no
sooner open than things happened swiftly

  the two saw me and stopped short the
girl with a little gasp chen with a sudden
stiffening of his body i felt certain that
chen did not recognize me and i opened
my mouth to speak but instead i shouted
a warning as i saw what neither chen nor
the girl saw-a figure glide from the
passageway on the left swiftly as light
my mind registered two things-the black
slouch hat of the tongman the flash of an
upraised knife

  i shouted but my voice was buried ir
the smashing roar of lyons revolver

  the girl screamed i heard chen utter
a cry blinded by the stinging powder
smoke i could not see chen nor the girl

  i looked around at lyons he was
crouching low his gun gripped close to his
body his big jaws thrust out his little eyes
blazing through half closed lids

  then lyons whirled suddenly and van-
ished around the corner again his big
police revolver sent a crashing reverbera-
tion through the hall i turned then and
ran down the hall toward chens door
chen i cried its i-minturn

  chen wan looked up at me at the girl
crouching against the wall her jeweled
hands over her face then he pointed to
the tongman lying on the floor

  so i see said chen wan with his
devilish calmness and i suppose it was
lyons who did this

  yes i answered and i could not down
a shudder the bullet from the detectives
big gun had caught the tongman on the
left temple and smashed clear through the
front of his head passing out at the other


short stories

temple it was a ghastly but instantly
fatal wound

  perceiving that chen was in no need of
help i turned again and ran back to give
lyons a hand but that proved to be un-
necessary i
found him
snapping the
cuffs on the
man i had seen
hiding in the
doorway

  then squad-
man darwood
gun in hand
came pounding
up the stairs

  wheres ah hing demanded lyons

   parked him with westcott and-

  tell westcott to stand below and keep
everybody out then you get ah hing

  darwood left detective lyons turned
to me into chens room he barked
well get at the bottom of this now

  by the time darwood returned with ah
hing we were all in chen wans room
lyons prisoner gagged and handcuffed
was hidden in a closet the dead tong-
man lay on the floor a towel over his face
chen wan at lyons orders stood be-
hind the bed-screen

  detective lyons pointed down at the
dead man but his little eyes were fastened
on the face of old ah hing so you did
that eh he barked you killed chen
wan 

  ah hing lifted unblinking eyes and faced
the detectives gaze i killem he de-
clared and nodded his head

  all right boys lyons called out and
at his signal the towel was snatched off the
face of the dead tongman the prisoner was
brought from the closet and chen wan
stepped from behind the screen and faced
ah hing

  there was a moment of tense silence
 was looking at ah hing amazed by the
devilishly inhuman coolness with which he
faced that disclosure not a muscle of
his saffron face moved as he looked stead-
ily at detective lyons and presently i saw
the light in his eyes grow dull a transfor-
mation that is only one of the amazing
peculiarities of the oriental eye and one
that i can liken only to when one views the
windows of a room from which the light
is slowly withdrawn i knew what that
meant ah hing had closed the windows
of his soul come what may he would
tell the foreign devil police-nothing

  the silence was broken by the sharp

crackling of a match i looked around
chen wan was calmly lighting a cigarette

  mr lyons he said in his carefully
enunciated english lo shan has told me
all

  i remember how everyone looked sud-
denly at the girl she was standing by the
wall farthest from us as though trying to
shrink from our sight now she averted
her face quickly but not before i saw that
she was no longer crying that her dark
eyes held a look of exultant and defiant
happiness

  then we were listening to the cool in-
cisive voice of chen wan as he told us of
the plot against his life a conspiracy so
fantastic in its conception that outside of
chinatown the thing would seem incredible

  you have sent so many tong-killers to
prison the past year that they are becoming
afraid of the american police said chen
wan they plan a killing with the ut-
most care and yet every time some tong-
man goes to prison they say it isnt al-
ways the right tongman but the result so
far as the tongs are concerned is the same
eh lyons

  go on with your story said the big
detective grinning

  chen wan smiled so-by a devious
course of chinese reasoning they arrived
at the conclusion that the only sure way of
murdering me without having a police in-
vestigation and another tongman sent to
prison was to find someone who while
not willing to commit an actual crime
would obligingly confess to the crime and
take the consequences

  ah hing as you would say filled the
bill he is an old man with neither friends
nor money and what is worse he is a
slave to opium the only reason he hasnt
killed himself is that he cant pay his debts
you smile at that mr lyons but that is
because after all you do not know the
chinese mind like m inturn and i know it
to commit suicide is honorable but to do
so without first paying ones obligations-
well it simply isnt done as minturn
would say

  but these plotters showed ah hing a
way out no sum of money could induce
him to commit the actual crime but since

i	was to be slain anyway he saw no rea-
son why he should not profit by it so on
consideration that they promise to pay all
his debts ah hing agreed to confess to
murdering me-and take the consequences

  of course these two men who were to
do the actual slaying had no dealings with
ah hing all arrangements were made
the hand at the window

by wo sang whom we shall have no
trouble locating to make the case even
stronger against ah hing this wo sang
had a letter written telling you that ah
hing had been hired to kill me wo sang
set the hour of my death and told ah hing
to be in the alley beneath my window at
that time it was agreed that when the
deed had been done one of these men
would put his hand against the window
pane ah hing seeing the hand at the
window was to go at once to the police
station and confess

   these arrangements were finally set-
tled only last night at the east wind cafe
lo shan happened to overhear enough that
she could guess the rest being a chinese
girl i doubt if the thought of telephoning
to the american police ever occurred to
her and if it had she would have been
too much afraid of tong vengeance to do
it so trying to decide what she should
do she did nothing until the last minute
then came to my room to warn me

   hearing the rap on my door and being
 suspicious i opened the door cautiously
 lo shan rushed in and before i could
 stop her went to my window she had
 seen ah hing waiting in the alley she
 knew what he was waiting for keeping
 her face out of sight she put her hand
 against the window pane

   of course i was alarmed i thought it
 was a trap and in my anger and her agi-
 tation it was some time before i could
 get the truth from her then when i
 realized what the girl had done i drew the

	shades so she would not be seen and
waited for you wishing all the time that

 i	had a telephone in my room

   lo shan however did not like to wait
 she did not want you men to find her here
 there again you have the chinese mind
 in coming to my room lo shan has done
 a very improper and shameful thing
 that she did it to save my life is very
 little consolation to a girl who is steeped



 with four thousand years of chinese mor-
 ality under-
 standing that

i	kept her here
only until i felt
sure that the
tongmen had
given up their
attack and that
you were al-
most here

 you know
the rest the
tongmen were waiting in the hall prob-
ably they had seen lo shan but did not
guess that she had come to warn me and
so were waiting until she should leave in
the gloom lo shan mistook my friend
minturn for a highbinder and save for
mr lyons splendid aim the tongman
waiting outside my door would have fin-
ished his job after all too bad chen
concluded abruptly

  whaddye mean  this came quick
from lyons

  nothing-really chen replied and i
noticed that he did not look at lyons at
the time i thought nothing of it but later
-i think it was a week after that excit-
ing morning-i happened to meet chen at
the custom-house

  hows old ah hing i inquired

  with his thumbnail chen wan snapped
a match over the flame i saw mocking
lights in his long dark eyes

  why that was quite a joke on me he
said in his crisp college english when
his deal with the tongs fell through he was
in the same predicament as before-too
honorable to slay himself with his debts
unpaid and unable to earn money to pay
them so feeling that i should do some-
thing for him i took up all his obligations
and made him a present of ten dollars
then to my surprise to my very great sur-
prise ah hing spent the whole sum for
opium-and died happy

primitive test for soil fertility

the early settlers of kentucky had a peculiar test for determining the fertility of new
lands and while it appears to us to be a very unscientific one nevertheless it was univer-
sally used and relied on it consisted of digging a hole in the ground and then filling it with
the removed soil if the earth taken out would not fill up the hole when lightly thrown back
in the soil was considered to be fruitful and vice versa a common example of this matter of
soil replacement may be seen to-day in connection with grave-digging for notwithstanding
the addition of a coffin seldom can graves be completely filled in with the earth taken from
them and in time they sink considerably below the level of the surrounding ground the
kentucky soil test was known as virgils-c e m

george arlington hemingwood of the air service didnt care what those ken-
tucky mountaineers did so long as they didnt do it to him but when a bul-
let in the engine of his soaring plane made him try to figure out how to
land on tree-tops and live iie concluded that it was time to start something

ieutenant george arl-
ington hemingwood
of the hemingwoods of boston
a was wrestling with a problem
having applied soothing lotions
to his freshly shaved and smarting face
and put the last touches to the part in his
black hair he continued to stare into the
small mirror and wonder whether he ought
to do it or not

  he leaned over until his deeply tanned
face was within an inch of the glass and
inspected in detail the small close-cropped
black mustache which adorned his upper
lip it was a fairly luxuriant mustache as
those hirsute adornments go but it did not
quite satisfy his critical eye was it worth
while to shave it off in the hope that two
hairs would sprout where but one had
irown before

  let it go as it was he decided

  having decided this burning question
hemingwood proceeded leisurely to don
his tan serge shirt he had no further in-
terest in his face although that like its
principal ornament was a good enough
specimen of its kind a bit round per-
haps and certainly very brown but lighted
amazingly by a pair of sparkling brown
eyes and a wide good humored mouth

which was usually curved in either a smile
or a grin if not it conveyed the impres-
sion that it would stretch into one or the
other at the slightest provocation

  it was the face of a contented and cheery
person both of which george arlington
hemingwood was being a first lieutenant
in the air service satisfied him completely
and he had little more to ask from fate
the future was pleasant to his minds eye
he wasted no thought whatever on his
prospects he could not have told you
where he stood on the promotion list be-
cause he did not care particularly whether
he ever became a captain or not

  life as it was and as he lived it was a
good invention of the lords to his mind
the two rooms he occupied with walls of
beaverboard and a leak in the ceiling were
comfortable enough to live in and far more
appealing than the shadowed confines of

the h e in i  g-
wood residence
eou beacon hill
a  d although
his fathers bank
was a fine big
bank and h i s
fathers son
commercial exist-

could lead an enviable


moonlight and moonshine	

ence therein the cockpit of a de haviland
airplane was infinitely more desirable

  this despite the fact that george arl-
ington hemingwood had led a wild not
to say sensational existence during his five
years of flying from long island to the
philippines and from selfredge field on
the canadian border to france field in
panama he was known as the unluckiest
flyer still above the ground instead of under
it he could handle a ship along with the
best that was conceded however there
appeared to be a conspiracy of motors and
the elements against him he had had
more forced landings by half than any
other flyer on the list and almost in-
variably they occurred over such choice
bits of country as the everglades the
wilder sections of the mexican border
chesapeake bay the rockies and similar
traps for unwary airplanes

  he had been rescued thirty miles out at
sea during the bombing maneuvers at
langham field virginia he had laid amid
the wreckage of his ship in the big bend
for two days without food or water and
leen found by a miracle he had landed in
a canyon in arizona and wandered for a
week in the mountains he had been shot
down three times in france and a list of
the injuries he had encountered would in-
clude mention of a considerable percentage
of the bones of the human body always
however george arlington hemingwood
bobbed up serenely cursing his luck with
fluency and grinning

  his whole souled enjoyment of life ex-
tended to flying and was not dampened by
the crack-ups thereof

  having found his big stetson he ad-
justed it on his head at the precise angle
which appealed to his liking in these mat-
ters even with the aid of that impressive
twenty dollar chapeau he did not look like
a man whose hand had frequently been out-
stretched to greet st peter who was on
speaking terms as it were with the life
hereafter he was slightly under medium
height and looked a bit shorter than his
five feet seven and a half because of a pair
of powerful shoulders he was impec-
cably arrayed as always he was careful
about those things it was characteristic
that the insignia of rank and branch of
service on his collar were placed with ex-
actitude

  he strolled out through his sitting room
-the shabbily comfortable and muchly
cluttered domicile of a care free bachelor-
and down the long hall emerging into the
warm sunlight of a sprrg pf-moon in

kentucky springtime in kentucky is a
savory season and four of the flyers of
 goddard field
vv	were taking ad-

                      vantage of it by
--     laying at full
	 length on the

	xrf  	grass in front of

                        the barracks

-	-j-  v directly across
  the road four cor-
rugated iron han-
gars squatted in a row parallelling the line
of buildings of which the officers quarters
was one on the other side of the hangars
was goddard field a small rough air-
drome which sloped down to the great artil-
lery camp which spread out for two square
miles at its foot like the buildings of
the flying detachment camp henrys bar-
racks and stables had never been painted
and the big cantonment looked aged and
infirm which it was

  what is the subject of discussion en-
quired hemingwood as he ignited a
cheroot

  snapper is trying to justify the fact
that he possesses a new fiancee by spacious
arguments in favor of marriage returned
big blonde morrison

  of course looking at it impartially and
without prejudice marriage is a sucker
game from a mans viewpoint stated
hemingwood weightily

  what do you mean  enquired snapper
macneil belligerently the wiry red-
headed little flyer was a heaven-sent victim
for serious persiflage and was very much
in love 
aside from the temporary state of in-
sanity known as love the state has no
arguments in its favor from a mans view-
point pursued hemingwood look at
the expense for one thing however
cheer up snapper even marriage has its
points dont think i consider it an un-
mitigated evil you cant-

  beg pardon sir said a voice at hem-
ingwoods elbow major williamsons
compliments and will the lieutenant report
to headquarters immediately

  tall gaunt private rose perpetual
orderly of the officers barracks stood at
rigid attention and spewed these words
forth as though in mortal fear of forget-
ting one if he stopped

  be right over rose nodded heming-
wood so saying he turned on his heel
and left them spellbound

he strolled toward headquarters won-
dering what was up some new job prob-


short stories

ably as photographic officer his duties
were by no means onerous and conse-
quently he had a great fear that lightning
would strike at any moment in the form
of an order assigning him to some prosaic
task in addition to his other duties
however his fears were groundless
he found major williamson enthroned
behind his desk arguing acrimoniously
with gobel the sandy-haired and excitable
adjutant the c o fought frequently
with gobel for the purpose of prodding the
adjutant until he started pounding the desk
which he frequently did

  washington has at last discovered that
theres a photographic section hidden away
here the major told him youre due
for a sojourn in the back hills of kentucky
where moonshine grows on bushes and
rifle bullets flow like water

  the orders were brief and to the point
hemingwood was to make a mosaic of the
salters river between the villages of la-
port and herkimer that would be about
thirty miles hemingwood reflected the
mosaic was to include all the teriflory for
five miles on each side of the river three
hundred square miles which was several
days work it was for the use of the
geological survey according to the order
and was to be accomplished without
delay

  hemingwood was delighted he was
whistling cheerfully as he made off to in-
terview apperson and get things in readi-
ness for a weeks stay in the wilderness

  he found sergeant apperson his chief
non-com in the photo hut apperson was
a gray-haired veteran who was as reliable
as a tax collector and knew more about
cameras than the in-
ventors thereof
anything from a
pocket machine to a
motion picture out-
fit was in his pro-
fessional bailiwick
he was a wiry
wetather-beaten little
scotchman who retained a trace of the
brogue of his youth

  well have oor base oot yonder no
oot he queried well be ready in the
mornin sir-r-r

  the invaluable apperson was likewise
an excellent mechanic in addition to his
other praiseworthy talents so hemingwood
told him to have the ship warmed and
ready by six in the morning whereupon
he dismissed everything from his mind
apperson never failed

ii

  at precisely six-forty-five next
morning hemingwood was com-
x jlmencing to look for the salters
river which was his principal landmark to
aid in finding east point for a half
hour he had been flying over the moun-
tains as far as the eye could see even
from the airy perch of three thousand feet
low rolling heavily wooded hills rolled
away to the skyline it was not difficult
to believe the bloody history of those thou-
sands of acres of unkempt wilderness as
one looked down on the grim fastnesses
which hid in their depths a strange breed
who lived and fought and died in a
shadowed primitive world of their own
george himself had had a sample of the
suspicious mountain people when he had
been forced to land in the hills a few
months before

  another flyer would have been taut with
the strain of flying continuously over a
wilderness which presented no possible
landing field the failure of two or three
cylinders of the twelve-cylinder four hun-
dred and fifty horsepower liberty meant
crashing into the trees at seventy miles an
hour but no worry bothered george arl-
ington hemingwood his untroubled
eyes scanned the glistening instruments
and he enjoyed the ride he couldnt be
worried until disaster actually overtook
him the specially built ship carrying a
hundred and thirty-five gallons of gas
roared along over the mountains at a hun-
dred miles an hour to offset the extra
weight of gas oil and electric cameras it
was streamlined to the last possible degree
and it was a tribue to appersons loving
care down to the last turnbuckle glistening
in the morning sun

  finally the tiny stream came in sight
and he swung southward it twined along
between the mountains sometimes in deep
gorges and sometimes level with tiny fields

on its banks	v

herkimer came	

in sight and he
instantly vetoed
the one field

near it it was  	

ploughed land
and the furrows
were high and
soft

  he sped along
over the village
and deeper up into the mountains herk-
imer was lost to sight almost immediately
moonlight and moonshine

there was a three minute interval when he
only picked up one cabin

  then east point came in sight and
proved to be a pleasant surprise it was
larger than herkimer despite having no
railroad and the wide main street was
shaded with towering trees it was set at
the base of a mountain and for a half mile
westward small cleared fields occupied the
tiny valley floor there were small
ploughed fields on the mountainsides too
gleaming white against the green of the
woods

  hemingwood scrutinizing the ground
closely finally found a field although it
was not as near town as he would have
liked it was a long narrow grass clear-
ing just below the crest of the mountain
behind east point on the slope opposite
the town four miles east of the clearing
there was a small settlement which was
not on his map

  he throttled the motor to a thousand
revolutions a minute and dropped down
for a look he could see the residents of
east point popping forth from their
houses for a look at the visitor from the
sky there would be some excitement
down there he soliloquized he noticed a
solitary horseman toiling up the road from
east point to that settlement whatever its
name was the road led past his prospec-
tive landing place which would make
transportation of gas and oil a simple mat-
ter

  the field lay north and south with an
eastern slope it was surrounded by tow-
ering trees on three sides but to the north
where the road skirted it there was a good
approach

  he swooped down within ten feet of the
ground and flashed across it for a detailed
inspection it rolled slightly and the grass
was four or five inches long a few rocks
protruded from the vegetation but the
middle of the clearing seemed to be with-
out obstacles

  he decided immediately to try iti as
he zoomed upward and turned northward
to land over the road he looked around at
the imperturbable apperson he pointed
down at the field and apperson removed
his pipe and nodded not in approval
merely understanding apperson consid-
ered everything in the photo section as his
business except flying this he left en-
tirely to hemingwood if his chief had
indicated the ohio river as a landing place
apperson would have nodded

  hemingwood came in low over the thin
fringe of trees cutting the motor grad-

ually the heavy ship had almost lost
speed when it was over the road and was
mushing downward hemingwood stab-
bed the throttle ahead for a second as the
dehaviland settled over the fence the
spurt of power held the nose up a second
more and the stick was back in his lap
when the ship hit on three points in a hard
stall landing it rolled with slackening
speed up a small hump in the field picked
up again as it rolled down the other side
and stopped at the top of the second fold
a safe hundred yards from the southern
boundary it was flying as perfect as it
was unconsciously skillful

  hemingwood gave it the gun and taxied
to the fence he turned off the gasoline
feed ran the motor out and clicked off the
switches

  ill take a constitutional down to the
city apperson and see where we sleep and
eat if any likewise where we get gas
and oil and how i guess youd better
stay here therell be the usual mob of
people show up i suppose

  quite so nodded apperson raising
his yellow tinted goggles deliberately
yell have transportation to get the bags
into town no cloot

  uh-huh ill be back in a couple of
hours-by the time the sun gets right for
pictures anyhow

  he climbed out lit a cigaret and sur-
veyed the cloudless sky with satisfaction

fthe mosaic would be
taken from eleven thou-
sand feet and even a few
cumulous clouds would
mean great gaps in the
pictures it looked like
a good working day

apperson was busy in
the back cockpit unwiring
divers articles he had
packed away there he
could fit anything up to an
automobile into the cock-
pit of a ship article after
article materialized from
the mystic depths until it
was a problem where the
sergeant himself had ridden

  hemingwood took off his flying suit and
made off without further ado it was
about three miles over the mountain to
east point he estimated and it would be
a phenomenon if he did not meet a pro-
cession of cars one of which would be de-
lighted to turn around and give him a lift

  he had proceeded up the dusty road for
a half mile and had just reached the crest
short stories

of the hill when a horseman hove in sight
the one he had seen from the air prob-
ably he did not seem in a hurry for the
horse was ambling along at pretty much
his own gait

  suddenly hemingwoods dark eyes
lighted with interest and he became con-
scious that his face was undoubtedly spot-
ted with oil that was a woman on that
horse riding astride furthermore she
was a young woman a big white panama
hat shaped like a mans shaded her face
and her costume consisted of khaki riding
trousers leather boots and a white blouse

  in a few seconds he was able to state
with conviction that not only was the rider
a young woman but that she was also a
most remarkably attractive specimen of her
sex and george arlington hemingwood
was not a man who allowed opportunity to
knock at his door without an answer he
stopped a few feet in front of the horse
and smiled up at the girl

  i beg your pardon but could you tell
me the name of the town that seems to be
at the end of this road

  her piquant face framed by the panama
and bobbed hair dimpled slightly as she
pulled up her horse

  which end of the road  she enquired
the one im headed for-it seemed to
be the biggest

  east point she informed him did
you have a forced landing

  you talk like a flyer grinned heming-
wood no i came down on purpose i
thought i was near east point but its hard
to tell from the air particularly in such
thickly settled country he added

   she chuckled a peculiarly infectious per-
formance as she accomplished it she was
a tiny little thing hemingwood thought
and her small oval face with its saucily
tilted nose and rather wide mouth
possessed a charm which far transcended
the mere beauty of more regular features
she did not look as if a resident of the
mountains

  you know pretty lady ive read a few
flying stories in some of our magazines
and in every one some beautiful girl al-
ways materializes as soon as an airplane
lands he remarked they just pop out
of bushes in the wilderness or from behind
sand hummocks in the desert but in five
years of flying its the first time ive seen
it happen

   well this is the first time youve ever
landed anywhere near me she returned
mirth m her gray eyes

  my mistake laughed hemingwood

i wonder if you could give me some in-
formation i expect to be in your village
or above it for a few days taking pictures
of this flock of mountains if they rolled
kentucky out flat it would be bigger than
texas

  she laughed aloud this time her face
had an out-of-doors look about it just a
hint of golden tan and red cheeks with the
color underneath the skin instead of on
top of it

  the main things i want to know are
as follows where can my trusty sergeant
and myself procure beds and boards for
ourselves and is there any garage in
town where we can buy gasoline and oil 
that last remark is an insult she
said severely i ought to ride off and
leave you standing here after that insin-
uation against east point however
youre a stranger my uncle has practic-
ally the only store in east point he sells
gasoline and oil

  he must be a good business man judg-
ing by his choice of salesmen commented
hemingwood

  thats the secret of his success she
confided smilingly about the boarding
house i dont know we have no regular
hotel or even boarding house but i guess
my uncle could tell you where to go

  and your uncles name is-

  mumford you cant miss the store
theres a big sign on it

  do you think you could stand it if i
introduced myself enquired heming-
wood

  i might

  hemingwood-george hemingwood
hailingat present from camp henry
how do you do lieutenant heming-
wood she smiled beautiful morning
isnt it

  be a nice day if the weather doesnt
change miss blank agreed the flyer

  ill let you substitute morgan in the
blank are we ordinary people on the
ground to be allowed to look at your air-
plane 

   ill show you the sights myself

  she glanced down at the tiny gold watch
on her wrist

  ten minutes of nine ive got to
hurry im a hard working school-marm
you see but i do want to see your plane
lieutenant

  what time do you get through for the
day

  four oclock

  are you riding to school come back
this way
moonlight and moonshine

  yes

  ill be waiting at the ship for you i
want to be present when you see it be-
cause it all sounds so much more impres-
sive as i explain things

  i will be supposed to worship in silent
awe perhaps

  you be interested and ill do the wor-
shipping grinned hemingwood

  you dont appear to be of the reverent
sort however ill look forward to it
good-by until this afternoon

  she threw him a smile and urged her fat

white horse into
a lumbering gal-
lop

  shes no east
point girl shes
just out of col-
lege and getting
a years experi-
ence or some-
thing solilo-
quized heming-
wood must be
some little schoolhouse up at that settlement
i saw from the air cute kid and she
knows what its all about too

  he resumed his pilgrimage to east
point musing contentedly on the prospect
before him he had not proceeded five
hundred yards however before loud clank-
ing and rattling announced the fact that
there was a vehicle approaching a bat-
tered ford truck bounced into sight and
clattered up to him slowing gradually
loose tools in the rear were responsible
for the weird combination of noises given
forth by the flivver two men were in the
seat the truck stopped alongside the
flyer and the fat man at the wheel hailed
him

  mornin git down all right

  yes thanks nothing the matter
landed on purpose

  i see lookin fur anything special
around hyar

  the drivers round red face was the
setting for a pair of small green eyes en-
cased in rolls of fat he was dressed in
greasy mechanic clothing and a battered
felt hat his companion was a gaunt man
of middle age boasting a drooping mus-
tache and a melancholy look

  im going to town to look for gas and
oil and a place to sleep right now

  climb in hyar and ill take yuh t
town offered the fat man who seemed
to be making a determined effort to be
genial

  without a word his companion uncoiled

his long length and languidly transferred
himself into the rear of the truck he was
dressed in a black shirt and dirty khaki
trousers and his felt hat was in as decrepit
a condition as the drivers

  the ford had barely turned around
when the vanguard of the sightseers
passed in two flivvers both loaded to the
guards with coatless men of all ages
they peered at hemingwood with concen-
trated attention as they dashed by

  i keep the garage hyar an i cn let yuh
have all the gas yuh want offered the
driver

  well ive made arrangements in ad-
vance with mr mumford lied heming-
wood

  just why he had said it he did not know
it was an impulse but a sensible one he
intended to buy the gas of mumford be-
cause of the girl and he might as well
avoid antagonizing anyone in east point
if he could

  the driver grunted he was plainly
disappointed

  gettin right out he enquired

  no ill be here several days

  the man glanced at him quickly and the
flyer felt instinctively that the man behind
him was staring at him steadily and listen-
ing closely

  what fur

  the forthright question was like a blow

  i was sent here to take a lot of pic-
tures from the air hemingwood ex-
plained

  he felt the tenseness in the atmosphere
and was well aware of the attitude of
mountaineers regarding any stranger par-
ticularly a government man consequently
he went to some pains to describe his mis-
sion exactly apparently he did not sat-
isfy the fat garage man entirely though
hemingwood was somewhat puzzled it
would have been more explainable if the
man had been a mountaineer perhaps
he was and had graduated into a business
in town no reason why a man couldnt
make moonshine just because he lived in
town either he reflected

  several more cars passed them all filled
with passengers three men  horseback
and two buckboards were included in the
procession when they turned into the
wide dirt street of east point there were
knots of people mostly women talking on
the sidewalks they were plainly curi-
ous and hemingwood was the target for
severe inspection and several pointing
fingers

  most of the houses were small frame
short stories



buildings neatly painted and interspersed

with several
tumble -down

	shacks the
business section
was half-way
down the street
and consisted of
a tottery wooden
shed labeled
g a r a g e a
small drug store
with fly specked
windows and a big square building with
a false front modern show windows and
a big sign reading

mum fords general store

post office east point kentucky

  a bright red gasoline pump stood in
front of it and a rolling oil tank four
old men were in conversation in front of
the store and there was a group of
younger men whose meeting place was
evidently the garage a few wagons were
drawn up along the stone sidewalk the
horses tied to hitching posts evidently
all the available cars had been driven out
to the field

  as they drew up in front of the store
the fat driver offered to wait and transport
hemingwood back to the field which offer
the bostonian accepted with thanks

  he went into the crowded little store
and looked around at the counters

  mumford sells everything from pills
to plows he soliloquized and then
spotted a short broad baldheaded man
emerging from a cubbyhole in the rear
it proved to be mumford

  hemingwood introduced himself ex-
plained his need of a hundred gallons of
gas delivered at the field every flying day
and learned that mumford owned a truck
with which it could be delivered the
storekeeper also opined that he could un-
doubtedly find a place for the flyers to
live if they would wait for definite infor-
mation until the afternoon 

  the flyer studied his man a bit and
decided to take him into his confidence to
a slight extent he told him about the
casual meeting with his niece that morn-
ing and went on to say i came down
here with ballardson he wanted this gas
business so to keep him from being sore
i told him that i had made arrangements
in advance with you i dont know any-
thing about east point but i figured it
might save unpleasantness will you bear
me out in my story if necessary

  roundfaced mr mumford chuckled

  how come you figured ballardson that
way  he enquired

  he didnt seem particularly friendly
hemingwood returned

  if theres any unpleasantness probly
hell have something to do with it stated
mumford these mountain people are
funny you know

  on the way back to the field ballardsons
questions and something in the attitude of
both men showed plainly that they were
not satisfied as to the precise purpose of
the pictures hemingwood was to take
there were fifty or sixty people in plain
sight near the ship and as many more men
women and children lurking half-screened
in the surrounding forest they watched
the transfer of thirty gallons of gas with
consuming interest

  knots of roughly dressed men conversed
in low tones while other more convention-
ally arrayed made no mysterious motions
hemingwood caught a phrase the con-
trol wires go through the fuselage hyar
and work these hyar elevators he looked
around-he was up on a wing holding the
funnel over the main tank-to find out
who knew so much about airplanes in that
benighted town it seemed to be a scrawny
red-headed chap wearing a nondescript
felt hat hickory shirt and overalls a
moment later hemingwood noticed bal-
lardson in conversation with him

  the slow job of straining the gas through
the chamois was about over when the flyer
heard voices raised in anger he looked
around and saw two men standing close to
the tail surfaces of the plane surrounded
by a half dozen others including ballard-
son and the airplane expert

  i say youre a liar shouted a gaunt
rawboned mountaineer who was one of the
pair the other short and powerfully
built retaliated with a resounding slap
the next second they were locked in each
others arms

  hemingwood leaped to the ground while
the onlookers watched breathlessly those
men were perilously close to the ship if
one of them put a foot through the frail
linen of the elevators or rudder-

  as he ran toward them followed by
apperson he saw the taller man deliber-
ately kick his foot toward the drooping
elevators in a flash hemingwood took
in the details their faces were not those
of two fighting men temporarily hating
each other and that kick had looked delib-
erated even if it had missed as he got
within a foot of them they were poised
moonlight and moonshine



directly over the tail assembly straining
mightily another second and they would
have crashed together over the ship and
would have put one de haviland airplane
totally out of flying condition for several
days

  it was a frame-up hemingwood thought
as he hurled himself at the contestants
he hit them like a human cannon ball
and for the moment he was one char-
acteristically he was totally unimpressed
by the odds against him with fists and
feet he drove the astounded battlers back
after they had recovered they commenced
to retaliate no one else took a hand for
a moment and hemingwood fought en-
tirely alone he seemed to be a dynamic
ball bristling with feet and fists from every
angle he was in a cold rage at the un-
warranted interference of the mountain-
eers and he gloried in the opportunity to
vent some of it on them he fought fu-
riously and for a few seconds actually had
the best of it a sweeping kick sent the
stocky man to the ground and george took
a clumsy swing on the side of the head in
order to sink his fist in the taller mans
belly that put that personage out for a
second or two so he was able to meet the
rising gladiator with a wild flurry of fists
that cracked home to the jaw and sent him
down again

  but he knew it could not last he
leaped back and jerked out his colt

  stand still you he snapped and his
glinting eyes were hard and keen and his
smile had more than a touch of grimness
about it subconsciously he noticed bal-
lardsons amazed slightly scared face and
the taut expectancy half fear and half en-
joyment of the spectators apperson was
at his elbow his gun also out

  listen all of you hemingwood

shouted there
was utter silence
theres at least
one man here
that knows air-
planes this
framed-up fight
was for the pur-
pose of putting
this ship out of
commission if
another soul gets anywhere near it hes
going to be filled so full of lead itll take
a block and tackle to lift him into the
hearse

  youre fooling with the united states
army if you knock me off and you
wont get away with it im here to take

pictures and nothing else i dont give a
damn who or what you are but by god if
you two birds or anyone else looks cross-
eyed in my direction or starts anything
else as funny as this ill commence to get
damn interested now get the hell out of
here you two and therest of you get back
and stay back

  which they did they were thoroughly
awed and well satisfied to remain at a
distance it was significant that not a soul
seemed to take hemingwoods part evi-
dently the mountaineers had the village
business men somewhat under their thumbs

  nice start ive got soliloquized the
untroubled flyer

hi

he wasted no time in taking off
-no telling when fleecy cumulous
clouds would form in the sky and
spoil the continuity of the strips apper-
son had everything in readiness the cam-
era was set in the floor of the rear cockpit
in which an opening was cut to fit it the
electric motor was connected and spare
batteries and plenty of film for the days
work were in a specially built recess behind
the seat

  after a few circles of the field heming-
wood set out for herkimer climbing
steadily

  in a half hour the altimeter was reading
eleven thousand feet and the long grind
began he was flying his strips over the
short ten mile course east and west

  it was hard work to fly continuously
with every faculty concentrated on keep-
ing the ship absolutely level and flying a
straight line making sure that the strips
had plenty of overlap and that the speed
of the plane was kept constant in the
rear apperson was devoting all his atten-
tion to the huge camera and the motor
the camera was geared to shoot a picture
automatically at intervals of a few seconds
when he wanted to reload he signaled
hemingwood who thereupon flew around
killing time until the change had been made

  four hours of it left even the nerveless
pilot very tired he was heartily glad when
it was time to drop earthward again they
had covered the first six miles of the ter-
rain they were to shoot he hoped de-
voutly that there were no gaps to make
retakes necessary no way to tell that
though until the thousands of pictures had
been developed and laboriously put to-
gether in the completed mosaic

  mumford proved he was on the job by
short stories



having the next days supplies delivered at
the field within a half hour after they had
landed by the time the big tanks of the
d h were full a few spectators had ar-
rived and were looking in awed wonder at
the gigantic bomber close on their heels
came miss morgan

  mumford seemed distraught and ill-at-
ease referring to the fight only slightly
hemingwood decided that the merchant
did not dare take sides openly against the
mountaineers and that he was considerably
worried because of his business connection
with the hated government man his niece
however did not follow his lead she
beckoned hemingwood to one side and
her eyes were dark with worry

  tell me about this morning she com-
manded and hemingwood obliged giving
a more or less ludicrous account thereof

  apperson and i are going to stay out
here and guard the crate he concluded
i guess they wont monkey with us any
more i notice that the wild eyed mob
here are keeping their distance pretty well
i wish you wouldnt take it so lightly
she protested you have no idea how
they are when theyre aroused or fright-
ened with your ship flying around over

them all day theyll feel hunted and-

  i tried to explain this morning that
im not interested in their private crimes
hemingwood told her with a grin

  i know but the poor dears have been
hunted so much for things like moonshin-
ing which they consider perfectly all right
-you know they cant see for the life of
them why they should be taxed or be
breaking the law because they make some
corn mash out of their own corn and dis-
till it-

  i know but the poor dears give me
a pain in the neck when they try to bust
up my ship but lets not worry about it
eh

  whereupon in a very presentable bari-
tone he burst forth into a song

snap your fingers at care

   dont cross the bridge till youre there

  the girl hesitated smiled and finally
laughed she became serious again very
soon however

  thats fine but please be careful and
try not to alienate them any more wont
you she begged him

  hemingwood assented and he was aware
of a curious feeling of warm satisfaction
that she took so much interest in the sit-
uation he himself simply couldnt be

worried about it he was an unusual type
he could not be said to be brave because
he was really unacquainted with fear it
was a strange paradox that a man who
loved living so much should hold life it-
self so cheaply as did george arlington
hemingwood of the hemingwoods of
boston

   ill bring you your supper she offered

  ive got to go to town and see if i can
rustle some blankets and perhaps a tent
from your uncle he just told me he had
some

  the noise of a motor became clear and
george looked up to see the mumford
truck on its way homeward

  i intended to get a ride back to town
but i see i missed out hemingwood ob-
served mumford apparently wanted to
spend no more time than he needed to in
the vicinity of the flyers

  dont blame him please lieutenant
hemingwood the girl said in a low voice
you have no idea what a difficult position
he is in because of the trouble this morn-
ing the mountain people-

  i understand theres no reason why
he should risk being mixed up in it
nodded hemingwood

  ill give you a lift home on pegasus
she offered and so it came about that hem-
ingwood had a hilarious ride back to east
point on the rear deck of the venerable
pegasus he got off a little way out of
town although the girl did not sug-
gest it

   i cant call on you tonight which i in-
tended to ask permission to do he told
her smiling up into her own mirthful eyes
you have no idea what an angel from
heaven youd seem if you passed our pal-
atial pasture home this evening though

  she hesitated a moment and then
laughed

  i am invited out so little here that i
miss no opportunities to take part in the
social whirl she smiled aunty and i
will accept with pleasure and supply a bet-
ter picnic supper than you can get out of
cans too

  he got his supplies from mumford in-
cluding the tent and likewise a letter ad-
dressed in pencil to lt hemingwood in
care of mumfords store the script was
all but illegible he opened it in mum-
fords presence and read

  take my advise and git out of town
quick or youll be sorry i know what im
talkin about

a friend
moonlight and moonshine

  hemingwoods mouth stretched in a
wide grin he thrust it into his pocket
and said nothing about it to the patiently
curious mumford he showed it to ap-
person back at
the field and
that wily scot
shook his head

   tis no such
a bonny coun-
t r y he re-
marked sucking
at his pipe

  funny peo-
ple wild as
march hares
assented hemingwood theyll think sev-
eral times before they really try to harm
us though the most weve got to look
forward to is another attempt to harm the
ship i imagine our hides will stay in-
tact except under unusual circumstances
lets pitch the bungalow so i can catch a
nap before dinner arrives

  which they did and hemingwood en-
tirely unaffected by the note in his pocket
fell asleep immediately he had much
more interesting things to think about than
crazy mountaineers miss morgan for in-
stance

  his awakening was very pleasant being
brought about through the medium of gail
morgans far from unmusical voice he
thrust his tousled head through the flaps of
the tent and smiled through the fog of
heavy slumber

  i hope im awake and that this isnt a
dream he greeted her

  i brought you large sections of food
which may be a little more appetizing than
you could have found she told him smil-
ing down from her throne on pegasus
if urged i might even toy delicately with
some of it myself my aunt couldnt
come

  she wore no hat and her piquant face
was framed in flying brown hair hem-
ingwood smiled appreciatively at the pic-
ture she presented

  wheres apperson  he inquired

  asleep in the ship

  that worthy was awakened for the meal
which did not conclude until after twi-
light gail leaned back against one wheel
of the ship in comfort hemingwood lay
lazily at full length apperson went for
a walk he was a tactful man was the
sergeant

  your uncle was a bit mysterious about
this ballardson bozo hemingwood re-

   m



marked theres no love lost between
them is there

  oh they get along all right gail re-
sponded carelessly uncle ed doesnt ex-
actly approve of ballardson though
why not if im not too curious
hes from the mountains you know
and everybody knows that his garage busi-
ness doesnt amount to anything his real
occupation is transferring moonshine by
truck into various towns-covington and
cincinnati principally

  i see

  it was probably ballardson who had sent
that note hemingwood reflected the gar-
age man did not cotton to the idea of a
ship flying above the mountains several
hours a day taking pictures which he
would figure might be for the purpose of
locating stills he had taken a chance that
the letter would scare the interlopers away
hemingwood did not anticipate any more
extreme measures when the note failed to
work it had been his experience that the
uniform of the united states army
aroused respect enough to make any
wearer thereof immune from actual per-
sonal violence under ordinary conditions
he had seen the effect of it on the border
and likewise in these same kentucky moun-
tains except under unusual provocation
an army man was much safer than any
other stranger could possibly be

  has east point got
any minion of the
law he asked

  just ballardson
returned gail with that
little chuckle that hem-
ingwood so enjoyed
hearing

  the pilot laughed aloud and gail joined
him

  so the prominent bootlegger is peace
officer eh  chortled hemingwood thats
what i call a real tight corporation
hes pretty good at the job aside from
the moonshine too the girl told him

  the stars winked into being and before
long a thin moon rose above the mountains
they talked casually of many things with
an undercurrent of friendly understanding
that seemed like the result of long acquaint-
ance hemingwood learned that his esti-
mate of her was correct she had finished
college the year before and was spending
a year in east point because of the ill
health of her aunt and likewise because her
own rather drawn condition as a result of
hectic college years

  i tried to study all day and dance all
o	short stories

night and it didnt work she admitted
but i had a good time i havent minded
it so much up here but ill be glad to
get back week-ends in louisville once
or twice a month have been about all that
kept me from dying of dry rot this winter
flyers dont drop in every day

  they dont know youre here he told
her after i spread the news theyll be
flying in here in coveys

  apperson came back and disappeared
into the tent hemingwood was to take
the first watch at nine oclock gail got
to her feet and announced that she must be
going hemingwood walked over to the
fence with her pegasus was tethered
there

  as their hands clasped in parting and he
looked down into her upturned face he
obeyed an irresistible impulse and leaned
over to kiss her

  she slipped away laughing

  were getting along wonderfully but
not that well she chuckled and swung
aboard pegasus good night and if
you have any more fights i hope you win
them

  he stood and watched her as pegasus
ambled along the moonlit road just be-
fore they entered the deep shadow of the
trees she turned in the saddle and threw
him a parting smile and waved she
seemed at that moment like some little
goddess disappearing from mortal eyes into
the impenetrable darkness of the forest

  he walked back to the ship slowly and
sat in the cockpit his colt was ready to
his hand and the shadowed mountains
clustering around him seemed doubly mys-
terious even menacing under the blanket
of the night they seemed to be whisper-
ing with all the bloody legends of the
mountain country and to be vibrant with
some of the passion and untamable wild-
ness of the people whom they sheltered

  and yet george arlington heming-
wood a lonely watchman in the midst of
all-pervading silence was thinking not of
what might happen with his enemies but
rather of what the future might hold forth
tor himself and gail morgan

iv

  a ccording to instructions apper-

  ljl son awakened him at eight oclock
a jlat nine they had consumed coffee
and bread and were ready to take off

  it was a delicate job on the rolling field
but again it was accomplished safely and
the ship cleared the surrounding trees by a
jood fifty feet as it roared out over the

forest hemingwood held it low pointing
for the little schoolhouse where gail pre-
sided it was on the outskirts of the
mountain settlement called the hollows
as he passed over it he jazzed the throttle
twice he saw gail thrust her head out of
a window and wave her handkerchief he
returned the greeting with his free arm
there was a pleasant warmth in his heart
as he circled back and left the schoolhouse
behind

  the ship was barely three hundred feet
high so he nosed up in a steep climb his
right arm was draped carelessly over the
side of the cockpit and his eyes swept the
ground idly

  suddenly he felt a jerk at his ankle
he dropped his eyes and in utter surprise
saw a clean gash on the inner side of his
right booth sole he moved his foot
slightly and saw a hole in the wooden
flooring of the cockpit the next second
he saw gas jetting forth from a jagged
hole in the small copper tube which was the
gasoline feed line between main tank and
carburetor the libertys roar died away
into sputtering and then silence and
down below there was nothing but im-
penetrable forest into which to crash

  hemingwood reached automatically for
the mainline petcock and turned off the
gas then he turned on the petcock which
released the gas from the emergency tank
holding the ship in a dive to maintain fly-
ing speed

  for agonizing seconds the motor did not
catch and the ship was diving like a comet
for the earth hemingwood cursed stead-
ily fluently he had been shot at from
the ground and by dumb luck they had hit
the fast moving target there was noth-
ing for it but to crash what the hell was
the matter with that gravity tank if he
could get his hands on the blankety-blank
marksmen

  then he saw them there were five of
them partially hidden and they were still
shooting he could see the smoke from
their rifles unseen and unheard above
the whining wires there were bullets zip-
ping through the air around him

  there was two hundred feet of altitude
left with his usually boyish face sud-
denly grim and hard hemingwood
swooped around and made the dive more
steep might as well use that last little
margin to teach those birds a lesson

  his finger was on the machine gun con-
trol as he pointed the ship at them and
at that second the gravity tank got work-
ing and the motor cut in there was
moonlight and moonshine



tfiirty minutes gas in that tank plenty to
get back to the field with

  hemingwood came to himself even
his unemotional soul revolted at the
thought of pouring a hail of death on the
five would-be murderers below but he
did dive down at them carefully aiming a

bit beyond them
and his machine
 guns spouted fire
and a hail of
bullets which
ripped up the
trees a few doz-
en yards away
from them

 he barely
brought the
quivering strained ship out of the dive
in time to clear the treetops he turned
again and for the next five minutes terror-
ized the hiding mountaineers with showers
of lead all around them

  now let em see whether theyve got
any stomach to keep fiddling around he
grinned as he swept back toward the field

  his rancor was all gone now that he
was safe it was something of a game to
him

they fixed the mainline by means
of a spare rubber connection they
had brought along and got in a good
five hours of work landing shortly after
two oclock apperson seemingly entirely
unshaken by the events of the morning had
a suggestion to make he led heming-
wood to one side so that mumford there
with the gas could not overhear anything
and said

  lets dispense with lunch sir-r-r this
is bonny weather and it may be the
mornins eeventsll scare em off or maybe
theyll try again so the queecker we get
through the better to my mind

  to which hemingwood assented there
were but a few onlookers this time and
seemingly thesound of the shooting had
not been noticed mumford did not men-
tion anything about the events of the morn-
ing either so hemingwood decided that
it was a secret between himself and those
five men on the ground which was just
as well he reflected he did not particu-
larly care for the news to spread that he
had attempted to shoot up five mountain-
eers

  they worked until after four oclock
and once again mumford was waiting with
a new supply of gas he seemed a bit
more openly friendly now and announced

that mrs mumford and gail would again
oblige with supper

   they arrived in due time along with
pegasus the buckboard and a big basket
of provender but left almost immediately
after the meal was over mrs mumford
it appeared was president of the mental
improvement society of east point which
was to meet that evening to weigh the
merits of english poetry from chaucer to
masefield and gail was to sing

   hemingwood did not mention the inci-
dent of the morning to gail there was
nothing of the grandstander in him and
he did not want her to worry about it
after they had gone he and apperson
smoked and talked and watched the moon
come up at ten oclock apperson who
was to take the last watch again was
knocking out his pipe preparatory to re-
tiring when hemingwood became aware
of the fact that a horse was undoubtedly
galloping toward them and coming fast
they waited by the fence hands on their
guns

  it was gail morgan and pegasus was
a badly winded steed as she guided him up
to the fence

   did you shoot anybody this morning 
she asked breathlessly

  hemingwood a tingle of excitement
running up and down his spine told her
briefly what had happened

  you hit jim calley she told him
he must have been one of those men-
theyre all calleys over there jim must
have been a little away from the others so
that you got him anyway the calleys
are coming over tonight to get you

  may i ask how you know heming-
wood asked easily

  apperson was listening quietly his
empty pipe upside down in his mouth

  mrs tuttle a woman i nursed when
she was sick sent her little boy to tell me
to these people the fact that you and i
have been friendly means that we must
be sweethearts so she wanted to warn me
she isnt a calley herself although shes
kin to them

   gail was talking with breathless speed
as though laboring under almost unbear-
able tension she went on i came right
up without telling a soul youd better
start for east point right off

   no i guess well have to guard the old
ship gail

  but you dont know these calleys
theyre bad what chance will you have
against six men  i didnt know what to
do all the men in east point are either
too

short stories

with them or afraid of them it would be
suicide for anyone like my unde to take
a hand in it lieutenant hemingwood but

you could come
down to east
point for the

night and-

  no well
stay and
theres nothing
to worry about
declared hem-
ingwood gail
youre a brick
youre a whole
mansion of
bricks now you
turn right
around and gal-
 o p home be-
fore you get
mixed in it
yourself ill thank you later

   you cant stay she said the hint of a
sob in her voice i tell you those cal-
leys-

  please run along gail and i tell you
well be all right if i didnt think so id
light out im not hankering to commit
suicide

  finally after hemingwood had outlined
his plans she did go but not before she
had exhausted every means of persuasion
at her command hemingwood had a hard
time to keep her from staying nearby to
see what happened and then she announced
that shed tell her uncle and that they would
ioth be back which hemingwood like-
wise vetoed	

  please be careful she whispered fin-
ally leaning over a trifle and if theres
any way you can will you let me know that
everything lias come out all right  i

couldnt close my eyes until i know- 

  sure now for the love of mike
pretty lady beat it

  she had not disappeared from sight be-
fore hemingwood and apperson were
busy a big rock protruding two feet
above the ground was the cornerstone of
their defense the ship was standing by
the fence the tent thirty feet away from
it and ten feet from the edge of the forest
the rock was in a corner of the field near-
est the road perhaps forty feet from both
tent and ship

  they worked with breathless haste car-
rying the fence rails over to the rock and
constructing their barricade in a half
hour they had a small three sided fortifica-
tion of which the rock formed the apex

facing the tent where hemingwood fig-
ured most of the action would take place
if any the machine guns were useless-
there was no time to dismount them

  he was right about the scene of battle
less than half an hour from the time they
had ensconced themselves in their shelter
lying flat on the ground they heard a rust-
ling in the bushes behind the tent al-
though the moonlight was flooding the
world in silver radiance they could see no
signs of the men they knew were there

  for taut minutes there was utter silence
hemingwood wondered whether the low
structure of rails and rock behind which
they were hidden would catch the ma-
rauders eyes and scare them off he
hoped it would but the chances were
against it

  it was fully ten minutes before six
ghostly figures long rifles in hand slip-
ped out of the bushes and started to sur-
round the tent hemingwood acted be-
fore any of them went out of sight behind
it

  he shot his colt in the air and shouted
drop your guns hands up

  quick bellowed apperson to let them
know there was more than one gun trained
on them

  for an instant six men vague in the
moonlight stood like statues heming-
wood shot again shouting at the same
time next shot ill get someone drop
those guns

  the utter surprise of it and the terrify-
ing effect of those two shots from unseen
marksmen did the trick the mountain-
eers were a bit too far from the shelter
of the forest to risk a break for it against
unknown odds their rifles dropped to
the ground and six pairs of hands thrust
slowly into the air

  for a moment hemingwood was up
against a problem he knew in his heart
that if those mountaineers had the nerve
they could make their escape against two
colts the darkness and the distance be-
tween the opposing factions made accurate
shooting almost impossible the most
sensible procedure was for either him or
apperson to go out and make sure they
moonlight and moonshine



were thoroughly disarmed though the
presence of one or the other in the vicinity
of the six silent kentuckians meant that
the other man could not shoot without risk-
ing the wounding or killing of his ally
but it was the only possible chance and
which part should he take should he
approach them and leave apperson to
cover him or vice versa  he was a better
shot than apperson-and possibly the scot
might hesitate to shoot

  he put the matter up to the sergeant
bluntly apperson silently climbed out of
the barricade and circled widely to ap-
proach the line of captives from the rear
if they were unarmed except for their
rifles on the ground he and apperson might
get away with it hemingwood reflected
then a thought occurred to him and he
called apperson back he heard whis-
pers pass between the mountaineers

  keep quiet no talking he called
sharply then if they make a move
drop to the ground so i can shoot he
told apperson wait a minute get in
here im going out there myself 

  afterward hemingwood figured that
the mountaineers sure that they were op-
posed to only two men with revolvers got
the courage from the fact to make a break
for liberty as always among the moun-
tain people they were undoubtedly desper-
ate at the thought of capture for just
as hemingwood was climbing out of the
barricade the six men made a concerted
leap for their rifles like a flash hem-
ingwood dropped and both colts barked
in a fusillade of shots the flyer saw one
man drop and another screamed with pain
a hail of bullets poured from their rifles
and he heard apperson groan

  they got me he said weakly

  hemingwood shoved another clip into
his gun and emptied it into the woods
wherein the kentuckians had disappeared
he could hear them running through the
undergrowth when hemingwood was
really madit was a sort of cold calculat-
ing fury that was his condition as he
examined apperson it was a rather nasty
looking wound in the hip but apparently
it was only a deep flesh wound as he
bound it with handkerchief and belt he said
tersely think you can move at all

  apperson tried winced and said i
could hobble in an emergency sir-r-r
whats in your mind may i ask 

  hemingwood explained quickly if
there was a way to get those men hed do
it and he did not figure the odds against
him

   the self-starter worked the second time
he spun the booster magneo the ship was
already in position for the take-off with
utter recklessness he shoved the throttle
full on and the ship
hurled itself toward
the dense blackness
of the trees behind
a cold motor at
the last second he
zoomed the de hav-
iland across the
menacing wall and
the matchless lib-
erty did its work half a minute later he
had spotted the fugitives below like ghosts
slipping through the shadows

  he gave them one chance the first
burst from his guns was close to them but
not aimed exactly at them then he
swooped so low he was scraping the tops
of the trees and motioned them back to-
ward the field with his arm they must
realize that he held their lives in the palm
of his hand

   they did he saw them ostentatiously
drop their guns and with their hands in
the air in token of surrender start walking
back toward the field apperson was wait-
ing for them hemingwood rode herd
on them from the air while he watched the
crippled scotchman supervise while one
man tied up his fellows with safety wire
from the ship

   they knew that the best they could do
would be to kill apperson-and then all
succumb themselves to that withering blast
of death from the air

  for the next thirty seconds heming-
wood flew as he never had before it was
a rare feat of airmanship to land his de
haviland in the darkness on that field but
he did it

   he climbed out and looked their cap-
tives over one of them was a gaunt old
man with a gray tobacco stained beard
three of them seemed to be middle-aged
and there were two young fellows one
who had fallen seemed little more than a
boy apperson was binding his wound
the bullet had drilled through his thigh
another man was wounded in the shoulder
neither wound was mortal

  hemingwood was thinking hard as to
his next step appersons wound was
practically negligible although he had to
hobble on one foot and it drew a sigh from
him every time his other foot touched the
ground keeping those men prisoners
meant a good deal of trouble and red tape
probably the whole clan would descend on


short stories

the flyers to revenge themselves if they
stayed in the mountains and very possibly
there would be complications of consider-
able difficulty in even incarcerating them
besides his business was to get those pic-
tures

  apperson was lying on the ground to
relieve his pain hemingwood looked
down at his captives for a moment in si-
lent appraisal they darted quick fear-
ful glances at him like trapped animals

  listen you calleys he said conversa-
tionally youve tried to kill us twice
once it was because you were afraid we
were after you that shows youre up to
something i could have killed you all
then i wounded one of you by accident
in trying to scare you then you pull
this i could have killed you all again
you know that

  now get this i dont give a damn
about you im here to take pictures i
dont want trouble i dont care whether
youre making moonshine enough to float
the british navy ive got you now to
show you that i dont want to bother with
you im going to let you take your
wounded and vamoose out of here go
home lay off me and behave yourselves
weve sniped three of you in exchange for
one little wound and by god if you lift
a finger at me again ill mow you all down
get anywhere near this field and those
machine gunsll start working from the
ground they wouldnt know that the
guns on the ship were useless on the
ground unless dismounted and get
funny while im in the air and the same

thingll happen
and if you snipe
me off some
night while im
here youll have
enough of the
united states
army combing
these woods for
you to run you
down like rats
all the dope
will be mailed
in tomorrow in-
cluding who you
are and what
youve done
now im going
to spank you and send you home like the
baa boys you are

  a long sigh came from the astounded
prisoners followed by a deep chuckle from
the om man apperson showed no sur-

prise hemingwood released them and
they got to their feet slowly the old man
smiled slowly and it made a great change
in his fierce hawk-like face

  yuh can think o the calleys as yore
friends stranger he said slowly cmon
hyar you

  carrying their wounded they marched
silently off into the forest

v

ess than five minutes after the calleys
had disappeared into the woods the
clatter of an approaching automo-
bile interrupted the reminiscent conversa-
tion of the two airmen

  it was the mumford truck and it car-
ried mumford gail morgan and five other
men one of them he perceived was
ballardson another was a doctor who
got to work on apperson immediately

  gail told me all about it lieutenant
said mumford of course we couldnt

let a thing like this go on-

  of course not interrupted ballard-
son the fat peace officer was ill at ease
and showed it im glad there wasnt
nothin to it

  there was something to it but it ended
all right hemingwood told him and a
perverse imp in his eyes was unseen in
the darkness he narrated the nights
events briefly and then added im sure
grateful to you for sending me that note
of warning

  he was watching closely and knew he
had scored ballardsons mouth opened
and closed in fish-like gasps hemingwood
turned to the other men who were sud-
denly interested

  got an anonymous note warning me to
get out of town for safetys sake just
found out it was from ballardson here
thanks again officer

  the men were silent as though at a com-
plete loss for words hemingwood knew
however that he had put a weapon in their
hands which would save both them and
him any reprisal from the crooked official
for the nights work he was aware of
how slight an excuse was needed for a
mountain feud and surmised that mum-
ford and the other east point men had
made a real sacrifice in coming to his
assistance

  the men drifted over to the ship to ex-
amine it at close range hemingwood gave
mumford succinct details about the note
and the successful shot he had fired at
ballardson a moment before and then
moonlight and moonshine

joined gail who had been standing quietly
in the background

  gail we never can thank you enough
of course he said

  dont try then ill take it for
granted she laughed back

 she was elusively lovely in the moon-
light and hemingwood found himself in
the grip of profoundly disturbing emo-
tions

  ever since i arrived youve been doing
favors for me he found himself saying
and then to his own surprise he added
i wish youd do me one more favor and
marry me

  for a second her glorious eyes met his
own squarely then she turned away
quickly and laughed

  it might not be a favor she said
lightly and slipped away toward her
uncle

  the truck carried apperson back to
town but hemingwood stayed out at the
field he did not sleep well either hour
after hour he examined himself mentally
and in the end he decided that he was
afraid he was in love

  the succeeding week only made him
surer of it while apperson was conval-
escing he spent every possible hour with
gail but never was the subject closest to
his heart mentioned george arlington
hemingwood who had never known what
it was to be shy or at a loss was totally
unable to nerve himself for the ordeal of
a serious proposal night after night he
tried only to stutter off into banal noth-
ings

  that is until the morning when apper-
son being recovered and the pictures all
taken they were about to take off for
home with a crowd around to watch the
take-off his helmet and goggles on his
head and the motor idling along on the
warm-up under appersons skillful hand
he impulsively bent over and whispered
his plea into her ear she listened quietly
her hand clasped in his they were in
back of the crowd and for the moment
seemed to be inhabiting a little world all
their own

  cant you possibly say yes   he asked
her his eyes holding hers steadily

  im sorry-but i dont quite know yet
she whispered i like you better than
any man ive ever known she hesitated
and then leaned close to him and said
rapidly i think i want to say yes-but



george im not sure perhaps this sum-
mer-

  he pressed her eagerly for a definite
answer but she shook her head even so
there was a song on his lips and such a
leaping light in his eyes as he got in the
ship that apperson took one look at him
glanced at the flushed face of the girl and
smiled an enigmatic smile below his owl-
like goggles

  hemingwood took off circled the field
and then obeyed an impulse to give the
crowd a parting thrill he swooped down
low over the field and waved a farewell
in the forefront of the crowd he saw gail
and she was beckoning wildly for a mo-
ment he stared she was signaling him
down

  he landed taxied the ship to the edge of
the field and turned it around she ap-
peared alongside the plane her hair
whipping in the propellor blast and her
eyes glowing warmly the astonished
crowd looked on wondering as she put
her lips close to his ear and said quickly
when i saw you leav-
ing i found out that i was
sure will you be back
this week-end

  george arlington hem-
ingwood yelled like a co-
manche indian and started
to climb out

 not now-no

  all right tell all the
folks and ill be here sat-
urday if i have to build a ship

  thuswise she sent him away

not until goddard field was in
sight did george arlington hem-
ingwood of the hemingwoods of
boston come out of his rose tinted trance
his face was one wide grin as he sent the
ton-and-a-half bomber roaring downward
in sweeping spirals and graceful wing-
turns

  just before i left i seem to remember
some remarks about love and matrimony
he reflected ill have to tell these rough-
necks some time i suppose wont that
boy snapper rave and wont i get the
razz

  he did it continued spasmodically long
after the quarters of mr and mrs hem-
ingwood became a popular gathering place
but hemingwood bore up under it wonder-
fully
uncle billy watsons job

by owen clarke treleaven
author of the fool prospectors new suit the law of the shark gods etc

 uncle billy was a gun crank he- knew it he gloried in it others
   made fun of the old-timer and his old-time guns then came
 the test with uncle billys last job as guard for high grade ore

neither man could have ex-
plained why they did not be-
gin shooting the instant they
caught sight of each other as
they had so often threatened
to do perhaps it was the surprise of
meeting thus unexpectedly after a lapse
of twenty years that caused the momen-
tary hesitation as they met in the road-
and that hesitation tided them over the
ticklish second when their right hands
trembled with nerve tension unafraid
each man looked coolly into the others
eyes

  then uncle billy watson frowned and
laid the old fashioned colts gun which he
had been fondly examining down beside
him on the seat of the two wheeled cart
he laid it down reluctantly with loving
care and his horny hand seemed to caress
the polished pistol grip-for uncle billy
was what the east would have termed an
antique firearm collector but what the
west laconically dubbed a gun crank

  his brows drew together as he laid down
the antique pistol and he abruptly turned
his horses head to pass the approaching
rider but the equestrian pulled up his
handsome black gelding squarely in the
middle of the road and sat awaiting uncle
billys first move his hand significantly
rested on his right thigh and there was a
sneer upon his swarthy face

  uncle billys calm was phlegmatic

  hort lakey he began in cold meas-
ured accents i swore id shoot ye the next
time i laid eyes on you but now-i
dunno im considerable oldern i was
when we parted and mebbe i got more
sense now i didnt have much then or
id never have hooked up with you-thats
dead certain but now i dunno as i care
to risk swinging for killing you where you
sit it wouldnt be much of a trick for
me to do but it would be a risk when i
cant prove you burned our cabin with all
my antique guns twenty years ago an i
cant prove that ye stole them coffee cans
that held my share of the dust and nug-
gets i cant prove nothin and im too
smart for ye i can see the fever to draw
in your eye hort lakey so pull over to
the side of the road and let me by id

be ashamed t
death to have
anybody come
along and see
m e talkin to
ye

  the sneer on
the dark face of
the man on the
horse broadened
one excuse
is as goods another the truth probably
is youre too old to work that fast draw of
uncle billy watsons job	

yours any more and ill bet you aint got
a gun with you that was made later than
i so you couldnt do any shootin if you
was itching to especially if you ever got
that colts brevet you was always belly-
aching for-

  uncle billy lovingly picked up the long
barrelled gun from the seat

   i got that brevet here he interrupted
after twenty years search i found her
today and shes in first rate workin
order dont you worry about that but i
tell you hort lakey i aint going to use
it on ye you aint worth the risk id be
takin get out of my way im going
home

   lakey laughed tantalizingly

  so you cant be prodded into fighting
all right guess then id better give you
the message i was sent to deliver ed
summers wants you should go up to the
golden horn to see him hes got a job
for you one of them guard jobs like you
had with the express company a dan-
gerous job like you always said you
craved he laughed at his own words
and dont forget if you get the job that
i recommended you for it dont forget
that

  he wheeled his horse and spurred it into
a gallop in the direction from which he
had come his arrogant laugh floated back
to uuncle billy who sat fondly handling
the antique pistol

akey proceeded at a fast pace up the
road until he had put a mile between
-j him and uncle billy watson then
he stopped his horse and looked back uncle
billy was not in sight lakey abruptly
left the road and crossed the creek below
a dam which was used to divert part of the
stream into a ditch that followed the hills
around to rosss reservoir

  he crossed the stream and went up a
draw on the other side at some little
distance from the creek he dismounted and
tied his horse to a small digger pine he
continued on foot until he came within
sight of a large boulder here he stopped
and whistled softly

  instantly a long barrelled pistol ap-
peared from behind the rock to be fol-
lowed by a mans head lakey called re-
assuringly and went to the hidden man

  its all fixed lew he chuckled i
just met the old coot down the road a
piece and hes going to see ed summers
about the job aint that rich him with
his old fashioned pistol aguardin all that
gold and tickled as a kid he is be-

cause at last somebody wants to hire him
if he only knew that tomorrows the last
time hell ever see the sunrise-haw haw
shoot his mouth off about me stealing his
gold and burning up his crazy old guns
will he  run me out of the best mining
country i ever -saw with his threats to
shoot me huh well i went all right
but its my turn now i been figgering
for years on how to get him and i got my
chance at last him and the gold will be
got tomorrow lew ol timer-well kill
two birds with the same stone

  for a long time they squatted there on
their heels cowpuncher fashion and plan-
ned the events of the morrow

ii

uncle billy sat a few minutes
longer where lakey had left him
he experienced several emotions
his first impulse was to fling his old bat-
tered hat into the air in wild hilarious
jubilation over the fact that a job had
been offered him

  for the last few years uncle billy had
found it more and more difficult to get
work no one wanted an old man it
seemed lumbago made it almost impos-
sible for him to get out and prospect for
himself so he had been forced to con-
tent himself with odd jobs now and then
which paid little money of late a hide-
ous worry had come to haunt his nights
he was afraid that he would have to spend
his last few years in the alms house sub-
ject of charity and object of pity that
would have quite broken uncle billys
heart

  and now he had actually been offered a
job he chuckled and grinned to himself
as he drove along

  then he was bewildered at lakeys last
words what had lakey to do with the
golden horn mine  and why had he
recommended him for the job he won-
dered-

  uncle billy realized now on second
thought that he had detected an innuendo
in lakeys last words at the time of utter-
ance had sensed an underlying connota-
tion in that last sentence had sensed some-
thing that inexplicably foreboded evil for
himself a dangerous job lakey had
said and had recommended him

  uncle billy grinned and there was a lit-
tle devil-may-care gleam in his steady blue
eyes as he picked up the reins and clucked
to his ancient horse and started toward
murphys hes see ed summers about
io

short stories

that job right pronto a dangerous job
and hort lakey had recommended him for
it-h-m-m-mm

  twenty years ago uncle billy and lakey
had been partners in a claim over in col-
umbia they had prospered steadily and
had got along well together as long as they
made wages but from the day when
they made the first big cleanup their rela-
tions had undergone a change

  lakey had seemed to take every oppor-
tunity to quarrel and bring about a dis-
solution of their partnership he had be-
come surly and suspicious gold does that
to some men his method of provoking
a quarrel had been invariably the same
he had continually ridiculed uncle billy
watsons hobby of collecting antique fire-
arms particularly he had made light of
the older mans great desire for a colts
brevet-a gun believed to have been made
in belgium under colts patents and which
was difficult to obtain in time the bone
of contention between the two had come to
be that brevet gun at the very mention
of the pistol lakey would fly into a rage
and accuse his partner of slighting the
work at the mine to further a crazy hobby
at times he had deliberately baited watson
into anger by insulting remarks about the
hobby and particularly the colts brevet

  then on the night of the big fire which
wiped out nearly all the town their rela-
tions had come to the breaking point their
own cabin stood well aside from the path
the devastating flames had taken but after
the business section of the town had burned
to the ground uncle billy had seen that
his own cabin was be-
ginning to blaze and ar-
rived at the scene just
in time to see someone
making off through the
brush back of the claim

 the cabin was
doomed it had almost
broken uncle billys
heart to stand help-
lessly by watching the
greedy flames consume his beloved collec-
tion of antique firearms which had by this
time assumed respectable proportions and
value the fact that his coffee cans filled
with gold hidden under the floor might not
be there melted into chunks of blackened
metal when the fire had burned out did
not occur to him

  he had stood guard over the smoking
embers that night and wondered at the ab-
sence of his partner probably drunk
with the others who had assisted their fa-

vorite saloon-keepers to save some of the
liquid stock he thought

  but in the morning after he had
searched in vain for the melted chunks of
gold and lakey was still missing-he had
known others learning of the loss had
argued the possibility of lakeys death in
the fire but uncle billy had known better
the loss of the guns and the gold as a mo-
tive for the burning of the cabin had been
all too apparently the reason for lakeys
absence

   as the years passed there came reports
from lakey uncle billy made his threats
as to what would happen if the two ever
met and lakey countered with his boasts
as was the custom of the period when two
men went gunning for each other but
from that day of the fire until this they
had not met and now after twenty years
they encountered each other on the day
when uncle billy had acquired the pistol
which had been the cause of the trouble
between them

   uncle billy turned off the main street
in murphys at morleys garage and went
out the cave road two hours later he
arrived at the golden mine and went up
to the unpainted shack which served as an
office building he noted with surprise
the several tents pitched on the slope of
the hill below the shaft of the mine must
be putting on more men he thought the
few cabins above the office had sufficed to
house the small gang of miners who had
worked here laboriously uncle billy
climbed the slope to the office his back
bothered him and he hoped the job he was
to contract for would not be hard work

  ed summers appeared on the porch of
the office building

  come right on in uncle billy he
boomed summers was a large man big
and hearty in all his actions and he always
shouted there was something likeable in
his bluff ways you felt he was a man to
be trusted come on in he repeated
been expecting you for an hour now

   uncle billy took off his battered hat as
he entered the office he did it rather
hesitatingly

  none of that now summers roared
none of that youre here to be hired
not apprenticed jus you keep that there
hat on your head-you look too darn naked
with it off he laughed

  youve asked me for a job two-three
times now uncle billy and i declare i
always hated to have to say i couldnt use
you but just here the other day a job-
a sort o peculiar kind of job you might
uncle billy watsons job

say-come up and i says to myself thats
the job for him 

  he laughed again as if to relieve uncle
billy of any embarrassment he might feel
at applying again for work then the big
mans face grew serious and he lowered
his voice until it merely rumbled in a
throaty undertone

   fact of the matter is ol timer this job
is jus the result of a peculiar hunch ive
got heres the how of it

  the golden horns struck something
rich day before yesterday we busted into
something that took my breath away were
in rock thats goin better than four hun-
dred dollars a pound he leaned back
and beamed largely upon uncle billy

  it may be only a pocket and it may be
the biggest thing this countrys known since
the old days-i dont know but it means
were able to send twice as much ore down
to the smelter because dontyou see its
so all-fired rich it dont have to be stamped
here now you know we only got one
truck an its been hauling capacity loads
down to angels camp one load a day
thats all one truck can do

  now if this is only a pocket it wont
jay to buy another truck so i made ar-
rangements with ol man ryan to help
freight the ore down to the railroad at
angels hes got that big string of jacks
doin nothing but running wild over the
hills blondys going to make two trips a
day in the truck down to where the six
mile road makes the big bend at that gar-
land ranch gate

  well blondys goin to dump the stuff
there and ryans to take it on in the rest
of the way he can go through the gar-
land ranch and over the hills by george
taylors property and save quite a little
hat way come out on the angels road at
the concrete bridge you know

   well that part of its all right but after
t made the arrangements i begun to worry
about leavin all that ore laying there for
ryans second trip course i dont sup-
jiose anybodyd bother it these aint the
old wild and woolly days but somehow i
cant help thinking that itd be a whole lot
lietter if i had somebody someone i can
trust down there to sort o keep an eye on
those sacks of ore

  thats the hunch i had and thats the
job i have for you they tell me you
were a shotgun messenger once upon a
time and that you still have the old eye and
a darn handy way of pulling a gun

  tell me uncle billy had a sudden
thought tell me who i take orders from



if i take this job does this here skunk
hort lakey have anything to do with

me

  oh thats right you did have some
trouble with lakey once didnt you id
forgot that no you wont have to take
orders from anybody but me

  fact of the matter is i dont think any -
body around here will have to take orders
from lakey much longer i dont likt-
the way he does business i hired him
for my assistant two-three weeks ago on
very good recommendation from a mine up
in trinity county and im getting sick
of him already so dont let that worry
you

  well what do you say ol timer ill
pay seven dollars a day and furnish you
with a gun to sort o have handy in case
anything did happen he got up and
went to a drawer in his desk from which

he took a large
automatic pis-
tol

   course 
dont believe
theys any dan-
ger of anything
happening but
its always best
to be on the
safe side he proffered the gun

  uncle billy smiled

  no thank you kindly mr summers
i wouldnt care for that there thing i
never shot one of em and never want to
i got a dandy gun of my own ill load up
and carry along why yes ill take the
job and be obliged to you how long do
ye reckon it will last he dropped his
eyes as he asked the question and then
raised them to look anxiously out of the
window trying to appear casual and un-
concerned

  the big man cleared his throat

  well i cant say rightly might be a
few days might be longer you see if
this vein keeps on just the same ill buy
one or more trucks it wouldnt pay to
keep hiring ol man ryans jacks if it
peters out well well go back to making the
one haul a day down to angels thats all
anyway he beamed and laid a hand on
uncle billys shoulder ill hire you right
now for a week

ill

uncle billys heart was heavy as
he went down the slope to has old
horse and dilapidated two wheeled
cart only a weeks work and he had

short stories

come up here buoyed with the hope that
he would find steady employment before
he reached the town however a thought
struck him that made him feel better of
all the men in and around murphys he
had been the one chosen to guard the gold
uncle billy had always been very proud
of his position with the express company
in the dangerous days when large ship-
ments of bullion were carried out of the
hills sometimes the carrying of the gold
out of the hills was interrupted and others
assumed the conveyance of the precious
metal there had been two such occasions
in uncle billys life and each time he had
saved the shipment for the company he
still carried a slug of lead somewhere under
his left shoulder blade sometimes he
wondered if that had anything to do with
the lumbago

  by the time he had reached his shack on
the willow lined bank of the creek back of
the mitchler hotel he felt better he was
humming a little tune as he lovingly ex-
amined and fondled the brevet pistol he
had wanted so long and his thoughts went
back to the days when the percussion cap
guns had delt quick death to those who at-
tempted to take the bullion away from the
company-and him

  uncle billy put his horse away and
wheeled the old cart under the shed as
he came up to the cabin door an old gray
cat sleek and well fed luxuriantly
stretched itself on the doorstep and lazily
came to him its tail big and stiffly erect
and rubbed against his boots purring
fiercely uncle billy shifted the brevet
pistol to his left hand and stooped over to
rub the cats back

  he was preparing his frugal supper
when a step sounded at the open door
the crickets and frogs down beneath the
willows back of the cabin abruptly stilled
their twilight singing as the steps came
near and uncle billys brows swung sharp-
ly together as he saw who his visitor was
he stepped quickly to the door as if to
deny the man entrance and stood silently
watchful and frankly frowning waiting
for him to speak

  horton lakey smiled ingratiatingly and
stepped forward as if to enter the cabin
uncle billy stood firm in the doorway

  oh well if you aint goin to be hos-
pitable to an old pardner all right i just
happened to be uptown waiting for tibo
to bring the mail and i thought id step
down here for a minute or two i wanted
to find out if you got the job

  i did and i dunno as your recom-

mendation had so much to do with it after
all uncle billy straightened his bent
shoulders pridefully mebbe ed sum-
mers knew i was a good man for the job
without your say-so why are you so
anxious to know did ye figger on me
giving you a rake-off on the first days
pay 

  oh no nothing like that lakeys
eyes half concealed under their suddenly
dropped lids glittered in the glare of the
lamplight within the cabin and he wet his
lips with a quick tongue i was just in-
terested bein as im assistant superintend-
ent up to the mine thought id find out
if the boss hired the right man for the
job

  well mebbe he did uncle billy
snapped he was tired of this mans ar-
rogance if theys nothin else you
wanted to know hort lakey-

  thats all lakey turned to go i
suppose the super dont take much stock
in your moss-covered guns and gave you
his automatic to carry tomorrow his
eyes were bright and steadily fixed on the
older mans face and he eagerly awaited
the answer

  i dont care how many automatics hes
got i dont want any of em uncle
billy snapped im going to load one of
these here real guns of mine with extry
heavy charges of powder and ball and i
reckon it will stand by me in case of any
trouble

  uncle billy went back to his preparations

for supper in
high dudgeon
m o s s-covered
guns it was
sacrilege his
bright blue eyes
raised to the im-
posing array of
pistols attached
to the farther
wall of the room
and he snorted
angrily auto-
matics huh automatics hell catch
him carrying one of them new-fangled
things and mebbe forgetting to slip off the
safety catch to em before he fired-if he
had to fire

  he carried a battered frying-pan of
smoking bacon and a plate of chili beans
to the pine table took the blackened coffee
pot off the stove and set it in front of his
plate and sat down to his meal abruptly
he got up again and brought the newly ac-
quired treasure the brevet pistol to the
uncle billy watsons job

 table and laid it beside his plate from
 time to time he studied it as a book-worm
 will read his book during a meal studied
 it picked it up and examined it with the
 all absorbed interest of a connoisseur and
 collector

    he spent the evening with his treasures
 as usual and when he was ready for bed
 he loaded one of the old pistols and slid
 it into a worn old holster that was polished
 and shining from much contact with
 smooth metal and scarred on the outside
 from rough usage

    he was up when the first rosy streaks of
 dawn appeared over the mountain above
  the power house on the big tree road
 he hummed happily while he cooked
 breakfast and the old gray cat purred as
 if it too knew that the day was auspicious
 uncle billy was happier than he had been
 for years he had a job

   to be sure ed summers had said it was
 only a short time job but who could tell
 suppose some crazy half-breed indian got
 his skin full of jackass and decided to try
 and steal some of that all-fired rich ore
 suppose somebody tried to stop ol man
 ryan and he should holler for help and
 he uncle billy should come a runnin and
 with his heavily loaded pistol defend the
 companys ore as he had defended the
 express companys consignments why-
 why wouldnt it stand to reason ed sum-
 mers would be grateful and give him a
 lifelong job with the company why
 sure he would

   hed say uncle billy words can not
 describe my everlasting gratitude to you
 there is nothing i will not do for you
 i-

   doggone me uncle billy shamefully
 confided to the big gray cat im getting
 as silly as a hoot owl goin to play
 actin about a durned ornery job standing
 guard over some gold like id never had
 any experience at all they couldnt be
 no such luck as anything happenin to make
 a heero outa me and if they did aint i
 found out from experience that when a
 company hires a guard they figger any-
 thing that happens while hes workin as
 being simply within his duty  shucks
 cat im getting old thats alls the matter
 with me gettin old and mebbe childish

    nevertheless he laughed gleefully at the
 thought childish he knew he was not
 he felt better and stronger this morning
 than he had for years the keen tang of
 the morning air and the zest of his new
 job made him feel positively young again
 with happy ostentation he buckled on the

heavy old pistol he had selected and loaded
last night and went out to hitch up the
old horse for the ride over to the cache on
the six mile road

iv

horton lakey according to

previous arrangement met the
man he had talked to in the draw
yesterday and whom he had called lew
in an abandoned cabin several miles from
the scene of uncle billys lonely vigil with
the sacks of ore there was a full hour
before the truck would arrive with its
precious load he knew and he tethered
his black gelding outside the cabin and the
two men sat smoking for a while each
busy with his thoughts and each a little
nervous

  did you loose ryans jacks lakey
queried after a while

  cut their hobbles lew draper an-
swered

  i could see theyd been used to runnin
wild just as you said they had for they
took out for the hills the minute i turned
em loose i figger it will take ol man
ryan the better part of the day to round
them up thats what you said you
wanted

  thats the dope the truck will get to
the cache with the first load along about
eleven oclock it will be way past noon
at the earliest before ryan gets them jacks
caught and gets started after his first load
he wont get to the cache until blondy gets
there with the second load  well see to
that if we have to shoot him we got to
do our work between the time the truck
gets there with the second load and ryans
appearance its too bad we cant work
this somehow to get more than todays
haul but i guess it cant be done after
today when they find that crazy old gun
cranks body therell be a posse out thatll
string from hell to breakfast

  youre sure you got enough mules to
pack all the sacks over to your mine lew 

  sure thing and i got enough ore on
the dump to mix this golden horn stuflf
into then when i strike my pocket all
i gotta do is sack up the mixed stuff and
send her down below

  all right thats that well have
our lunch and get started over there but
mind i want you to remember one thing
uncle billy watson the old fool is my
meat if i ketch you taking a bead on
him when were drawing his fire ill kill
you where you lay

aw thats all right yuh dont need to
no

short stories

get hard boiled about it you can play
out your own feud with the ol coot it
aint none of my game how you figger-
ing on getting him to fire all six shots be-
fore we show ourselves

  easy play the old trick of the hat be-
hind the boulder
hell bite all
right thepi
when his old gun
is empty well
walk up on him
he cant reload
in less than five
minutes and
when we step
out in plain
sight- lakey
drew a long sibilant breath between his
teeth and his mouth tightened in to sinister
smile of grim satisfaction-im going to
talk to him a little while i want him to
know im going to kill him want him
to have a minute or two to think it over
while i tell him a few things and then
when hes listened to me long enough
im going to raise this automatic of mine-
goin to bring it up nice and slow so he
can watch it come on a line with his head
-and then ill drill him right between his
eyes

v

uncle billy arrived at the des-
ignated spot for the transfer of the
ore sacks tethered his old horse on
a long picket rope and prepared to take
things easy he took a sack filled with
hay from the cart and propped it against
an oak tree it would make a comfort-
able seat while he awaited the arrival of
the truck and ryans appearance the sun
was warm and the old man sighed and
stretched on his sack beneath the tree
the warm air felt good on his back es-
pecially to that stiff area where a bandits
leaden slug remained a constant reminder
of the old days when a guarding job meant
occasional trouble

  he smiled to himself as he thought of
the almost ludicrous contrast the last job
he had had as a guard and this one
pretty good joke he thought to be out
here almost within sound of tourists auto-
mobile horns armed with an old-fashioned
pistol against the probable theft of ore
sacks probable  he smiled broadly as
if anyone would try to do a thing like that
in this day and age  it was funny all right
he drew a much thumbed catalogue of an-
tique guns from his sagging coat and de-

lightedly fell to perusing the beloved
pages he grinned with conscious pride
of possession when he came to a cut of one
of those brevet pistols one of the most
difficult of old guns to obtain well he
had his funny how a man could spend
twenty years searching for a thing all over
the west and then come to find it in a
neighboring town like his quest for one
of patterson colts the one without a trig-
ger guard and with a folding trigger hed
looked all over for one and at last had to
pay two hundred and fifty dollars for this
one

  two hundred fifty dollars the guilty
thought came to him that he could sell that
very gun right now for more than that
they were very rare that money would
go a long way toward keeping him inde-
pendent but even as he thought of it
he was horrified sell that little beauty
never it would be like parting with his
own flesh and blood

  then the first truckload of ore sacks
came to break his reverie and he helped the
driver stack them in a neat pile the
truck returned to the mine and uncle billy
ate his meager lunch sandwiches of bacon
and biscuits and a bottle of cold black
coffee

  three oclock came and ryan had not
shown up then uncle billy heard the
exhaust of the truck and it soon put in an
appearance

  for the love of mike blondy what do
you reckons happened to ol man ryan
if he dont get here for his first load
pretty quick ill have to put in half the
night waiting for him to come for the
rest

  guess his jacks got loose during the
night i see him from the top of the last
hill driving them toward the trail hell
be along pretty quick now id stay and
help you pack but i gotta get right back
the boss he wants me to help repair the
hoist thats why i made it here with
the second load so speedy aint had a
bite to eat yet ed wants to get the hoist
fixed before the night shift goes on at six
well so long

  uncle billy was worried he didnt like
to have anything go wrong about this job
it didnt augur well what if ryan had
to make the second trip across the hills to
angels in the dark anything might hap-
pen he didnt like it it made him ner-
vous and he fell to watching sharply

  then it was he heard a slight crackle as
if someone had broken a dry branch under-
foot he turned quickly to face the di-
uncle billy watsons job

hi

rection from which the sound came in-
stantly another noise sounded from be-
hind him

  whos there he called sharply

  there was no answer another sound
behind him caused him to whirl

  if anybodys there speak up or come
out where i can see ye he called quickly
there was no answer and he turned his
head to watch in the direction from which
the other noise had come then he drew
the old-fashioned colts gun and raised
the hammer

  he had seen the tip of a black hat rise
and then lower behind a boulder

  if ye dont come out in sight before i
count three ill fire on ye he threatened

  there was no sound he turned again
and saw the top of another hat appear
instantly he fired the heavy charge caus-
ing the gun to kick sharply upward the
hat disappeared and for a few moments
there was no move around him

  then the thing happened again and he
fired two shots the fourth shot was de-
livered with oldtime cunning uncle billy
saw that a small boulder lay behind the
rock which concealed the wearer of one of
the black hats behind it and a little to one
side he fired directly at the small boulder

and a fierce
i grunt of pain
ttold him of some
i sort of a hit-
likely some lead
 or a fragment of
 rock he thought

  the other hat
i now came into

	view and before
it disappeared
uncle billy fired
again again he fired another shot at the
smaller rock

  hardly had the reverberations of the
sixth shot echoed and died when two men
arose from their concealment and walked
toward uncle billy the foremost one
was horton lakey and his face was con-
tracted into a hideous expression of rage
and pain a dark stain was spreading on
his light colored shirt at his left shoulder
the two men walked toward the guard
and neither one made a move to draw
the pistols which hung at their hips

  uncle billy still held his gun before
him the barrel slightly pointed upward his
thumb hooked over the high hammer as
if he would fire again

  lakey stepped forward and halted a

dozen paces from the old man wincing
with the pain of his wounded shoulder

  you cn get a little satisfaction outa
the knowledge that you shot me before you
died watson his voice changed and he
grinned a toothy grin like the grimace of
a huge ape you know youre going to
die dont you-you old fool 

  uncle billys eyes were peculiar to be-
hold there wasnt a vestige of fear in
their calm blue depths it was almost as
if he welcomed what was to come even
it seemed he was eager for it to begin he
calmly looked from lakeys snarling face
to lew drapers eager one if ever he
had looked upon the lust to kill he was
looking upon it now he still held the
heavy colts revolver before him as if he
were not aware he had fired its sixth shot

  course i know whats in your mind
hort lakey he said slowly youre
aiming to shoot me just as you threatened
to do twenty years ago and just as i
threatened to shoot you 

  you pretty near got human intelli-
gence lakey sneered i could have
shot you an hour ago before the second
truck came but i didnt want to do it
from cover i wanted to wait until youd
had a chance to show what your damn ol
guns can do for you in a tight pinch

  and too i wanted you to know what
im aiming to do beside killing you i
wanted you to know that you couldnt hold
down your last job i wanted ed sum-
mers to know hed picked the wrong man
im going to take these here sacks and
pack them on some mules lews got over
the hill a piece goin to take them away
and leave your worthless old carcass here
to tell the story of your failure

  hort lakey uncle billy was stern
im goin to give you and lew draper one
chance you clear out of here both of
you get going and keep going-clear out
of the country if you do that-

 haw haw the two men laughed
uproariously

  are you goin 

  for answer they laughed again

  all right youre asking for it

  as fast as the movement of the hand of
a magician uncle billy raised the colts
gun he still held before him there was
a flash and a roar and lakey spun half-
way around and fell on his face another
roar and still another and as lew draper
was reaching for his own gust he too spun
first one way and then the other and
slumped into a heap on the ground they
lay where they fell silent motionless

crumpled into awkward postures uncle
billy stood perfectly still

  the tap-tap-tap of a woodpeckers bill
on dead wood sounded from nearby a
meadow lark sang throatily the chang
chang of a brass cowbell sounded from a
distant pasture in the garland ranch

  then the splutter of a flivver ed sum-
mers came running toward uncle billy
who stood blowing the smoke from his
gun barrel

 what- why-

  uncle billy grinned happily

  little fuss he said simply these
here hombres thought they knew a way to
get away with your gold mr summers
this one he pointed toward lakey he
always did think he knew how to do every-
thing always thought he knew more
than me he did didnt know much about
old guns though didnt know a colts
brevet was made with ten chambers as

well as six and eight he held the gun
forward and beamed upon ed summers

  the big man looked at the gun and
gasped

 did you- are they dead

  dead  naw jest kinda fainted
thought mebbe twenty-thirty years in the
pen would be better for them that would
be crude work for a man like me i just
shot a hole in each of their shoulders
thats all a man fixed that-a-way cant
do any shootin that is i shot two of 
drapers shoulders and only one of lakeys
-the left i i wanted him to go for his
gun with his right but he didnt he
giggled and then beamed quite shamelessly

  and that night when the prisoners had
been delivered to a deputy sheriff ed
summers made uncle billy watsons play
acting of the early morning real he
did deliver a speech and he did put uncle
billy on the payroll for life

  among the snow-tipped peaks of kashmir smith of detroit was
  to see that to molest the hidden tomb of a mogul of the chitralis
  was to arouse a deadly power more terrible than any modern weapon

chapter i

the beginning of the trail

one dusty morning i found a
piece of paper on my desk in
the offices of pan american
motors on woodward ave-
nue detroit it was a yellow
paper about as big as my hand and what it
said was this

  when convenient mr hacket would
like to see mr smith in his office

  hacket was about third assistant sales
manager of pan am and i was general
utility man with a reputation for getting
into trouble it turned out that hacket
had something worse than trouble on his
mind and that was an idea

ever been in india smith he asked

  i told him i didnt think so and he
looked as if i was trying to tell him some-
thing that was not so said my card-ap-
plication card filed with the personnel de-
partment on entering pan am motors-
had stated distinctly that i had lived there
for three years

  that must be a l smith i ex-
plained after thinking it over hes
been laid up for two months with double
pneumonia my name is alexander mc-
donald smith

  this only bothered hacket for a min-
ute after all the idea was not his and

he saw no reason to worry about it so he
explained things in the rapid fire manner
of a young fellow who thinks its business-
like to be swift

  the pan am directors had asked our
chiefs why we were not selling more cars
to the orient we had a few sales and a
lot of inquiries from japan but india was
a blank someone had dug up figures to
prove that there were so many thousand
cars in india and practically none of
american make the climate there in a
good part of the country was an all-year
affair like southern california the oil
supply was plenteous and convenient and
so forth our competitors for some rea-
son were not trying to sell cars there

  you remember how the business part of
the u s of a shortly after the war fig-
ured out to launch a government merchant
marine in all the seven seas whichever they
may be and to corner the trade of south
america and drill for oil in alaska and
so forth well pan american motors
was making more money then than it knew
what to do with and starting plants in
canada and england with trade in gen-
eral booming and buzzing nobody thought
of the bumps nobody ever does

  so motors was going to send a repre-
sentative to india and hacket picked me
as hereinbefore related to find out-trans-
portation and ten dollars a day paid-if
there was a market for our cars and if

pawed over his papers and finally went off
to ask about it when he came back he
said it was british india so i listened to
another bunch of instructions and went
oft to clear out my desk and wait for let-
ters of introduction and tickets nobody
asked if i wanted to go

  as a matter of fact i did badly any
other place would have done as well it
was a dusty morning and the office win-
dows were opened wide for the first time
that summer the jangle of the street
cars down woodward was as bad as the
clatter of the typewriters and i had not
set foot off pavement for eight months

  lord how a fellow gets to hate the
streets when a straw bonnet and a park
and open windows are the only things he
can see of a change in the season

  if i had known what sort of a camp i
was bound for a couple of months hence
id have yelped out loud i didnt imagine
such a thing and you couldnt if you tried
think of a few tents bunched over a snow-
fed river three thousand feet below
trees bigger than the california sequoias
and mountains crowding all around that
would make the rockies look like slag
heaps fishing for what you want and
big game shooting-well for stags bear
and such-like

  man ive sampled a good many kinds
of camps from the week-end auto parking
kind to the government a e f brand
and i want to say right now that this camp
was in a class by itself

  sometimes when the alarm clock does
its stunt and i wake up from dreaming
about that place im in a fever to pick up
again and start off to it and then come
the chills when i think of all that hap-
pened and of the hours when i cursed a
l smith for not going instead of me

  as i said pan american motors start-
ed out to sell the world and before
x jlid been in calcutta a week i
thanked my stars i was not a salesman
we had as much chance of selling cars in
india as i would have of underscoring an
opera

  outside a shipping cost with a duty
tacked on that came to about half the sell-
ing price of a car there were only two rea-
sons why pan american motors would
never flourish in india natives-coolies
they call em-and bullock carts were sit-
ting around waiting for a chance to haul
loads at about a quarter the cents-per-mile
a truck would roll up

  you might investigate kashmir mr
smith someone suggested a splendid
country you know just being opened up
it is in the hills and i imagine the cli-
mate would be a welcome change from
this

  two weeks later i found out that the
advice about kashmir was a merry jest
an englishman may not see one of our
jokes but he can slip one over and look
as serious as an umpire behind the plate
in a worlds series ill tell you about
this kashmir thing when we come to
it

  anything looked better to me than cal-
cutta where the climate was borrowed
from hell i wrote a preliminary report
mailed it and jumped a train for delhi
pronounced dilly to see what their capital
looked like but it was hotter than cal-
cutta and that was worse than new or-
leans in september

  there were some tourists in delhi but
no sightseeing busses and not even a tin
lizzie at the station after one ride
around the city and down their main street
which has a name like a sneeze and a grunt
and means silver street i went back to
my room at the hotel and stayed there
probably it was the heat-id been out in
the streets of calcutta regularly from nine
to five-but i began to have a queer feel-
ing about this india maybe it was caused
by the mob of natives not blacks but
brown men there must have been a mil-
lion or so crowded into a place no bigger
than yonkers and the place had nearly
a million smells all different

  even in my room the electric fan was
not an electric fan it was a kind of super
fly-swatter worked by a rope and some-
wheres i suppose a brown man in a cotton
shirt was pulling the rope through the
screens of the upstairs veranda that was
outside my window i could see the domes of
the camp of the snake

a couple of real palaces and a bunch of
ruins

  it made me feel as if id arrived in a
city that was a couple of thousand years
behind the times all the leading citizens
seemed to be dead at least the ruins they
left were the only sights of the place

when i started to sit down and
write another letter to the bunch
in the office my brain ceased to act
all at once a man was calling something
below the veranda and when he kept on
shouting i went out to see what was doing

  about a dozen natives were squatting
down just below me and a boy began bow-
ing and pointing to an old man who held
a strip of white cloth over his knees

  sahib said the boy here is a won-
der will the sahib please to watch

  the old man held out his bare arms and
draped the cloth over his wrists when
he lifted it i saw a green shoot in the
ground under the place where his hands
had been then he put back the cloth and
everyone looked at me the second time
he pulled back his arms there was a big
twig with green leaves where the shoot
had been

  thats old stuff i told the boy

  yes sahib he came back at me seri-
ously it is older than we remember
please to watch

  the sleight-of-hand man stood up and
jerked off the cloth and pointed to a two
foot shrub with some kind of fruit on it
a minute ago that shrub had been a twig
the boy pulled off the fruit and tossed it
up it was a mangov right enough but
i had seen the mango trick before

  the way it works is this the hand-is-
quicker-than-the-eye artist has a small
bush with a stem sharpened to a point
wrapped up in his apron or sleeve and
when the innocent bystander is busy look-
ing at the twig he slips it under the cloth
then he sticks the point in the ground
shakes out the branches a bit and his stuff
is done

  throw up the bush i grinned at the
boy

  as the sahib wishes to my surprise
he gave the thing a yank and then began to
pull the shrub came up all right but
it brought with it an honest clump of
roots and a wad of earth the old con-
jurer looked up at me and his eyes glinted
i tossed them a handful of coppers it was
worth that much and they began to fight
among themselves for the money all but
the boy

ii

   if the sahib will walk in the sher bagh
 garden this night he will see a greater
 wonder he promised

   when i tried to get the letter started

again my brain
was just as
much a blank as
before i kept
seeing the hin-
du boy and the
old conjurer and
the mango bush
especially the
bush

   of course the
old man could
have had the shrub tucked away in his
jumper somewhere and he could have
slipped it under the cloth if he was very
clever and possibly he might have
brought along a bush with roots hanging
 it and dug a hole with his hands in the
soft black earth

   he must have done that because there
was no other way to explain the trick
but somehow the explanation did not sat-
isfy me the roots had come out of the
ground as if they had been planted there

   that evening a slicked-up army officer
 in the dining-room told me where the sher
 bagh was

chapter ii

the first touch

it was a sort of public garden open-
ing off the hotel with a mosque at the
other end the trees were thick over-
head except in the center where there was
an opening over a narrow well later i
learned there was one of those big tanks
alongside the mosque wall where it was
hidden by some bushes

   a lantern was over the entrance and as
 i came up a boy and a girl walked out
 they looked about old enough to be just
 out of high-school but the english always
 look young and the girl might have been
 nineteen she glanced at me once and
 went on talking probably thinking an
 american tourist was nothing but a neces-
 sary flaw in the landscape

  she was worth looking at twice and
then some her wide white hat hid her
eyes but she carried her chin up i dont
know what a greek profile is still ill lay
odds she had one she could have stepped
into line at the follies and the other
girls would have taken time out to give
her the double-o

short stories

  captain dixon will take you out after
barasang she was saying to the boy if
youll be an angel and come

  rats he mumbled you know per-
fectly well the lower chitral region is all
shot out the only thing really worth
while is the high hill game

  they might as well have been talking
about psychic research for all the meaning
i got out of that not that i stopped to
listen i was watching the girl and won-
dering how a dres made out of such flimsy
stuff seemed to be tailored to fit her be-
fore they were out of hearing i gathered
that he was her brother and broke having
backed the wrong horse at the racetrack
that afternoon also that hed had sev-
eral shots of the whisky and soda variety
she was urging him to go somewhere with
her and he was kicking about it that
was how i guessed she was his sister

  i scratched a match to start up my pipe
and tried to find a cool spot in the park
the heat was like a veil wrapped over my
head and the place was rank with some
kind of flower acacias as i saw the next
day there werent any benches and i
sat down on the stone edge of the well

  the conjuror and the boy were not to
be seen and i wondered how the girl of the
white hat looked cool and what barasang
was and then a voice overhead whis-
pered at me do not be frightened sahib
atcha sahib-

  the stars were blotted out as i looked
up and a human body dropped past me
splashing a dozen feet below in the well
the light was bad and the thing happened
quickly but i thought it was the boy of
the mango trick at least the voice sound-
ed like his he had flashed down a foot
from my eyes and had hit the narrow
mouth of the well without scraping any
of the stones

  it takes more than that to make me
jump i scratched a match and shaded it
to look down the water was quivering
and the scum on its top had been split
apart the sides about four feet apart
were solid rock without a handhold any-
where

  a few bubbles broke at the surface and
then quit coming the skin on my back
began to prickle a bit when i noticed a
snake wiggling around in the scum and
thought that the hindu kid would have a
pleasant surprise when he came up he
didnt come i lit another match from the
first and it burned out after a third
one i knew that anything down in that
well would stay down and half started to

slide in after the kid figuring that he had
bumped his head on a rock

  the snake and another thing helped to
keep me where i was something tugged
at my coat pulling me back when i got
to my feet and swept an arm around in
the darkness under the trees nothing more
happened for a while i listened at the
well without hearing anything

  when a diver comes up after a two min-
ute stay under water he makes a noise like
a fat man breathing after a hundred yard
dash i was certain the boy had not taken
the air again the trick began to look
serious and i was half angry half worried
about him someone else was in the gar-
den the gent or lady who had laid a re-
straining hand on me and was acting like
an unlawful-abiding citizen

  without striking any more matches i
walked back to the hotel veranda and called
to the first white man visible it was the
young bird who had been ragging the girl

  one of the village lads i said has
committed suicide in the well and i am
the party who saw him last either ive
been seeing spooks or wed better hustle
up a pulmotor and a rope

  he looked me over and laughed its
a dashed good trick isnt it didnt the
old budmash come around for some bak-
sheesh 

  no i told him and no bran-mash
either suppose the drinks are on me
eh

  the thin face of the english boy split
in a grin and he explained that it was re-
markable very that the conjuror had not
pursued me to the hotel for a tip bak-
sheesh they called it it was a regular
stunt of theirs and this was how they
worked it

  the hindu child climbed the tree near
which id been sitting and jumped from
a branch out into the well he was an
experienced diver and knew how to swim
through an under-water-conduit that led
to the temple tank not far away

  well we had that drink on the porch
and a couple more each one different
arnold duggendale carnie doing the sug-
gesting while i did the paying he told
me his name and what horse was sure to
win in the race the next day-they only
had one but it was a steeplechase and
lasted until tea time told me hed been
in the saddle of one of the ponies last week
and broken a foreleg-of the horse

  carnie had alert black eyes and a pleas-
ant laugh and did not seem the type for
a jockey i liked him at sight thinking
the camp of the snake

of his sister and he invited me to come and
shoot mountain sheep with him where it
was not so damnably hot

  when i started to undress that night i
found that several items were missing
from my ensemble a wallet with let-
ters from the pan am people with my
passport letters of- identification and a few
time-tables luckily my travelers checks
were safe as i kept them scattered with
the big ones in my hip pocket

chapter iii

a warning

when my business was attended to
in delhi i wrote that report and
mailed it and tried to guess what
to do next the hotel clerks never got
beyond the idea i was a tourist and kept
telling me to go see the tag-me-hal but
when they said it was a tomb i let em
know i was not selling hearses after
that they let me alone especially when i
reminded them they had not got back my
wallet

  of course i had looked through the
sher bagh place the next morning and of
course i did not find my stuff the hotel
people sent a man out to look too and he
found as much as i did then he asked
me if i wanted to lodge a complaint against
the hindus

  i was fairly certain that the conjurer
bird had lifted my wallet under the tree
probably expecting that i carried a fat
roll after my display of pennies the after-
noon before not having recognized
either of the natives that evening there
was not evidence enough to stir up the
police somebody had ended the evening
richer by my passport and letters that
identified me that was all

  then i remembered the tip about kash-
mir and bought a ticket for it thinking
that it might be a city with some get-up-
and-go about it being a new development

and then it became clear that id been
treated rough by the english hombre in

calcutta because kashmir turned out to
be a country several thousand years older
than india itself also a place where
there was not anything but mountains
when the people in the hotel spoke of go-
ing to the hills they meant kashmir

  but let it be here understood that it
was far from being dead in fact alec
smith automobile prospector never en-
tered into a livelier spot

  my introduction to kashmir began in
the train which was made up of those
trick english cars like ail-compartment
pullmans witth doors opening on the side
of the car and two couches along either
wall for the inmates to sleep on

  when id stripped off my coat and
shoved my bags down to the foot of the
couch and changed to a dry shirt i watched
the dust and wooden tenements of delhi
slide past and felt better

  i would strongly advise you to put the
valises at the other end remarked the
man who was on the couch opposite the
train thieves are very expert

  he was a short fellow middle aged
and he wore an old suit nothing un-
usual about him except his eyes which
were deep-set and brilliant the book he
had been reading was full of printing that
looked like shorthand-circles and curli-
ques and dots instead of letters it might
have been sanscrit or arabic or anything
else but he turned the leaves as if it was
a best seller

  letting the bags stay where they were
i told him that id made the acquaintance
of the native sons already and wanted very
much to see them again id bought a six
shooter in the delhi bazaar and meant to
use it if another hindu came after my roll

  my companions name was moorcroft
dr paul moorcroft and he seemed to be
interested in the fate of my wallet and
asked me to describe the boy and the con-
jurer and the various things that were
stolen all he said however was that it
was unusual for professional magicians to
try to rob a white man near the hotel for
it spoiled their graft

  the train thieves are quite a different
fraternity quite he assured me ive
known them to slip into the carriages
stripped to a loin cloth with their bodies
greased if you grasp them they slide
away like eels and if the train is stopped
for the guard to investigate they are off
into the jungle at once

  theyd stop for a bullet under the
ribs i pointed out and thats all
theyd get from me
short stories



  he looked at me as if i was a new spe-
cimen of carnivorous animal and turned
back to his book remarking that the na-
tive thugs were real professionals able to
lift a money belt from a sleeping passen-
ger i grinned at him and took out a lit-
tle volume of stevenson that always trav-
els with me

  after wed eaten for the last time and
the lights were touched up i slipped the
revolver from my pocket to the back of
the sofa and lay down the money being
in my hip pocket was under me with the
gun and i was not worrying about any
native turning me over without waking up

  it was about as cool in the compart-
ment as the steam room of a turkish bath
but it was better than delhi and i dozed
off while moorcroft was still turning over
the pages of his book being a light
sleeper i wakened every time the door
rattled or my companion scratched a
match

  by and by it was quieter and i was
dreaming of jumping into a well full of
snakes when something switched my mind
back to consciousness for a minute or
so i lay without opening my eyes begin-
ning to think instead of dream it seemed
as if more air was coming in than usual
although the train was barely moving

  i opened my eyes a crack and shut them
promptly moorcroft was no longer in
my range of vision but a man was stand-
ing in the center of the compartment and
this man was a native wearing two strips
of cloth one over his head and the other
around his hips his skin was shining
either from sweat or grease and he held a
very slender curved knife in his hand

  in past years sundry surgeons have re-
moved most of the bones from my nose
and part of my jaw is sterling silver where
they had to take a splice in it because of
sudden collision with some lead i can
look a gun in the eye and take a share in a
toe and heel mix-up without worrying any
but a knife sets my skin to creeping evi-
dently the native was in the compartment
to rob and meant to have something for his
trouble it would not do to let him know
i was awake and only a fool would charge
into a knife a straight-from-the-shoul-
der wallop will knock out most natives
because they never learn the why and
wherefore of a fist but you cant hit out
when youre lying on your back with your
eyes shut

  still pretending i was wrapped in slum-
ber and wondering all the time what had
happened to moorcroft i rolled over on

my right side facing the wall and snored
a couple of times to reassure the brown
devil with my back to him i was facing
the wall and had edged off the six-shooter
he could not see it

  presently i rolled on my back again
with my eyes wide open the gun in my
right hand covered the concave space un-
der his ribs he had drawn closer and
the knife was about three feet from my
ear

  it was a fifty-fifty proposition and it
looked as if both of us would bump off if
either moved a finger did i say my
hands were cold  so were my feet
then moorcroft spoke saying something
to the native that meant nothing to me
without looking away from the thiefs
eyes i was aware of the doctor sitting up
at the end of his couch with a finger mark-
ing the place in the book where hed left
off reading

  what he said in hindustani he never
explained but the native stepped back and
shoved the knife in his girdle

  put the revolver aside mr smith
my companion remarked to me it would
never do to shoot this chap you know

  then make him lie down and hold his
hands up behind his back i countered

  moorcroft gabbled something and our
visitor dropped to his knees and proceed-
ed to bump his forehead against the floor
at the englishmans feet as if moorcroft
was a tin god

  then he glided toward the door and was
half through before i managed to grab his
arm he grinned at me good-naturedly
and his bare arm slipped through my fin-
gers like a fishs fin it felt as if it had
been oiled when i reached the door and
looked out along the running board he was
gone

  the train was only crawling and a thick
mesh of forest lined the right of way like
a wall a wild pig startled by the light
and the noise plunged away crushing
down bamboo shoots and lush grass in its
path

  young man observed moorcroft
youve had your warning

  going back to my bunk i got out my
pipe lets hear it

  that pahari could have knifed yoti be-
fore or after you foolishly displayed a
weapon

  was he a thief

  most men are moorcrofts yellow
face seemed to grow sharper as he looked
at me we anglo-saxons pride our-
selves on our respectability and yet for
the camp of the snake



generations weve been rambling around
the world breaking open graves and cart-
ing away shrines out of asia to sell or set
up in some dismal museum in london or
chicago yes that pahari is a thief and
the son of a thug i once patched up his
sire after a tiger
clawed his ribs
loose and the hill
people never forget
a service

 his big eyes
glowed queerly and
his lips sneered i
was in pekin when
the allies broke in
to loot after the boxer show and i saw
cossacks and british marines ripping down
ancestral tablets of gold tablets that the
chinese believe are the incarnate spirits
of their ancestors yet in london or new
york if a man robs a grave we call him a
ghoul

  you win doctor i told him but i
didnt swallow all the dose he gave me
who would  the whole thing looked
queer-the pahari bird coming into the
compartment like that and then going
through a daily dozen head-bobbing and
it turned out later that my hunch was a
good one is there any more to the les-
son 

  moorcroft began to talk like a profes-
sor i wished later i had paid more at-
tention to what he said

  the main point of it was that he was
warning me not to meddle with anything
that turned up under my nose in india
when they wanted to the hindus could
arm themselves with weapons that left
white men no chance at all moorcroft
named over poisons that could kill a man
daily for a couple of years and stimulants
like bhang and hasheesh that could make a
native give one whoop and run out and
slaughter any europeans who happened
along and feel blissful doing it

  must have some kick that drink i
told him

  he went on to say magic the real vari-
ety was practiced by hindus and such-
like

  ive seen their snake charmers and
mango growers i agreed and our
vaudeville artists put it all over them
you cant tell me there are any real magi-
cians

  those shining eyes of his fastened on
me and he smiled hed seen a conjurer
throw one end of a rope up into the air
and the rope stay upright and a boy

climb up the rope and vanish and a tiger
come down by and by said it was a
stunt they didnt do now except for visit-
ing kings and a few others

  i think it is accomplished by group
hypnotism he added the hindus are
adept at mesmerizing the spectators we
do not realize what they are up to and
they never explain we have never at-
tempted to measure their powers because
we have been too busy making money

  i thought of the mango shrub and
sniffed the warm odor of the forest was
sweeping through the train like an in-
cense and the prickly heat was startitng up
all over me

  another thing mr smith i have seen
buddhist priests thrust knives into their
bodies utterly without feeling the pain
and once a wandering lama stopped at my
tent who could communicate his thoughts
to kinsmen a thousand miles away to
the white men who dwell within her north-
ern borders india is a riddle ages old
the fascination of this- he swept a thin
hand around at the carriage windows-
gets under our skin in time some of us
learn a very few of the mysteries and try
to forget what we know

  moorcroft leaned forward to touch my
knee and i felt like pulling away from
him

  mr smith he said god help the
white man who yields to the lure of the
mysteries he becomes a slave more dan-
gerous than a drug maddened malay
what about that warning i re-
minded him where do i figure in this
someone wanted your papers and took
them mr smith when you did not take
the hint to go away this native was sent
either to rob you of your money or to kill
you if i were you i would return at
once to calcutta and book a passage for
home

  now there was no reason why anybody
should wish a war on me certainly the
prospects of american autos invading
india was a lost hope and why should a
trade competitor want to bump me off
anyway  i laughed and got out my flask
offering it to moorcroft

  you cant sell me any line about ma-
gic doctor i grinned and these
mysteries died in the middle ages but
you certainly help to pass the time im
going to see kashmir

  he refused a drink and went back to his
book paying no more attention to me at
all


short stories

chapter iv

an inn without a keeper

a day or so later we got out at a
junction where there was a real
breeze and rocks and trees that
looked natural a narrow gauge railway
took me up to a kind of pleasure resort
which i passed by wishing to see more of
the country it was all mountains each
range higher than the last and a fellow
traveler told me there was a station a few
days ride up and in so i took one bag and
hopped into a mail cart with two ponies
and two wheels and a bearded pirate to
drive it

  lord how that man did drive we
left the post road and climbed for two days
up into trails that hung on the sides of
hills we skidded around corners with
my overcoat flapping over a sheer preci-
pice and across log bridges that swayed
up and down close above a river that
looked like the rapids of the st lawrence
the smell of the pines was mighty good
after the mixtures of delhi i saw a peak
covered with snow ahead of us and also a
mass of black rushing cloud to windward
the leaves on the birches turned white
side up and the sunlight became sickly
judging by the drivers curses a thunder-
storm was no joke in this country

  just then we rounded a turn and nearly
bumped an auto stalled in the trail the
native driver reined his steeds up the bank
a bit and maneuvered past but i signaled
for him to stop

  the car was one of those english mod-
els light with a long wheel base and plenty
of power one man a tall chap with a
brown likeable face and a dinky mustache
was testing out the ignition system and
wasting no time about it the young chap
beside him hailed me

  hullo smith did you have any money
on sir havelock he came in nicely you
must admit

  it was arnold carnie and his sister was
in the rear seat the other fellow went
by the name of dixon-evidently the cap-
tain dixon i had heard them speak of in
delhi-and carnie assured me cheerfully
that if they did not get the bus working
before the storm broke they would be in a
fine jam because the trail would be mud
and the bridges would be slippery elm

  after watching dixon working a while
i thought the ignition was o k carnie
said theyd tested out the gas line and that
was all right i didnt feel like leaving
miss carnie parked in the mud on the

edge of a half mile drop into the river and
asked if they minded my tinkering with
the carburetor

  it was a brand id never seen before but
they all work on the same principle i
found it was a mess of dirt and cleaned it
out and got the float to functioning again
this done the motor sputtered a bit when
we cranked her up and finally began to
purr in a business-like way

  come along smithy carnie urged
we might break down again you know

  i asked if they were going to the chitral
station

  either that or the river as the case
may be

  the prospect of a real ride was tempt-
ing and i yanked my bag from the cart
and climbed in as dixon who took the
wheel slipped in his clutch and started
with a jerk that nearly landed me in the
girls lap the wind whined in the khaki
top and our dust swept out over the gorge
in a great plume the sun had quit alto-
gether and dixon switched on his lights
and trod on the gas until we were making
more than thirty along that trail built for
mules and carts he seemed to know the
road and took the turns at a rate that sent
loose stones rattling over the great divide

  as thunderstorms sometimes do this one
held off for several miles then the far-

off trees began
to thresh and a
red glare shone
out along the
crests across the
valley thunder
went off right
overhead and
when the first
flash came it
glittered on a
million rain-
drops

 dixon eased
the car up close to an overhanging rock
that protected us from the full force of the
storm we wrapped the girl up in blan-
kets and listened to rocks bouncing down
the hillside and caroming over our heads
now and then a tree cracked and i heard
one fall not far behind us

  the storm was beyond us in a few min-
utes  the sun darted into rolling mist that
looked like clouds and glowed red from
the light behind it the rumble of the
river came up stronger than ever as we
went on

  again dixon drove as if he never want-
ed to reach the hotel alive ive been at
the camp of the snake



the wheel in one or two transcontinental
sprints and i know that mountain driving
isnt as bad as it looks when the road bed
is dry but we were skidding up to
bridges and slithering down drops that
might have ended in a washout

  miss carnie gasped once or twice and
even the youthful arnold called a halt
when the trail forked

  well never make the climb to the sta-
tion larry he gave out not in this
mud you confounded jehu so be a
good chap and edge off to the lumber
camp somebodys there im sure and
gordon can dry out at least

  dixon looked at him as if he was going
to object then thought better of it and
swung into the right fork into a forest of
big pines and i took my feet off the floor-
boards where theyd been clamped for an
hour about twilight we came out of a
winding trail to the edge of the gorge
again and a cluster of tents

  it was really one tent with a scattering
of huts but the tent was more like a pa-
vilion some native servants came from
the shacks and helped us carry in our
bags captain dixon ran the car under
some of the thickest foliage-the whole
place was a grove of big pines visible in
the glare of the headlights-and i heard
him swearing at the natives because they
didnt rig a tarpaulin over it properly

  there were lamps going in the big tent
the thing was divided up into rooms and
passageways like a bungalow oriental
rugs covered every inch of the floorboards
and the lamps were queer affairs with a
big chinese lantern painted like a dragon
hung from the silk top of each of the two
main compartments

  one of these looked like a reception
hall with a kerosene stove with a few bear-
skins and leather cushions slung around
i only saw one chair in the tent in the next
room which must have been the owners
study this had a teakwood table some
bookshelves and other shelves stacked
with bundles of clippings and papers the
chair by the table was black hardwood
carved all over with gilt patterns and it
looked as if it might have been a throne
some time or other

  across the passageway were three sleep-
ing compartments in a row every one with
a cot and rug and washstand i looked
into the fourth compartment at the back
of the passage on the side away from the
entrance and found that it was full of
stores foodstuffs kerosene blankets
medicines and so forth

  the doors except the front entrance
were just openings in the partitions cur-
tained off i went out and examined it to
find out why the heat kept in so well
the tent had double sides and top a big
tarp was stretched on a frame of eight
inch bamboo and the guys were inch ma-
nila rope anchored around logs that were
sunk in the ground besides the dense
growth of pines protected it from the
worst of the wind that i could hear moan-
ing way up over my head

  arnold carnie called me dinner is
on the rug smithy our host is absent
so weve conscripted his house boys and
some excellent port

  as he said the natives were serving a
hot meal of rice and mutton with those
chupatty cakes in the reception room and
we all squatted down on the animal skins
to eat dixon didnt trouble to ask per-
mission to make ourselves at home be-
cause hospitality in these places is a mat-
ter of course and we were only taking
things for granted

  in the lamp light dixon looked more
than a little tired he had a lined face
yellow brown like many englishmen who
spend their lives in that steam sunbath of
a place he said practically nothing
though he was attentive to gordon carnie
and i suspected they were engaged

  dixon and miss carnie paid little heed
to me though they were polite enough
but arnold was the kind that makes every-
body his friend-or enemy he explained
that the owner was away on a hike or
hunt and the tent was really a native af-
fair the kind used by indian dukes or dig-
nitaries when they traveled a bit

  two things struck me as queer there
werent any chairs except the one curio
and i had not seen any guns stacked in
the den the man had skins enough to
mark him for a hunter and that sort usu-
ally keeps a small arsenal on hand but
i had an idea that i knew the name of the
tent dweller on the den table i noticed
a black book that was either the one moor-
croft had been reading on the train or its
twin and i was not over pleased at
stumbling on dr paul moorcroft again

chapter v

the chimney

it did not seem as if id been asleep
at all when someone waked me up by
flashing an electric torch in my eyes
i chucked off my blankets and sat up and


short stories



arnold carnie whispered to me not to
make so much noise

  we had bunked in the storeroom us-
ing some of the extra blankets and i saw
by my watch that it was four a m ar-
nold cut off my questions by saying that
one of his bearers had come up with a
couple of rifles having walked from the
place where the luggage cart had parked
for the night at the fork in the trail the
carnies heavy stuff had been sent after
them by native cart

  thats fair enough i told him sit-
ting on my fingers to warm them but why
turn out the guard

  barasang smithy he grinned this
is the hour when all good hunters arise and
curse remember i promised to take you
with me on shikar

  that godless youth meant what he said
and i crawled into pants and shoes pulling
on a sheepskin jacket that he requisitioned
from somewhere then we had a swallow
of rum and a biscuit apiece and went out
to where a couple of natives stood shiver-
ing we managed to slip by without wak-
ing the others dixon was breathing away
in his compartment next to us and miss
carnie evidently had the place reserved
for guests in the front of the tent moor-
crofts sleeping compartment was still dark
and soundless

  arnold flashed his torch over the rifles
and offered me my choice in a whisper i
selected the enfield and left him the 
mannlicher that the other bearer carried
the natives shouldered the rifles and one
went ahead to act as guide later i was
sorry that we had thrown the spotlight on
the guns like that

  the wind bit like a knife and my thighs
ached below the sheepskin before wed
gone a mile i was puffing although carnie
and the hunters pushed ahead without a
stumble or a halt ive done a bit of
shooting in my time and if i do say so
can manage to hit what im aiming at
now and then though perhaps my style is
somewhat my own some guys can figure
up range by their sights and a piece of
paper and a lightning calculation as to the
size of trees and houses at a certain dis-
tance not me i guess the range and
watch where the first shot lands i al-
ways let the other fellows worry and test
the wind and change their slings a few
times before the firing begins after that
im at home

  maybe this will explain why i didnt
guess all that was due to happen around
the camp before it did you cant tell me

that any hombre ever knew anything was
going to occur by putting two and two to-
gether outside of the mob of sherlock
holmess in books

  we hiked for about an hour when we
reached a high plateau and halted in a nest
of boulders that we could see in the half
light that comes before the dawn arnold
told me to watch the mists clear away from
the line of trees about two hundred yards

distant between the trees and our rocks
was a level clearing and he explained that
deer were apt to feed along the edge of
the brush at sunrise i knew that at this
hour game is easiest to stalk by now the
peaks on our right were standing out black
against a long glow of green and scarlet
the wind developed a new kick and the
white mist began to thin

  then trees began to take shape and look-
natural we stepped back deeper into
the shadow of the rocks and one oi the
natives pushed the enfield into my hand
i had seen nothing stirring around the
trees but he pointed down into a depres-
sion

  several doe were getting up grazing
toward the brush and a big buck was just
entering the shadows where we were sure
to lose sight of him i sighted and whis-
pered to arnold to shoot first his gun
cracked almost as i spoke and the deer
stood absolutely still for a second every
head up

  i pressed the trigger and the enfield
kicked back the buck had been stung by
one of our shots-my fingers were chilled
and i think i pulled down missing him
entirely the last shreds of mist hid him
as he started off along the line of the trees
when he was nearly opposite us i took a
chance and fired again this time he gave
a long bound and went down in a heap

  shabash well done smithy cried
arnold

  the two natives hustled over and met us
half way across the clearing grinning and
staring at me admiringly carnie forgot
his own disappointment as he measured
the spread of the horns with a tape and
the camp of the snake



counted the points and complimented me
generously

  never saw it done before smithy old
boy on my word two hundred and
twelve yards-i paced it-a running deer
and a poor light hullo heres where i
creased his flank

  which is more than i did with one
shot i assured him

  we left the hunters to remove the head
and strip off the best of the meat while we
walked back with the rifles the sun was
just coming up over the snow peaks the
big gorge along which we headed was
still a shadowy pit with the whole world
overhead flaming purple and red and a
deep blue-green i cant begin to tell what
it looked like youll have to go to the
himalayas and watch the sun rise to
know the air was like old wine and al-
most as heady i was walking along try-
ing to see and smell everything at once
when arnold shouted at me hold up
smithy steady my lad and watch
where you are going to put your feet

  half expecting to see a snake on the
ground i stopped short and looked down
and the part of me under the ribs began to
burn and send fiery waves up under my
skull there was nothing in front of me
at all

  a sort of chasm ran back here from the
edge of the cliff a gash in the rock where
a few stunted cedars clung hiding the
drop in between the cedars i could see
ait almost sheer drop of several hundred
feet and far down under the cliff the
valley bed and the shine of the river a mile
below the gash was not more than
twenty feet across and it ran back from
the face of the cliff only a stones throw
but two steps more would have sent me
caroming down the chute

  this is where poor cobden died ar-
nold explained as i circled back he
was dixons manager you know he was
at work here with the tree cutters a few
weeks ago just beginning the day after
sunrise larry says he must have been
full to the scuppers because the natives
heard him shout then they saw him run
a few steps and crash down through those
cedars he glanced down thoughtfully

  it struck me as i listened to arnold
that a man would need to be pretty well
tanked up to run down into the chimney
as he called the hole if this englishman
cobden had been the boss of a gang of
lumberjacks he must have known the
country around here pretty well anyone
who looked down the chimney once would

not be likely to forget it was there in
fact a semi-circle of pine stumps as high
as a mans head stood around it and all
along here at the edge of the main gorge
the biggest pines had been cut further
on we saw men at work hindu coolies
hacking away at a great pair of monnda
pines a dozen feet through at the base i
asked arnold how the timber was sent to
the sawmills

  floated smithy he answered lightly
the trunks are rolled or hauled by yaks
to the edge of the gorge then they are
dumped over and floated down into india
on the river

  captain lawrence dixon he explained
was part owner of this forest concession
he and a couple of others had bought out
the ancestral rights of some little native
rajah who needed ready cash

  the english government had put a stop
to wholesale timber cutting in the hima-
layas a generation ago but had allowed
the native rulers the privilege of limited
cutting the preservation of the big trees
as in california and elsewhere at home
was important to preserve the water sup-
ply of heat ridden india the chief who
had sold out to dixon and his partners was
more interested in building up a racing
stable in delhi and in buying phonographs
and radios than in keeping his forests safe
for autocracy

  anyway dixon had come up to look
over the work which had been delayed
after the death of cobden his manager
the tribe that had sold the big trees to
him-arnold called them chitralis-were
objecting to his felling a group of the
deodars which were valuable the rajah
of the chitralis claimed that this particu-
lar grove sheltered the grave of his gone-
and-forgotten ancestors he had forgotten
the grove when the contract was drawn up
and signed the trees belonged to dixon
and his partners but with the chitralis
acting ugly the hindus who were working
for dixon had kept their distance from
the grove that had caused the dispute

  those infernal hindus are like sheep
arnold told me with a white man to
tell them what to do theyll go ahead and
tear down somebodys castle thats why
the work has been held up a crazy white
man warned them to refrain from tres-
passing in the sacred grove

  he pointed ahead to our camp in a nest
of the big pines that loomed up at the end
of the cleared tract it stood on a knoll
and we could see the gray canvas of the
tent you see smithy arnold grinned
short stories

weve wandered into the marquee of the
chap whos taken a stand against larry
and his honest toilers thats his tent
and he i remarked is dr moor-
croft

  i dont know the blighters name
larry keeps his mouth damnably well shut
about his affairs hullo there he is with
that babu

  dixon and a big hindu who wore euro-
pean clothes and a turban were walking
along the edge of the gorge toward us he
asked where we had been and arnold told
him about the stag the babu it seemed
was a kind of clerk and overseer and had
been in charge of the lumber camp after
cobden went west his name was anim
dass and he greeted us as if arnold was
the prince of wales and i was an ace of
big game hunters

  oh sahib he grinned oh my
friends you must infallible go out to make
havoc among bears if this night is clear
anim dass had learned his english from
textbooks and the way he slung around
big words was a caution so were his
clothes arnold told me later that he had
got together a french navy captains dress
jacket and the pants of a pre-war russian
ensign when arnold questioned him the
babu explained that several bears were in
the habit of coming down from the higher
ground to root around in the clearings and
the moon was good enough to shoot by

  thats a lark cried the youngster
want to come with us anim dass
impossible quite sahib my bones
not being adapted to this extremely cold
climate

  i wondered if the babu was not a little
cautious about venturing out where the
chitralis might find him and i asked car-
nie if he thought it was all right to leave
his sister in the camp when the natives
were acting ugly

  my dear chap he laughed shes
safer here than in calcutta or new york
for that matter these chitralis wouldnt
think of scragging a feringhi

  he meant a white man but remem-
bering dr moorcroft and the train thief
i wondered if arnold was right and the
doctor wrong or the other way around

  a fter breakfast-and it was a meal
fit for the gods superintended by
j gordon carnie under one of the
giant deodars-the luggage of dixons
party came up and arnold set to work
bossing the natives who were pitching the
three tents near the big pavilion i hung

around hoping that gordon carnie might
want to try her hand at deer shooting but
she went off to join dixon and i strolled
into the grove to inspect it

  the trees covered more ground than i
thought running back from the tents to a
small round clearing where there was a
kind of hillock on the top of this loose
stones had been piled it looked as if the
ground had been cleared a long time ago
because vines and briers overgrew the
boulders

  i did not go near it because it had all the
signs of a snake colony and just then dr

paul moorcroft was standing with his back
to me looking at it about a dozen
strange natives were squatting at his heels
they were slender men with thin faces
and all wore a kind of peaked woolen cap
instead of turbans and carried knives and
short curved swords in their belts i sus-
pected these were the chitralis arnold had
been talking about and it turned out i was
right

  the doctor might have been praying to
the stone heap with the gang for a con-
gregation i stayed where i was behind
some shrubs until another peaked cap
came running up and moorcroft gabbled
with the natives for a moment they
were frowning and fingering their knives
and when moorcroft turned away they
scattered among the trees they were out
of sight in a second and i kept an eye on
the bushes heading after the doctor he
went too fast for me to catch up before he
left the big trees and struck out into the
open

  dixon and a half dozen hindus were
forming around the furthest of the deo-
dars at the edge of the grove by the brink
of the gorge as moorcroft came up
four axes began to ring on the trunk

  captain dixon  captain dixon the
doctor waved his arms and shouted this
will never do

  coming to the tree he said something
sharply to the natives and they lowered
their axes looking at the captain dixon
glanced at me then at moorcroft and
raised one eyebrow
the camp of the snake



  the deodars are not to be touched
moorcroft panted great scott man
havent you wood enough without cutting
into the grove over the chitral tomb
miss carnie seemed surprised by the
mans objection and moorcrofts nervous
face was whitish his dark eyes blazing

  i have been over the grove pretty thor-
oughly sir replied dixon in his quiet
way and i have failed to discover any
sign of a tomb where is it and what
is it

  moorcroft grew red and stopped a sec-
ond to think

  the point is captain dixon by cutting
these trees you are enraging the chitrali
tribesmen and laying up trouble for the
government	

  i noticed that he avoided the matter of
the tomb but dixon brought him back to
it quickly enough if the grave is emp-
ty dixon began i fail to see-

  it is not empty cried the doctor

there is a body in it and-

  and what 

  and the natives have a long standing
veneration for this grove the name deo-
dar is derived from the sanscrit devadar
which signifies a god or the place of a
deity hundreds of years ago this site
was selected for the tomb of one of the
chitrali kings the present rajah as-
sumed that it would not be molested when
he sold his timber rights

  dixon had been studying the owner of
the tent and now he smiled as if he had
made up his mind

  i think we are indebted to you moor-
croft for your absentee hospitality last
night he said please accept our
thanks as to the tomb you are talking
quite over my head you know we are
not molesting any grave cutting the
trees will not disturb anything under the
earth the land is the rajahs the timber
is mine

  he ordered the staring hindus to carry
on with the chopping and the axes began
to ring again i started to take him aside
to explain that moorcroft was slightly
cracked on the subject of graves when
gordon carnie spoke up

  isnt dr moorcroft really in the right
lawrence she asked her brown eyes
thoughtful its such a pity to do away
with these beauties

  dixon wasnt the kind of man that can
be wheedled by a woman and he shook his
head

  no can do gordon these deodars
represent a hundred thousand square feet

of excellent pine needed in india also
several hundred pounds which my associ-
ates have paid to this rajah i cant let
my partners down you know

  she seemed to realize the truth of this
and sighed then moorcroft made a mis-
take i think if miss carnie had been let
alone she might have argued dixon into
something because she seemed set on leav-
ing the deodars as they were

  man cried the doctor harshly cant
you see the danger  doesnt cobdens
death mean anything to you will you
go on after that he died the morning
his men started work on the grove

  for half a minute dixon stood per-
fectly still as if following out a new line
of thought his eyes narrowed and his
brown face became drawn and i saw that
underneath his quiet manner he had a
temper to be reckoned with

  then cobdens fall was not an acci-
dent dr moorcroft kindly explain
how can i explain if you cannot un-
derstand  he turned to the girl miss
carnie please believe that i am earnest
in my warning i advise you to move
your camp away from the grove and-to
return to simla at once

  but why dr moorcroft she asked
frankly

  he pointed up at the trees

  this place was selected for the grave
of one of the chitrali rulers three hundred
years ago for a reason perhaps you will
understand me when i say that there are
forces guarding it from intrusion these
forces are invisible but their power is
very great

  snakes i asked and he laughed

  my dear smith would a snake drive a
sane and courageous white man over a
thousand foot cliif i refer to cobden
but he was drunk i pointed out

  he was not i saw him go past the
grove just before sunrise with his men
cobden was not a drinking man and he
was perfectly sober yet half an hour later

he acted as if- moorcroft hesitated

a delirious patient would stagger and
shout like that he seemed to be blind
his mentality must have been abnormal at
that moment because he had been sub-
jected to an overpowering stimulant
what was that dixon asked shortly
fear

  we looked at each other and there were
shadows under the captains eyes pres-
ently he smiled

  moorcroft you cant expect to frighten
me into leaving jthe valley you are the


short stories

rajahs friend i understand hes helped
you with your research work i dont
know how much hes offered you to make
us leave this valuable timber uncut if
youll show me this mazar this grave or
holy place ill order my men to take care
not to injure it

the doctor shook his head and muttered
something under his breath in hindustani
and i saw dixon look down at him sharply

then as he turned away moorcroft
stretched out both hands toward the girl
helplessly

miss carnie he appealed i am try-
ing to help you i know the secret of this
place and i beg you for the last time to
leave the valley with your brother

but why she held back a laugh

and what is this  secret 

then he said a strange thing it would
do no good to tell you

by now i was pretty sure that moor-
croft was warped in the upper works and
this was not pleasant to think about with
him parked across the clearing from our
tents

chapter vi

what gordon carnie saw

after a little while it occurred to me
that anim dass must know some-
l thing about the death of cobden

in a curious way the account moorcroft
gave of the mans end fitted in with my
doubts when i had studied the chimney

i found the overseer walking alone in the
grove which was a little surprising at
that hour of the day

a quarter of an hour later i had him
sized up as a chap who could tell as many

lies to the minute as i could think of 

questions he had not seen cobden fall he soon recovered when nothing more
he swore but some of his men had and happened and we rambled over to the spot
they said the fcringhi-the white man- and watched the coolies lop off the branch-
had seen a ghost anim dass being edu- es which were small compared to the

cated scoffed at great bole then they cut off the top
the idea of spir- and cleared a place near the butt where
its and was cer- anim dass painted the mark of the dixon
tain that cobden company

had stumbled at as soon as this was done the trunk was
the edge of the worked to the edge of the steep slope with
declivity leading skids and tackle and shoved off it
into the chimney crashed down crushing the undergrowth
and had lost his and boomed off a ledge of rock by the time
head	it reached the valley bed it looked the size

   did cobden of a match and it was split in two parts
sahib find the shrine in this wood  i i saw that anim dass was staring at it
asked the babu suddenly having a theory and the coolies muttered a lot a high
of my own i wanted to test	wind came up of a sudden and i turned

  indeed not sahib responded anim back to the wood where it was warmer

 dass promptly he found no sign of it

   i might have believed the fellow if he
 had said he did not know how could he
 be certain if cobden had located it or not

   i have heard this grave has gold or-
 jewels in it i remarked casually having
 heard no such thing anim dass looked
 incredulous too incredulous to satisfy me

   quite impossible he cried or his
 highness the rajah babur el-sulaiman of
 chitral would have removed the stones
 and dug them up and anim dass
 shrugged his plump shoulders looking
 sleekly indifferent to the whole thing he
 was too clever for me to get anything out
 of and a bit too clever to be honest i
 thought he knew where the grave or shrine
 was also that it was placed under some
 stones maybe statues or tombstones but
 i wouldnt have trusted the babu with a
 pocketfid of german marks

   my theory was not a pleasant one but
 it stuck like the latest tin pan alley jazz
 moorcroft having a mania against white
 men who intruded on native no-trespassing
 ground had managed to dump cobden
 down the chimney anim dass knew what
 had happened pretty well but was keep-
 ing his mouth shut and was probably be-
 ing paid to do it the fact that there were
 several versions of how cobden had died
 proved that someone was lying

   just as i had reasoned thus far the big
 deodar the men were working on swayed
 and began to roar down to the ground i
 saw anim dass turn and look and his skin
 grew several shades lighter when the tree
 thudded on earth he licked his lips and
 his brown eyes flickered all around like
 a snake when a stick is poked at it if
 ever a man was scared anim dass was
the camp of the snake	

and where i hoped to find signs of arnold
or the tomb that was making all this trou-
ble neither one was to be seen ive a
pretty good pair of eyes and i quartered
all the area under the deodars and even
pushed into the thickets without uncover-
ing any headstone or marker it was get-
ting dark by then and i struck back to the
camp and found arnold carnie sitting by
an open fire polishing the stock of his pet
rifle he had been asleep most of the day

  that wind was still sweeping over us
and i could feel the tree tops weaving in
and out though down by the fire the air
was hardly stirring somehow or other
i kept looking up as if i could see some-
thing up there because i was restless
perhaps it struck me all of a sudden that
there was something over our heads that
was coming along with the wind

  this restlessness must have been on ac-
count of the heights all around us also be-
cause of the elevation of the grove itself
six or eight thousand feet above sea level
always affects a man a bit the blood
doesnt run normally

  anyway i had a hunch that the carnies
ought not to be in that camp when i
told arnold that i did not feel easy about
moorcroft he laughed

  rot smithy the doctor is one of the
learned heads of india his book on the
customs and legends and-and so forth
of the hill tribes is classic hes as sane
as you are

  he wiped the oil off the rear sight and
glanced across the clearing at the huts of
moorcrofts followers

  the chitralis may turn ugly count of
this sacred wood if so youll see some-
thing worth while my lad-larry dixon
stirred up he could handle the whole
tribe and the rajah thrown in but if
youre seeing ghosts- ill ask gordon to
come with us tonight shes game for
bears and moonlight

  a bout an hour after the moon had
l climbed over the peaks we set out
jl jl again miss carnie with us cap-
tain dixon stayed behind to go over ac-
counts with anim dass and moorcrofts
tent was dark when we passed it it grew
colder as we worked up the edge of the
gorge moving slowly after the two natives
who did not seem as keen about bears as
they were about deer

  in fact there was nothing stirring along
the gorge miss carnie had kept quiet
like a good hunter for an hour or so un-
til we came out on a knoll and the two

natives joined us then she chuckled and
asked arnold where his black bears were
her brother ordered the men on but they
insisted they were too chilled to go up the
gorge any further and i noticed that they
were shivering

   why its not cold whispered gordon
 carnie now that the wind has gone
 down

   i hadnt noticed until then that the gale
 had stopped because the underbrush was
 still swaying and rustling around the hil-
 lock but the girl was right no air was
 stirring the steep slope of the gorge lay
 just behind us and the tops of the cedars
 that lined the silver of the river were ab-
 solutely still i remember this because i
 wondered what was moving the bushes

  here comes one arnold whispered
to me eagerly your first shot smithy
he raised the muzzle of his rifle and 
knocked it down with my left arm the
thing advancing toward us through the
high grass and bushes was on two legs and
when it came out into clear moonlight we
recognized anim dass the babu was
half running half staggering and he was
panting as if hed come a long way with
the throttle wide open

  great scott cried arnold softly
look at his face

   i had been watching the swaying bush-
es figuring that a bear or something simi-
lar was at his heels when i looked at his
face i thought the moonlight was playing
tricks with my eyes it does sometimes
anim dass was as white as the girl beside
me and his mouth was twisted into a
kind of fixed crooked grin

  stop man i shouted back up-
sit down look ahead of you

   he was running toward the slope that
led down into the chimney where cobden
had fallen to his death our knoll over-
looked the chasm about a hundred yards
away anim dass stumbled to his knees
got up atfd plunged forward jerkily

   arnold shouted and began to run down
toward the edge of the drop either the
babu did not hear us or he was too fright-
ened to understand what we said noth-
ing came out of the bushes after him and
he would have been perfectly safe if he
stayed where he was

   he stumbled and trotted forward as if
he was being pulled by something we could
not see men caught out in the open in a
hurricane might have rolled along like
that carnie took a desperate chance in
skirting the edge of the drop to reach him
he was stretching out his hand to grip the


short stories

man when anim dass with that fixed
silly grin  on his face leaped for-
ward and down
the chasm

  loose stones
poured down
with him and a
piece of rock
crashed loose
it seemed like
a whole minute
 later that i saw
the last of the
b ab u whirling
down the face
of the cliff half
a mile below

we went back to the camp in the
grove and found it dark after
lighting the stove and a small lan-
tern in the girls tent she asked us to find
larry dixon and tell him what had hap-
pened gordon was a little shaken by the
fall of the overseer still she did not make
a wild fuss the way some women do when
anything unpleasant has happened

  we found the captain on his cot in his
tent which was at the other end of the line
from gordons arnold and i shared one
of the middle pair and the other served as
a combined dining and store shelter

  dixon was there all right but completely
useless

  whew arnold sniffed several times
never knew larry drank-like that

   i flashed the electric torch in his face and
shook him until he opened his eyes they
were sunk in the sockets and kind of
glazed and he went right back into a heavy
sleep breathing like a man under ether
the whole tent reeked of whisky and of
something else that i couldnt place car-
nie noticed it too and told me it was no
use trying to rouse dixon for a while

  i dont know if its opium or hasheesh
smoke that smells like that smithy he
whispered someone put larry out of
commission

  it was hard to say whether the captain
had been soaking up whisky or whether a
liberal quantity of it had been poured
around his cot we looked at each other
and i saw that arnold was worried for the
first time up to now we youngsters had
let dixon do the worrying and now that
we had to act for ourselves we realized how
much we had depended on him

  he wont sleep it off before morning
carnie i pointed out the first thing
is to put your sister to bed without letting

her know how he is laid up second is
to keep a watch at her tent until daylight
arnold lied like a gentleman and told
the girl dixon had started to walk to chit-
ral some six miles away and would not be
back until noon said hed left a note
with his servant

  gordon looked at me quickly with a
womans instinct for getting at the truth
her fine eyes were dark with anxiety and
i knew she must care a whole lot about
dixon

  is larry-hurt mr smith

  i started to say that he was hale and
well and checked myself just in time
anim dass had taught me a lesson or two
in lying and i remembered that i couldnt
very well be supposed to know how a man
was six miles away

  if you want miss carnie i offered
ill hike over to chitral and find out he
cant be with us until after breakfast

  she shook her head and thought for a
moment captain dixon ought to know
about the-the accident poor anim dass
arnold you must call his servant and send
the boy with a message to chitral

  this would have been the logical thing
to do if dixon had been in the native town
instead of slumbering off a sweet mixture
of dope and booze in his tent if we told
the girl the truth shed have thought we
were making up another story and any-
way shed want to go to dixon and con-
vince herself he was not in need of nurs-
ing

  we were all a bit shaken by watching
that babu take a flying leap over the cliff
but it took more than that to put arnold
down for the count he pushed his sister
into the open flap of the tent and ex-
plained that dixon had found something
wrong with the accounts of anim dass
that evening and had gone off at once to
chitral to check up with the rajah he
said hed find dixons servant and send
him off with the message

  it was a good half hour before he came
back and remarked with a perfectly
straight face that the boy had gone
meanwhile id been explaining to miss
carnie how anim dass must have been
disturbed by the discrepancy in his ac-
counts and had come out to look for us and
had been frightened when he found him-
self at the edge of the chimney and had
stumbled over the edge in the bad light

  she smiled at me without saying any-
thing and busied herself brewing some tea
and toasting some of the biscuits they call
scones over the stove arnold and i ate
the camp of the snake



up all she had and said good night betak-
ing ourselves to the embers of the camp
fire which we stirred up to a good blaze
here we could keep an eye on all the tents
and moorcrofts portable house i was
hoping the doctor would show up because
i wanted- to ask him a few questions but
he failed to appear

  id hate to hold a good poker hand
against you carnie i told him when my
pipe was going good your face is too
good a bluff id have sworn you were
telling the truth about that boy

  he borrowed my tobacco pouch and
filled his briar

  i was smithy the boy is gone so
are the bearers and all the other servants
after puffing until the pipe was going to
his satisfaction he smiled also moor-
crofts men have departed this place
also dixons hindus have folded their
tents and silently passed away and the
curious- thing is that nothing seems to be
stolen

  i thought this over for a while looking
from the dark bulk of the doctors tent-
house to the shrouded auto and the line
of empty shacks in the shadows under the
trees that evening when we left to go
after bears about thirty natives had been
quartered in the grove now when i
checked up arnold and myself were the
only souls awake and able bodied and
alive

  then this camp isnt what you might
call thickly populated i remarked
where did your men go

  havent the faintest idea old chap
  why did they leave

  ask the hindu gods-they ought to
know why two score dependable natives
forsook a months pay and a magnificent
chance to loot he bent forward to toss
some more wood on the fire frighten
these punjabi budmashes of mine a little
and they just naturally steal whatever
they can lay hand on afterward they
confess and are forgiven and the stolen
articles charged up to their pay
meaning

  they must have been more than a lit-
tle scared smithy hullo whatever be-
came of our two shikars

  when we came to consider it neither
of us had seen the hunters after anim
dass jumped down the chimney arnold
had an explanation that fitted in pretty
well with my theory during our absence
the hillmen from chitral had visited the
fiamp to stage a demonstration in j-evenge
cio

for the felling of a tree in the sacred
grove they must have put our men to
flight because dixon had been dead to the

world at the
time in fact the
chitrali crowd
might have
drugged him to
keep him out of
the way

 which
brings us to
anim dass
concluded car-
nie any ideas
about that poor
blighter
smithy

  i had several moorcroft sane or in-
sane was trying his best to frighten us
into leaving the grove for what reason
i didnt know but that would keep he
was working with the chitrali gang the
fact that he had been talking with them
that morning proved he was in communi-
cation with them the doctor had man-
aged to scare anim dass stiff and the
babu after finding dixon laid neatly to
sleep had run after us

  good smithy nodded carnie but
how did he come to run off the khud

  i didnt say anything because guessing
isnt my long suit i had seen a healthy
man walk into a chasm that he knew was
there outside of suicide what explana-
tion was there and it was a cinch that
cobden and anim dass had not decided
to commit suicide at the same spot within
a couple of weeks

  he acted as if he was drunk smithy
maybe but i dont think he was i
grunted remembering that they had said
that about cobden too

  the wind might have made him lose
his balance on the slope

  might have there was no wind
but confound it smithy the under-
growth was rustling all around
something was in it

  that left us about where we started
neither of us had seen anything moving
except anim dass and i wasnt worry-
ing about what we hadnt seen arnold
was he had a quick brain better than
mine and he was as keen on this mystery
as he had been for getting a deer the night
before

  after a long while he spoke up
smithy only two explanations can pos-
sibly- fit either the babu was so badly
frightened he couldnt see what was in
short stories



front of him or he thought that the cliff
was level ground

chapter vii

a last warning

next morning captain lawrence
dixon appeared long before we
expected him in a natty gray
tweed suit and shaved immaculately his
skin looked sallow and the pupils of his
eyes were dark after listening to all we
had to say he nodded thanked us very
civilly and asked which of us in the ab-
sence of the native cooks was inclined to
prepare breakfast

  youre a cool hand larry cried ar-
nold what do you think of this mess
and what are you going to do about it

  i never think before breakfast young
un remarked the captain its the ra-
jahs doing of course and equally of
course well keep the flag flying after
youve prepared breakfast arnold you
take one rifle and post yourself beyond the
wood where you can watch the chitral
trail and smith if you are game you
can go down into the gorge by the lower
trail and try to bury whats left of anim
dass

  he lit a cigarette and sat in a brown
study while arnold and i pitched in and
brewed black coffee fixed up eggs and
toast and opened the tin of marmalade
we felt better after that especially when
dixon took matters so easily he knew
how to encourage a couple of youngsters
and as i started down the zigzag trail that
was the only path to the river i felt all
my fears vanish after all one native
had fallen off the cliff and the others had
struck in a body they did that in the
u s of a

  but the matter of attending to anim
dass temporarily ended  all pleasant
thoughts for a while i battled the big
vultures that were descending on him and
finally had to heap some rocks over the
poor devil and stick a rough cross over the
pile

  by the time i reached the top of the
cliff i was about all in and it was early
afternoon coming through the deodars
i heard voices and slung the enfield muz-
zle forward over my arm going on
quietly i made out that gordon carnie
and dixon were talking within a few yards
of me although the acacia bushes hid
them

larry she cried her voice rising its

a foolish risk ill buy out your interest
in the grove then you can satisfy your
partners and we can leave

  his reply was too low to hear but evi-
dently he refused

  if anything happened to arnie or to
the american wed never forgive our-
selves larry you must let me buy the
grove and ill leave the trees as they
are

  now i had not meant to listen in but
the girls words halted me in my tracks
she seemed to be beside herself over
something and i gathered that it was be-
cause larry would not abandon the grove
also i learned that the carnies had money
owned mines in south africa and a rub-
ber plantation in sumatra and when ar-
nold spoke of being broke he meant he
had spent his income a good many months
ahead

  ill send you and arnie down to simla
in the car gordon he said smith can
drive i think moorcroft was correct
enough in saying that this is not the place
for you if id suspected the rajah would
try this kind of trickery i would never
have-

 nonsense you know we will not
leave you

  he began to urge gordon to go to a
kind of mission hospital station about
twenty miles away-the nearest thing to
civilization i suppose and then he
pleaded with her to go with him and be
married there

  after a moment or two of this with
dixon making love to her and the girl
laughing and half crying i realized that
this was not the place for alexander
smith i didnt want larry dixon to
marry gordon or anyone else to marry the
girl for that matter except me and that
was impossible and it didnt improve
my humor to think of him standing there
with her in his arms and probably kissing
her hed be a fool not to

  i looked all over for arnold and finally
found him in moorcrofts den he was
sitting in the only chair with papers and
books scattered all over the table and he
was flushed with excitement

  oh i say smithy he hailed heres
a merry go a cracking good find ive
been cramming since larry called me in
and ive learned a lot about this place
theres a tomb somewhere in the
grove

  i sat down on a tiger skin and got out
my pipe borrowing some of his tobacco
and remarking that his news was old
the camp of the snake

  wait a bit yankee this tomb was
built by jahangire one ol the great mo-
guls about three centuries ago and he
buried one of his wives in it

  carnie flourished a book at me and
grinned with excite-
ment

  its all in moor-
crofts book on the
relics of mogul rule
in kashmir he says
that the annals of jahangires reign re-
late that this queen was a beauty and a
persian and he built the tomb under-
ground in a grove of high deodars on the
wurdwan river afterward the site
was kept a secret so that no blighters
could tear the thing to pieces

  sure its this grove i asked becom-
ing interested

  this identical place moorcroft quotes
a legend of the chitral ruling family-
about fourth cousins of the mogul-to
prove it is hidden under a pile of
rocks

  ive seen it then i thought of the
clearing and the heap of boulders where
moorcroft had been standing

  ripping were getting to the meat
of the mystery he turned to the loose
pages of manuscript i ventured to dig
into moorcrofts latest unpublished as yet
some of these sheets have an account of
the inside of the vault-marble walls mo-
saic floor bearing the inscriptions-hm
here we are one portion of the floor is
a solid square of silver etched with designs
by-and so forth gordon would like to
see all this grandeur

  arnold wanted to find dixon and his
sister and hurry off to the pile of rocks to
find out if the account in the book was cor-
rect but i cooled him off by reminding
him that the place was really the rajahs
property dixon had bought only the tim-
ber rights

  he admitted that moorcroft said in the
book that the chitrali rulers stood in awe
of the place and although they were legal
owners of the ground never ventured into
the tomb

  that must be what moorcroft meant
when he said that some invisible force or
other guarded this grove i pointed out
he probably was thinking of the spirit
of the dead queen or maybe the mogul
scattered poison around to discourage tres-
passers

  rot carnie laughed i thought you
said moorcroft was balmy-mad you
know



  and he may be i insisted but it
stands to reason that something must have
kept thieves out of the place for three hun-
dred years because the location of the
tomb was known to the natives and moor-
croft seems to have found it untouched

  i wanted to tell him what id heard in
the grove and to ask him if he knew
dixon was planning to marry his sister
arnold did not seem to consider such a
possibility i suppose gordon had had a
whole platoon of suitors he was study-
ing me with a frown

  you look done up smithy lets go
and tell larry anyway

  i was beginning to feel tired and dead
sleepy for a fact but i went with car-
nie outside dixons tent we found the
captain holding a small piece of paper
he handed it to carnie who passed it on
to me it said

  dear miss carnie if you have any re-
gard for your brother or your own life
do not fail to take the car back to simla
and be out of the camp before sunset

paul moorcroft

  but what held us all silent was the post-
script scribbled hastily under the neat
writing of the message

  the snake will not be held back any
longer

  this struck me as the warning of an in-
sane man who was not the less dangerous
carnie could make nothing of it dixon
observed that it had been folded and stuck
in one of the sticks split at one end which
are used by natives to carry messages
and it had been found on miss carnies
cot when they returned from their walk a
few minutes ago

  it means war my dear fellows he
said grimly the rajah i fancy is in-
clined to make use of some of the mum-
mery of his people who may be snake wor-
shippers the cult of nag or the serpent
extends into the himalayas

  yes assented carnie i remember
my servant saying that no snake would
harm you if you could see a particular
snow peak among the higher ranges for-
get which one a raid of cobras would be
unpleasant but not absolutely fatal

  a thought flashed into the thing that
serves me for a brain and all my arteries
felt several degrees cooler suppose a
forty foot boa-constrictor was quartered
under that heap of rocks in the vaults
these reptiles lived to a ripe old age id
short stories

heard somewhere possibly a hundred years
or so

   also they climbed trees and i could
never forget the creepy feeling id had
walking under the deodars for the first
time and then such a snake might have
frightened cobden and anim dass into
fleeing too close to the edge of the cliff
and it would have caused the undergrowth
to sway and rustle although in the poor
light we had not seen it on the ground

   to tell the truth though i felt too
sleepy to think much and wandered off to
my tent meaning to doze for an hour the
sun was warm on the canvas and id been
thirty-six hours without sleep

   i remember hearing captain dixon sing-
 ing somewhere outside the tent its a
 long way to tipperary then the sing-
 ing stopped and i felt the tent and every-
 thing else slipping away it was a pleas-
 ant feeling too until i began to walk un-
 der thousand-foot trees every one with a
 great boa coiled in the branches and
 anim dass was skipping around grinning
 at me from behind the boles of the forest
 with a hat made of vultures wings

   the wings began to flap and then to hit
 me on the shoulder and anim dass was
 yelling something in my ear calling to me
 to wake up the worst of it was that i
 couldnt move even when the wings turned
 into hands and fingers gripped into my
 arm

  mr smith please wake up-please

   my eyes opened and i saw the inside of
 the tent only it was half hidden by a kind
 of veil so i shut my eyes again and tried
 to shake off the hand that was bothering
 me then my forehead felt wefand cold
 and i sat up with an effort

   gordon carnie was standing by the cot
 with the miniature bit of embroidery she
 calls a handkerchief in her hand dipping it
 into the water pail the light was dim
  the sun must have set but i could see her
 cheeks were perfectly white she was
 half smiling with a kind of wild anxiety

  please say something mr smith
whatever is the matter  you and arnie
too

   it was not easy to say anything i found
 and i must have slept like a dead man for
 four hours but that girl could have
 brought me out from a dose of ether and
 when i understood that something had
 happened and that she was calling on me
 for help i got up after emptying most
 of the water bucket over my head i was
 able to think straight and to walk without
 staggering

  the first thing i did was to feel around
the cot for the enfield that i had left there
then i lit a lamp and searched the tent
carefully while the girl watched me as if
she did not know whether i was a cure or
a turn for the worse

  the thing that brought me around finally
was the rifle the enfield was gone i
asked if she had seen it or taken it and she
shook her head

  larry might have taken it with him
he went to look at the chitral trail two
hours ago arnie was sleeping and so
were you i knew you were tired but
when larry did not come back and it was
growing dark i tried to wake my brother
i couldnt and so-

  you came for me i thought of the
state wed found dixon in last night and
wondered if the same thing had happened
to arnold and me there was no smell
of whisky in the tent but i felt as if id
downed a quart or so in the last few hours
my hands shook and my head was split-
ting

  arnold was curled up on the ground by

the dead fire
and his rifle was
missing h i s
face was flushed
and though his
eyelids twitched
when i rapped
his fingers with
a stick h i s
heavy breathing
did not stop
finally i scratched a match and held the
flame to his wrist after a second i took
it away and carried him into the tent lay-
ing him on the cot

  that boy had been doped and the same
thing must have happened to me though
how it had been done was a mystery i
had not taken a drink even of water since
coming to camp  nor anything to eat for
that matter i had been perfectly all right
until we read over those books in moor-
crofts study

  i looked at miss carnie and her lip
was quivering all at once a hot flame of
rage swept over me moorcroft and his
rajah had been trying to worry the heart
out of this girl by their tricks and things
had gone far enough theyd got away
with our rifles but i had a loaded re-
volver tucked in my inner coat pocket that
theyd overlooked and i made up my
mind that someone was going to pay for
this brand of black magic
the camp of the snake



chapter viii

moorcroft makes a suggestion

the last glow of sunset hung over
the mountain peaks across the gorge
and the wind had died away the
camp was in shadow and the paths under
the deodars were dark it was very likely
that we were being watched and it would
not do to take a light where we were go-
ing miss carnie saw that id decided on
some course of action and she followed me
into the deeper gloom near the car

  well go to the look-out where cap-
tain dixon went i whispered before
the moon rises after weve gained touch
with him well come right back to your
brother hes safe enough for the pres-
ent

  i dont want to leave him

   neither did i but we couldnt carry him
and it was important to find out what had
happened to dixon although i did not
tell her we couldnt help arnold much by
hanging around and by slipping away in
the interval of darkness anyone spying on
us would lose track of us

  as a matter of fact a mans voice re-
marked at my ear carnie is perfectly safe
where he is

  dr moorcroft had come up somehow
without being heard and i could just make
out his square pale face in the gloom he
seemed to be alone when i reached out
and caught his arm he did not make a move
to resist

  what have you done to arnold i
asked

  a little datura was put in his tobacco
jar this morning while you were all away
from the camp

  that is poison said gordon a catch
in her voice

  in quantity yes scattered grains
mixed with tobacco merely produce over-
powering drowsiness in fact a stupor that
lasts for some hours moorcroft might
have been lecturing to a class my ser-
vants were instructed to doctor your to-
bacco smith but apparently they were
not successful if you are coming with
us this evening i must have your word
that you will not resort to violence no mat-
ter what happens

  guess again i laughed i never
felt more like violence in my life and ill
begin with you if anything more starts
happening

  for a moment we were all silent and i
could hear the girls quick breathing
twilight is very short under those im-

mense heights and the afterglow had left
the sky when moorcroft spoke again

  miss carnie i had intended taking you
with me alone tonight you did not heed
my warning to leave the grove it is now
too late your only chance is in coming
with me to see the snake

  what snake i asked

  the one in the tomb if you come and
keep silence i will do my utmost to guard
you against the forces that are loosed
within this grove at present

  where-where is-captain dixon 
i had never heard her speak of dixon in
such a hesitating way but moorcroft
seemed to be able to read the girls mind

  he is unharmed at present and you
will see him before long the man spoke
as if he pitied the girl and i wondered
what had happened to dixon probably
he was a prisoner in the hands of the
chitrali-moorcroft-rajah party although
miss carnie had heard no shooting and the
captain was not the sort of fellow to fall
into a trap easily or let himself be taken
without using his gun

  we will go to the tomb and be specta-
tors of a time-honored ceremonial of the
tribe-of the chitralis the doctor ex-
plained as if we were children unfor-
tunately the rajah is absent in delhi horse
racing if he were here he would pro-
tect you miss carnie

  the grove was pitch dark by then and
a hazy light was growing over the eastern
peaks the air felt colder all at once
in some way the place seemed to take
shape and form around us

  gordon drew a little closer to me and
i knew she felt the same way i did its
hard to explain neither of us were sub-
ject to ordinary fear of barren places or
heights it was the camp itself that set
our nerves on edge that shapeless pit of
blackness under the giant trees already
sighing and rustling with a chilly breeze

  we both knew without being told that
the camp was not deserted any more
something else was there besides moor-
croft and ourselves an hour before wed
had trees around us and a stretch of grass
and a few canvas shelters now the con-
founded place felt as if it had taken on
life it was just as if wed walked out of
a garden into someone elses house only
we had not moved at all

  how did anim dass die i asked
moorcroft suddenly certain that he knew

  and he did because he laughed and said
under his breath come and youll learn
for yourself


short stories

  there was nothing else to do if id
palled my gun on moorcroft and demand-
ed that he tell us the truth of all this mys-
tery i dont think the man would have
opened his lips his warning sounded
crazier than ever but my brain was be-
ginning slowly to register the fact that
moorcroft was not mad

  he knew where we could find dixon
and he could hold back the chitralis if he
wanted to some of them were probably
in the grove aijid they could jump us any
time we made a false move to say nothing
of arnold the girl at my side seemed
nearly mad with worry about the man she
loved so we followed moorcroft along
the dark path my hand on the butt of the
six-shooter and for all the good it did
me i might as well have been casing along
a mouse-trap

the moon had cleared the peaks by
the time we reached the small clear-
ing with the stone heap in the cen-
ter it looked differently by moonlight
and with a hundred or more natives squat-
ting in a solid ring at the edge of the grass
in the shadows

  it was hard to see them clearly but they
wore some kind of peaked head-dress and
after glancing at us they kept their eyes on
the heap of boulders to enter that ring
was like walking into a menagerie with all
the animal cages open i know i felt my
nerves tingle all over and miss carnie
stood as straight as a deodar and kept her
chin up

  moorcroft whispered to us not to speak
and signed for us to sit down by him half-
way between the ring of chitralis and the
mass of stones right in front of us
twenty yards away some of the biggest
rocks had been moved aside leaving a
black hole about large enough for a man
with a pack to crawl through taking
away these boulders had not disturbed the
others so i guessed that hole led into a
passageway going down to the tomb and
i nice or twice i thought a glow of light
came and went as if someone with a lan-
tern was moving around below but there
was  mistaking the sudden feeling of
danger that swept over us

  it wasnt the wind either that chilled
me a kind of electric shock twitched my
arms and made my heart skip a beat i
tried to get up and found i could not move
and at the same time i stopped thinking

  the cold feeling of absolute fear passed
away in a flash leaving me too weak to
lift a hand

  mr smith gordon whispered do
you feel cold im sure someone put a
hand on my shoulder

  now nothing had come near us i
noticed a shrill whining in the air like the
thin note of a violin only this was im-
mense and powerful as the shrill vibration
that comes into the air when a hurricane
is heading up it was like wind but the
underbrush was still as the pews of a
church there was no wind stirring

  do not move miss carnie and do not
go a step nearer the entrance to the tomb
moorcroft whispered

  the whining was still in the air which
seemed to vibrate but it was not sound or
anything moving sweat trinkled down
into my eyes and i had to set my teeth to
keep from turning around and crawling
away-anything to get outside that cursed
circle and away from the thing that hung
over us in the air

  all at once drums started pounding be-
hind the circle
the natives
were beating a
kind of tattoo
after a while
the rhythm
quickened and
grew louder
strangely
enough it made
me feel easier
though it sounded very much like taps for
us then two men walked into the circle
one carrying fruit the other a bowl of
milk they set down the stuff in front of
the hole and went back

  you will see the snake now moor-
croft muttered but you must not get
up or speak

  the vibration in the air grew less and
finally died down to a faint hissing by
and by i realized that the sound came from
the open mouth of the tomb it was al-
most drowned by the beat of the drums

  watch whispered moorcroft

  the hole became darker then lighter as
a head appeared the head drew back
and i heard something sliding over rocks
then a man crawled out

  propping himself up over the bowl of
milk and the fruit he swayed his head
from side to side like a snake keeping time
to the beat of the drums at first i
thought it was one of the chitralis going
through some mummery connected with
their show and then i nearly yelled out
loud

  it was dixon and while we watched
the camp of the snake	

his head suddenly sank down until the chin
was on the ground he began to wriggle
first around the bowl then around the heap
of stones and he moved not by his el-
bows as a man might but by sliding his
whole body along as a snake moves

  i glanced at the girl beside me she
had seen dixon-i knew that by her face
-and now mercifully she had closed her
eyes

  one look i had at the mans face in
the moonlight it seemed strangely loose
and empty of expression the full lips
were drawn back and the eyes were nar-
rowed to slits ordinarily dixon was re-
markably handsome but now it made me
shudder to see him because life itself
seemed to have left him and what we saw
wriggling in the tall grass was no more
than the body of a man twisting in a kind
of muscular strength

  i was thankful he had gone back of the
stones instead of toward us for a mo-
ment he could be heard moving away into
the trees

  this has gone far enough i leaned
back to whisper to moorcroft without be-
ing heard by gordon carnie that man
was hypnotized

  yes he nodded dixon was a vic-
tim of group hypnotism which is very
well understood by the chitralis but it
goes deeper than that they have only
stripped the mask from him-the mask
you know of deceit they have taken
away from him his ability to control his
face and his movements what you saw
was the mans true nature devoid of every
influence of civilization

  curiously enough i thought of dixon as
arnold and i had seen him twenty-four
hours ago asleep in his tent his face
had held a suggestion of brutishness then

  all at once the drums stopped and i saw
that the natives had disappeared miss
carnie stumbled to her feet and looked
down at moorcroft and though she was
shivering her voice was like the swish of
a sword

  kindly explain everything dr moor-
croft at once

  he got up and bowed and ill swear
there was admiration for her and pity too
in his manner

  come miss carnie we can do so
safely now

  without looking around he walked to
the hole stooped and climbed through a
match flashed and i saw that he was light-
ing a candle the hole was at the head
of a narrow passage and several big

boulders had been propped over it to hold
up the loose stones above

  she followed him in at once and they
started down a flight of stone steps bend-
ing over because the passage was hardly
large enough for a dwarf i had to scram-
ble down on heels and hands but after
what had happened i was not going to let
the girl out of my sight

  the stair descended a dozen feet or so
and ended in a square chamber with walls
of dark sandstone and a teakwood door at
one side this was open and we followed
moorcroft through ive wondered after-
ward why we ventured down into the
tomb but miss carnie was not in the
mood to stop at anything and i never
thought of trying to stop her

chapter ix

the emerald casket

inside the door we all halted and
looked down another narrow stair
this time of marble ran from our feet
to the floor of the mausoleum itself a
lantern stood near the center with dix-
ons rifle or rather the one he had bor-
rowed from me beside it

  the air was cold but reasonably fresh
due to the door being left open and the
place itself was a treasure chamber like a
stage setting the walls were a mass of
mosaics of some shining stone moor-
croft explained that they were made of
onyx and jasper and the green in them
was jade and these stone pictures on
the walls were a replica of the forest over
our heads-slender trees with triangular
green leaves and patterns of vines running
through them

  even the slender columns that support-
ed the red sandstone roof were shaped
like cedars with branches spreading out at
the top and running into the sandstone
the carving on the pillars was a work of
art and each one probably would have sold
for ten thousand dollars on fifth avenue
or post street

  moorcroft pointed out everything ex-
plaining that the builder jahangire the
mogul chap had tried to make this tomb
of a favorite immune from the wear of
time the precious stones were bright as
ever and the marble floor was polished
but water had seeped through here and
there and places in the walls were crump-
led in by roots of the deodars that had
grown into the tomb

  he said the entrance had been covered
up by the loose rocks to prevent discovery


short stories

but a thing like this is not forgotten
and though the chitralis from whom
moorcroft learned the secret kept its site
hidden as well as they could many natives
in india knew about it

  for three hundred years no robber
dared to enter here the doctor remarked
but look at that

  across the chamber the floor was a
square of solid silver and around this ran
a lacy screen clear to the ceiling by
holding the lantern close to the openings
in the carved screen we could see a kind of
altar inside with a small casket on it
this box was set with precious stones
mostly emeralds i expect

   in that casket moorcroft told us rested

the ashes of the
persian girl the
mogul had
loved and the
marble screen-
the thing was
really carved
 out of marble-
was shattered at
one place by a
small black-
smiths ham-
mer that lay
near where we stood

   it did not need a diagram to show that
dixon had been at work smashing the bar-
rier between him and the casket when he
had been interrupted miss carnie looked
as if someone had struck her but she faced
moorcroft frankly and asked him to tell
his story

dr moorcroft had known
lawrence dixon for several years
since the captain had resigned
from the army dixon had been posted
in the kashmir region doing work with
thie border commission while he was
a subaltern he had mixed with the wealth-
ier natives a lot and had taken to eating
opium he had always been a drinker
and his promotion was due to influence

  why the man had resigned moorcroft
did not say but it came out afterward that
he had been involved in smuggling opium
into russia

  besides opium dixon had dabbled more
than was good for him in the mysteries of
the hindus he had followers in nearly
every caste because the man had a keen
mind and knew how to make a penny turn
up when he wanted it when the rajah
of chitral babur el-sulaiman had been
in need of money in delhi a few months

ago dixon offered to buy out the hill
chiefs feudal rights to cut timber

  he got the concession cheap for some
six thousand pounds but to buy the tim-
ber he had to interest two or three other
men in the forestry venture these peo-
ple in calcutta supplied most of the six
thousand pounds and stipulated that cob-
den should be made manager cobden was
notoriously honest though quarrelsome
and an experienced lumber man

  about the actual terms of the partner-
ship moorcroft knew little dixon was
content to take a small percentage for his
services because he meant to make his pro-
fit in a different thing the tomb of jahan-
gire

  he knew the site of the tomb must be
close to this spot having learned that much
from his native friends but knew also that
the chitralis kept a close watch on it
the timber cutting gave him an excuse
to go over every foot of the ground tak-
ing the sacred grove as a starting point
he found the entrance in the rock pile
quickly

  the man was not afraid to take long
chances still breaking into the mauso-
leum would require the help of another
white man and armed followers dixon
had an idea of the wealth buried in the
tomb and he made his first mistake by try-
ing to win over cobden to help him make
the raid a man venturing into the vault
alone would be at the mercy of the chit-
ralis who would probably gather outside
and shut him up in the place-so dixon
must have reasoned

  anyway cobden refused to meddle and
accused dixon of ruining the timber con-
cession by an act of plain thievery the
tomb belonged to the rajah the trees to
the englishman who had made a good
bargain

  whether cobden threatened to reveal
dixons plans to the other partners moor-
croft did not know but dixon asked one
of his followers anim dass to get the
manager out of the way for several weeks
-carry him off to one of the unruly hill
tribes or see that he fell sick now anim
dass did not believe in taking any unneces-
sary trouble and while dixon was absent in
delhi waiting for the field to be cleared
the babu proceeded to kill cobden-which
was the safest thing to do from his point
of view

  and he did it cleverly a cobra was
brought up from one of the southern val-
leys and was slipped into the managers
overcoat by one oi the natives who could
the camp of the snake	

handle the deadly snake cobden was bit-
ten before he was aware of danger in the
half light of sunrise near the edge of the
cliff

  a cobras bite does not always kill but
anim dass had his species of reptile se-
lected with care and cobden saw what
had struck him he knew too- that he was
a couple of miles from medicines and
stimulants at the camp-and did not care
to die under the eyes of the natives who
had tricked him he walked off the cliff

  which suited anim dass perfectly be-
cause a half dozen witnesses could say that
the white man died by accident

  meanwhile dixon had met gordon car-
nie at the races in delhi moorcroft found
out that he was paying attention to the
girl miss carnies parents were dead
and both she and her brother disliked the
perfunctory care-taking of the officers
wives dixons history was not known in
delhi and-that was all moorcroft said
of the love that the girl had wasted on the
man who had tried to marry her for her
money but i knew pretty well what he
left unsaid dixon playing for a greater
stake than the chitral tomb had persuad-
ed gordon carnie and her brother to come
to the hills to his camp then he tried to
induce her to go with him in the car to the
missionary to be married

  the girl was barely out of school wilful
and heedless as her brother hardly out
of the flapper stage yet a womans in-
stinct warned her to hold back from this
final step i think dixon tried to play the
sheik and rush her off and failed any-
way the talk that afternoon gave her an
insight into his character and the conjur-
ing of the natives horrible as it was did
the rest

  even then i didnt quite believe that the
chitralis had turned dixon into a human
snake by collective thought-action proba-
bly the man had been tricked or drugged
and was trying to crawl away without be-
ing seen

  you havent explained yet how anim
dass died i reminded moorcroft in
spite of the mans open story and its ef-
fect on the girl i was not quite sure in my
mind what part he was playing

  he followed cobden retorted the doc-
tor grimly last night when dixon was
sleeping in his tent the babu took alarm
suspecting the truth he had an inkling
that the chitralis had decided on his death
as a punishment for the murder of the
white man which they witnessed

  moorcroft took up the hammer and

glanced at it thoughtfully anim dass
was aware of the secret of the tomb he
came to me last night and being thor-
oughly frightened confessed a good deal
trying to lay all the blame on dixon i
could do nothing for him after id left
the camp to go to the tribe and try to make
them keep their hands off you smith and
the carnies anim dass ran to find arnold

carnie he was creeping through the un-
derbrush when he put his hand on a
cobra

  accident 

  no the chitralis caught him after
theyd seen him barging around the stone
heap yesterday he was petrified by ter-
ror and half numb with the poison that
kills in a half hour when he reached the
edge of the cliff where you were proba-
bly he was more than half blind by then
and stumbled off it made  difference
suddenly he stopped and looked at gor-
don carnie there were dark circles un-
der her eyes and her teeth were caught in
hr lower lip

  why did you keep silent so long dr
moorcroft you are lawrences enemy
and i do not believe what you say why
wont you accuse him to his face

  she was defiant and bitterly hurt i
suppose a woman is a poor judge of char-
acter in the man she loves or likes and
law doesnt mean the world to her either
but i saw her wince as she looked at the
break in that beautiful screen built by a
prince generations ago to guard the re-
mains of the woman he had cherished

  im going to find lawrence and make
him answer you she added lifting her
chin in a way that meant business

  a breath of cold air passed through the
tomb blowing out the candle and making
the lantern flicker moorcroft held up his
hand listening and i set myself for some
new kind of magic

  the wind is rising he said

  we left the tomb and i had no regrets
when he closed the door after us and
crawled out the hole behind that screen
was a fortune in jewels and a few whacks
of the hammer might have made it mine
because i was armed and moorcroft


wasnt and the chitralis had left us-evi-
dently trusting the doctor who had been
there before

  but when i thought of dixon and his
snake wriggle and the things i might be
made to look like if i tried to crack that
crib i walked out on my toes and helped
moorcroft roll the boulders back into
place outside a merry gale was blowing
and the deodars were swaying overhead
the moon had gone behind clouds and it
sure looked good for a storm

  so moorcroft thought and we hurried
the girl to his trick tent as the best shelter
available those himalaya thunderstorms
are no dewy showers

chapter x

the edge of the cliff

we were caught by the first burst
of rain in the clearing and by the
time we staggered in through the
entrance of the big tent our clothes were
soggy with water the tent was dark
moorcrofts servants being still a w o
l and he felt his way into the study to
the lamp that stood on his desk while i
put down the rifle and went after him for
a rag to wipe it off

  out of the darkness a match flared up
and someone else lighted the lamp it
was larry dixon and when he put the
shade in place and turned toward us i saw
two of his natives squatted against the side
of the partition they were all spattered
a bit with rain so i guessed they had just
arrived

  wheres dear arnold smiled dixon

  if ever a man seemed worked up to tear
things wide open dixon was that man
his sunken eyes smouldered and twitched
and two red spots burned in his cheeks
he may have had a shot of his favorite
stuff opium or bhang but the loose folds
of skin about his mouth and his puckered
lips were traces of the experience hed
come through the mask was off his face
to stay off

  ive precious little time to waste on
you two he snarled wheres that
cub

  he is not here responded moorcroft
calmly wiping the water off his glasses

  thats a lie youve hounded me
enough moorcroft now youre coming
with me to the tomb in the grove and if
your cursed chitralis try any more trick-
ery youll be the one to suffer

  precisely nodded the little doctor

and you no man could break into the
screen and come out alive

  how much dixon remembered of his
experience i dont know but it couldnt
have been much just then i heard gor-
dons step behind me and her voice

  captain dixon is it true that you
ordered anim dass to put mr cobden out
of the way

  the one thing that hurt her most was
that he should have had a native for a side-
kick his eyes half closed and his teeth
clicked shut what he would have said
i dont know and gordon after a look at
his face was past caring by then it was
the little doctor who laid all cards on the
table after a quick glance at dixon

  moorcroft rummaged in the mess ar-
nold had made of his papers and drew out
a small slip with a few words scribbled on
it

  just a minute he said gravely miss
carnie perhaps will believe this now i
hope it will save her from a heartless
scoundrel and it may prove to be a
timely bit of -news for you dixon

  it was a telegram dated three days ago
which ran

  your advice as to chitral situation
received it is urgently important
that the tomb and its grove should
not be molested they are unques-
tionably the property of the rajah
babur el-sulaiman friendship of
hill tribes at stake calcutta part-
ners of timber enterprise coming to
take over c i d sending representa-
tive to arrest dixon who is believed
to be head of gang of native thieves
delhi

  the telegram was addressed to moor-
croft and signed by the resident of kash-
mir c i d stood for the criminal in-
vestigation department

  apparently dixon went on the doc-
tor quietly your precious pair of con-
jurers who robbed mr smith at the hotel
are not your only servants did you want
his money or his papers 

  one of the breaks in the storm came just
then and we could hear the rumble of the
river down below and the snapping of the
canvas under the gale i heard something
more the sputtering roar of a motor with
cut-out open a considerable distance off
dixon caught it too

he had been glaring at moorcroft his
lips moving in a kind of whisper until
now there had been nothing against him
but moorcrofts suspicions-and the tale

short stories

the camp of the snake

of anim dass who was dead so that
didnt count seeing that telegram how-
ever and realizing that he was being
tracked down roused the devil in him

  there was a way out for him and his
quick brain grasped it before i did with
a snarl he jerked a revolver out of his belt
and fired at moorcroft the slender man
went down as if his legs had been pulled
out from under him and dixon had the
gun pulled down on me before id got
mine out from its sling miss carnie
saved me that time by stepping between us
and dixon snapped something at the two
natives that sounded like

  missy-sahib lao

  they were on their feet and caught her
by the arms hauling her to one side while
she struggled to win free calling dixon a
coward which he wasnt exactly what-
ever else he might have been

  ill have use for you gordon he mut-
tered watching for a chance to wing me
a hostage across the frontier-miss car-
nie you know-worth a few hundred
pounds what ah smith

  when the girl was pulled to one side we
both shot almost together and both of us
missed i had stepped back as i pulled
the trigger into the next compartment
which was dark one of the hindus had
been pulling a knife to throw it and i
wanted to shift to new ground

  the minute i reached the waiting room
the lamp in the study was blown out i
listened and heard nothing at all until gor-
don called out clearly

  they will kill you in the tent mr

smith go to arn-

  somebody cut her off but her advice was
good i slipped out the front entrance a
short ways and knelt down trying to watch

the black
square of the
opening
against the
gray blurr of
the wind-
whipped walls
then came a
flash of light-
ning and i saw
dixon walking
toward me his
gun poised
we shot so
close together that it was impossible to
hear my bullet strike my coat jerked and
something cold as ice grazed the tender
skin over a rib

  that bird could shoot and i changed po-



  sition again waiting for the next display
of lightning and getting madder all the
time

  when the flash came i was looking
toward the tent and i glimpsed one of the
natives crawling along the ground knife
in hand i pulled down on him and heard
the bullet strike this time just before dix-
ons gun barked and a weight landed on
my right forearm and every nerve in me
turned around a few times

  that jar and the crack that followed it
told me a bone in the arm was out of com-
mission i took the revolver in my left
hand and crawled to one side a couple
of dim flashes high up in the clouds
showed me that dixon was coming for-
ward again i heard him laugh and knew
that hed seen something to his liking

  i doubt if youll have as much burial
as anim dass mr smith he whispered

  i knew better than to risk a shot at the
sound with the gun in my left hand the
pain in my right arm was beginning to
make me dizzy and i figured the edge of
the cliff must be close behind me dixon
must have seen it the lightning had sus-
pended operations but the clouds were
drifting away and the moonlight was grow-
ing stronger all the time

  dixons figure began to take shape a
few paces away and i nerved myself for
another shot knowing it might be my last
and praying that it would do enough dam-
age to keep him from carrying off the girl
the wind was whining in the brush and
the air seemed to vibrate with it when the
last clouds rolled away from the moon

  i	had dixon along the sights but i
never pulled the trigger his arm was
swaying in front of him and his face was
turned up to the sky behind him and
all around the clearing i saw a throng of
turbaned natives squatting-all except one
man

  he was an old man his thin arms
were lifted over his head and he was look-
ing up into the silvery space over the jut-
ting heights around us i could see jewels
gleam in his turban and his long cloak
made him look like some kind of a priest
somewhere in the grove a drum was boom-
ing and the beat of it kept time with the
roaring of blood in my ears

  dixons arm jerked spasmodically and
the revolver dropped from his fingers he
half turned as if trying to run out of the
semi-circle of squatting figures then he
cried out and caught at his throat

  the old man pointed out over the val-
ley and i shivered the same force that


short stories

had disarmed dixon was driving him away
from me toward the edge of the precipice
i could see all the chitralis looking at him
and then pushing back and struggling as
if a resistless wind was driving him ahead
dixon stumbled to the edge of the cliff
flinging up his arms he dropped out of
sight

  i must have been more than a little faint
because a half dozen moons seemed to
come down from the sky and dance around
the clearing when they went away the
old man and his tribe had gone and miss
carnie was standing in the tent entrance
calling me anxiously

  in the study i found dr moorcroft
calmly bandaging up his right chest where
dixons bullet had ripped through

  hullo smith the rajah of chitrali
was just here-motored up from delhi to
see what the trouble was said youd drop
in presently fine old specimen isnt he 

  with a glance at my arm he pulled off
my coat and shook his head his injury
prevented his setting the broken bone and
he said cheerfully that hed have to send
me down to the nearest army post to be
patched up by a surgeon all at once he
smiled

  understand anything of native cus-
toms now smith or are you still wish-
ful to go up against the occult power of a
whole people with a revolver in your
hand 

  i wont meddle thank you i told him

  he was a strange fellow becoming
serious he stared at me thoughtfully

  do you know smith i fancy your med-
dling saved me my life and miss carnie
an extremely unpleasant ordeal-to say
nothing of her brother

  tell me just one thing dr moorcroft

i begged what
was the idea of
the native who
raided my berth
and brandished
a knife in my
ear on the train 
was that dix-
ons doing

 n o h e
smiled mine the chap was one of my
servants and i felt confident that the inci-
dent would discourage you from getting
into further trouble i was wrong

  he told me that he was worried about
gordon carnie the girl was about at
the end of her rope with a fever that
might develop in her brain she was de-
termined to leave the grove at once moor-

croft agreed that she ought to be taken
down to the hill settlement at simla or
some such place and out of these sur-
roundings

  just then we were hailed from the en-
trance there stood arnold carnie my
rifle in hand blinking like a sleepy owl
we had a laugh out of that and it did us
good when we gave him a sketch of
what had happened he was indignant

  why in thunder didnt you blighters
wake me up smith it wasnt a bit fair
you got the first buck and all the fight-
ing

  i cheered him up a little by showing him
how to get the water out of that fool car-
bureter in the car by warming up the mo-
tor after that he bundled up his sister
and stowed her in the rear seat while i
took the wheel arnold wasnt much of
a hand at driving and it was up to me to
coax that bus about a hundred miles to
civilization

  and it was a whale of a ride down that
muddy mountain trail over the rock bridg-
es and around washouts with the prospect
of skidding after anim dass and dixon
if the brakes were put on too suddenly-
and with only one hand to manage the
wheel and the gears the sun came up
and the mist rolled around us like a sea
miles overhead the sun gleamed on the
snow of the mountains we were leaving

  yes it was a morning for the gods and
a ride of rides by the time we reached
the first bungalows and the buffalo carts
and palms gordon carnie was sleeping in
her brothers arms and we knew that the
danger of brain fever was past when we
stopped i felt sorry that it was over

its a dusty morning in may and the
street cars are raising a steady bed-
lam on woodward theres a glint
of green out where belle isle is and the
sun is warm on the pavements i saw a
straw hat today and the windows are
opened at last

  theres a letter from arnold carnie in
the mail asking me to come out for a sum-
mers shooting in the high hill country
north of kashmir and he promises real
game this time i cant afford to go and
maybe i ought to stay sitting at the desk
but by thunder im going

  when the red gods call a fellow he takes
the next train out or feels sorry the rest
of his life what are the red gods
well some say the hunting call others
wanderlust but im through trying to
explain things
bush tleague strategy

by h m sutherland

as a batter buster stubbs was the old pile-driver and as a third sacker
he was wide fast and sure the trouble was his head didnt work as weli
as his feet but when he did get that idea it was dynamite for all

bull luck thats what i call it
and after ten years managing
teams in six different leagues i
think i ought to know stra-
tegy huh say ive pulled that
stuff and got yards of fulsome praise on
every sport sheet in town and then on the
next day id try the same stunt and itd
fail to work what happened those
same boys who had strewed my path with
roses on the day before now stood unani-
mous for my immediate departure-if it
could be taken for granted that i had
enough brains to be able to locate the rail-
road station strategy is strategy when it
works when it dont then its an excess
cargo of ivory of triple-plated imbecility
where baseball intelligence is supposed to
lurk

  im guiding the destinies of a gang of
dock-wallopers and sandlot alumni not so
long ago but what i can still remember it
without forgetting any of the important
details when i run slap bang into some of
that bull luck strategy which for a few
minutes had me standing on my left ear
and feeling about as useless as a mexican
hairless pup on a polar expedition

  the season had already got under way
when i agreed to old man griess terms
to manage the tars which for the last two
years had followed the national example
and stayed in the cellar i hadnt been
there long before i found out why they

were called tars-they never moved until
the weather got hot and then they didnt
break any tendons i knew most of them
had played with them at some time or
other about twenty years before they
were castoffs from the big leagues and they
had reached their last resting place before
they became night watchmen

  i raised a howl to gries but his heart
was bigger than his pocketbook and
throughout the year those old birds stuck
closer to him than a mud turtle to a pick-
aninnys toe however i did manage to
loosen the old man out of enough change
to bring in four pretty good youngsters
three for the infield and one for the pas-
tures  and later i picked up a couple of
sidewinders which called themselves
pitchers then i got busy and tried to
teach those burr-heels this thing they call
baseball strategy

  i might as well have tried to instruct a
stuck pig in a business college they for-
got everything i told them as soon as i
shut my mouth all those youngsters
knew was to hit the ball and run but ive
got to hand it to them they could do that
little thing as good as a lot of bozoes who
are drawing down twenty-six times as
much cash with the old boys as a sort
of a foundation i gradually built up a ma-
chine that hit on nearly all of its cylinders
at least part of the time

  to the surprise of everybody including
short stories



me and old man gries the taro started
in to win games right along in a month
they jumped from seventh to third place
and the papers and sports writers began to
take notice the impossible had hap-
pened  the millenium had arrived oh
they didnt put it in so many words but at
least they left that impression

  the boys kept on plugging along win-
ning four or five every week and each day
the crowds on the home grounds increased
a little old man gries came into the dug-
out one saturday and sat down beside me
we were playing the lions who were in
second place and nipping the heels of the
governors from the state capitol the per-
ennial winners of the pennant

  the tars were stepping high wide and
fancy that afternoon shoestring mc-
mahon one of my kid pitchers had thur-
ston magic on the ball and the lions were
dislocating their spinal columns trying to
reach his weird shoots down on second
chet kavannaugh was doing frankie
frischs and rogers hornsbys all over the
lot with the crowd on its composite toes
yelling so loud for him that they would
have made an apache indian back up into
his teepee

  look at that crowd says old man
gries surveying
the grandstand
with a grin which
if it had been any
wider they would
have had to move
back his ears

  look at that
ball team i shoots
back at him
t hats what
brought your crowd out but he couldnt
see anything but the gate receipts for
the first time in the tars history they
seemed to be getting out of the stretch-
penny class

  finally kavannaugh pulled a bare-hand
stop over the bag that brought even the
boss to his feet and he forgot the crowd
for a minute wild cat marvin the
yowling third sacker pulled a match for
chets play and to top it off old wiggins
in right field showed unusual speed and
pulled down what looked like a certain
three base hit

  how did you do it queried the old
man beaming on me like i was a pros-
pective millionaire son-in-law weve
never had a team to play like that before

  of course not i replies loftily
theyre playing baseball and not one-old-

cat theyve been taught teamwork and
strategy thats what does the trick-
strategy watch this play now

  hart the first man up had singled and
kavannaugh was at bat i signaled for the
hit and run on the second ball at the mo-
tion of the pitcher hart was off like a
jackrabbit and kavannaugh met the ball
for a low liner between third and short
so hot neither of them had time to get
out of his tracks before the leather mar-
ble was in the outfield hart came to third
before the fielder got his hands on the
ball and when he juggled it for an in-
stant took a long dive for the platter he
made it clean

  thats what i mean says i in a com-
placent tone grinning at old man gries
thats what wins the old ball games and
thats whats going to bring in the first
flag the tars ever won

  if you do it declares the old man
ill give a five years contract and add
two thou to your pay check

  from that minute on waking or sleep-
ing my ideas were single-tracked on one
purpose-the pennant also from that
minute on it began to look like lady luck
wasnt particularly wild about my style
still she flirted around keeping me in
hopes and keeping the whole situation un-
certain before she decided to make up her
mind one way or the other

  we closed our home engagement that af-
ternoon by holding the lions to two runs
while the boys collected a natural seven
then that night we hit the road for a cou-
ple of weeks in which we were lined up
soft against the cellarites and their boon
companions on the bottom rungs the
first week we cleaned up and went into
second place and by winning the first two
games from the lions the second week
we started pushing the league leaders the
governors

  right then lady luck arose and begat
herself hence deserting me cold and for
the next month i had enough troubles to
make the book of job read like pollyanna
in the first place shoestring mcmahon
went out somewhere and got himself full
of typhoid fever and two days later kav-
annaugh caught his toe in the bag strap and
tore a tendon loose in his ankle which the
doctor said would keep him on crutches
for a month at least i had to run in one
of my old reliables from the bench to take
his place and that bird was so slow youd
think he kept his engine in reverse all
the time

  when we got back home for a few
bush league strategy



weeks stay i was feeling so darned gloomy
i didnt care much what else happened un-
til it did that same night wild cat mar-
vin picked out the only corner in town on
which any sort of an accident happened
and stood there long enough for a fire en-
gine to skid and knock him for a row of
brick boarding-houses when he come to
he had a special nurse and a busted leg
that capped the amazing climax and out-
side of a few charley horses among the
has-beens split fingers marriages and one
case of paralysis that was all i had to
worry about right in the middle of a hot
race for the flag

  my line-up after that looked like the sick
call in an old soldiers home there
wasnt enough life in the outfit to start an
argument with the umpire let alone win a
ball game hart at short did nobly and
covered miles of territory but he was hu-
man he couldnt get over to third and
take the throw at second at the same time
duffus on first was as steady as a deacon
and between these two the infields ragged
edges were held together in a way but the
holes were large enough to permit several
games to slip out of our fingers

  i had only three pitchers left and they
worked alternately which is at least one
lay too soon for any man i ever had un-
der me but what else could i do old
man gries was as tight as a one-piece bath-
ing suit and all the money i could get out
of him wouldnt keep a one-legged man in
dancing pumps we started to slide down
the ladder and i saw that contract and the
two thou raise slipping over the dark blue
horizon we were still in second place
but the lions were closing the gap like a
thoroughbred behind a bunch of selling
platers

  august eased up on us before we re-
alized it and the lions loped by us after
taking three in a row from us on our home
lot the sports boys began to rise up on
their hind legs and howl that the tars
must get new blood injected from the
general trend of their articles i saw that
the new blood they wanted was mine old
man gries let fall several sarcastic re-
marks about strategy but if he couldnt
tell the difference between strategy and
tragedy i wasnt going to get a black-
board and chalk and draw a diagram of it
for him

  one day we were playing the grays at
least it had been scheduled for a ball game
but i had long since decided that it was
an endurance contest to see who could hold
tip the play longer and then do less when

they got out on the field it was as hot
as hell in summer and i had been dividing
my attention between the men and the wa-
ter cooler when someone in street clothes
came into the dugout and sat down beside
me it was jess walters one of the old-
timers whom i had sent out to the sandlots
and little country towns nearby to look
over the ground and see if he could pick up
any promising young players i didnt ex-
pect him to locate any material but had
found that the best way of getting rid of
him

  i was busy watching the grays sluggers
who ordinarily couldnt hit the mississippi

river with a pad-
dle slam my best
hurler for six safe-
ties in succession
and i forgot a 
about jess when
the agony of that
inning was finally
over he was still
sitting there and i
could see with both
eyes shut that he
was chuck full of eagerness and excite-
ment about something and was doing his
darndest to keep it hid

  i kinder felt sorry for old jess he
seemed so anxious to make good in his new
job as my scout for he realized that i knew
he was too old and stiff for anything else
and to think that only a few years before
jess was a  hitter on the cubs and the
idol of thefans now he was digging
up youngsters for a bush team at a salary
which wouldnt have bought his cigars
when he was a big leaguer

  how are they cornin hank he asks
trying to appear natural

  rotten whats on your mind

  jess moved over and lowered his tones
so that the others on the bench couldnt
hear

  hank ive found him

  him i didnt understand what he
was driving at who is him

  the phenom-the cobb-the babe of
the bushes you wanted me to find you a
ball player well i told you ive dis-
covered him

  so i wasnt particularly interested
jess meant all right but he is one of those
birds who gets enthusiastic about anything
once and never gives it a rest til he kills
it

  you aint got nothin to do tomorrer
pleads jess les run up and take a look
at him well get back by dark
	short stories

  come up to the hotel tonight and tell
me about it

  there didnt seem to be any other way of
getting rid of him then and i didnt want
to throw that game away even if there was
a baseball superman ready to be pulled off
the bushes the boys started a slugging
bee in the eighth and tied the score but a
round robin of rotten fielding lost the game
in the ninth putting us another notch be-
hind the lions i went home feeling about
as cheerful as a smallpox ward the only
good news id heard in a week was that
kavannaughs ankle was mending fast and
that in another week hed be able to get
back on second and stop up that gap which
had been bringing me gray hairs

  i had forgotten about jess until i saw
him stray into the lobby after dinner i
tried to duck into the elevator but it was
no go so i led the way into a corner and
gave him a cigar

  well lets hear about this discovery
you made i radioed already i was fig-
gering on some excuse to get out of that
trip the next day because i had other
plans

  hes a murderin hittin fool enthused
jess names stubbs-vernoy stubbs
he plays on a team for a brick-makin com-
pany saturdays and sundays up at not-
toway ive seen him play twice and take
it from me hank you wont make no mis-
take in signin him quick

  what does he play  not that i cared
but it was the only question i could think
of at the time

  third and he covers acres fast on
his pins and throw say that bird can
put em all day in a quart cup

  i let jess rave for a while til he got it
all out of his system and then i took a hand
in the conversation

  lets come down to cases jess you
and ive seen good men play and we know
the makings when we see em is this bird
any good i mean by that is he good
enough to hit the alleged pitchers in this
league oh i know he could hit on that
brickyard team but honestly jess do you
think down in your heart that jackson of
the governors couldnt make a monkey
of him ive reached the limit on the pay-
roll and unless hes some unusual i cant
afford to gallivant around and take on bush
wonders for a pastime

  jess laid his hand solemnly on my knee
ive been tellin you the honest truth
hank he declared solemnly i believe
he is a wonder

  that settled it i knew old jess
wouldnt deliberately lie about it but i still
didnt have much confidence in the ability
of that busher however i was needing
a third baseman bad marvin wasnt go-
ing to be able to get back in harness for
the rest of the season and grimes my
cast-off sub let em go through him like
the spirit of the lord through an alabama
camp meeting i believe that if this
stubbs had been playing in any other posi-
tion i would have sat tight and let him
stay in the brickyard

  the tarss home town was as dead as
williamsburg va on sunday anyway
and since we couldnt play because of a re-
cently passed city ordinance i chased along
up to nottoway with jess it took about
four hours to go that forty miles on a
dinky two-coach train which stopped at
every other farmhouse when we finally
hit nottoway i couldnt see anything but a
brickyard jess led the way to a boarding-
house where we got a greasy dinner for
four bits then we hiked it out to the
ball grounds which was part of the brick-
yard

  the game hadnt started when we got
there but we didnt have long to wait
another team from somewhere nearby had
the field for practice and they were pretty
bad they could hit and throw but it
was a fifty-fifty shot whether they got
their hands on a batted ball or not and
even if they did it was another even bet
that they would manhandle it around long
enough for the batter to land on first
then the brick-makers come on for their
warm-up they were a motley gang
among them one kid of about fifteen and a
couple of geezers with whiskers they
were even worse than the other team

  which is it i asked as they lined up
to bat out a few

  the one in the red flannel undershirt
replied jess

  i looked him over he was about nine
teen tall and gangly looking like he hadnt
ever got enough to eat his arms were
long hanging down almost to his knees
and when he moved you naturally expected
himto fall over his feet he was that awk-
ward a sort of a loose smile stuck on his
face like it was glued there but liable to
drop off at any instant and a large quid
puffed out one cheek making his whole
face look kinder lop-sided but under that
red understirt i could see the play of a set
of powerful muscles and he swung a cou-
ple of bats around his head like they were
dumbbells
bush league strategy



  when it came his turn to hit he stepped
up alongside the plate and stood there with
his feet wide apart and that big club of
his restinug on his shoulder that bozo
hit says i to myself why he couldnt
get his bat off his shoulder before a fast
shoot would be in the catchers glove no
man ever stood at the plate in the manner
he did and hit a real pitcher i started
to give jess the razz for bringing me up
forty miles from nowhere to see a athletic
mishap accidentally knock the cover off a
pitcher a kid could
land on when he want-
ed to but just then
the warm-up man shot
the ball across with
more speed than he
had been feeding to
the others and i
thought t o myself
heres where this
batting bird gets
caught flat-footed

  old jesss phenom kinder hunched his
shoulders and swung that bat like a flash
of soft-soaped lightning crack the
ball traveled like a white streak out across-
country and it took two fielders to get it
back to the diamond from the point
where it finally stopped it would have
been a home run in the yankee center
field

  an accident i opines to jess the
thing couldnt have been anything else

  he pulls them kind of accidents nearly
ever time he comes up replies jess grin-
ning wide and happy

  i waited until it came his turn again and
he slammed one down the third base line
so hot the fielder started to put out his bare
hand for the stop but evidently thought
better of it and let it go and i didnt
blame him then the game started and
as far as i and the rest of the crowd were
concerned it was a private exhibition by
vernoy stubbs against the roundhouse
curves which the twirler always tele-
graphed he was a batterin fool a homer
two triples a single a walk and a sky-
scraper which a fielder wandered under
and caught was his record and the gar-
deners were playing back clean outside the
lot for him each time he came up

  jess pounded me on the back until i was
sore as three pups with one bone between
them but i couldnt get excited i had a
pretty strong hunch that vernoy stubbs
would be left at the church door when he
got up against real pitching however i
had to admit that he could field a lot better
cio

than grimes and also i knew that i could
teach him something about hitting once i
got him on the lot at home

  that evening after the game jess and i
drifted around to that boarding-house and
found young stubbs eating supper we
sat in and afterward while waiting for the
train had a talk with him that is we
did the talking with him coming in with
the nods and uh-huhs i offered him ex-
penses until he had tried out and if he
made good a salary of two hundred a
month he jumped at it like a hungry
trout and a half-hour later we were on
our way vernoys smile had expanded
some and his whole face was lit up like a
kid with his first rifle he was tickled
silly all right but he kept quiet and stayed
in the background

  jess took him in tow when we got home
and brought him around for the morning
practice at ten oclock the next day the
boys had fitted him up with a uniform and
he was out chasing flies when i arrived
i let him do as he pleased for half an hour
while i batted out a few to the infield
and then i called him over on third where
i shot some easy bounders down to him
he gobbled them up like he was starved
for them and then i opened up with a few
over the bag and mixed them with others
down closer to short he went after them
all spraddled out and awkward but hie
got them those long arms of his could
reach where the other man couldnt and he
pulled down liners and scooped up sizzlers
on the grass in a manner that brought com-
ments from the other boys he let some
go between his legs and fumbled others
that he should have had easy but i knew
that with a little hard practice daily hed
be a big improvement over grimes on the
hot corner

  i sent commy lovett out to the mound
to toss em over for the batting practice
telling him to lob em up to young stubbs
for a while and then turn loose his best
shoots when i gave him the signal the
first two or three times up stubbs drove
the ball to all corners of the lot he
wasnt a groove hitter he scattered em
over the place most anywhere there didnt
happen to be a fielder old jess was sit-
ting on the bench watching the proceedings
with a look like a cat after eating the
canary i didnt want to show stubbs up
particularly in fact i kinder wanted to
nurse him along slow and easy but i
couldnt resist the temptation to rub off that
smirk from old jesss face i signaled
lovett to shoot over a couple of wide fast
short stories



ones and then follow with some quick hop-
pers over the plate

  the phenom stood still and watched
the two wide ones pass and then lovett
turned loose one of his special inshoots
over the inside of the pan stubbs swung
unbelievably quick and drove the ball
against the right field wall line not ten feet
over the heads of the infield lovett
looked surprised and i know i did a
single delighted yah came from old
jess on the bench

  i kept stubbs in the box for ten minutes
and lovett gave him everything he had
still that loose-jointed mistake stepped into
em regularly i began to see another big
star a hundred thousand dollar trade with
the big leagues and with the proceeds a
real championship team made of the tars

  naturally i went easy with my find
figgering on teaching him the fine points
of the game and making a real star out of
him and right there is where i made one
of the biggest mistakes in my promising
managerial career

  that bird could field and hit but that
let him out his brains might as well have
been an edam cheese for all the good they
did him thinking was out of his line
hed do whatever i told him to do but i
couldnt follow him all around the bases
and keep him posted i tried to teach him
this strategy but unless everything hap-
pened just like you told him he was left
stranded way up in the air with no idea
of what was going on in the practice
games the boys could pick him off the base
with any sort of an old trick and he never
could understand how it happened the
only time he knew exactly what to do was
when he slammed the ball clean out of the
lot

  first i tried to teach him how to stand
at the plate but the trouble was he
couldnt carry two ideas in his head at once
if he centered on his stand he couldnt
see the ball finally i had to give it up
and let him hit like he always had which
was good enough for me to give him a
chance on third and pray to the god of luck
every time men got on the bases

  his gangly six-foot appearance gained
for him a lot of publicity before he got a
try-out on the team although our prac-
tice sessions were never attended by the
sports writers it leaked out that we had a
fence buster ready for the next invasion
of the lions and the report brought out a
whale of a crowd

   on stubbss first appearance at the plate
he caught one of hilis fast ones and lifted

it into the creek over the left field wall
the fans took him to their bosoms dub-
bed him buster and thereafter when he

came to the plate
greeted him loud
and long he re-
sponded nobly with
a couple of two-
baggers and two or
three bits of spec-
t a c u  a r fielding
and the next
morning he was the
citys leading citizen his picture was in
both papers mine alongside for i came
in for my share of the laurels for discov-
ering the greatest ball player that ever
graced the tar uniform

  the strangest thing about it was that
this fulsome praise didnt have any effect
at all on buster stubbs sometimes i
doubt whether he knew what it was all
about anyway he docilely took every bit
of advice i gave him and tried his darndest
to do it but he always forgot it when an
emergency came up i dont know
whether there is any scientific truth back
of my belief or not but it looked to me
like his nerves were paralyzed for an in-
stant when he switched from one track
to another if he was thinking about one
thing he couldnt get that off his mind until
it was too late to do anything else i usu-
ally signaled him what to do and let him
go on and finish it that way no matter what
happened for that reason during the
next few weeks i got the blame for many
a boner which i didnt deserve and bus-
ter continued to be the chief worship of
the population

  kavannaugh got back on second and i had
as fast an infield as i could want all except
when there were men on bases and then
my heart was in my boots if buster got
it into his head to throw to second to
kavannaugh it went no matter if the run-
ner had already pilfered the bag but as
usual i got the blame for most of it al-
though some of the sports writers razzed
stubbs a few times in a half-hearted man-
ner however i could stand a lot of their
howls because my team was winning ball
and once more we were crowding on the
heels of the lions

  we met the governors for a three game
series and mopped up while the lions hit
a slump and tobogganed until only a few
points separated us i began to dream of
that contract and extra two grand and i
was pushing the boys to the limit after
another week of see-sawing buster broke


bush league strategy



loose on a rampage and won three games in
a row with his fence-busting that boy
was leading the league with the stick with
an average well above  and was getting
better every day as he kinder got used to
the boys pitching when we got back
from a heart-breaking trip on which most
of our games went into extra innings
wearing my moundsmen to a frazzle we
were in second place by a safe margin
with the lions still slumping five full
games ahead of us were the governors and
they were going strong jackson their
star twirler had the seasons record of
victories and the entire organization was
going great guns

  still playing with everything we had
the tars held their own during the next
two weeks and even gained a notch or two
on the governors with the close of the
season only two weeks away we were three
games behind the governors and we had
a series of three games with them on the
last three days the stage was all set for
buster to go down in history as an all-wool
hero

  i took buster under my wing and for the
next seven days i kept him on the lot from
eight in the morning until noon trying to
drill some of the strategy of the game
into his head if it had been anyone else
i would have worn them down until they
would have been hospital meat but that
boy was tireless he never got enough
baseball and he was willing to stay on the
lot all day if i thought it necessary but
his head was stuffed with the same material
they put in baseball bats for a month
the opposing slabmen had been playing
him feeding him wide ones and making
him reach after them or else walk him
once they got him on the bases they picked
him off with such frequency that it wor-
ried the life out of him

  we landed on the grays for a series of
three- games while the governors were
dropping one out of three to the maples
who were close down to the bottom and
we went into the last week still two games
behind the governors the maples were
on hand for the first three days and the
tars were out for blood i had been talk-
ing to them every morning and i had them
fighting mad buster led the slaughter
and drove every pitcher they had to the
showers making enough tallies in those
three days to run the score keepers dizzy
if they kept up that pace i knew theyd
make the governors look like a pair of
pink socks at a funeral kinder out of place
meanwhile the lions had gone on a bat-

ting spree and had taken two out of three
from the governors which put us on even
terms with the latter for the pennant and
my extra two grand

  thursday morning the governors landed
in town with a couple of train loads of
the faithful and a brass band they
marched out to the park that afternoon
and lined up back of their dugout it
looked like the whole city was milling
around the gates trying to get in when i
got there about one oclock that was the
first time that burg had been waked up
since the main grocery store got on fire
before prohibition

  i lined the boys up in the clubhouse anti
gave them a little talk they were geared
on high and impatient to get at it

  boys i says were going to play
straight baseball today without any of the
frills theyre warming up kopnak and
you know what hes got youve got to
him before and you can do it again to-
morrow theyll use jackson and then were
going to be up against something else but
well not cross any bridges before we get
to em today youve got to go out there
and hit em hard and often can you ck
it

  a chorus of yells greeted my speech and
i knew that game was all over but the
shouting

  kopnak was stingy with his hits and we
didnt get a man on until the fifth when
hart slipped one down the line between
first and second for a clean single duf-
fus laid down a bunt on the third base line
and hart was on second it was all set
for buster and he obliged by lifting one
into the crowds in left field good for three
bases under the ground rules i stopped
him on third base by main strength and
he scored a minute
later on an infield out
in the eighth buster
cracked one over the
fence for the circuit
and the crowd went
delirious my second
best pitcher small
held the governors
safely throughout the
game they collected nine hits but he
kept them scattered and tightened in
pinches when a bingle meant a score

  buster had a monopoly on the front page
of the newspapers and some of the boys
read it all over to him in the clubhouse the
next morning while we were getting the
kinks out and holding a skull session he
was gravely interested in it all but he
short stories



didnt offer any comment any other man
on the team would have puffed up like a
barrel of dried apples in the rain but ill
have to hand it to bus it didnt cause him
to turn a hair

  shoestring mcmahon walked in and the
boys crowded around him for a minute
my heart stood still if that boy was able
to pitch i hadnt been around to the hos-
pital for several weeks being so busy chas-
ing that pennant and i didnt know how
fast the boy was coming through but one
look at him pancaked my hopes he was
so thin he could have drunk one of guss
pink lemonades and made a thermometer
out of himself he shook hands with me
and i asks him to make a speech

  boys he starts out and there is a
choke in his voice id give all i ever ex-
pect to have to be out there today and help
you win that old flag weve been chasing
so long i couldnt stay in the hospital
with this goin on if you win today-but
there aint no if s youll do it and boys
ill be ready next year to help hold it

  the gang yelled a little and milled
around then i took the stump

  there wont be no game tomorrow i
says when we win today that ends it
but weve got to be on our toes jackson
is pitching today and you know what that
means hes the slickest bird in the league
and if we outguess him we can be plumb
proud of ourselves you fellows have
got to keep your eye on me watch me
for every play its strategy that wins
when you go up against the governors
with jackson up lovetts pitching for us
today hell put em where he wants em
to go all youve got to do is to play as i
tell you lets go

  the crowd was bigger than it had been
on the previous day there were some
wheelchairs in the overflow in right-even
the crippled were out in force old man
gries was bouncing around like a new rub-
ber ball he shook hands with me four
times that i remember of when buster
came on the field the roar that went up
must have been heard in the next county
but he was so busy trying to remember all
the things i had been telling him that he
didnt have time to pay any attention

  then the game started from the first
it was a pitchers battle with both jackson
and lovett in perfect form and control
hits were as scarce as pet skunks at a
fashion show and those two rows of goose-
eggs on the scoreboard kept lengthening
out almost all the way across twice the
hostile team got men on bases once as far

as second but lovett knew the next bat-
ters weaknesses and fed em up to him so
that hed hit em where they could be picked
up by the infield or captured in the outfield
with gallager up and a man on first and
second in the sixth inning i signaled lovett
to let him have a low curve on the outside
of the plate and at the same time i mo-
tioned kavannaugh to come over toward
first gallager their most dangerous hitter
slammed a wicked one right into kavan-
naughs hands for a double play

  buster should have had a couple of
doubles on long low liners far into the
gardens but each time the fielders were
playing back in the edge of the crowd and
had plenty of time to camp under them
in the sixth he poked a single over short
and then when i signaled a hit and run on
the second pitched ball he tore loose on
the first one and was caught standing up
at second the crowd booed him for the
first time since he came to the tars and he
came in with a surprised look on his phiz
it wouldnt do any good to bawl him out
so i said nothing

  in the eighth it began to look like the
governorsd score but with one down bus-
ter grabbed a liner about five feet over
his head and whipped it to second in time
to cut off the runner who had started at
the crack of the bat we didnt get any-
where in our half and lovett cut them
down three in a row in the first of the
ninth

came the last half with bus up with
everything primed for him to set
off the match to the fireworks and
permit me sonorously to state he did that
little thing

  the outfielders drifted back to the edge
of the crowds again and were waiting for
him when he stepped to the plate the
infield got clean back on the grass leaving
the diamond lonely as a graveyard right
there was where i got my idea for the big
strategy which was going to win the pen-
nant it was simple and with a little
luck would have made me mayor of the
burg but i had forgotten that i was
working that strategy with buster stubbs
at the bat with the whole team playing
away out i called on him to lay down a
bunt

  the first ball was wide and the second
bus laid down as neatly as eddie collins
could have placed it and was off in a long
lope for first jackson dived for it
scooped it up and threw all in the same
movement but in his hurry he overthrew
bush league strategy

first the coach sent buster on down to
second while the crowd yelled its head off
the ball hit somebodys wadded-up sweater
about twenty feet behind first and stopped
dead the right fielder who was back-
ing up the throw grabbed it and shot it
to second bus glancing over his shoul-
der saw the play and immediately forgot
all i had taught him about the hook slide
he went in on his head all doubled up and
i dont see yet how he kept from breaking
his neck

  the throw was low and arrived about
the same time bus did in the cloud of
dust i couldnt see exactly what happened
except that the umps waved bus safe and
i danced a jig around third for a minute
kavannaugh was up and i had a hunch he
would come through with a single he
had a habit of doing that thing right when
it was necessary

  but something was wrong down at sec-
ond i saw buster get up and look around
on the ground at his feet the baseman
was doing the same thing as was the um-
pire at first i thought it was the lost
ball trick to tag bus i yelled at him to sit
down on the bag and he started to obey
but suddenly he grew rigid and his jaw
dropped i wondered if he had a stroke
or something and was getting ready to
call time and see what was the matter the

baseman and the umpire were still search-
ing for the ball

suddenly bus ducked at a dead run for



third and i tried to stop him but he grin-
ned and hoofed it home as fast as he could
make it the crowd was in hysterics and
the umpires were staring at buster as if he
had gone out of his mind i hurried along
and caught up with him as he dropped into
the dugout the crowd was swarming on
the field but the ushers and a couple of
cops drove them back when i saw the
field was cleared i rushed up to bus

 what the-

  he grinned i get what you meant by
that word strategy  he said it
worked he slipped his hand down in-
side his shirt pulled the ball out and
handed it to me the umpire was stand-
ing there looking at us

  whered you get it  did you steal it 
i wanted to know

  no it got inside my shirt when i slid
i felt it wiggle

  yer out yells the umps at bus

  of course i raised a kick which brought
on a conference between the two umps and
im nineteen separate and distinct kinds
of a liar if they didnt forfeit that game to
the governors-called it a deliberate at-
tempt to steal the pennant and a dangerous
reflection on the cleanliness of the sport in
the league that decision stood although
i appealed to every known power under the
sun buster stubbs couldnt stand the
gaff and that night he disappeared to
this day i havent seen hide nor hair of
him now i ask you what chance had i
to prove it was an accident when the man
who pulled it had vanished into the tall
and uncut

  oh yes we lost the next game eight to
nothing the boys somehow couldnt
raise any pep after that great strategic play

i	quit cold beat old gries to it and re-
signed strategy huh bull luck
thats what i call it

buffalo paths

ranging in size from a foot-and-a-half wide and a few inches deep up to wide and hard-
packed roads the buffalo paths crossed and criss-crossed the prairies foothills and moun-
tains and usually led the traveler to water but at times they led him to dried ponds and he had
his labor for nothing the narrower paths were so sharply cut as to suggest the use of tools
in some places they were so numerous and intermingled as to puzzle and confuse even the
best plainsman in others they stretched away with a directness which would have been credi-
table to an engineer the paths converging from a dry plain to the ford of a river were so
worn and so deep and wide that the rain-water rushing along them cut through the hard-
packed surface and turned them into deep gullies ravines and even stream beds ever growing
deeper in some localities this started erosions of banks and bluffs which eventually carried
them away and left mires in their stead often the larger paths could be told from man-made
roads only by the tracks showing on them and early travelers often exclaimed at the excellent
selection directness and quality of these paths and from them attributed to their makers
a sagacity far beyond their mental equipment and powers-c e m

detectives of big cities including new york found dapper dan much
like an eel it never occurred to them to try ashes for slipperiness

dapper dan dalrym-

ple had been a thorn in the
side of the department so long
now that he had become a sort
of institution so much so in
fact that finally hounded from pillar to
post he had between two suns transferred
his activities and these were many and
varied from philadelphia which had been
his stamping ground for ten zestful
highly-colored years to new york and
the wider field of activity which the me-
tropolis afforded

  the police of the city of brotherly love
were not exactly in love with dapper dan
they hated him as the devil is said to hate
holy water and in passing it may be said
that between the chiefs of detectives of the
two cities following a certain sarcastic
reference on the part of gunson of the
new york bureau there had not existed
for some time now anything approaching
an entente cordiale

  for dapper dan was elusive he was
here today and gone tomorrow he had a
faculty for disappearing almost under the
noses of the laboring sleuths who in phila-
ielphia at any rate had had trouble enough
iti keeping up with his rapid fire operations
without attending to the little matter of
his apprehension and incarceration behind
iiars

  a con man who was so smooth that in
the parlance of certain newspaper repor-
ters he would have needed skid-chains to
keep his feet down long enough to stay in
one place a split second by the watch dap-
per dan on a dozen different occasions in
the past had been under lock and key-
almost but not quite at the last moment
with the grim hand of
the law upon his shoul-
der he had always
somehow squirmed free
to reappear abruptly
with a lightning quick
touch where he was
least expected with
dapper dan the faculty
had amounted almost to
genius and so far he
had yet to languish behind bars

  detective gunson of the new york bu-

reau had heard of dapper dan as was
but natural in fact he had seen him
at one time or another in the line-up at
headquarters now on a warm after-
noon of early spring patrolling his beat
along fifth avenue he had seen or
thought that he had seen for a split sec-
ond a figure that had seemed vaguely
familiar

    a man in a light tan overcoat walking
  with a peculiar lifting swagger had passed
  abruptly from the avenue into and
  through the throng of shoppers into the
  world-famous jewelry house of gutelius
  the plainclothesman out of the tail of his
  eye had seen him just long enough to
  bring from his lips the two explosive sig-
  nificant words of dapper dan

    but the throng was dense the detective
  by the time he had elbowed his way inside
  had lost the man in the light tan overcoat
  and soft shapeless hat but he was cer-
  tain that it had been dapper dan

    and then far down an aisle there rose
  all at once a murmur growing to a mutter
  and a quick frenzied shout of

    stop thief

    the detective catapulting inward like
  a football player going through a broken
  field had for a moment a glimpse of a
  light tan overcoat-it had whisked round
  the aisle corner even as he looked ahead
  of him now in the swirl and eddy of the
  milling crowd he heard that cry repeated
  from the long counter just across with a
  stream of protesting french or german
  he could not tell which

    standing not upon the order of his go-
  ing gunson by main strength had reached
  the door to see once again as he rushed
  through the doorway that light tan over-
  coat for a split second beneath the soft
  shapeless hat he had a glimpse of a dark
  mocking face then even as he sprang
  forward it was gone

   the plainclothesman however in his
 rush had reached the street corner from
 there following a moments brusque con-
 verse with the policeman on the beat he
 turned backward leaden-footed slow

    an inquiry within the shop elicited the
  information that it had been indeed dapper
  dan and this time his getaway had

iso
disappearing dalrymple

taken with it the trifling matter of a neck-
lace worth fifty thousand as it stood

  there were no two ways about it dap-
per dan on his first day in the metropolis
had scored gunson remembering that
brief ironic message to the philadelphia
police squirmed mentally while once more
upon the sidewalk he went northward
upon the way leading to the station-house
ready with his report

  it would be a report that he would take
no pleasure in making that much was
certain and then abruptly he halted
breath indrawn sharply through set teeth

  there not ten paces in advance mov-
ing carefree and at ease with his swift
silent jungle step was the man in the light
tan overcoat

  gunson made one single lurching
stride then his hand flashed out in a light-
ning stab for the others shoulder

  well well if it aint dapper dan he
was beginning now well take a little
walk-

  there came a sudden wrench a twist
and the man in the light overcoat had
turned upon him with blazing eyes the
detectives face purpled he stuttered
choked falling backward a pace his jaw
slack mouth open in an abrupt wonder and
disgust

  for the mans face as it had come level
with his own was a face that he had never
seen

ii

it was not possible for gunson to
have been mistaken he knew dap-
per dan well and unfavorably to cite
the ancient adage with a reverse twist
face to face he could not have been wrong

  having reported to his chief he made
his way out to the street and went on-
ward to walk head down forward along
the quiet street his mood was the re-
verse of pleasant

it was a quiet residential neighborhood

in the west sev-
enties and hq
had ample o p-
portunity for
reflection - had
food for
thought at any
rate for it was
past his lunch-
eon hour and he
had forgotten
all about it

 dapper dan
metropolis had



struck twelve in broad daylight and on the
avenue and-where was dapper dan

  somewhere secure doubtless laughing
in his sleeve at the boasted efficiency of the
metropolitan police for in the terse lan-
guage of gunsons superior dalrymple had
made suckers of the whole kit-and-ca-
boodle he had made them look like dum-
mies the first crack out of the box

  well it was a pretty kettle of fish and
no mistake gunson chin sunk on his
chest in his minds eye could see the head-
lines as they would appear in a little while
in the early editions

disappearing dalrymple puts it over

nabs necklace under noses of cops
police are powerless

  that would make sweet reading for the
philadelphia police it would for a fact
gunson chewing the cud of his chagrin
glanced down the street then up and upon
the instant stiffened abruptly like a pointer
at gaze

  ahead of him distant scarcely half a
block there had appeared all at once a
man walking lightfoot on the balls of his
feet-a man in a light tan overcoat and
soft shapeless hat

  the detective swore softly under his
breath quickening his pace as from the
corner of the street beyond there showed
the looming figure of the policeman on the
beat the sun winking on the brass buttons
but he was going in the same direction
his broad back vanished round the corner
even as gunson looked

  but this time there could be no mistake
for a brief instant etched against the sun-
light the detective had seen the mans
face hawklike with lowered lids it was
disappearing dalrymple and he was but
a scant half-block away

  his gait now a quick pounding run the
detective drew nearer by feet by yards
and still that tall figure in the light over-
coat held onward at a rapid walk just
ahead and perhaps ten paces beyond pur-
suer and pursued there was a huge
square-sided motor truck blocking the
sidewalk it loomed in dalrymples path
as turning his head he saw the detective
coming up

  almost at that distance gunson fancied
that he could see the sneering grin the
brief flicker of the fingers in an ironic
farewell then dalrymple had vanished be-
hind that truck just as there came a sud-
den thunder in the narrow way the de-
tective quickening his pace rounded the
corner of the truck in high his jaw slack


short stories

he stopped dead staring pop-eyed at the
long deserted street empty of all life un-
der the declining sun

  disappearing dalrymple had-disap-
peared 

iii

flush with the street here there was
an ash-hoist gunson glancing up-
ward at the building just across
gave a dry grimace of disgust and of re-
alization-and of something else so near
and yet so far and in plain sight of-
well dalrymple must be a wizard and no
mistake he turned now to the man
stolid foreign eyes lack lustre under
sleepy brows who atop the ash wagon
stared down at him face gray with dust
and sweat

  for a moment even as he harbored the
thought the detective dismissed it as ab-
surd the ash man certainly could not be
dalrymple even the disappearing one
could not have rounded the corner of that
truck disguising himself with soot and
grime which was plainly the result of many
months in the brief interval in which he
had been invisible to the pursuer at his
back but where had he gone

  seen anything of a man in a light over-
coat and soft hat asked gunson peering
upward at the ashman on the truck and
the answer when it came removed all
doubt

 no mister ay bane see nobuddy wat
you tank

  for a split second the detective had
thought to see in the sleepy-lidded eyes a
faint flicker like the sun on water but
no the fellow was plainly a stupid one
busy with his ashes he would not have no-
ticed had there been an earthquake in the
quiet street

  gunson turned snarling under his
breath a bitter brooding malediction then
at a slow dragging walk he was away
meanwhile-

iv

evening had come and the street
lamps glimmered in the quiet street
when below the level of the walk
out of that ashpit below the level of the
street there came all at once a fumbling
rustle a mutter a murmur then a thick
turgid oath

  a light danced glimmering on floor and
wall as in the reflection of its glow a
figure ash gray from head to foot
emerged crawling upon hands and knees

outward to the cellar and the comparative
cleanness of the asphalt floor

   a prodigious sneeze stifled at birth pro-
claimed that it was indeed a man but a
man whose own mother would not have
known even in the light of day

  a moment disappearing dalrymple
stood grinning in spite of his discomfort
once again he had won clear for to
gain egress from that house would be an
easy matter in the tenth of a second that
he had rounded that truck he had seen in
one flashing glance that the ashman his
back turned had been oblivious and in
that brief moment his decision had been
taken

  the hoist had been going down even
as he sprang hidden from gunsons view
by the great truck the hoist cover had
grazed his head by the proverbial eyelash
then downward into the cellar he had gone
while above him gunson raging had
turned sullenly away

   in the moment that the detective round-
ing the truck had come upon the scene the
ash hoist had been closed the truck
sidewise to the street had hidden the whole
occurrence and there had been some-
thing else in the moment that dapper dan
had literally taken the plunge his hand
reaching had opened the wagon-slide-the
chute that had been the reason of the
roar that the detective had heard-the
noise of the ashes pouring downward out
of that truck to pile in a small mountain
upon that ash hoist lid it was incon-
ceivable that beneath that dust gray heap
there could be a man

   the driver with an imagination at the
zero point had looked startled then with
an oath had checked that downpour but
the thing was done

   and now walking forward softly on the
balls of his feet dapper dan-a dapper
dan now only in name indeed-waited a
moment listening holding his breath he
had composed himself to wait there in the
darkness until the chance that he might be
discovered would be reduced to a mini-
mum and glanc-
ing at the radium
dial of his watch
he saw that it was
late

   there was a spiral iron stairway just
across from him he went up it now
pocketing his flash feeling ahead of him
for the handle of a door which presently
turning it without sound he opened inch
by careful inch

  he found himself in thick darkness a
disappearing dalrymple



darkness that was musty like a vault
feeling before him with his finger tips
he was aware that he was in a closet or
rather a small room through the door of
which he could hear merely the ticking of
a clock

  applying his eye to the keyhole he could
see nothing plainly the room beyond was
in darkness too after a moment turning
the doorknob with careful fingers he felt
rather than saw that he was in a wide high
ceilinged chamber empty as he was cer-
tain  there was no one there but he must
be careful possibly the household was
not yet asleep for the night it would not
do to blunder

  and then a thin smile edged his lips a
smile of calculation of elation and of a
sudden swift tigerish resolve he was
here inside the house presumably it was
the house of a substantial citizen there
would be pickings here for him who could
take them and that would be duck soup
for dapper dan

  making the circle of the room his hand
in the darkness suddenly touched a some-
thing cold and hard-a glass door swing-
ing open which bespoke a cabinet of some
sort then his swift exploring fingers
outspread before him he froze abruptly
rigid where he stood

 guns

  that was what he had touched there in
the darkness guns a regular arsenal of
them he had stumbled upon the gun-
room of a sportsman and that meant in
this neighborhood and street the establish-
ment of a millionaire at the very least

  by now he had gotten some of the ashes
from his face fastidious as always he
thought ruefully of his new exquisitely
tailored morning suit the very latest
wrinkle indeed since by now it was all
wrinkles ingrained with ash

 but he would make somebody pay for
that

 going forward carefully with the
stealth and caution of an indian he had
made the circuit of the room halting at
last at a doorway that opened under his
hand admitting him to a smaller room in
which as he could feel there were a desk
and chairs

  now for the first time he produced his
pocket flash to find that he was in a sort
of office as he could see furnished with a
spartan simplicity-for a millionaire

  but millionaires many of them were
like that and this man a sportsman would
scarcely furnish an office with sybaritic

ease but the desk was heavy substan-
 tial his feet sank in the thick pile of a rug
that was daghestan at the very least

   and it was then that snapping on the
wall switch he recoiled his hand went
out and again black darkness enveloped
him with the dousing of the light

   for beyond that office he had heard on
 a sudden the murmur of voices muffled
 as through many thicknesses of walls

v

crouching there in the thick
darkness he could hear those voices
coming nearer a late party pos-
sibly and could they have seen the light
shining through that door

   dapper dan resisting an impulse to re-
 turn backward the way which he had come
 of a sudden thought better of it as close at
 hand he heard the voices high-pitched
 now and the quick pad-pad of running
 feet

   his- hand reaching behind him for the
 door by which he had made entry turned
 the knob exerted a quick silent pressure
 but the door was fast he was locked in

   fool that he had been not to have made
 certain of that spring lock but now it
 was too late

   lip lifting from his white even teeth
 as a trapped animal grins at the hunters
 his hand in a quick stab for his automatic
 came away as the outer door burst open
 with a slattering crash he was conscious
 of a sudden blaze of light faces dim fin-
 ures crowding close with of a sudden a
 great voice roaring in the narrow room

  dapper dan welcome to our city

well what do you know
about that

  as in a mist he saw
the face of gunson be-
hind it others their
laughter echoed in a
roaring chorus as like a
lance of light the reali-
zation of the truth came
to him at the sight of
gunson and the rest

  mouth open he slumped backward
against the wall

   he was in the police-station by night
 perhaps the green lights might have
 warned but in the bright sunlight and at
 the quick urge of his desperate need he
 had not known

   disappearing dalrymple had broken into
 jail

and loyalty fear and courage-and the tests that are to try the souls

of those whose destiny calls them to the land of frost and gold

he threw back his head and
howled eerily his muzzle
lifted to the stars and the most
mournful sound known to man
poured from his throat and was
echoed and reechoed by the hooded cedars
and the rocks about him he could not
have told you why he howled dogs are
not prone to introspection but he knew
that his master who should be in the cabin
yonder would never come out again he
knew that the dying wisps of smoke from
the chimney would never billow out in
thick gray clouds again and he knew
that the other man-who had come out so
hastily and gone swinging down the river
trail-would never-never return

  cheechako was chained it had origin-
ally been a mark of disgrace an unbearable
humiliation to a malamute pup but he did
not mind it any longer his master had
made sleeping quarters for him that were
vastly warmer than a snow-bed even in
the coldest weather and cheechako whole-
heartedly approved he was comfortable
he was fed and carson released him now
and then to stretch his legs and swore
at him affectionately from time to time
and no reasonable dog will demand any
more or so cheechako viewed it anyhow

  but now his muzzle tilted up his eyes
half-closed and from his throat those deso-
late and despairing howls poured forth
a-a-o-oooo-e-e a-a-o-oooo-e-e they
were a dirge and a lament they were
sounds of grief and they were noises of
despair cheechako could not explain
their meaning at all but when a man dies
they spring full-bodied from that mans
dogs throat

  the hooded cedars watched and echoed
back the sound the rocks about him
watched and gave tongue stilly in a faint
reflection of his sorrow the river lis-
tened and babbled absently of sympathy
and rippled on the river has seen too
many men die to be disturbed the wilds
listened for many miles around the de-
spairing grief-stricken howling reached
to tree and forest and hill and valley the
thin and muted wailing bore its message
only the cabin seemed indifferent though
the tragedy was within it somewhere
within the four log walls carson lay
sprawled out cheechako knew that he
was dead without knowing how he knew
there had been a shot later the other
man had come out hastily with a pack on
his back he had taken the river trail
and disappeared

  and long into the night until the pale
moonlight faded and died cheechako

howled his sorrow for a thing he did not

understand o f
his own predica-
ment the dog had
yet no knowledge
it was natural to
be chained food
was brought when
one was chained
that there was
now no one to
bring him food
that no one was
likely to come and that the most pertina-
cious of puppy teeth could not work
through the chain that bound him these
things did not disturb him his head
thrown back his eyes half-closed he
howled in an ecstasy of grief

  and while he gave vent to his sorrow in
the immemorable tradition of his race a
faint rumbling set up afar off in the wilds
it was hardly more than a murmur and
maybe it was the wind among the trees
maybe it was a minor landslide in the hills
not so many miles away-a few hundred
tons of earth and stone that plunged down-
ward when the thaw of spring released its
keystone maybe it was any one of any
number of things even a giant spruce tree
crashing thunderously to the ground but
it lasted a little too long for any such sim-
ple explanation if one were inclined to
be fanciful one would say it was the mill
of one of the forest gods grinding the
grist of mens destinies and set going now
by the murder of which cheechako howled

  certainly many unrelated things began
to happen which bore obscurely upon that
killing the man who had fled down-river
reflected on his cleverness and grinned to
himself he opened thick sausage-like
bags and ran his fingers through shining
yellow dust remembering his security
against detection or punishment he
laughed cacklingly

  and very far away-away down in seat-
tle-bob holliday found courage to ask a
girl to marry him and promised to go back
to alaska only long enough to gather to-
gether what capital he had accumulated
when they would be married most of
what he owned he told her was in a placer
claim that he and sam carson worked to-
gether he would sell out to sam and re-
turn but he would not take her back to
the hardships he had endured he was
filled with a fierce desire to shield and pro-
tect her that meant money outside of
course and he started north eagerly for
the results of many years suffering and

work which sam carson was guarding
for him

  and again in a dingy small building a
sleepy mail clerk discovered a letter that
had slipped behind account-books and been
hidden for months on end he canceled
its stamp and dropped it into a mail bag
to go to its proper destination

 then the rumbling murmur which
might have been the mill of a forest god
off in the wilds stopped abruptly the
grist had had its first grinding

  but the mill was not put away oh
no cheechako howled on until the moon-
light paled and day came again and the
letter that had lain so long was dropped
into a canoe and floated down to the coast
in charge of a half-breed paddleman and
bob holliday sped north for alaska and
his partner sam carson who guarded a
small fortune that holliday had earned in
sweat and agony and fierce battle with the
wilds and winter snows holliday was
very happy the money his partner held
for him would mean comforts and even
luxuries for the girl he loved

  the mill of the forest god was simply
laid aside for a little while they grind
not slowly-these mills of the gods-but
very swiftly more swiftly than the grist
can come to their grinding stones now
and then they are forced to wait for more
but everything upon the earth comes to
them some time high ambitions and
most base desires and womens laughter
and red blood gushing and all hopes and
fears and lusts and terrors together disap-
pear between the millstones and come out
transformed into the product that the gods
desire

  the mill was merely waiting

  ii

the place had that indefinable air of
desertion that comes upon a wilder-
ness cabin in such an amazingly
short time the wood pile huge yet
clearly but the remnant of a winters sup-
ply had not yet sprouted any of the mosses
and lichens that multiply on dead wood in
the short alaskan summer the axe
even was leaned against the door chips
still rested on blades of the quickly-grow-
ing grass that comes before the snow has
vanished a pipe rested on a bench be-
fore the house but the place was de
serted the feel of emptiness was in the
air

  holliday had drawn in his breath for a -
shout to announce his coming when the
curious desolation all about struck home


	short stories

it was almost like a blow every sign
and symbol of occupancy every possible
indication that the place was what it
seemed to be-the winter quarters of an

old-timer thriftily remaining near his
claim and then suddenly the feeling of
emptiness that was like death

  he disembarked in silence his forehead
creased in a quick and puzzled frown he
was walking swiftly when he climbed the
bluff glancing sharply here and there a
sudden cold apprehension made him hesi-
tate then he shook himself impatiently
and moved more quickly still

  within ten yards of the door he stopped
stock-still and then he fairly rushed for
the cabin and plunged within
i it was a longtime later that he came out
he was very pale and looked like a man
who has been shaken to the core he was
swearing brokenly then he made him-
self stop and sit down with shaking fin-
gers he filled his pipe and lighted it

  in his bunk he said evenly to the uni-
verse a bullet through his head no
sign of a fight it isnt credible-but
there isnt a sign of any dust or any sup-
plies and somebody else had been bunking
in there with him murder of course

  he smoked presently he got up and
found a path which he followed at its
end he saw what he was looking for he
poked about the cradle there and expertly
fingered the heap of gravel that had been
thawed and dug out to be washed when
summer came again

  hed cleaned up he said evenly he
must have had a lot of dust and the man
with him knew it ive got to find that
man

  his hands clenched and unclenched as
he went back toward the cabin then he
calmed himself again his eyes searched
for a suitable spot for the thing he had to
do

  and then quite suddenly my god
said holliday

  it was cheechako who had dragged

himself to the limit of his chain and with
his last atom of strength managed to whim-
per faintly cheechako was not pretty to
look at it had been a very long time
since the night that he howled to the stars
of his grief for the man who was dead
and he had been chained fast cheechako
was alive and that was all

  he lay on the ground looking up with
agonized pitiful eyes holliday stared
down at him and reached for his gun in
sheer mercy then his eyes hardened

  no-o-o i guess not youll be sams
dog youll have to stay alive a while yet
maybe you can pick out his murderer for
me

  he unbuckled the collar that cheecha-
kos most frenzied efforts had not enabled
him to reach and took the mass of skin
and boniness beneath down toward his
canoe with a face like stone he tended
cheechako with infinite gentleness

  and that night he left cheechako wrap-
ped up in his own blankets while he carved
deeply upon a crudely fashioned wooden
cross his expression frightened chee-
chako a little but the dog lay huddled in
the blankets and gazed at him hungrily
cheechako hoped desperately that this man
would be his master hereafter only he
also hoped desperately that he would never
never use a chain

ill

cheechako learned much and
forgot a little in the weeks that fol-
lowed when he could stand on
his wabbling paws holliday took him off
invalids diet and fed him more naturally
canine dishes-the perpetual dried or
frozen fish of the dog-teams for instance
cheechako wolfed it as he wolfed every-
thing else and in that connection learned
a lesson once in his eagerness he leaped
up to snatch it from hollidays hand his
snapping teeth closed on empty air and
he was soundly thrashed for the effort
later he learned not to snarl or snap if his
food was taken squarely from between his
teeth when he had mastered that he
was tamed he understood that he was
not to try to bite holliday under any cir-
cumstances whatever and when he had
mastered the idea he was almost pitifully
anxious to prove his loyalty to holliday
the only thing was that in learning that
he got it into his head that he was not to
snarl at or try to sink his teeth in any man

  that was possibly why holliday was
disappointed when he took the dog grimly
downstream and made his inquiries as to

time of carsons death but enough had
trapped or wintered inland near their
claims to make the absence of any explana-
tion at all no proof of guilt that was
where cheechako was to come in

  always before his grim interrogation
was over holliday unobtrusively allowed
cheechako to draw near cheechako had
known the man who had been with carson
when he was murdered holliday watched
him closely he would sniff at the man
glance up at his master and wag his tail
placatingly holliday watched for some
sign of recognition cheechako grew to
consider it a part of the greeting of every
man his master met that was the dif-
ference between them cheechako simply
did not understand he had already for-
gotten a great deal of what had happened
to him and holliday was his master now
carson was a dim and misty figure of the
past

  by the time holliday actually came upon
the man of whom he was in search chee-
chako considered the little ceremony a part
of the scheme of things not to be deviated
from

  they found him camping alone after
trailing him for two days

  howdy said he looking up from his
fire with its sizzling pan of beans and ba-
con

  howdy said holliday curtly you
came down-river about a month ago

  the man bent forward over his fire
cheechako watching patiently saw his
whole figure stiffen

  i come down yes said the camper
stirring his beans sweat came out on his
forehead but he made no movement to-
ward a weapon he was not the sort to
fight anything out

  know sam carson demanded holli-
day

  hm- said the camper seems like
i knew him once in nome

  his eyes rested on cheechako and
flicked away cheechako knew that he
was recognized and he wagged his tail ten-
tatively but he had changed allegiance
now he waited to see what holliday
would do

  stop at his cabin demanded holliday
grimly

  nope said the camper whats
up

  pup said holliday

  this was cheechakos cue holliday
did not know what carson had called him
and pup had been a substitute know-
ing then what holliday expected of him
and anxious to do nothing of which his
master would not approve cheechako

went forward
and sniffed po-
litely at the
mans legs he
rather expected
some sign of
r e c o g n i-
tion when it
came cheecha-
ko would re-
spond as cor-
dially as was consonant in a dog who be-
longed to someone else but the man who
had stayed with carson made no move
whatever though his smell to cheechako
was the smell of a thing in deadly fear

  cheechako glanced up at holliday and
wagged his tail placatingly

  he dont seem to know you said hol-
liday grimly i guess you didnt

  they camped with the stranger then
and he told holliday that his name was
dugan and that he was a placer man and
told stories at which holliday unbent
enough to smile faintly

  holliday was grim and silent these days
because he had a man-hunt on his hands
and the gold dust that was to have made a
certain girl happy had been stolen by the
murderer of his friend he listened ab-
stractedly to dugans jests but mostly he
brooded over the death of his friend and
his own hopes in the same instant

  cheechako lay at the edge of the circle
of firelight and watched the two men
mostly he watched holliday because hol-
liday was his master but often his eyes
dwelt puzzledly on dugan he knew du-
gan and dugan knew him vaguely a
dim remembrance arose of dugan in car-
sons cabin feeding him a sweet and
pleasant-tasting liquid out of a bottle while
he laughed uproariously yes cheecha-
ko remembered it distinctly he won-
dered if dugan had any more of that
pleasant stuff

  once he rose and started forward ten-
tatively dugan had been smelling quite
normally human but as cheechako drew
near him he again smelled like something
that is afraid it puzzled cheechako he
sniffed and would have gone nearer but
short stories



first of course he looked at holliday and
holliday merely glanced at him and did
not notice cheechako was used to such
ignoring he wagged his tail a little and
went back outside the firelight his mas-
ter did not want him near

  but later that night when the two men
lay rolled in their blankets in the smoke of
the smudge fire cheechako went thought-
fully forward again he began to nudge
dugans kit with his nose there might
be some of that sweet-tasting liquid

  holliday awoke and sat up with a start
the other man had not gone to sleep

  what the hells your dog doing in my
kit he demanded hysterically

  well see said holliday his voice
had a curious edge to it

  cheechako sniffed about there was
something there that had a familiar odor
he drew in his breath in a long and luxu-
rious smell then he began to scratch
busily

  ill take a look at that said holliday
grimly

  he went to where cheechako scratched
while dugan moved cautiously among his
blankets the firelight glinted momentar-
ily on polished metal among the coverings
the metal thing was pointed at hollidays
back though it trembled slightly

  holliday looked up

  your bacon he said his tone altered
get out he ordered cheechako

  cheechako went away after wagging his
tail placatingly presently he curled up
and slept fitfully the odor he had sniffed
permeating all his dreams the odor was
that of carson and cheechako dreamed
of times in the cabin when dugan was
there holliday too composed himself to
slumber but dugan lay awake and shiv-
ered some of carsons possessions were
in the kit cheechako had nosed at and
though he had had his revolver on holli-
day dugan was by no means sure he could
have summoned the nerve to kill him he
had killed carson in a fashion peculiarly
his own which did not require that he dis-
charge the weapon himself but now he
debated in a panicky fear if he had not bet-
ter shoot holliday sleeping it would be
dangerous down here not like the hills at
all but it might be best if that damned
dog kept sniffing around-

  the next morning he cursed in a species
of hysterical relief when he saw cheechako
trotting soberly away behind his master
cheechako wagged his tail politely in part-
ing he did not understand why dugan
had feigned not to remember him now

they were going to find another man and
holliday would expect him to sniff that
mans legs and look up and wag his tail
it was a ceremony that was part of the
scheme of things cheechako simply re-
membered dugan as a man who had stayed
a long time with carson in the cabin up-
river and had fed him sweet liquid out of
a bottle and now smelled as if he were
afraid

  but holliday of course did not know
that otherwise he would have been
burying dugan by this time with a grimly
satisfied look upon his face

iv

far off in the wilderness where the
cedars meditated beside a deserted
cabin a faint rumbling murmur set
up again of course it might have been
the wind in the trees or a minor landslide
in the hills not many miles away or even a
giant spruce tree crashing thunderously to
the earth but it lasted just a bit too long
for such a simple explanation to a fanci-
ful hearer it might have sounded as if the
mill of the forest god were grinding its
grist again

  and just as such an idea would demand
many unrelated things began to happen
which bore obscurely upon the murder of a
man now buried deeply beneath a deeply-
carved wooden cross

  holliday for instance received two let-
ters one was from the girl who loved
him one was from the dead man stained
and draggled with long journeying and
much forwarding and months on its
travels the letter from the girl told him
pitifully that she loved him and wanted to
be near him and offered to come and share
any trial or hardship rather than endure the
numbing pain of separation holliday of
course knew better
than to take her at her
word

  the other letter
was very short

dear bob

  im sending this
down by a chillicoot
buck what stopped to
ask for some matches
the claim is proving up kind of a bonanza
because i already took out near twenty
thousand in dust which makes a damn big
poke for you with what you got me to keep
for you you better look out or ill steal
it ha ha

  i got me a nezv dog that i call cheecha-
grist



ko hes a pretty good dog an i got a
feller to help me out until you come back
an hes taut the pup to drink molasses
out of a bottle you out to see it

  well no more until next time yrs

                       sam

 and the man who had come down the
river trail and left cheechako chained to
starve these many long moons past he
found himself growing short of cash and
lacking an easier way to recoup his for-
tunes decided to do some placer work him-
self when he worked with sam carson
he had marked down a likely spot but did
not trouble to work it because he could at-
tain to wealth so much more simply just
a bullet that he need not even fire himself
he took canoe and went paddling up the
river having a winters supplies bundled
up in the bow

  then the mill stopped again and again
for lack of grist to grind doubtless the
forest god to whom it belonged went on
about his other affairs

v

cheechako slept within the cabin
that winter stretched out before the
fire and soaking the heat into his
body with the luxurious enjoyment that
only a dog can compass there was no
need for the discipline that before had
made his chaining necessary hollidays
training had had better results than car-
sons cheechako was a well-mannered
dog now who listened soberly when holli-
day talked to him

  and holliday talked often loneliness
in the wilds is quite different from loneli-
ness anywhere else with the snow piled
in monster drifts about the cabin so that
there was an actual tunnel a good part of
the way from the door to the wood-pile he
was utterly isolated from the world he
had to talk he told cheechako confiden-
tially just what the girl outside meant to
him he would not have said it to any
living man but the dog listened soberly
sometimes holliday grew morose some-
times he called himself a fool for not
bringing her with him-and then gave
thanks that he did not and he had mo-
ments of passionate jealousy and doubt
wondering if she were waiting for him and
believing in him through all the months
when no word from either could reach the
other

  he read her last letter into tiny frag-
ments long after he could recite it word
for word he read strange meanings into

it as that she began to feel her loyalty
wavering and in honesty wished to place it
beyond recall and then he read them out
again and was bitterly ashamed that such
things had entered his mind at all all
this was during the days of storm when
he could not even build monster fires and
thaw out gravel to be shifted where the
first waters of spring would wash out its
infinitesimal proportion of gold for him

  but dugan appeared at the cabin in
december

  he came on snowshoes and had con-
quered his first surprise before he shouted
outside the cabin door dugan had come
over in hopes of finding some stray read-
ing-matter anything to break the mon-
otony of his own cabin some four miles or
more away the smoke warned him that
someone was within and no more than a
flicker of his eyelids expressed surprise
that holliday was the occupant

  holliday greeted him with a feverish cor-
diality pressed tobacco upon him bade
him remain and eat presented cheechako
and they talked interminably dugan was
jollity itself he was soon assured that
holliday had no suspicion of him he
had left no clue after the murder and
cheechako-who might have gamboled
about him-had been trained by holliday
into the perfection of canine manners
cheechako remembered yes but he did not
associate dugan with the death of his
former master and in any event he was
a dog and there was but one master in the
world for him injuries done to a past
owner would not arouse cheechako now
though he would fight to the last drop of
his blood for holliday dugan had every
reason in the world to feel secure

  he was secure in his gratitude for
having someone to talk to holliday would
have welcomed the devil himself when
dugan finally left for his own cabin holli-
day was more nearly normal than for
months

  and it may be that dugans presence
kept holliday sane that winter he was
surely used to loneliness but no such lone-
liness as possessed him now no man is
lonely who can keep his brain busy with
the things of the moment and the place he
is in but holliday could not do that a
picture of the girl who waited for him
was always at hand his presence and
his desperate work was due to her he
could not help thinking and dreaming of
her and that thinking and dreaming made
the solitude into a corroding horror

  dugan changed all that he was some-
io

short stories

one to talk to holliday even told him
about the girl he talked for hours about
her while cheechako lay at one side of
the cabin floor and watched gravely his
ears alert and his eyes somber often he
watched dugan and vague memories crept
disturbingly about his mind here in this
same cabin-

  dugan knew about the murder too how
holliday had come joyously to the cabin
-and found his best friend murdered and
his happiness destroyed in the one instant
sam carson had been the keeper of most
of hollidays possessions and they had
been stolen by the murderer

  it was probably his own feigned sym-
pathy and secret sardonic amusement that
suggested a duplication of his former feat
to dugan dugans own claim was rich
-how rich he could not tell until spring
but hollidays claim was little worse car-
son had skimmed the cream but the rest
was worth taking if it could be done with-
out risk

  and dugan who had not nerve enough
to shoot a man in cold blood and was too
cowardly to pick a fight grinned obscurely
to himself he fingered his own pokes
which would be bulging when spring came
he thought of hollidays and then he
began to whittle out a little contrivance of
wood and leathern thongs which looked
very much like a trap but was much more
deadly it was a clever little idea of his
own perfectly safe and absolutely no
risk suddenly he stooped and listened
it seemed as if some noise to which his
ears were unconsciously attuned had sud-
denly ceased

  maybe the mill had stopped again

vi

  and then spring came from the
trees came cracklings as their coat-
x aings of sleet and solidified snow
were stripped off and fell melting to the
earth below from the river came minor
rumblings as the thawed streams of the
mountains poured their waters into it and
its surface ice grown thinner cracked
across and spun downstream in crumbling
icepans toward the sea the rocks from
hooded things in dazzling cerements
peered out naked and glistening like new-
born seals at the world that was stirring
for its feverish growth of summer the
spruce buds swelled to bursting slowly
dwindling patches of snow disclosed in-
congruously green grass prematurely
sprouted and the wild things seemed to
awake bull caribou roared their chal-

lenges in the indefinite distance foxes
moved about keen and joyously savage
no longer hampered by the snow now
and then the winters windrift above some
hidden hollow stirred and a peevish bear
emerged from his long sleep sleepily fe-
rocious

  and holliday worked like a madman
all day long he shoveled his gravel and dirt
into the cradle through which a small
stream ran after the first few days he
sang it might be that he would not have
a sum that would satisfy him but he would
squander some of it and see the girl who
loved him he would see her and speak
to her again it was no wonder that he
sang

  and dugan he worked too and his
eyes glistened at the size of his clean-ups
he filled one poke then another and still
another as time went on but dugan
would never be satisfied with what was his
own he went over to hollidays cabin
now and then and listened while holliday
told him excitedly of the miracle that
would happen he was going outside
in a little while longer he would see the
girl

  he told the whole course of his prog-
ress to the man who had murdered his
friend while cheechako sat between his
feet and regarded dugan speculatively
cheechako could not understand why du-
gan so consistently ignored him it
seemed illogical to the dog because he re-
membered that in this same cabin-

  and at last holliday came back from
the cradle singing at the top of his voice

cheechako had
caught some of
his festive
spirit and
danced clums-
ily about him
dugan was sit-
t i ng on the
bench before
the cabin and
his eyelids
flickered when
holliday came into view

  im through shouted holliday at
sight of his visitor dugan im through
im going down-river in the morning with
a fat poke in my pack to see the most won-
derful girl in the world

  dugan grinned he had been at the
cabin for some little time and there was a
surprise he had prepared for holliday in-
side it was the same surprise he had
prepared for carson
grist

  im going down tomorrow myself he
said closed up my shack and quit my
workings

  well celebrate said holliday exu-
berantly man im going outside to

the most wonderful-

  cheechako sniffed the air in the cabin
dugan did not smell normally human he
smelled as if he were afraid and yet he
was grinning and cracking jokes as if he
shared in hollidays uproarious happiness

  cheechako continued to be puzzled and
to grow more puzzled two or three
times he cocked up his ears as if listening
to a faint rumbling murmur far off in the
wilds which might have been anything-
even the mill of a forest god grinding the
grist of mens destinies but mostly he
watched the two men

  dugan produced a bottle long hoarded
but holliday would not touch it he
wanted to stay awake he said that no atom
of his wonderful good luck should go un-
tasted to the full he would be starting
downstream at daybreak and dugan
grinned and drank himself

  holliday began to cook a festive meal
the smells were savory and delicious but
cheechakos nose suddenly attracted him
to an unusual spot he went tentatively
toward hollidays bunk being a well-
mannered dog he knew he should never
climb upon his masters bed but something
drew him there irresistibly he sniffed
and dugans smell was suddenly that of a
thing in deadly fear cheechako turned
his head and regarded him puzzledly du-
gans scent was on his masters blankets
too and dugan had no business to be
there cheechako sniffed bewildered

this other odor-

  theres just one thing said holliday
with a sudden wistful gravity old
sams dead i told you how he was mur-
dered i wish-well i wish he was go-
ing outside with me

  the faint rumbling outside that sounded
like millstones grinding grew suddenly
loud and harsh as if the stones were crum-
bling up the last stray grains that had been
fed to them cheechako cocked his ears
but that was only a noise there was a
queer smell on his masters bunk he
heaved up his forepaws to sniff it more
nearly

  cheechako snapped dugan dugan
had gone suddenly pale and more than
ever he had the smell of fear about
him

  holliday lifted his head and a curious
expression came upon his face dugan
cn

went over and took cheechako by the col-
lar

  shedding fleas on your bunk he said
to holliday grinning but he ought to
share in the celebration too got any mo-
lasses 

  he knew of course he reached up
and took down the bottle of syrup holliday
had saved as a supreme luxury

  taught a dog to do this once grinned
dugan here you cheechako open
your mouth

  cheechako sniffed at his leg then he
saw the bottle his eyes danced dugan
had remembered at last he jumped up
to lick eagerly

  ho roared dugan as cheechako
struggled frantically to coax out the
sticky sweet stuff faster than it would
flow i knew youd like it watch him
holliday

  holliday straightened up

  youve never heard me call that dog
cheechako  he said queerly ive al-
ways called him pup the only other
man whod know his name would be sam
carson and- hollidays voice changed
swiftly-and the man who killed him
and that trick- by god youre sam
carsons murderer

 his revolver flashed out dugan
gasped the bottle fell to the floor and
cheechako lapped eagerly at its exuding
contents

  you shot him from behind said holli-
day savagely with your gun not a foot
from his head get out that gun now
dugan i give you just two seconds

  dugans teeth chattered his eyes
darted despairingly to the bunk holli-
days face was like stone there was no
faintest trace of mercy in it with a sud-
den squeal like that of a cornered rat du-
gan rushed for him

  and hollidays revolver was out and in
his hand but dugans open-handed attack
brought an instinctive response in kind
his free fist shot out in a terrific blow
it caught dugan squarely between the
eyes and hurled him backward he stag-
gered and his foot crushed cheechakos
paw the dog leaped up with a yelp and
bared teeth and his movement was enough
to upset dugans balance completely he
toppled backward and a sudden terrible
scream filled all the cabin

  he fell against the bunk and his arms
clutched wildly while his face showed only
frozen horror then he crashed down on
the blankets

  and there was a bellowing roar and a


short stories

hurst of smoke from the bunk dugan
did not even shudder he lay quite still
presently a sullen little drip-drip-drip
sounded on the floor

  holliday bent over and pawed among the
blankets he brought out a curious little
contrivance very much like a trap it was
a board with a revolver tied to it and a
thong so arranged that pressure on the
thong would discharge the revolver into
the source of the pressure

  cheechako sniffed at it it was the
source of the peculiar odor he had noted
in his masters bunk he wagged his tail
placatingly and looked up at holliday

  right where my head would have
gone said holliday shuddering a little

in spite of him-
self when i
lay down to
sleep and he
was going t o
stay here over-
night i see
how he killed
carson now
pfaugh

 sick with
disgust and a little shaken he flung down
the board

  holliday did not go down-river at day-
break it was nearer noon when he

started and instead of one deeply-carved
cross in the ground about the cabin there
were two one read

sam carson
murdered

june  -

  and the other

his murderer

june  -

                                          -ft

  holliday paddled down the river with
cheechako in the bow of his canoe looking
with bright and curious eyes at all that
was to be seen holliday had the gold
that he had washed out himself during the
winter he had besides gold taken from
dugans pokes to the amount that dugan
had stolen the surplus he had scat-
tered in the river he did not want it
he was going outside to the girl who had
waited for him

  and the mill  oh the mill had ground
up all its grist it stopped until one day
a half-breed killed a white man in some
dispute over an indian woman and the
echo of the shot traveled thinly over the
wilds and then a faint rumbling mur-
mur set up which might of course have
been the wind in the trees or a landslide
in the hills not so very far away but
equally of course it might not

mutiny at five bells

at sea each day is divided into four-hour watches commencing at midnight the ships
bell strikes each half-hour eight  bells  to the watch at twelve-thirty am  one bell 
is struck at one oclock two bells-and so until four oclock brings eight bells the
watch between four pm and eight pm is further divided into those famed institutions coming
from time immemorial and that are so puzzling to landsmen-the first and second dog-
watches

     in the beginning tradition has it the universal system of bell-striking included eight bells
for this period-four pm to eight pm-as for any other in the american navy this is so
to-day but not in the english nor in its imitator the japanese for says tradition once a
mutiny was planned upon a british man-o-war in the south seaswith the following results

    one of the conspirators weakened and disclosed the plan to an officer he said that the
crew upon the appointed day at five bells of the second dog-watch would mutiny warned
the captain hurried away a junior officer to ask aid of the nearest naval vessel but assistance
might not come in time autocrat of the quarterdeck a british commander might hasten this
detail of ship-work delay that one but the march of the hours was beyond even his hand

    however he was a resourceful man a natural psychologist the mutineers-to-be waited
light bells of the appointed day-four oclock the  afternoon-watch  was ended four-
thirty one bell of the first dog-watch so to four bells tension increased for mutiny carries
the death-penalty six-thirty the men crouched as the bell struck-struck one bell only
once it clanged with this inexplicable shattering of immemorial custom the crew fell
almost into panic

    there was no mutiny for none knew whom to trust what to expect seven oclock which
by immutable custom must be six bells was two bells seven-thirty three bells eight oclock
four bells then eight-thirty and it was one bell as it always had been aid came in time
thanks to the commanders device and so tradition says this improvised scheme of beu-
strildng during the dog-watches became the universal british system as it is to-day

   blue men etc

     even a detective on a holiday may join the mad masquers of new
     orleans at carnival time yet even there mystery and tragedy may
     haunt his hours of playtime-and no man may escape his destiny

with a little sigh of satisfac-
tion clinton braithwait
leaned back as far as he could
without losing his precarious
balance and squinted hap-
pily at the study of the picturesque court-
yard his last brush stroke had completed
then his glance lifted from the picture and
roved over the scene it portrayed-rose-
tinted walls covered with fig vine bal-
conies blue and green now faded to ex-
quisitely tender tones butter-colored oil
jars dripping clusters of purple flowers
a banana tree and two oleanders trench-
antly green against the low open pat-
terned brick wall at the far end of the
garden where presided a gaudy madonna
in a niche above a gurgling fountain
beautiful peaceful fragrant

  the peculiar brooding charm that is
new orleans the new orleans of the
vieux carre-the old french and spanish
quarter-permeated this the home of
mesdemoiselles bebe and roxanne du-
montel the artist turned quickly at the
sound of footsteps under the echoing arch
behind him that opened on the street
there approached a handsome middle-aged
citizen of new orleans slender quick of
movement mobile of countenance

  hello said the newcomer with hardly

a trace of french accent how did you
manage it

  manage what thiery said braith-
wait grinning a welcome

  to get mile bebes permission to paint
this courtyard shes sicked the dog on
more artists than you can count for daring
so much as to shoot a covetous glance at
her pet banana tree you must have hyp-
notized her roxanne she is amiable but
bebe-oh la la

  braithwait removed the canvas set it
against the wall and proceeded to unlimber
the collapsible easel

  vamped the dog first and then an ex-
traordinary lady whether she is bebe or
roxanne i havent the honor of knowing
but shes sixty and dresses in sprigged
muslin

  thats bebe right enough roxanne
is the elder but she looks ten years
younger-fact is poor mile bebe isnt
more than thirty-five if shes that hers
is a queer story and a sad one

  gaston thiery started guiltily as the
creaking of a board and the sweep of a
raised venetian blind warned them of the
approach of the subject of their talk

  bon jour mamselle called thiery
advancing quickly into the center of the
garden i see you have raised the em-

bargo in favor of my friend monsieur
braithwait be careful mademoiselle he
is a dangerous charmer

  the woman a miniature creature smiled
down upon her visitors and leaned her
crossed arms on the balcony rail what
would you  she asked with the tiniest of
tiny shrugs he comes in your friend
he implores he cajoles i am not of stone
if it were not for my fiance i might be
foolish-but as it is i feel safe enough to
give him the permission she had the
dried look of a withered rosebud her small
features were finely wrinkled as if a cob-
web had been laid over them her large
heavily pouched black eyes were feverishly
bright her voice drawling in her soft
creole speech had withal a curious sharp-
ness the pitch of strained nerves

  braithwait joined his friend under the
balcony i am very grateful i assure
you mademoiselle and i shall avail myself
often of the privilege you were so gracious
to give there are a dozen angles of your
charming garden every one an inspira-
tion

  of a surety come when you wish-
ah roxanne is calling me bon jour
messieurs she waved a blue-veined
hand and hurried into the house

 my compliments-a complete con-
quest laughed thiery are your la-
bors ended then come with me to the
guides and we will lunch

  hraithwait nodded agreement gathered
his paraphernalia and followed his friend
out into the sun-drenched street

her fiance he said in a puzzled tone
is that dear little old thing engaged
thats part of the story said thiery
wait till we are settled with a table be-
tween us and ill tell you the whole thing

its worth listening to youd never
guess for instance that that piece of dres-
den china had been in jail now would
you 

  i wouldnt and i dont said braithwait
flatly ive been a detective long enough
to know criminal earmarks when i see
them that woman is as innocent as a
child-id bet on it

  and keep your money gaston agreed
she is innocent and a child but-here we
are ill order because i know what and
how and then ill relieve your curiosity
he summoned a waiter held a confidential
conversation and having arranged things
to his satisfaction slumped into his chair
and leaned across the table

  this all happened about fifteen years
ago at the time it made a tremendous
stir for mile bebe was the prettiest thing
in ten counties then all eyes and enameled
skin and a mouth as red as a chili pepper
she certainly was a belle beaux in rows
but she wouldnt look at one of em until
along comes a rank outsider an added
starter a dark horse in the race a quiet
spoken slim good-looking chap he was
nobody knew anything about him he
said he came from new york and his
name was jack creel he seemed to have
plenty of money and he was stopping at
the st charles hotel well as it came
about mile bebe and roxanne and a
dozen or so escorts go to the races one fine
day and from her box bebe looks down
and sees this creel and he looks up and
sees bebe bang-theyre off how
they managed to meet bebe never would
tell you know how carefully guarded are
our girls of the old french families but
love will find the way and they found
theirs first we began hearing rumors
that they were seen together at strange
places and stranger hours in the dusk of
the cathedral at twilight they were stum-
bled on by one of the devout gossips step-
ping out of
the dining-
room at an-
toines they were
marked by the
bon v iv ant s

driving in mys-
terious barouch-
es by any and
all who cared to
look-that sort
of thing i was
a bit hurt myself-a little bit sentimental
about bebe to tell the truth how my
sisters ohd and ahd and gossiped
the masque of tragedy

however it ended by bebes announcing
that she is engaged and of course thats
a terrible breech of etiquette and the whole
dumontel connection fall upon this creel
and demanded his pedigree and any ex-
cuse he may have for being alive

  hes got a pretty good bank balance it
seems and is very vague as to ancestry
all the dumontels and the chaberts and
the dequenes are wild but bebe just
beams theyre going to be married and
then to paris to live the nine days won-
der passes by and then he goes north to
settle up his affairs what happened next
of course didnt come out until after-
ward but it was like this he writes
her from new york that he has a surprise
in store for her she is to tell no one
but he will be in new orleans just one
night its carnival time if a masquer
climbs her wall at twelve oclock of a cer-
tain night she is not to be frightened it
will be-guess who all very romantic

  sure enough shes in the garden-i
dont mean the courtyard where you were
painting but the garden that makes the
corner of esplanade and is shut off from
it by a good seven foot high brick wall
with a little green door on the side street
there she waits palpitating in comes
the masked lover and well-one can ima-
gine it moonlight distant music tin
horns confetti carnival he puts into
her hands a pearl necklace-an astounding
thing the sort that wraps three or four
times around the throat and then hangs to
the waist they are big evenly matched
pearls a wonder string he tells her it
is an heirloom his one
great treasure when
they are in paris he will
sell it and they will
have a fortune she is
to tell no one not even
sister roxanne not a
word it is their se-
cret

  her family have treated him shabbily
he explained had more than hinted that he
was a fortune-hunting pauper he didnt
choose to pander to their greed let them
think what they chose it was his little
vengeance let her hide his treasure and
keep it very very carefully unsuspected
f anyone he would leave for the north
in the morning and make his official ap-
pearance a week or ten days later for the
wedding and poor bebe is such an in-
nocent little love-sick ninny that ever
word is gospel and her jack the most
marvellous poetic figure and of course



girl-like she cant stand having those di-
vine pearls in her possession and not show-
ing them so what does she do but wear
them to the carnival ball

  at first everyone takes it for granted
that they are just mardi gras paste so
she gets annoyed at that and acts so mys-
teriously that pretty soon the story goes
from lip to lip that this is the gift of the
groom-to-be and from that the few
people at the ball who really are experts
and can tell the real from the imitation
however good spot that necklace as being
something priceless the length of it the
unusual size of the pearls perfectly
matched make it something quite unique
-and presto the fats in the fire

  a few days nearly a week later a de-
tective arrives from the north mr jack
creel has been located and arrested the
pearls answer to the description given by
mrs charling bullard of washington of
her stolen jewels mr creel it turns out
is wanted for a whole series of robberies

  with her world crumbling about her
ears mile bebe refuses to believe she
refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the
necklace she repeats his statement to
her that the pearls are his an heirloom
nothing can move her she changes her
story a dozen times-shes given the pearls
to a messenger she doesnt know where
they are the string she wore to carnival
ball was only a lot of cheap beads she had
bought and strung herself she believes
absolutely in her fiance he is a perse-
cuted angel she will stand by him for-
ever and stand by him she did

  she is searched the house is searched

she is called an accessory after the fact
and in spite of the whole dumontel clan
they put bebe in jail she goes quite
short stories



cheerfully with her poodle and her negro
maid and her little portable altar and her
special chocolate pot and the pearls
never were found from that day to this
theyve never been seen but her devo-
tion and faith couldnt save creel there
was too much against him they couldnt
prove the bullard robbery on him but they
rlidnt need that one bebe was in jail
when his trial came on they brought
her up north and faced her with him in
hopes shed break down but she didnt
merely said as she always had that she
loved him and believed in him insisting
that all the accusations against him were
lies she even accused her revered aunts
and uncles-she and roxanne were or-
phans-of committing perjury and join-
ing in a conspiracy to break up her mar-
riage she was the despair of everyone
friend foe and family he was given a
long sentence there was a terrible scene
in court she had literally to be torn from
him they say and he broke down and
cried like a child

   from then on poor mile bebe began
to fail at first it was melancholia when
be died of pneumonia a year later in prison
they tried to keep it from her but she
found out a convict who had made
friends with creel in prison wrote her
alxmt it presumably at the dying mans
request she nearly died too but she
pulled through and then-suddenly she
became cheerful and happy she was
waiting for him to come she thought
that he had just gone north to settle his
affairs and was coming in a few days and
then theyd be married shes perfectly
sane on all other matters but in this shes
just gone back and stayed as matters were
before the catastrophe but shes grown
 ld in jumps as you might say just wither-
ing away but happy always looking for-
ward to her wedding day her gown has
been hanging in her closet they tell me for
fifteen years and she is always ordering
orange blossoms from the florists they
all know her and respectfully take her or-
ders and fail to fill them but roxanne
s ive her a wax wreath under glass and
sites quite content with that poor little
jni he bebe the sight of her always goes
to my heart why couldnt she have lav-
ished all that faith and love on somebody
worthy of it irony of fate poor little
soul

   ah there comes our quail roasted in
yine leaves see if you dont like them

   hut braithwait hardly glanced at the
succulent birds as they were ceremoni-

ously presented to his attention of
course shes got the pearls cached some-
where he said thoughtfully with this
delusion that he is coming and that she is
to be married she would obey his instruc-
tions she is holding them for him it
is their nest egg for the future but
where could she have put them so securely
that not in all this searching and overhaul-
ing they have never come to light he
grinned ruefully i almost wish my
good thiery that you hadnt told me the
tale of mile bebes love tragedy im on
my vacation and when im vacationing i
make it a point to be my artist self pure
and simple im supposed to be a painter
now and here youre rousing my sleeping
sleuth instinct hang it all i wanted to
leave my profession behind me when i
came back here i wanted to be an artist

and a gourmet
let m e compli-
ment you by the
way in your
choice in quail in
grape leaves its
a new one on me
but ill say its a
little bit of all
right

  the subject of
mile bebe and
the vanishing pearls would not so easily
be set aside as they sipped the last taste
of the heavy black louisiana after lunch-
eon coffee braithwait came out of a pro-
longed reverie

  are they sure that the sister roxanne
knows nothing of the whereabouts of the
pearls he asked

  the white-haired olive-skinned thiery
opened wide black eyes his own mind
had been traveling back into the past not
she a simple creature roxanne if she
had known anything the priest would have
learned of it before now no she doesnt
know-and there is another point of tra-
gedy bebe was always devout when she
was a very young girl she had a notion
of taking the veil but this love affair es-
tranged her from the church what it
must have cost her-la pauvre she still
has her plaster saints all over the house
and as i told you she took her little port-
able altar to jail with her however she
seems to have worked out a plan of doing
without as you might say the middle man
she deals direct with her saints of
course in her twisted mind she has the idea
of pursuit she does not dare confide in
anything human alas i must confess
the masque of tragedy



my friend it is my tragedy too i have
never married thiery rose nervously
and reached for his hat allons if
you are painting this afternoon you had
best install yourself before the light be-
gins to change since you have forgotten
that you are a detective remember that
you are a painter

  youre right agreed braithwait i
have an appointment this afternoon with
the northeast corner of the cabildo
good-by and thank you for all your forms
of entertainment that story and quails
in vine leaves what more could an artist
sherlock want

  they parted before the door of the little
restaurant and braithwait took his lei-
surely way to jackson square and the an-
cient cabildo

but in spite of the lure of warm
color architectural felicities and
linear perfections his mind would
travel back to the vision of the tiny dried
rosebud woman leaning with crossed arms
on the gallery rail looking down with fe-
verishly bright black eyes at the faithful
lover while she talked of a fiance dead
long ago of whose passing she had only
the message written by a fellow convict
perhaps heaven in its mercy had blanked
out the sorrows leaving her the happy il-
lusion of expectancy forever

  when he left the quiet of the interior
court of the old prison it was to meet the
blast of playing bands the streets were
full of hurrying people men and women
in tinsel and rainbow colors crowded taxis
from which fluttered the carnival colors
of purple yellow and green dusk was
hovering in the sky and the myriad elec-
tric lights swung above across the wide
thoroughfare made a golden haze in the
misty atmosphere the contrast of the
stillness of the prison yard and the gather-
ing festivity of the street was startling
why not play truant himself  the next
day would bring the finale the mad cli-
max the license of mardi gras made
every man and woman abroad in the jost-
ling throng a possible acquaintance a
friend and companion maybe for an hour
or the night long or a lifetime-who
knew  braithwait ducked out of the
crowd and into a costumers there was
little left for choice but he bought a cheap
suit of the black and white of pierrot a
black skull cap and a supply of grease paint
and powder

  for that night and half the next day
braithwait disappeared from the earth

 and another pierrot had joined the black
 and white army that danced in and out of

house club and cafe dawn found him
and a motley crew of bedraggled merry-
makers on the shores of the lake a
breakfast at the bungalow topped off by
a taxi race into town that avoided disaster
by a miracle it was nearly noon and
rex had taken the city keys in his keeping
when the thought of his room a bath and
a shave loomed up as the three things most
to be desired in a topsy-turvy world
without the formality of a leave-taking
braithwait abandoned the remains of the
party and sought his hotel the streets
were littered with serpentine and confetti
sodden and mired with the tramplings of
the mob the wires across the streets and
the crisscrossed lines of light bulbs were
dripping with colored ribbon like spanish
moss of a live oak the streets were
nearly deserted of masquers now the
idea of rest and recuperation against the
festivities to be renewed with the after-
noon had penetrated to the weary minds
and tired feet of the quondam revelers

  braithwait glanced up the marble flight
of stairs leading into the hotel as he paid
his cab fare and stopped open-mouthed
by the center pillar stood gaston thiery
his skin was ashen his face drawn in hard
lines of anxiety and pain his eyes deep
sunken and filled as if with a film of with-
held tears the man was a wreck for-
getting his disguise braithwait rushed up
to his friend seizing his shoulder almost
roughly

  in heavens name whats wrong with
you man he demanded

  braithwait thiery gasped thank
god ive been waiting for you since
r

short stories

seven oclock been to your room-asked
everywhere quick quick come with me
-at once

  the detective became suddenly aware of
his bedraggled finery let me get this
confounded stuff off whats happened
never mind come as you are here
taxi thiery gripped the detectives arm
with nervous fingers that dug into the flesh
as he thrust his reluctant companion into
the vehicle and gave the dumontel address
to the driver

  braithwait started where the
dumontels whats wrong there

  the car had started thiery leaned for-
ward covering his face with his hand he
was crying great scalding tears slipped
between his fingers shocked and puz-
zled braithwait laid a sympathetic hand
on the others shoulder

  what is it man vieux how can i
help come come get a grip on your-
self

  the frenchman pulled himself together
with a tearing effort its mademoiselle
bebe he whispered hoarsely shes
dead-murdered

  what exclaimed braithwait mur-
dered why what for are you
sure 

  you shall see said thiery i have
held them all off i made roxanne insist
the chief of police knows of you i ex-
plained who you are she has not been
moved nothing has been touched-and she
so gentle it is this cursed story of the
earls i feel sure of it and yet-but you
shall see you shall see the little man
placed a shaking hand on the limp soiled
folds of the pierrot ruff i trust to you
my friend to see that this devil is pun-
ished he must be found the most das-
tardly the most cowardly- he choked

  ill do everything i can you may be
sure of that braithwaits face was grim
beneath its streaked coat of powder and
smeared rouge the cab rattled to the
curb already a knot of curious neigh-
bors were gathered at the wide entrance
under the fan arch where they were held
back by a policeman at a word from
thiery the guardian permitted them to en-
ter the familiar courtyard all was as
sunny calm and softly gay as ever-the
red bird in its cage warbled sleepily the
vivid green banana leaves rustled together
whispering

  thiery led the way up the stairs to the
first gallery and knocked on the double
doors roxanne a tall slender woman
who bore herself with dignity in spite of

the ravages of shock and grief admitted
them

  gaston clasped both her hands in his 
i have brought him he will give us our
one consolation roxanne he will not
let her murderer go unpunished he of
all the world is the one man i could trust
-and he is here

  miss dumontel looked at the tattered
masquerader without surprise they
have waited monsieur she said gravely
the coroner is here and the police they
all knew her-she was the friend of every-
body my poor bebe she turned toward
a door leading from the salon which when
opened revealed a corridor that at its fur-
ther end terminated in an iron festooned
balcony that overlooked the garden right
and left were doors and a transverse hall
ran the entire depth of the old mansion
before the door to the left of the hall win-
dow sat a blue-coated officer

  there said roxanne giving a sudden
racking sob was it not enough that her
life was ruined that her beautiful mind
was broken  and now mon dieu-this n
she controlled herself he will show
you monsieur i-i cannot it was i
who found her she added simply as she
turned away

  the policeman rose received thierys
explanation as if expecting it looked at
braithwait curiously and unlocking the
door preceded them into the room the
tall windows stood open their blue painted
shutters folded back the broad green
varnished leaves of a magnolia tree thrust
themselves over the wrought iron balcony
railing the floor was of red tile the fur-
niture huge polished mahogany pieces an
immense canopied bed an armoire of gi-
gantic proportions a rosewood prie dieu
drawn up beside the bed in the middle
of the western wall was a small open fire-
place whose shelf was ornamented by a
sevres clock and two plaster statues of
st joseph and st anthony on a stand
between the windows stood what the in-
vestigator recognized as the portable altar
mentioned by thiery it was of gilded
wood with painted panels but the figure
that should have stood before it on the lit-
tle gothic pedestal was not in its place

  braithwait took in the details of the
room before he permitted himself to look
at the almost doll-like figure that lay out-
flung before the opened casements then
he went close and knelt down beside it
mile bebe was miraculously young in
death she looked a girl again the fine
web of wrinkles that had covered her face
the masque

like a veil blurring her features was gone 
wiped away leaving them chiseled and

cameo-like she was dressed in an ela-
borate negligee such as a creole bride of
fifteen years ago would inevitably have se-
lected for her trousseau her almost white
hair fell in soft curls about the still brow
she looked not old not even her years
but like some powdered-haired belle of
the eighteenth century the black lashes
that swept her cheeks and the dark arches
of her brows enhanced the illusion

  carefully after closely examining the
corpse the detective lifted it in his arms
the cause of death was instantly apparent
the neck was broken she had fallen or
been thrown with great violence her head
striking on the stone lintel of the french
window the two brass sunken sockets
that received the old-fashioned closing rods
operated by the turning of the door-like
knob were directly at the base of the skull
death had been instantaneous he laid
her gently back and rose from her side
his gaze traveled out to the stone-floored
balcony with its hand-wrought delicate iron
railings he stepped over the dead hands
that seemed to bar his passage the bal-
cony as he had surmised ran the entire
length of the house overhanging the gar-
den a trellis covered with vines came up
nearly to its base forming an iron pergola
through the crowding leaves he could
njake out the forms of green-painted
benches and seats below evidently a little
arbor for hot weather relaxation the
high wall that shut the garden from the
street was pierced almost directly opposite
by a small green door once inside the
enclosure any agile person could easily
climb the trellis pull himself up and over
the railing and enter the room if mile

of tragedy	

bebe had been murdered this was certainly
the way her assailant had come there
was proof of it in plain sight-broken ten-
drils freshly scraped paint the heavy im-
print of a foot in the moist soil

  braithwait turned back into the room
both thiery and the officer were regard-
ing him expectantly as if they believed him
capable of unravelling the mystery at once
standing still in the middle of the room
he studied all the surroundings once more
in detail there had been no struggle
evidently only two things attracted at-
tention in the orderly chamber-the door
of the great armoire stood open revealing
a white satin wedding dress turned ivory
with age other dresses sheer embroid-
ered trifles of lawn and mull evidently
in this wardrobe the bereft bride had
stored her trousseau one hook was
empty evidently the gorgeous wrapper
that now clothed the stiffened form had
hung there why had she if frightened
in the night by an intruder put on this
treasured locked away garment instead
of slipping at once into the handy familiar
bathrobe which was by her bed little
pale blue silken mules were on the waxen
feet the square-toed black kid bedroom
slippers stood undisturbed on the wooly
knitted mat but most puzzling clue of
all the only object in the room that was
out of place or damaged was a colored
plaster figure of st rita it lay on the
floor broken in three pieces braithwait
picked up the base and tried it on the
empty pedestal of the altar it fitted ex-
actly this then was the occupant of the
little shrine the statue was hollow he
examined each piece carefully it had
been stuffed with cotton here and there
on the rough contours of the casting
shreds adhered he looked at the base
once more it had been crudely sealed
with wax yellow wax such as votive can-
dles are made of

  he replaced the shards and again made
the tour of the room once more bent above
the body and studied its expression the at-
titude of the hands the manner of its po-
sition

  i believe he said slowly she kept the
pearls in that statue of course they
couldnt find them she had them with
her i think you told me thiery that
even in jail she took her little altar do
you see he held a fragment toward him
the bits of cotton wool clinging there
she packed the inside with it so the con-
tents wouldnt rattle she sealed the base
with wax candles she bought at the cathe-
short stories



dral and brought home with her instead
of burning on the altar there would be
nothing to account for that wax thus
far i think im right but who in the world
could know or guess that after all these
years who came here to compel her to
give them up and how could he force
the secret she had kept against all odds for
years the only person who possibly
could have made her tell the man she loved
and who gave the pearls into her keeping
-is dead i confess i dont get it but
someone was here and someone killed her
though i doubt if that was intentional
she fell or was thrown it was the way
her head hit the stone lintel and the brass
cups

  thierys eyes were bitter hard but
he killed her just the same to kill her
was like killing a child look how little
she is how helpless the tears sprang
again to his eyes youve got to find the
brute think think hard things dont
just happen there is a reason for every-
thing somebody knew somebody must
have known

  he came in braithwait continued
either over the wall or through that green
door-but thats a detail he climbed to
the balcony by way of the arbor he
knew which were her windows for his
tracks land over the railing directly in
front of them not further down which
would have been an easier climb if you
look and see we have to deal with some-
one who knew and why is she dressed
in that lace negligee  as i read the signs
she wanted to look her best could she
have expected someone

  thiery blanched his fists clenched
how dare you he snarled were you
not my friend-

  the detective held up a restraining hand
remember that we have to deal with a de-
fective reason he cautioned she lived
emotionally as you told me in the past
you are not to take offense at what i say
you are to try and help me it is for you
to think

  thiery sobered perhaps roxanne
he ventured but no i knew as much
and more of my poor dear little friend than
her sister and i tell you there is no one
if anyone who was capable of committing
this crime had known then this would
have been done long ago-

  unless interrupted the policeman
shrewdly that person had only just found
out-something that mademoiselle herself
may have said may have informed this
person

  this person may have signaled to her
given her time to throw on that lace gown
it isnt conceivable that she a modest
shrinking creature would have dressed
herself before someone already in the
room she must have realized he was
there outside for look there is a brooch
fastened at her neck she took time to
put it on hurriedly no doubt-but she
dressed i dont understand it at all
braithwait thrust his hands deep into the
wide pockets of the black and white trou-
sers hunching up the long blouse from
which half of the huge black buttons had
been torn away pierrots black skull cap
was awry and his own tawny hair escaped
in a yellow halo black white and red
had mingled in indescribable confusion on
his face as he raised his eyes he caught
sight of his reflection in the long mirror
hung on the inside of the wardrobe door
he started shrugged and grinned and
then stiffened like a bird dog at point he
stared and his eyes widened he seemed
hypnotized by his own double in the glass
by god he exclaimed by god
thats it ive got it i know

  he dashed past his amazed companions
through the salon where the startled rox-
anne rose to meet him down the steps to

the courtyard
and out to the
street break-
ing through the
curious crowd
and thrusting
aside the p o-
 i c e m a n on
watch down
the avenue
now beginning to fill again with the gaudy
costumes of the fete he ran like one pos-
sessed waving aside all delay and in-
terference he made his way directly to
the chief of police that functionary at
first angry and disbelieving became ex-
citedly convinced anxiously cooperative
to braithwaits reiterated demands for
immediate action he responded with ef-
ficient zeal

  are you sure you can pick up his
trail the detective inquired its not
s easy but he cant have left the city
yet unless he got aboard of some tramp
freighter sailing this morning have
everyone that leaves the mouth of the river
overhauled send a police boat down im-
mediately

  orders flew

  unmindful of his appearance braith-
wait paced the floor
the masque of tragedy

  how long has he been out got long
distance  has he had time to grow a
mustache or beard are there any dis-
tinguishing marks has anything hap-
pened of recent years that might serve as
further means of identification

  there were delays inevitable but fret-
ting at last the required information
was forthcoming eric johns had been
released on the th of january-time off
for good behavior followed a chart of
measurements a notation as to where fin-
gerprints and photographs were available
there was a white scar in his hair over the
left ear he was known to have gone to
friends in atlanta georgia

  trail him from there ordered braith-
wait they will have had an eye on him
at headquarters at any rate they can
verify that hes left get busy now time
is precious

  more long distance and while the ser-
geant was busy at the task under braith-
waits nervous directions plainclothes men
on duty watching the harvesting of the
pickpockets convened by carnival were
called in and despatched north east south
and west a description of the wanted
man was circulated with radio rapidity
the dragnet was spread

  youre right came the voice of the
chief as he glanced over the shoulder of
the man at the telephone who was jotting
down in shorthand the words that were
pouring over the wire from atlanta he
jave them the slip got out of town some
time last week they havent the remotest
idea where he went hed got a job in a
garage and seemed to be working hon-
estly  lived with his friends didnt go to
any of the hangouts

  all right the detective cut in tell
them to get in touch with the people he
stayed with-they may come across with
something he looked at his colleague
suddenly conscious of his bedraggled state

  youre all in mr braithwait the
chief said kindly you need a bath and
a change ill send you to your hotel in
one of the department cars theres noth-
ing more you can do now until we begin
to get reports in

  braithwait looked at his torn and soiled
blouse and spattered trousers no longer
white pretty tough looking customer-
what but just the same im grateful to
these sad rags ill tell you why later on
it you havent guessed it already

  guessed what-that youve been forty-
eight hours without sleep i dont have
to guess i know said the officer

  not that at all said the detective
yawning but never mind youre right
me for forty winks and some every day
clothes ive had about all of this tragic
masquerade that i can use put me
aboard your dreadnought and pack me
home if anything stirs wake me up and
for goodness sake dont call me unless
there is

  braithwait as it happened was allowed
all of ten hours of rest before he was
called-he was even up and dressed before
his telephone rang

  weve got him said the voice of the
chief over the wire picked him up in
new iberia think he was headed west
he wont talk no trace of pearls kelly
and bassee are bringing him back

  not in the baggage and not on him
hey said braithwait sharply get a
specimen of his handwriting go to the
post office here in the city and find out
what packages were sent out by parcel post
early this morning its dollars to dough-
nuts hes mailed them to himselfv under an-
other name-somewhere west since he was
headed that way but dont neglect ad-
dress in mexico either probably its in-
sured-he wouldnt take a chance on los-
ing them have them look up registered
packages first of all

  at that you may be right came the
answer ill have the p o combed in-
side of half an hour call you again
later

  it was hardly more than the time speci-
fied when the bell jangled once more

  there are three packages registered
between  and  a m the chief re-
ported one to galveston one to los
angeles and one to san francisco were
having all three watched for on delivery
if hes sent them to himself he wont
be there to receive it but well have em
all held for identification in case hes got
p     a pal at the other end
q  w fjfji all the other stuff that
fuji 	went through unregis-

jgli ipioil	tered was bulky stuff

blwlallp and from known resi-
wf i	dents weve checked

      w r up  the stations
mmjgjw	g o o d approved

                braithwait my bet
is galveston just a hunch of course
but i think hell make for a port less con-
spicuous than san francisco and more
handy than los angeles however we
mustnt be too sure our mans no fool
braithwait hung up and realizing that
the hunger that gripped him was the a-

tural result of semi-starvation betook him-
self to breakfast later he went in search
of thiery and found the little frenchman
in the depths of despair there was no
justice in the world-all his faith in braith-
waits prowess had ebbed

  i dont blame you said the detective
but im sure positive and its straight de-
duction im not just playing a hunch
poor mile bebes ghost is not going to
walk demanding vengeance though i
doubt if she was ever the sort to demand
it- he paused and his eyes had a far
away look funny thing-imagination
he said softly do you know i can see
what happened last night as clearly and
in detail as if id been hidden in that great
armoire of hers watching it all theres
only one detail that is still a mystery to me
but that ill know very soon im going
to have the prisoner brought directly to
the dumontel house hes due in an hour
if he isnt here already wait ill tele-
phone he was gone only a few mo-
ments when he returned he nodded with
an air of satisfaction come on thiery
lets go the chief is coming too he
laid his hand with a comforting gesture
on thierys bowed shoulder

  into the silent courtyard now blurring
into the soft shadows of twilight they made
their way the curious crowd had dis-
persed only the policeman on duty dif-
ferentiated the entrance under the ancient
doorway from its counterparts up and
down the street here and there a citizen
hurrying home or a brightly-garbed
masquer on his way to dinner enlivened
the thoroughfare

  hes coming now said braithwait as
he caught the distant sound of an ap-
proaching patrol wagon

  well go straight to mile bebes room
she will confront him

  roxanne her dignity broken by the
strain admitted them tearfully she had
been advised by telephone of what was to
happen

  leave this to us mile dumontel said
braithwait sympathetically but rest as-
sured justice is not going to be cheated
this time

  with her handkerchief to her eyes the
bereaved sister motioned them to proceed
down the corridor

  on the bed in mile bebes virginal room
lay the little corpse so small so young
seeming like a child asleep she was
dressed in the lace negligee for in this
roxanne had decided mile bebe was to
be buried at head and foot the soft ra-

diance of many candles glowed an ebony
and silver crucifix lay on the still breast
beneath her delicate hands through the
open window the breeze stole softly bend-
ing the candles flame on the floor lay
undisturbed at the detectives orders the
three pieces of the broken statuette of st
rita the officer sitting outside the door
saluted respectfully with a sob thiery
threw himself on his knees by the bedside
his lips moving in silent prayer

  what i am going to do whispered
braithwait will be rather spectacular
dont let it get on your nerves old man
im going to put over a third degree of
my own invention from inside that ar-
moire when the chief is here tell him
so the suspect wont hear you get him
outside the chances are that the guilty
man will be so upset at sight of his victim
he wont notice anything else listen-i
hear them

  he tiptoed to the massive wardrobe
tested its balance and stepped inside its
depth was sufficient to readily conceal him
behind the pendant clothing and the card-
board boxes he had to push aside the
doors he left ajar

  thiery rose to his feet and a moment
later the door to the passage was pushed
open and the chief entered close behind
him between two uniformed policemen
stumbled a haggard wild-eyed man as
his gaze fell upon the dead woman he gave
a smothered shriek and had it not been
for the men beside him would have crum
pled to the floor

  the chief spoke low his voice reproach-
ful how could you kill a helpless lit-
tle woman like that

  the prisoner began to tremble his hand
cuffs rattled sharply

  eric johns said an eerie voice eric
johns

  the prisoner struggled twisted fought
even the men who held him paled

  thiery close to the chief was whisper-
ing eagerly

  and you swore you were my pal said
the voice and you used all i told you-
to rob her-the woman i loved you had
learned that for love of me me-creel-
she had lost her reason you waited till
it was carnival time till you could come
in the disguise and masque i told you i had
worn when i came to her with the pearls
you thought that seeing you she would
think it was i come again and for me
she would reveal the hiding place of the
trust she had kept so long and well
half-fainting the accused reeled his
the masque of tragedy

face was ghastly sweat poured from his
brow i didnt kill her i didnt i
didnt he screamed she tried to fol-
low me i threw her down-i didnt
know-i didnt know

  she thought i had come back to her
the hollow voice went on she told you
the hiding place you couldnt wait you
broke the statue the necklace fell out the
pearls-my pearls-i had gambled my life
for you threw her from you when she
clung thinking that her lover was leaving
her-you

  oh my god listen i didnt mean
to kill her cried the frantic prisoner i
did dress as you told me you had that night
-in a black spanish costume with a red
cape she fell for it yes and let me in-
but i didnt mean to kill her didnt even
know she was dead till now i thought it
out the pearls werent no use to her-
she was crazy if shed died nobody
would have known theyd a been just
lost creel creel for the love of god
dont haunt me youd a done the same
thing yourself you know you would

  he groveled his breath came in hoarse
rattling gasps

   the cool voice of the chief cut the pause
what did you do with the loot johns
ill give em back i will panted the
huddled wreck on the floor i sent them
to galveston by parcel post to william
haynes-thats the name i used i faked
stuff to identify myself with ill get em
-ill send for em-but for the love of
god get a priest and have him lay that
ghost he was my pal creel was and i
went back on him i double-crossed him
after he was dead but so help me i didnt
kill her she was such a little bit of a
thing i just shook her off and she fell

 didnt even look back just thought she
dropped-so help me creel thats the
gods truth with an unconsciously
dramatic gesture he approached the bed
and laid his shaking hand on the two quiet
ones that lay above the crucifix

  i do believe you the impulsive
f renchman spoke for all present the
thief turned his haggard eyes gratefully
to his face i do believe you thiery re-
peated and i loved her

  take the prisoner down said the chief
huskily ill join you in a moment
between the two guards eric johns was
led from the room a moment later
braithwait appeared at the door of the
wardrobe and stepped to the floor even
his steeled nerve was shaken it showed



in the drawn look about his mouth and

eyes

  poor devil
he said at
length poor
devil -anyway
we got the
truth the whole
truth and noth-
ing but the
t r u t h he
paused then
crossed softly
to the window
she saw the masquer in the garden he
said dreamily as one recalling a half-for-
gotten memory he must have called to
her somehow attracted her attention so
she flew to the great armoire hurried into
her beautiful gown found her satin mules
fastened the lace at her throat with the
brooch he had given her and opened the
windows to let him in anyway she had
her little moment of happy illusion before
she went

  the chief of police came up to braith-
wait and held out his hand you were
right every inch of the way what put
you on the trail

  the fifteen years lapse of time said
braithwait if it had been possible for
anyone having the requisite knowledge and
capable of such a thing to act before he
would have acted in the second place
when i caught sight of my own reflection
in the mirror i suddenly remembered
thierys story of how creel had warned
her the night lie brought the pearls to ex-
pect a masquer in her garden had anyone
known all this and known also the poor
womans delusions which was a very open
secret there would be ninety-nine chances
to a hundred that the imposter would be
received with open arms and the secret of
the lost pearls revealed it would be the
only way to break through her habit of se-
crecy and of course the man who had
been eric johns pal in prison who had
written to the fiancee the particulars of
his death would be the one person in the
world who would know in all probability
how he had disguised himself on that fate-
ful night and he would have had to wait
fifteen years until he had served his term
to make use of his knowledge well the
mystery is cleared eric johns goes back
to jail mrs charling bullard of wash-
ington will get the agreeable surprise of

outlaw cattle

g astronomically speaking we
have cherished vigorous suspicions
concerning the service records of many un-
successful steaks we have met tough
as rhino hide some of them were steaks
too which bore honored names ranging
from flank to plank-ed porterhouse
hard-bitten critters they had been when
roaming the western range but yet harder
after being teamed with french fried upon
the kitchen range and set before us in
mockery

  for the first time all such suspicions
have been confirmed on the hoof those
impermeable steaks were roundup-dodgers

concerning the derivation of this

even among ranchers and old-time punch-

stories writes from the tex ranch val-
liant oklahoma

editor short stories

dear sir

  i have heard several explanations of the term
maverick my grandfather came to texas
from tennessee in the s and he has given me
a lot of lone star lore one time and another
my impression is that maverick was a man who
turned loose down about san antonio way a
herd of cattle and left them without a caretaker
other cowmen got into the habit of branding his
calves in the maverick brand so in course of
time he had numerous cattle which scattered his
brand farther and farther until his herds roamed
over most of central and north texas after a
while when a cowman found an unbranded brute
he naturally supposed it to belong to the maver-
ick herd as all other men saw after the brand-
ing of their own everybody helped maverick
texas soon was overrun with cattle with mav-
ericks brand and there is no telling how many
thousands he then possessed

matthew watson

from the following which appeared
first in the st louis republic no-
vember  it would seem that an un-
intentional wrong is done a splendid texan
family through the popular tradition based
largely upon a misconception

  it is asserted in substance that the patriarch
of the maverick family came at an early day
from ireland to texas became a stock raiser
and branded all the yearling calves he found un-
the story tellers circle	

branded on the range such animals became
known as mavericks implying of course that
stich branding was done regardless of rightful
ownership allow me to correct this statement

  nearly  years ago this branch of the mav-
erick family removed from massachusetts to
south carolina and in  samuel a maverick
a native of the latter state came to texas he
signed the texas declaration of independence
and many times served in both branches of the
legislature in which i was repeatedly his col-
league a more honorable man never sat in our
councils he was a noble man and the head of
a noble family he acquired much land and also
many cattle but paid no attention to the latter
or so little that they scattered over a large scope
of country in time this became so notorious
that in their spring round-ups the people on that
frontier came to regard all yearlings found with
mavericks cattle as legitimate prey facetiously
styling every unbranded yearling so found a
maverick and appropriating it as such in
this way his herd in a few years virtually be-
came extinct in all this time indeed from 
till his death a few years ago mr maverick
lived in san antonio while his cattle as before
stated were at large  the frontier instead of
grasping the stock of other people by sheer
neglect and indifference mr maverick allowed
other people to appropriate his own young cattle
till his herd ceased to be

  i have not seen a member of the family since
 but know these statements to be true and
am unwilling to remain silent when the memory
of so true and good a man is thus placed in a
false light

                   john henry brown
                          dallas texas

judging that in the settling of a ques-
tion involving the name of a family
some member of the maverick clan had a
right to be heard we have obtained the
following statement from the grandson of
the original samuel a maverick

  hon samuel a maverick a citizen of san
antonio was during  residing temporarily
at decrows point on matagorda bay he was
a lawyer with a strong propensity for invest-
ment is real estate in fact all the enterprising
men in texas of that day were justly enthusi-
astic over real estate at  and  cents an acre

  during the year  a neighbor being in-
debted to mr maverick in the sum of 
paid the debt in cattle transferring  animals
at  a head steers were cheap in those days
the hides only being cashable in foreign markets
mr maverick did not want stock but as it was
a case of cattle or nothing he passively received
them and left them in charge of a colored fam-
ily nominally slave but essentially free while
he and his own kin returned to san antonio

  in the year  the cattle were removed from
the gulf coast to conquista on the east bank of
the san antonio river  miles below san an-
tonio here as before under the distinguished
 management of the colored family who
really were not to blame as they had no inter-
est in the outcome the cattle were left to graze
to fatten to multiply and to wander away

  about one-third of the calves were branded
and the stencil iron was kept so cold -and rusty
that in  the entire herd was estimated at 
head the original number

  neighbors shrewdly surmised the stray calves

to be mavericks and so they called them mav-
ericks-but did they continue to recognize them
as such ah no they hastened to burn into
the tender hides far different brands and the
beasts were mavericks mavericks no longer

  about the year  after ri years of ex-
perience in the cattle business mr maverick
sold the entire brand  head as they ran to
mr a toutant beauregard a brother of the dis-
tinguished general beauregard mr beauregard
however paid  per head and mr maverick
retired from the venture with an apparent profit
of  per cent and the unique distinction of
having his name bestowed upon a very useful
critter known to every cowman mr maverick
all statements to the contrary notwithstanding
was never a range king for with the exception
of the herd mentioned and a few necessary cow
ponies he never owned any cattle or horses

c k richard of herrnon illi-
nois inquired recently concerning an
implement of range and border equipment
appearing occasionally in our stories the
half-breed holster for a six-gun since
other members of the circle may have been
puzzled by the reference it is well to make
plain the nature of this contrivance which
is used commonly in mexico a half-
breed holster is an ordinary six-gun sheath
flapless and with the lower end cut away
for a distance of two or three inches to
facilitate sudden firing from the holster
in this action the holster with the gun bar-
rel protruding from its lower end often a
bored cork just fitting the muzzle is sewed
to the leather is tipped to horizontal as the
six-gun trigger is pulled or the hammer
fanned

dear sir

  bet you the drinks western stories are not as
universally popular as you think you get lots
of letters from enthusiastic readers who heartily
enjoy that kind but not many i think expres-
sing soulfelt weariness of them nevertheless
there are more of the latter type of letter-writers
than you may imagine my letter is inspired by
a reporters comment in this evenings paper
about the popularity of western shows in the
lower main street picture houses business al-
ways is good when bill hart et al are on the
screen but he adds and you can draw a line
under the but-the houses higher uptown re-
fuse to run a western under any circumstances
and i know they are nearly always s r o

  no one who dislikes westerns ever goes to
the box office and tells the manager so he
merely drifts uptown in search of harold lloyd
or dorothy gish and when he goes to the
newsstand he doesnt cuss the dealer for selling
western stories-simply buys another magazine

  this is not a spiteful missive from an enemy
you are giving us the very best better than
most of the others and your avoidance of long-
drawn-out serials fills me with gratitude i have
been a reader for a long time and intend to re-
main one

- this man is going
  to commit murder-

    so says the examiner after a two-hour test
    and surely enough sooner or later the man
    just examined commits that very crime

startling revolutionary new dis-
coveries have been made that will lead
to the wiping out of r  of all crime within
thirty or forty years if the public once
knows the facts and acts upon them

  do you know that  c of all crime is
committed by one fiftieth of the population
do you know that nine out of every ten
criminals are criminals because they have a
defective spot in their brains though they
may be brilliantly intelligent in other re-
spects do you know that if this fiftieth
part of the population with its inherited
brain defects were prevented from breeding
more criminals that nearly all crime would
disappear within a generation or two do
you know how the experts intend to bring
this about

   french strother noted writer and associate editor
of the worlds work lias spent much time in-
vestigating these discoveries the facts he tells will

  it seems almost unbelievable that a
  grammar school graduate could

and then
  draw
  this

look at
this
picture

   and really believe he had copied what he
   saw but it has been done independ-
   ently by dozens of young criminals in
   dead earnest this is a test of character
   not of intelligence the brightest crim-
   inals make many odd mistakes such as
   this

take your breath away for they are unanswerable
proofs based on actual tests in  cases he
will tell you of the many odd crimes that have
been committed and will explain just why they have
been committed he will tell you the stories of re-
markable criminals and of famous criminal families
that bred murderers robbers and swindlers gener-
ation after generation due to the handing down of

 of all crime
within  years

yes if the public once
knows the facts and
acts on them

   how is it to be done not by punishing
   criminals in the old way but by seg-
   regating them for life thus preventing them
   from breeding more criminals all the
   crime in the country is committed by only
    of the population and neaily all of the
    are criminals not because they cue sin-
   ful or had a bad bringing up but be-
   cause they inherited a defective spot on the
   brain they may be intelligent enough in
   many cases yet there is a kink somewhere
   in the mind which can never be straightened
   out but which unfortunately can be handed
   down to future generations

       a two-hour test of the emotions has been
   devised by which the sanity or criminal in-
   sanity of  persons has been definitely
   determined it has become possible to fore-
   tell with amazing accuracy just what sort of
   crime the examined man is likely to commit
   french strother associate editor of the
