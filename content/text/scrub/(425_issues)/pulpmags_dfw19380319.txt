 money to burn

by william e barrett

author of iou murderred ice etc

a gripping story of washington where the cost of living is the highest of
any city in the nation and the cost of dying is often at bargain rates

  a ll day long the money had been
flowing into the old house on
mount vernon highway piles
upon piles of greasy currency that
passed through greg coopers hands
for counting and dropped like waste
paper into boxes with the money
came a mood across the room from
him cooper could see senator brad-
ford weller sitting smugly behind his
desk his pepper-and-salt colored wig
looking more false than ever and his
narrow greedy face relaxed

  greed that was the thing that came
into the house with the money that
was the mood it was in the senators
face and it was like something living
and tangible in the house itself driving
out all of the things that had existed
here before it even hatred cooper
mopped the perspiration from his fore-

head with a limp handkerchief his
young face tense

  he was feeling it himself the un-
settling power of money in large
amounts his fingers fumbled as he
checked the currency over none of the
bills felt crisp any longer they felt
greasy slimy they repelled him and
at the same time attracted him he
found himself wanting them and at
the same time wanting to escape from
them

  what is the total now cooper

  the senators voice had the dry
quality of rustling paper greg
cooper ran the tip of his pencil across
the latest entry on the sheet before
him

  one hundred and fifty-four thou-

tim weller rose in protest
a complete short novel

 sand five hundred and fifteen dollars
 he said huskily

   the senator put his fingertips to-
 gether his elbows resting on his
 carved mahogany desk the light of
 late afternoon came through the vene-
 tian blinds and fell across him in bars
 it was a kind light to a man of the
 senators years it softened the pouches
 under his eyes and the slack lines of
 his mouth if the room had not been
 crowded with currency he might have
 looked benevolent his eyes however
 were hard with money hunger and the
 light did not soften that

feed that money to the fire hito-as fast
as mr cooper can check it




detective fiction weekly

  there will not be very much more
he said it is not an impressive sum
it is too much to be stacked in an
old house

  coopers voice was sharper than he
intended it to be but he did not qualify
the statement his lean jaw was hard
and there was a vast sincerity in the
depths of his level gray eyes he did
not have to pussyfoot when he felt
strongly about anything he was one
of those strange products of wash-
ington a senators secretary a young
man with legal training and newspaper
experience a sound body and a hard
mind-too young to be a senator him-
self but with more knowledge of the
senators job than the senator would
ever have bradford weller turned
slowly in his chair

 a mans money is his own
cooper he said and hes foolish
only when he lets others tell him what
to do with it

  cooper shook his head thats
rhetoric save it for the voters a man
is foolish with his money any time
that he takes it to a place where he
cant protect it properly hes being
foolish with his life too people kill
for money

  the senator chuckled i have my
private joke on you cooper you are
going to be surprised and not you
alone

  his voice choked off into another
chuckle he was holding his chin
against his chest and he had turned
his chair so that the shadows hid his
expression cooper shrugged and put
his attention once more upon the sheets
spread out before him

  the penciled figures were the piles
of currency reduced to symbols the
record of the senators resources pulled
into this house for some obscure rea-
son there were bank accounts that

had been closed out stocks and bonds
that had been sold debts that had
been collected in none of the transac-
tions had a check figured every deal
at the senators insistence had been
closed in cash and the cash was here
in the study of the senators virginia
home-heaps of it

  the door to the big hall opened
slowly and cooper looked up hito
the japanese man of all work was
standing there his squat body bent
slightly forward his beady black eyes
on the senator

  a misser terry black to see you
you see him yess

  his voice was a blend of hiss and
lisp that hit the esses hard the senator
leaned back in his chair terry
black ah yes show him in hito
he turned to cooper as the japanese
bowed out this black he said
doubtfully its that taxi fellow isnt
it

  cooper nodded grimly it is he
saved your life in  youve got
him down as owing you five hundred
dollars

  im letting him off for two hundred
and fifty

  i know i wrote the letter to him
its a shame to take a dime

   the senator cleared his throat its
my money cooper maybe you can
afford to give away two hundred and
fifty dollars i cant

  greg cooper snorted he remem-
bered terry black very well a de-
pression down-and-outer without a job
who had jumped off a park bench to
knock a gun out of the hand of a
man who tried to assassinate brad-
ford weller it had been quite a show
with the newsreel cameras grinding
senator weller had publicly presented
terry black with a check for five hun-
dred dollars and solemnly accepted the
money to burn



mans note in exchange he had been
applauded for that for saving the
mans pride while he paid him a re-
ward nobody who read the news-
papers or saw the newsreels took the
loan angle seriously terry black
brought his wife and youngster to
washington and bought a taxicab
now bradford weller was trying to
collect

f i he door to the big hall opened
again and terry black came into
the room he was a slender man of
medium height with lean jaws high
cheekbones and large eyes set deep
he was wearing a blue serge suit that
was shiny from much pressing he
had a taxi drivers cap in one gnarled
hand and a creased envelope in the
other he bobbed his head rather
awkwardly

  how do you do senator i-i got
over as soon as i could

  the senator half rose to extend a
limp hand how are you black
quite well i hope you are prepared
to pick up your note i presume
terry black swallowed hard yes
sir i didnt have much warning you
told me you know that any time i
had the money

  bradford weller cleared his throat
noisily that was two years ago
black i havent pressed you

  i know there was a strange ex-
pression in the taxi drivers deep eyes
he laid the envelope on the senators
desk its there he said hoarsely
but senator  

  yes what

  id appreciate it if you could wait
a while i had to get it from a loan
shark they never let go those fellows
the interest-

  the senator waved his hand quite
impossible black i need the money

i made it easy for you cut the note
in half

  he reached out one hand and drew
the envelope to him terry black
watched it across the desk top and
greg cooper watched terry black
there was perspiration heavy on greg
coopers forehead again he was he
knew looking at an honorable man
who met his debts when they were
called whatever the price to himself
the taxi drivers shoulders slumped

  all right sir he said thank
you

  he turned to go and his eyes rested
on greg coopers desk and on the box
beside it the desk that was stacked
with currency and the box that was
filled with it his slightly stooped fig-
ure became rigid he stared hard and
then his eyes swung back to the sena-
tor bradford weller was counting
the money that he had taken from
the envelope and he did not look up
terry black swore under his breath
put his cap on his head and stalked
from the room greg cooper looked
after him

  he was an honorable man when he
came in he thought what was he
when he went out

  something had risen out of that
greed-polluted room and entered the
soul of terry black greg cooper had
seen it happen he passed the hand-
kerchief across his forehead and
looked toward the senator bradford
weller tossed the currency-stuffed en-
velope from one desk to the other

  two hundred and fifty more
cooper he said make a record of
it

  greg cooper made no comment
there were times when the words
at his command were inadequate to
express his thoughts or his feelings
he had no awe of the senator he had


detective fiction weekly

written speeches for bradford weller
that weller could never have written
himself he had written diplomatic
letters to irate constituents and he
had ferreted out the hidden hands
behind important bills so that the sena-
tor could line up on the right side
he had no more illusions about states-
manship and he knew the senator for
what he was yet strangely he had an
affection of a kind for the man the
affection of a foster parent for a
spoiled and detestable brat which has
nevertheless a helpless appeal brad-
ford weller couldnt walk alone in a
world of politics but he thought that
he could and he was quite vain cooper
granted him his vanity and watched
over him it was all part of a good
political secretarys job

  the room was quiet again cooper
made the pencil entry on a long sheet
and the ink entry in a ledger he
checked through the thin sheaf of tens
and twenties for which terry black
had entered the slave ranks of a loan
shark then tossed the bills into the
box with the rest

  the door at the end of the room
opened hito was bowing to the sena-
tor again

  misser george arlington you see
him yess

  at sound of the name cooper raised
his head sharply the senator came out
of his reverie yes yes of course
ill see him

  he was squaring away behind his
desk like a man of affairs rather than
like the idle dreamer of a long after-
noon he made a gesture toward
cooper

  you might drop the lid on that
box he said

  cooper had acted ahead of the com-
mand the box was closed and he was
stacking the last of the unchecked bills

in a desk drawer when the latest visi-
tor came in

george arlington was big

and expansive a massive study
in blue and gray six feet tall and over
two hundred pounds he looked like
a wealthy western cattleman dressed
for the city he was carrying a pearl
gray stetson of the broad-brim type
in his hand a broad white-toothed
smile split his bronzed face

  ah senator im glad to see you
a whiff of lilac blew across the room
and greg cooper wrinkled his nose
his eyes had narrowed and he was
sitting stiffly behind his own desk the
name george arlington had been fa-
miliar but he had been willing to grant
the fact that more than one man might
bear the name there was no mistak-
ing the big man in the gray suit and
the blue shirt however they had met
before greg cooper had been a news-
paper man then and big george had
been under indictment for fraud

 leave us alone for a while cooper
ill call you

  the senator had risen to his feet
big george half turned and the smile
left his face momentarily he was re-
membering cooper cooper was look-
ing at the senator

  do you know who this man is
he said curtly

  bradford weller frowned if you
are referring to mr arlington i am
quite familiar with-ah his record
hes a con man a darned good
one hes made his living by trimming
suckers for years and hes only slipped
once

  cooper this is embarrassing

  big george laughed not to me
senator a newspaper man never quite
gets the hang of being a gentleman
thanks
money to burn



  cooper looked the big man over
briefly the look of expansive geniality
had come back to george arlington
but his eyes had grown small and nar-
row they were small eyes normally
but arlington had learned the trick of
holding them wide open so that they
appeared frank and friendly he wasnt
holding them open while his face was
turned away from the senator greg
cooper stood his ground he faced the
senator once more

  embarrassing or not he said
this baby can get the fillings out of
your teeth dont buy anything from
him

  the senator threw back his head and
laughed his laugh was a sudden ex-
plosive sound in the room big
georges chuckle rumbled an accom-
paniment the two men looked at each
other and greg cooper was outside of
the secret that they shared he knew
that he was outside and that there was
nothing that he could do about it the
senator had taken the bit in his teeth
like this once before he had played
with a utility crowd at a time when
greg cooper told him that it was
political suicide to do so

  that was why bradford weller was
a senator now by courtesy only he
retained the title but the voters had
swept him out of office in the last elec-
tion and he was actually an ex-senator
cooper shrugged he could nurse and
jockey a man only to a certain point
beyond that point the man was on his
own he had thrown out his warning
and if the senator preferred to laugh
that was the senators business

  big george arlington blocked his
way to the door the con man was
holding out his hand no hard feel-
ings he said

  greg cooper took the extended hand
gravely they shook hands as two

fighters might shake before the open-
ing bell there was a grim smile on
greg coopers face

  no hard feelings he said

chapter ii

the promise

tf the mood of the senators study
was greed then the mood of the
big hall was fear mike deshler was
the symbol of it a bulky heavy-
shouldered man with the face of a
prize-fighter he sat in a straight chair
with a clear view of both the front
door and the door to the senators
study he had his arms folded across
his chest and his right hand was at
his armpit he was a guard who had
been hired by the day from a famous
detective agency to that extent had
bradford weller been careful he had
prepared against sudden violence

  but he had let george arlington
enter the room where he had over a
hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
currency

  cooper nodded to the guard and
crossed the hall a girl rose swiftly to
meet him from a big chair in the parlor
where she had been pretending to read
a magazine she was a slender girl
vividly dark her brown eyes wide with
worry

  greg she said ive been want-
ing to talk to you what is he going
to do

  greg cooper looked down into the
girls face all the prettier for its pallor
and his heart thudded painfully vivian
dawson had the capacity for stirring
his emotions as no other girl ever had
she was the lure that had held him
to his job on weary days when the
senator tried his patience and his soul
she was the senators orphaned niece
and because she was all that she was


detective fiction weekly

greg cooper refused to believe that
the senator was all that he appeared
to be

  i dont know what hes going to
do vi he said softly let us talk
it over a little

  he started into the old-fashioned
parlor with her and stopped there
was a tall thin man with long curling
gray hair in the easy chair by the win-
dow this was tim weller a federal
judge once in the long ago and the
elder brother of the senator tim wel-
ler had given up his own political
career when his brother started to
climb he was old now but still the
wiser of the two men when he cared
to speak his mind at the moment his
chin was on his chest and he seemed
to be asleep vivian spoke from behind
coopers right shoulder

  the little study might be better
she said

  they went together down the hall
to the small study which was used occa-
sionally by emily weller the senators
sister and ruler of his household the
senator was a bachelor and emily a
spinster she had been a shrewd hostess
in a town where a woman can make
or break a man by her skill in enter-
taining as though being in the room
that she used made discussion of her
inevitable vivian said softly

  greg i am worried and a little
frightened if aunt emily werent in
the hospital uncle bradford wouldnt
be bringing all of that money into the
house he is going to do something
rash

  her fear showed in her eyes greg
cooper bulked above her conscious of
her feminine daintiness her complete
desirability some streak of loyalty to
his chief made him say what he did not
entirely feel

  perhaps hes entitled to do what

he wants to do for a change emily
rides herd on him pretty hard

  she has to where would he be
if she didnt

 greg cooper shrugged he didnt
know if it was a good idea for women
to dominate men even for their own
good but he had to admit to his own
soul that emily weller had a better
brain and a sounder judgment than
her brother she was in the hospital
now for a minor operation and he had
not missed the significance of that fact
in connection with the senators talk
of surprises and the quick conversion
of assets into currency vivian daw-
son gripped his arm

  its that woman upstairs she said
tensely shes supposed to be my
house guest but she never comes near
me he had me invite her and she
stays in her room shes an adven-
turess greg hes going to run away
with her

  nonsense

  it isnt nonsense you can tell by
looking at her that she is the calcu-
lating type she used to be an actress
hes going to take all of his money
and run away with her

greg cooper tried to hold his
face in a poker mold he had
drawn conclusions of his own when
mildred harney was invited to the
weller estate in the absence of emily
weller but the senator had loved them
and left them before he wasnt the
marrying type

  the senator loves his money more
than he will ever love any woman
he said

  vivian tapped her foot but sup-
pose he doesnt think that the money
is his while he stays here that he has
no control over it that would make
a difference wouldnt it
money to burn



  greg cooper met her eyes it
would he said

  then thats the answer he wants
to take his money away where no one
else has any say about it except him-
self hes going to take this woman
with him greg he mustnt do it he
mustnt aunt emily has given him
too much he would leave her penni-
less

  she was beating with her small fists
against greg coopers chest and she
seemed unaware of what she was
doing she hadnt mentioned the sena-
tors name and reputation as a chip in
the game-and greg cooper did not
consider it a very big chip himself
the voters would never send brad-
ford weller back into the senate his
political career was done political ex-
pediency no longer anchored him

  with over a hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars in cash and a decorative
blonde companion bradford weller
would be as free as a bird in any coun-
try on the globe in france or england
no scandal would follow or touch him
his money would be his passport

  vivian dawson had been looking up
into coopers face and he never held
a poker expression long when she was
around sensing the fact that she had
scored a point with him she moved
to the other side of the room

  youve got to do something about
it greg she said youre the only
one who can

  cooper frowned he wasnt sure
that it was any of his business past a
certain point to interfere in what
might be a family matter of the sena-
tors he took a step toward the girl

  why worry about it vi he said
huskily youve never been happy
here ive been playing with the offer
of a job in cuba ill take it like a
shot if-

  the girl was standing motionless
youre asking me to run away from
responsibility greg

  he dropped his eyes it isnt your
responsibility

  he felt that he should argue the
point with her and prove to her that
she was not concerned in what the sena-
tor did but he found that the words
wouldnt come he wanted to take vi
dawson out of here and give her a
home of her own-his home but the
senator and his piles of currency could
not be dismissed with a gesture and a
word there was drama building up
in this old house on mount vernon
boulevard drama and perhaps
tragedy vi dawson was still looking
at him

  aunt emily would stop him from
running away with a blonde actress
and losing his money she said but
we cant worry her while she is in
the hospital weve got to do some-
thing ourselves

  its his life vi-and his money
it isnt a man cant take all his
money and run out on his wife can
he well aunt emily has managed his
house for him better than most wives
would she hasnt any money of her
own he would leave her penniless
the girl was becoming angry
angry girls become unreasonable if
they arent headed off greg cooper
mopped his forehead he was more
at home in a mans world and he knew
how to argue with people like the
senator he was conscious too of an
inherent handicap-he was by nature
reasonable he could see both sides of
an argument so clearly that he
couldnt become steamed up over either
side

  youve got to think of the senator
himself too she said no flashy
young woman like mildred harney is

really in love with an old man like
uncle bradford shell get all his
money and shell ruin his reputation
and-

  greg cooper grinned wryly and
his friends wont speak to him and the
post office wont deliver his mail
and- he became suddenly grave and
gripped the girls shoulders with strong
fingers im not a meddler vi if this
girl is going to marry him ive got to
stay out if it is a swindle im going
to stay in

  and youll stop him from running
away until youre sure

  thats a big order

  if you dont ill find some way to
do it

 how

  some way hes my dead mothers
brother i havent any other family
left

 her voice was breaking greg
cooper gripped her by the elbows
lifted her off the floor and kissed her
squarely on the mouth before she had
time to turn her head he was a little
bit shaken as he set her down and his
voice was husky

  sit tight vi he said i dont
know whats up but whatever it is
ill find a way to block it until we
know

  he was thinking of george arling-
ton more than he was of the glamorous
mildred harney vi dawson held the
tips of her fingers against her lips

  thats a promise she said

  cooper nodded solemnly its a
promise

chapter iii

a bargain in burglary

mildred harney was sitting
in the parlor with tim weller
when greg cooper came back down

the hall with vi dawson the old man
was wide awake now and talking in
a slow drawl about the old days when
actors did their acting on a stage

  they didnt can human bodies in
celluloid and human voices in wax
then he said not in my day

  the blonde girl laughed she made
a vivid picture with the sunlight
streaming through the window on her
she was dressed in shimmery green
that molded tightly to her shapely
body she had one leg crossed over the
other and she kept the balanced leg
swinging her teeth were a startling
white and she wore her makeup lightly
but for all of her spectacular quality
she did not seem quite real vi daw-
son sighed

  she is beautiful she said reluc-
tantly greg cooper squeezed her arm

  wax fruit looks swell in a bowl
he said but its pretty disappointing
as fruit

  thanks greg youre being
sweet

  vi dawson left him and went into
the parlor coopers eyes followed her
briefly there was an easy grace in
her a gallant straightness to her shoul-
ders vi dawson didnt have to pick
a setting or put on an act to win mascu-
line attention she had only to be
herself

  hito the japanese was standing in-
side the front door with his hands
clasped behind his back greg cooper
stopped beside him

  did mr arlington come out yet
no sar he still talk to misser
senator weller yess

  okay tell the senator i had to
go down town for an hour

  greg cooper went out into the
balmy air of late afternoon it was
indian summer weather and traffic
flowed in a steady stream along the
money to burn



paved memorial highway he tooled
his car out of the broad parking strip
behind the house and joined the pro-
cession of cars that was moving down
the pavement to washington

  im a sap and a meddler he said
but perhaps i am performing a pub-
lic service at that

  he was frowning at the winged
goddess on his radiator cap behind
him he was leaving a house that con-
tained over a hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars in currency before him
lay hannigans joint on ninth street
and he hoped a date with beau brid-
well one of the last of the old time
cracksmen

  twenty-two minutes after leaving
the senators house he pulled his car
to the ninth street curb there was
a burlesque house and a hamburger
place a couple of chili parlors several
saloons two theaters specializing in
grade b westerns-and hannigans

  hannigans was a restaurant and a
saloon and a club of sorts burglars
pickpockets petty grifters and yegg-
men down on their luck made a hang-
out of hannigans and big steve han-
nigan minded his own business he
knew his customers by name and repu-
tation and business but if they behaved
themselves in his place he didnt care
what they might plan there against
the peace and the well-being of other
people the police kept an eye on him
but they didnt tap anybody on the
shoulder in hannigans they made
their collars outside on the whole it
was a decent place a little long on
odors and short on beauty but dis-
creetly shadowed and fitted with booths
that were not sounding boards

  beau bridwell wasnt there but
hannigan knew where he could be
found ill have him here in five
minutes skipper he said cooper

seated himself in a booth ordered a
beer and waited beau bridwell showed
up in four minutes flat hannigans
service was always good

the years had not been kind to
bridwell he was undersized and
stoop-shouldered and he entered a door
with a kind of furtive duck that
brought him in sidewise his pasty
white face was covered with dirty gray
stubble his eyes rolled uneasily under
bushy eyebrows that were already
gray

  you got something for me mr
cooper he croaked hannigan says
you were askin

  thats right beau have a beer

  cooper gave the order for the beer
which would keep hannigan from but-
ting in for a few minutes he was
measuring bridwell thoughtfully it
was hard to believe that this shabby
little down-and-outer had once been
an aristocrat of the underworld a
master hand at the art of opening
safes

  ive got a box to be opened beau
he said

  the little man jerked convulsively
his lips worked nix im all washed
up one more rap would finish me
im running straight mr cooper

  this is straight beau ill take the
responsibility i am senator wellers
secretary ill let you into his house and
you open the box you do not steal
anything and you wont have to run
from cops or worry about burglar
alarms

  the little man stopped the nervous
jerking of his features he lived in
a world of sharp dealing of chiseling
of games and rackets that played along
the fringe of the law his eyes stopped
rolling and concentrated shrewdly on
coopers face he saw an angle and

he was wondering how far he could
play along in safety

  you aint risking a swell job and
a rep to glom some of the senators
marbles he said finally i guess may-
be i can work for you

  okay cooper was relieved can
you still open a safe by listening for
the tumblers to fall

  beau bridwell wet his lips if the
box is  or before that yes after
that maybe one o them new boxes
no

  its pretty old

  thats swell

  the little man took a deep draught
of the beer he wiped his lips with
his fingers if you wasnt a friend
o mine when you was on the papers
i wouldnt touch it he said but
friend or no friend i gotta have a bit
o money for my work i gotta have
it now

  how much

  bridwells eyes narrowed a hun-
dred bucks cooper

  i havent got that much money on
me beau

  ill take a check i aint scared o
rubber in your paper

  the little man had thrown off his
air of frightened humility cooper had
come to him and cooper had hired
him for a job that no one else could
do the thought gave him dignity he
had a certain grim stubbornness under
the dignity too measuring him
cooper knew that the man would stand
on the demand for a hundred dollars
and not a cent less cooper laid his
check flat on the sticky table top and
wrote

  one hundred dollars beau you
wont get drunk on me

  this beer is my last i dont drink
when ive got a job to do

  thats the spirit get out to the

senators house on mount vernon
highway at three am the back door
will be unlocked and ill be waiting
for you better hire a car and leave
it alongside the highway

  okay beau bridwell took one
look at the check and folded it away
swiftly there was a tightening in the
mans slack lips a gleam in his eye
cooper rose slowly he could read in
the mans face the reason for the swift
acceptance of the check idea the fix-
ing of the amount above what a man
might be expected to carry in his
pocket

  that check was beau bridwells in-
surance against a frame-up or a slip
it was his proof of employment by
greg cooper coopers lips twisted in
a wry grin

  he stepped out of the booth and
stopped short with surprise terry
black the taxi driver was sitting on
a stool at the bar with a straight
whiskey in his hand and his eyes fixed
on the booth when he saw coopers
eyes on him he turned his back and
huddled over the whiskey glass greg
coopers eyes narrowed

  he strode out to his car he had
taken a long step if everything went
all right tonight he would take a hun-
dred and fifty odd thousands of dollars
from the senators safe provided that
he was not interrupted he would take
that money and hide it in a panel that
he had discovered years ago in the
parlor mantel there would be hell to
pay in the morning but until the sena-
tor found his money he would not be
able to lose any of it to blondes con-
fidence men or second story workers

  it was not stealing money he told
himself it was removing it from the
control of its owner during a period
of danger i know the senator bet-
ter than he knows himself he
money to burn



thought he isnt smart enough to go
up against professional talent and win
by shifting the stakes out of the way
ive got a chance of confusing the
players and of finding out what the
senator is up against

  but he was not entirely reassured
whatever the moral issue might be
there would be a period of time be-
tween the safe and the mantel panel
when he would be in the eyes of the
law a burglar

chapter iv
blazing currency

pvinner at bradford wellers
was a dull meal for everyone
except the senator himself the sena-
tor enjoyed it because he made no
attempt to follow the desperate at-
tempts that were made at conversation
and because he paid no attention to
anyone save himself he found his
own thoughts not only satisfying but
exciting

  he was on the verge of a big step-
the adventure of his career a secret
blazed in his brain and the knowledge
that no one shared that secret in its
entirety was thrilling knowledge he
felt like a minor god with power over
the lives of others he looked down
the table

  there was vi dawson a sweet child
in her way and quite pretty he felt
a little bit sorry for her because the
girl would probably have to bear the
brunt of her aunts peevishness when
this business was done he didnt envy
her the experience

  but cooper will probably marry
her he thought a good man
cooper

  he smiled smugly next to the satis-
faction that he felt over breaking free
from the thralldom of his sister

emily he was most pleased over the
fact that he was going to put one over
on cooper cooper had been right too
often in the past it would be good
to surprise him to shock him and to
see the consternation on his face

  cooper will probably catch hell
from little vivian too unless i miss
my guess that business of his down
town had something to do with me
vivian would like to keep me safely on
ice till emily gets back from the hos-
pital

  his eyes glittered he felt a hard
pounding under his ribs the speeded
action of his heart that always ac-
companied waves of hatred the mere
thought of emily weller was enough
to make his heart hammer

  two years older than himself she
had always dominated him she was
invincibly right on everything an irre-
sistible force that would brook no ob-
stacle when she was moving toward an
objective-and an immovable object
when she settled down to block a
project that she did not approve true
she was a strong character she had
shared his lean days and she had
worked tirelessly in the face of many
defeats she had steered his career
over many a treacherous social reef
and she had saved him a score of times
from making an imperishable fool of
himself

  he granted her everything that she
was and everything that she had been
-and still he hated her he had hated
her for years and she didnt know
he had played the hypocrite with her
-the loving and appreciative brother
-because he lacked the courage to
force an issue for his own hypocrisy
he hated her

  if i were free i would be dif-
ferent

  he had said that often when feel-


detective fiction weekly

ings of personal inferiority goaded
him he changed that refrain now to
when i am free and his soul soared
he was going to avenge himself on
them all-on those who had been right
when he had been wrong and who had
made him feel inferior with their
rightness he would be nobodys man
nobodys creation nobodys responsi-
bility at the same time he would as-
sume no responsibility for anyone else
he was looking at his brother tim
from beneath narrowed lids

  tim too had always been an irri-
tation tim never forgot that he was
the eldest of the family showing his
age noticeably and far less active than
bradford tim had still retained his
ego dismissing with a snort the things
which he personally did not approve
refusing to argue and standing pat on
the fact that politically bradford
wteller was his own creation his own
special protege-the man whom he had
boosted and coaxed and jockeyed into
the senate and into political power

  the fact that bradford weller knew
himself for a pawn that his brother had
moved made his resentment deeper
he walked in his brothers shadow
even now when long years led back
to the day when tim wellers name
had meant anything by itself

  bradford weller had his own repu-
tation but he could not forget that the
reputation had been made for him
given to him

  there had been times when his
stomach had rolled and he had turned
sick with thoughts like these but not
tonight tonight he would break them
all upon the shock of his surprise

  all no he looked at mildred har-
ney and his expression softened she
wore soft blue tonight and there was
heaven in a color like that when the
woman who wore it had hair that

formed a golden aureole about her
head he would not break her he
would never break her or hurt her
she was his recompense for long years
of inferiority and his reward for the
bold stroke that would end those years

  with the thought the senator was
young again the years dropped from
him he was no longer a veteran of the
political arena with a governorship and
two senate terms behind him he was
a man who had won the love of a
glorious golden woman

tinner was over a meal so
smoothly and effortlessly served
by the faultless hito that one was not
aware of service at all the senator
looked around the table

  i would like to see you all in my
study within the next ten minutes
he said

  he rose and mildred harney was
beside him her hand rested lightly
caressingly on his arm he looked
down into her eyes and was conscious
of a wave of excitement her eyes
were ice blue and yet in the depths
he saw a warm glowing spark he
laid his hand over hers and liked the
softness of the contact

  the others were taking his ten
minutes provision literally so he
walked on to the study with the girl
the grim-visaged mike deshler was
on guard before the door the senator
nodded to him

  come in after the others do he
said i will want you

  mike deshler touched his forehead
with two fingers in a rough salute
the senator unlocked the study door
and clicked the switch which con-
trolled the wall bracket lights they
were soft lights and did not emphasize
the mark of the years upon his face
he could see himself in the mirror over

	d-
money to burn



the mantel and in tailcoat and white
tie he looked taller than his five feet
ten his wig had cost him a thousand
dollars in paris and not even an expert
could tell that it was not his own hair
he had been careful too about his
teeth when his upper plate was made
he had had the dentist put gold crowns
on two of the teeth and fillings in
three of the others his own teeth had
not looked more real

  he squared his shoulders and turned
to the girl you still believe in me
mildred he said softly

  her fingers tightened on his fore-
arm and her face lifted to his you
know i do bradford she said in
everything

  he squeezed her fingers and released
her give me your support tonight
he said after that  

  there was a promise in his voice
and she smiled back at him he looked
at his old-fashioned safe in the corner
of the room and then at the two boxes
beside coopers desk a chuckle rose
in his throat he rubbed his hands to-
gether and went behind his desk
mildred harney sat down and
stretched her legs straight out before
her

  the door opened and tim weller
came in tim was a six-footer a bony-
faced man with sunken eyes that
glowed as cleanly as the eyes of a
young man he had never had much
to do with dentists and the few teeth
that he had left were discolored he
was biting a cigar with them now and
looking at his brother from under
bushy gray brows bradford weller
did not meet that questing regard

  greg cooper and vi dawson had
stopped outside the dining room door

  im a silly person greg and bad
company and hard to get along with
and-

	d-

  and a nail biter a fireplug parker
an eater of hot dogs with soda pop
and-

  stop im serious i know when
im dreadful but greg im worried
and scared and i cant help myself all
of that money in the house means
trouble and uncle brad isnt himself
you wont let me down greg you
wont let him be swindled or-

  i gave you a promise vi

  i know

  they went down the hall together
the senator watched them come in
with a cynical smile on his lips it
was a newly developed theory of his
that the young neither felt nor under-
stood the true meaning of love young
emotions he felt were essentially shal-
low subject to too many future
stresses which they probably would not
survive only rich maturity could know
the full flower of love he looked at
mildred harney and his shoulders un-
consciously squared mike deshler
and hito had come in he had his
full audience

olowly with complete apprecia-
 tion of the dramatic hush in the
room the senator moved out from
behind his desk he stood as he had
often stood before the senate his head
thrown back his audience in a semi-
circle about him he had a speech to
deliver too and his eyes were glitter-
ing points of light behind slitted lids
he would give them the speech and
he would watch it strike and wound
them watch them stiffen writh the
shock of what he was going to do it
was to be his night

  a man with money has no private
life he said slowly he is a target
for relatives who need help for or-
ganizations that believe that they need
help for chiselers and crooks and

prospective heirs who are impatient
for him to die

  his voice rose i have had too much
of all that and i am through i know
enough of the law to know how diffi-
cult is the way of escape if i make
a gift of the money that i own a rela-
tive might possibly block that gift by
challenging my competence if i try to
spend it in my own way i am open to
suits and annoyance and interference

  he pounded his right fist into his
open palm there is one thing that
i can do with my money-beyond any
appeal to the courts and beyond any
other appeal i am going to do that one
thing

  he balanced himself like a shot-
putter then literally hurled his words
into the room i am going to burn
every dollar of it he said

  he stopped and let the echo of his
words hang he saw vi dawson sit
up stiffly saw tim wellers teeth bite
clean through his cigar saw the for-
ward thrust of greg coopers body
only mildred harney held control of
her facial muscles she bent slightly
forward and she squeezed hard on her
tiny handkerchief with her right hand
but she was unshaken

  his heart glowed and invincibility
swept in a torrent through his veins
she was with him and she was game
he hadnt told her what he was going
to do

  every dollar he repeated grimly
light the paper under that pile of
wood in the fireplace hito you
deshler come over here near my
desk

  he snapped his commands the ser-
vants moved forward and the spell
broke tim weller came to his feet
with a loud snort bradford youre
insane

  the senator met his glare i was

never saner in my life i am exercising
a privilege i am beset by leeches by
people looking to me for support and
by people waiting for me to die well
im fooling them when i get through
they will have nothing to get from
me because i will have nothing to
give

  he was wound up to a speech-mak-
ing mood but he ran down under the
baleful glare of his brother tim
weller tapped the floor with his cane

  leeches he snorted bah
youve lived off the brains of other
people all your life and you talk about
burning money your right to burn
money fiddlesticks no man has the
right to destroy what he didnt create
money is a form of wealth he shook
a long forefinger at his brother and
you never created wealth of any kind
in your life

  bradford weller felt his heart ham-
mering hard again he took a back-
ward step and cursed himself inwardly
for weakness he was afraid of his
brother afraid of the wrath in the
older mans eyes the conciliatory
habits of the years ate at his resolve
then behind him he heard the snap-
ping crackle of the flames as the paper
blazed under hitos match his back
stiffened at the sound

  nevertheless he said the money
is mine and i choose to burn it

  vivian dawson was standing she
turned toward greg cooper her wide
eyes appealing to him coopers jaw
was ridged hard his brows drawn
down bradford weller could see him
from where he stood facing his brother
and he decided suddenly that he was
afraid too of cooper cooper had a
keen brain and he thought things
through he would have to throw
cooper off balance

  hito he said you will unpack
money to burn



those boxes beside mr coopers desk
check the packages out cooper desh-
ler come over closer to where im
standing

  he looked into his brothers eyes as
he gave his commands the anger
seemed to have drained from tim
weller or if the anger still burned in
him he lacked the energy to throw it
off in words he sat down heavily

  the money is in your name he
said

hvian dawson threw one
v more despairing look at greg
cooper and when he did not speak
she faced the issue herself please
uncle brad she said youll leave
aunt emily penniless

  bradford wellers lips thinned to
a tight line the mere mention of
emily wellers name was enough to
steel him in his resolve

  the best means of making sure
that your aunt emily does no worry-
ing about my future he said is for
me to ignore hers

  he turned his back on vivian daw-
son and on his brother hito looked up
at him sweat heavy on his yellow face
his small black mustache limp the
senator felt perspiration heavy on his
own forehead the trickle of it down
his spine

  feed that money to the fire hito
he said as fast as mr cooper can
check it

  the japanese made a clicking sound
with his tongue and looked at greg
cooper cooper nodded to him i put
rubber bands around the bills and
wrote the amount of each package on
a tag he said huskily read the
amounts to me

  the senator felt the support of his
armed guard deshler at his back and
the need for him tim weller had half

risen in his place again vivian daw-
son had taken a step forward-and
greg cooper had hesitated hito
picked up the first package

  one sousand dollar he said

  cooper said check and the pack-
age hit the flames

chapter v
death

tt was very warm in the study
of bradford weller as the flames
in the open fireplace mounted higher
and the crouching japanese continued
to feed them with packages of bills

  one sousand two hundrer dollar

  check

  the litany went on as hito called
the amounts and cooper checked them
off his sheet mildred harney camc
over beside the senator and squeezed
his arm he patted her hand

  good girl he said

  he knew himself that it was an
absurd remark but he felt stiff and
uncomfortable and a little frightened
there was a feeling of doom in the
room as though that small group of
people concentrating upon the blazing
money threw off waves of hostile
force

  tim weller was sitting like a statue
carved out of ancient wood his hands
crossed over the head of his cane and
his eyes expressionless vivian daw-
son was looking bitterly at greg
cooper mike deshler had his big fists
clenched and the perspiration was run-
ning in large rolling beads through
the seams in his battered face

  one hundred thousand dollars
isnt that enough to burn

  greg coopers voice snapped
through the tension in the room he
had his pencil suspended and lie
checked hito with his other hand while


detective fiction weekly

he waited for the answer to his ques-
tion the senator shook his shoulders
he smiled grimly

  i said every dollar cooper

  okay cooper matched the sena-
tors shrug with one of his own hito
moistened his lips with the tip of his
tongue and lifted another package

  one sousand dollar

  check

  vivian dawson rose with a sharp
exclamation and hurried from the
room greg coopers eyes followed her
miserably and he missed one of the
packages hito caught his mistake for
him and did the arithmetic

  two package he said two sou-
sand dollar total yess

  double check

  bradford weller smiled he was
feeling good again he had been chal-
lenged to stop and he had asserted
himself he felt invincible the blonde
girl had one leg across the corner of
his desk and she was very close to him
even closer than the physical contact
he told himself there was a mental
bond she had shown her faith in him
she had not protested his right to do
as he wished with his own money
even though she must have wanted that
money for herself it was the ultimate
test of human love

  the senator was feeling better than
he ever had when tim weller rose
and went out of the room without a
word the senator smiled the symbol
of his enslavement to relatives and
responsibility was going up in smoke
the relatives themselves were walk-
ing out on the show he almost wished
that his sister emily could be here

  he had a chill feeling along his
spine at the thought of her being here
and his heart hammered hard against
his ribs he had to drive even the
thought from his mind if he were to

enjoy his triumph she was so com-
pletely the ruler of this house and the
dominator of all men that he might
not even be able to command the alle-
giance of cooper and of hito if she
were here

  she wont be able to do a thing
he reflected

  that was a thought that pleased him
and he held to it he would be out
of the reach of her wrath when she
learned what had happened and she
would be helpless to undo what he had
done the idea of emily being help-
less was the most pleasant thought of
all

  there were only a few packages
more and he watched them hit the
flames and catch fire with a feeling of
unholy glee hito staggered a little
from the effects of the heat as he rose
to his feet greg cooper made a couple
of marks with his pencil

  one hundred and fifty-four thou-
sand seven hundred and sixty-five
dollars he said mechanically

  the senator rubbed his hands
thats fine he said

  fine if you think so

  greg cooper hurled the pencil into
the fire and stalked out of the room
the senator called to him and he did
not turn around the door slammed
behind him and hito looked to the
senator for instructions

t radford weller looked at
the fire scatter the ashes well
hito he said people have been
known to obtain treasury redemptions
on burned currency

  he took an envelope from his
pocket your pay deshler he said
i doubled the regular rate to take
care of the overtime

  thank you sir you wont need
me any more
money to burn



  theres nothing left to guard
  good night sir

  mike deshler walked out like a
punch drunk fighter bradford weller
grinned after him mike deshler would
open that envelope and find twenty
dollars-and mike deshler would re-
member that he had seen nearly a hun-
dred and sixty thousand dollars go
up in smoke mike deshler would
probably get drunk

  mildred harney swung her leg down
from the edge of the desk she gripped
the lapels of the senators dinner coat
and raised her face to his

  i think youre wonderful she
said that was the bravest thing that
i have ever seen anyone do

  he put his arm around her and ob-
livious to the presence of hito in the
room he kissed her hard on the mouth
he held her then at arms length

  and you dont mind if i am prac-
tically broke

  not a bit you have ability i be-
lieve in you

  he patted her shoulders you are
a wonderful girl

  she kissed him then swiftly-and
wheeling ran from the room he
looked after her and he could feel
the rush of his own blood she was
his he would take her with him when
he left he would take her to new
york after that there was excite-
ment in his brain but he had held win-
ning cards before in his lifetime he
would collect the winnings of the hand
that he held before he started to worry
about the next hand that would be
his life from now on

  he had made no definite promises
to the girl and a girl so obviously crazy
about him might not insist upon mar-
riage

  he watched hito as the japanese
completed his dispersement of the

ashes then he took a decanter from his
desk and poured himself a brandy

  a big night hito he said

  yess sar

  the japanese waited bradford
weller waved one thin hand that
will be all hito

  yess sar

  the door closed and bradford
weller was alone he finished his
brandy looked around the room tri-
umphantly and realized suddenly that
he was tired it had been a strain and
he had acquitted himself well under
circumstances far from easy

  ill go to bed he said

  he went out into a hall that was
silent and deserted mildred he sup-
posed had retired his eyes gleamed
at the thought of her the others
well there was little to keep them up
he found amusement in the thought of
cooper he had scored on cooper
more heavily even than he had hoped

  cooper had been shocked and sur-
prised into complete helplessness he
hadnt even had one of his customary
wisecracks to cap it all cooper was
in bad with vivian for not doing some-
thing heroic the senator chuckled
its no time for her to be acting
uppity and independent he said she
hasnt got a dime

  he was feeling like a minor god
again he had stretched out his hand
and he had scrambled lives around
with it every person in that room
would date time from this night he
had changed the course of every life
with the possible exception of desh-
lers even little hito would find things
different he would probably have to
hunt another job when emily came
back and found her meal ticket gone

  they made me eh well let them
make themselves

  he was in his room with the door

closed and he was very tired his head
ached a little and he was glad to re-
move the wig he climbed slowly out
of his evening clothes he had never
been able to abide a valet but there
were times when he wished that he
had one he lacked even the energy for
a shower he filled a glass of water
put his teeth into it and got into his
pajamas he turned out the light then
and threw himself gratefully upon the
bed

  staring up into the darkness he
imagined that he could see the leaping
flames again flames that danced on
stacks of currency-a danse macabre
for the hopes of those who had planned
to inherit freedom had come to him
from those flames-and he was not
through yet he had another surprise
in store he chuckled

  he did not hear the door open a
figure glided across the room and he
was not aware of the intruder until
he sensed a presence by his bed he
blinked to clear the vision of the flames
from his eyes and he saw the flash
of the knife coming down   

chapter vi
noises in the night

greg cooper slammed the door
of the senators study behind
him with mingled emotions he was
angry because he had just witnessed
the clumsy playing of an inept game
-and because he had been placed in
a position where he did not have a
card to play himself nor an opportunity
to explain to vivian dawson

  the pr 

  he looked into the parlor and into
the small study with a vague hope that
he might find her waiting for him
she wasnt in either place and he took
the stairs with long strides

  vivian dawsons room was to the
left from the head of the stairs
mildred harneys room adjoined it
and was connected to it by the bath-
room which they shared cooper
knocked on vivians door and waited
there was no answer and he knocked
again

  vi he called vi

  he heard her stir as though she had
risen from a chair or from the bed
but she did not come near the door
he tried again

  vi he called listen ive got
to talk to you

  go away her voice came muffled

  please vi 

  go away theres nothing you can
say nothing

  his face was grim and he was try-
ing to frame a phrase that would tip
her off to enough of the truth to in-
trigue her there was a soft step in
the hall behind him mildred harney
was standing there with her hands on
her hips a hard smile on her full
lips

  whats the matter kid wont the
girl friend talk to you she said
mockingly

  he looked at her with unfriendly
eyes you came up those stairs pretty
softly he said

  her eyes met his and there was none
of the melting sweetness in her that
the senator saw should i tramp
she said

  tramp is an apt word

  oh

  they stared at each other with un-
disguised hostility dislike had been
mutual from the moment of their first
meeting but the buttons were frankly
off the foils now cooper rammed his
hands in his pockets and moved toward
the stairs he no longer wanted to talk
to vi dawson unless vi dawson came
money to burn



downstairs this blonde woman was
too soft-footed

  remind me to tell you some time
why you flopped as an actress he
said

  did i flop there was ice in the
inquiry

  you did-and you made the same
mistake tonight

  he was moving down the stairs she
stamped her foot maybe youll be
working for me too she said and
then i-

  guess again

  he didnt look back he was angry
but he hoped that vi had heard the
conversation it might make her curi-
ous he could feel the flush still in his
face he wasnt normally unchivalrous
but he disliked hypocrites intensely
he particularly did not like young
women hypocrites who pretended to be
in love with dizzy old men

  hito was coming out of the senators
study and the little japanese had a nod
and a white-toothed grin for him
worlds might fall but as long as hito
still had jobs to do he would meet his
responsibilities grinning-and with a
bow thrown in for good measure if
there was anyone around who rated a
bow

  ill be using the little study for a
while hito he said

  yess sar

  cooper went down the hall there
was a phone in emily wellers study
and he dialed hannigans number
hannigan himself answered

  this is cooper hannigan is beau
bridwell there

  bridwell nope he left a while
ago in a taxi mr cooper he wasnt
drinking a thing so i dont figger hell
be back

  okay thanks

  cooper hung up with a frown

things got more and more complicated
and this was something that he couldnt
figure it was only a few minutes after
eleven and bridwell wasnt due out
here until three leaving hannigans in
a taxi particularly when he wasnt
drinking was an illogical play there
was a rent-a-car place within easy
walking distance of hannigans

  im letting little things worry me
he growled it doesnt make any dif-
ference

  he heard the senator close the study
door and mount the stairs hito was
putting out lights in the rear of the
house in a few minutes hito would
be through and then the japanese
would go out to his own room over
the garage behind the house and every-
thing would be quiet cooper rubbed
his eyes

  and i have to stay awake until
three nice going

already he could feel the tomb-
like silence settling upon the old
house it would be no cinch to stay
awake even with all that he had to
think about he smoked a cigarette and
heard hito putting out lights in the
big study

  cooper gave the man fifteen minutes
to clean up whatever odd chores he
might have to do in the rear of the
house then rose and went back through
the kitchen there was no sign of hito
and the rear door was locked cooper
was on the point of unlocking it but
he stopped with his hand on the catch
withdrew it and snapped his fingers
it will be time enough to do that
when i come down at three oclock

  he went back through the house
turned out the light in the little study
and ascended the stairs his room was
in the rear of the house just across the
hall from tim wellers the doors of


detective fiction weekly

all the rooms were closed but there was
a line of light under vivians door and
he stopped he was about to knock
softly when he became aware of the
fact that vivian was speaking to some-
one he stopped with his hand raised
and then the other voice answered

  he could not distinguish words but
the second voice was the voice of the
blonde mildred harney

  he let his hand drop and went slow-
ly up the hall it was natural enough
that two girls who occupied connecting
rooms should be having a goodnight
conversation but he wasnt quite happy
about it under present circumstances
mildred harney would not be talking
to vi out of any feeling of affection
she was the kind of a person who had
axes to grind and she was likely to
be in a mood for knifing greg cooper
in the back with a great deal of en-
thusiasm

  and i cant help that he went
into his room and snapped on the light
a shower would he reflected be a help
he slipped out of the dinner clothes
he could not however dismiss from
his mind the thought of vivian daw-
son

  if she had only talked to me in-
stead of the blonde he thought

ivian dawson herself was
unhappy she left her uncles study
with the feeling that she had been let
down that greg cooper had failed
her when she needed him most the
shock of her uncles bitter speech and
of his destruction of the money had
been hard enough to bear but greg
coopers failure to make a fight on the
issue had been disillusioning

  he was so weak so helpless and
after promising me so much

  she entered her room blindly and
threw herself down upon the bed i

never want to talk to him again
never

  she was still crying into her pillow
when he knocked she ignored him at
first then she rose slowly two in-
stincts were at war within her she
wanted to ignore him completely-and
she wanted to tell him what she
thought of him as she stood in the
middle of the room with her fists
clenched she saw her own reflection
in the mirror there were two streaks
down her cheeks where the tears had
flowed and her fists had rubbed the
tears

  she crossed to the mirror and lifted
her powder-puff from the bureau top
she heard the voices in the hall and the
patting motion of the powder-puff
slowed she could not distinguish the
words but she knew that mildred har-
ney was out there with greg and
curiosity got the better of her she
walked softly to the door she recog-
nized gregs voice and was able to
distinguish the tail end of a sentence

     and you made the same mistake
tonight

  the blonde girls voice replied
maybe youll be working for me too

  vivian flushed and turned away
from the door she didnt want to be
an eavesdropper and hadnt intended
to be one

  she walked back to the mirror
but when she picked up the pow-
der-puff she stopped with it in her
hand and forgot that she had it her
eyes were staring at her own reflection
and she was looking beyond it her
mind running in desperate circles

  he hasnt been friendly with her
and fooling me he couldnt

  the fact that greg cooper had been
talking to the blonde girl about a mis-
take that she had made however did
not make sense and she couldnt ex-
money to burn



plain satisfactorily to herself the girls
allusion to work

  mildred harney had entered the ad-
joining room vivian heard her mov-
ing around her chin came up and she
headed for the connecting bathroom

  im going to talk to her ive got
to know what she plans to do

  she reached the door just as the
blonde girl entered the bathroom from
the other door mildred harney stepped
swiftly into the bathroom and closed
her own door behind her

  you startled me

  im sorry vivians lips felt stiff
i wanted to talk to you

  sure mildred harney seemed
nervous she pulled at the doorknob
behind her and then strode into viv-
ians room

  ive been wanting to talk to you
too she said im sorry about what
happened tonight kid

  are you

  sure

  you could have stopped him from
burning that money he would have
listened to you

  the blonde girl smiled and shook her
head it would have cost me too much
kid hed figure that i was more inter-
ested in his money than in him
vivians eyes came up level
werent you

  did i act like it its gone isnt it
vivian blinked there didnt seem to
be any answer to that but the blonde
girl was too flip too casual and too
sure of herself and she was friendly
after a fashion tonight when she had
always been aloof there was an air of
triumphant excitement about her that
did not seem natural in a girl who had
merely won an old man while losing
his money vivian stared at her
thoughtfully the blonde girl looked
away

  you were a very good sport about
it vivian said

  so were you swell the blonde
girl patted her shoulder with an im-
pulsive gesture she was nervous how-
ever and seemed anxious to get away
she looked several times toward the
connecting door ive got to get the
beauty sleep she said

  vivian let her go there were many
things that she wanted to ask but she
couldnt ask them the conversation was
pitched on too unreal a note there
was no bond of contact between herself
and this girl the friendliness was all
on the surface

for ten or fifteen minutes after the
door had closed between them
vivian sat and stared at the wall she
hadnt been able to mention gregs
name at all she got up slowly and
slipped her shoulder straps as she
stepped out of the red evening gown
she heard the soft sound of subdued
voices her body stiffened

  there was a man in mildred har-
neys room

  the house seemed unnaturally still
except for that subdued cautious mur-
mur vivian took a swift step toward
the bathroom then stopped with her
face flushing it wasnt any of her
business if someone was in there she
didnt want to know about it

  she moved as far away from the
connecting bathroom as she could and
took off her other garments she
wanted to take a shower but she hesi-
tated finally she decided that she had
a perfect right to take a shower and
moved noisily toward the bathroom

  ill give them plenty of warning
ill let them know that im not spying
on them

  she could hear nothing when she
entered the bathroom she snapped the

catch which locked the door against mil-
dred harney and turned on the shower
it made a lot of noise and she was glad
of that her face still felt flushed

  it was probably uncle brad   
i dont care  it isnt any of my
business

  she scrubbed herself vigorously and
argued with herself as she scrubbed
then suddenly she stopped all move-
ment and stood stiffly under the
shower suppose that was greg in
there 

  the thought chilled her she tried
weakly to tell herself that she didnt
care but she was shaken and she hur-
ried with her toweling when she turned
off the shower she listened deliberately
at the door there were no voices at all
now and she flipped the catch off the
lock she went into her own room and
locked the bathroom door from her
side haste drove her and she slipped
swiftly into a pink nightgown and a
filmy negligee

  the hall was quiet and lighted by
only one dim bulb she moved along it
like a ghost and halted outside of her
uncles room her heart was thudding
painfully but she felt that she had to
know if he were in his own room or
not she stretched her hand out to the
knob then halted the gesture

  there was a tinkling sound from in-
side the room like the breaking of glass

  vivian backed away from the door
then turned and almost ran he is in
there it wasnt uncle brad

 she reached her own door and
stopped she looked toward greg
coopers door down the hall she
wanted to listen there too but she felt
embarrassed at the mere thought of
doing it she lifted her chin high i
dont care what he does

  the quiet of her own room smoth-
ered her but she threw herself down

on the bed and listened to the ticking of
her small clock each tick was like a
hammer stroke beating the foundations
of her life away tears welled into her
eyes but after a while she slept

  she woke with a jerk as though one
part of her mind had never been asleep
she knew that someone had passed her
door and that she had heard him pass
she sat bolt upright in the bed and the
murmur of voices came to her from
the other room not continued conver-
sation but merely occasional words-as
though two cautious people were trying
to converse with a minimum of words

  vivian rose slowly for several min-
utes she sat on the side of her bed and
she could no longer hear the voices
she looked at the small clock and saw
that it was twenty-five minutes to three
she had been awake for perhaps six or
seven minutes im being foolish

  she smoothed out her pillow and was
about to lie down once more when she
heard a faint sound down the hall like
the creaking of a door hinge she held
her breath and in a few seconds she
heard the sound again she got up and
moved to her door

  a man walked cautiously down the
hall toward her uncles room-or to-
ward the stairs she didnt know which
since she lost the sound of his foot-
steps after he passed her door

  its like a bad dream with frighten-
ing things happening and nothing that
one can do about them

  vivian went back to her bed looked
at it and looked at the clock it was
nineteen minutes to three she could
no longer hear voices in the next room
and the hall seemed quiet but she knew
that she couldnt sleep with that feel-
ing of dread and uncertainty hanging
over her

  it was a quarter of three she
reached for the negligee she put it on
money to burn



and slipped out into the hall she heard
no one and saw no one there was no
light under any of the doors she
moved down the hall hesitated a mo-
ment before her uncles door then
took a deep breath and turned the knob
she stepped into the room

chapter vii

the senators safe

greg cooper dozed during his
long vigil waiting for three
oclock in the morning when there is
nothing else to do but wait is a gruel-
ing test of a mans ability to keep
awake for a half hour cooper nodded
he came out of his doze with a quick
jerk

  he fumbled sleepily for his watch
he had a panicky feeling that he might
be late and a vague sense that some
sound had awakened him

  two thirty-two-and everything
quiet as a tomb

  he reassured himself on both counts
and stretched his muscles his eyes still
felt heavy and he decided that he could
not afford to risk another period of
inaction it was close enough to three
oclock to justify going downstairs
his watch had a luminous dial and he
had not needed a light he did not
chance disturbing anyone in the house-
hold with a light now he made his
way cautiously across the room and
opened the door gently his watch said
two thirty-five

  he didnt like the sound that the
hinge made and he waited in the door-
way listening due to the peculiar con-
struction of the stair well sound did
not penetrate the upper floor from the
first floor unless it was an unusually
sharp or loud sound but he was not
worried unduly about the possibility
of people being downstairs the chief

hazard as he saw it lay in restless
sleepers

  no sound came to him from any of
the rooms and he stepped out drawing
the door after him the hinge creaked
again but not as loudly as before he
balanced his weight on the balls of his
feet and moved down the hall to the
stairs

  he was taking his time he was en-
gaged in a burglary conspiracy no
matter how he might explain his mo-
tives to himself he could not afford to
be seen or delayed by any member of
a nerve-taut household he took the
darkened stairs a step at a time and
paused at the bottom his forehead
creased in a worried frown

  there was a line of light under the
door of the senators study

  he moved forward swiftly now his
nerves strung like fine wires beneath
his skin he had taken a half dozen
steps when he was conscious of move-
ment behind him a masked figure
seemed to rise from the ground and
there was a gun pressing against
coopers back

  take it easy the man growled
and walk straight ahead

  cooper grunted he had turned part-
ly into that gun but only an idiot would
try to turn the rest of the way he saw
no percentage in mock heroics

  i was going straight ahead when
you stopped me he said

  the man in the mask did not reply
he stayed close to cooper and cooper
marched before the study door cooper
came to a halt the gun barrel jabbed
him

  go on in

  there was more nervousness than
toughness in the man with the gun
cooper could sense that from the voice
and from the way in which the man
gave his orders cooper did not find


detective fiction weekly

the fact reassuring a nervous man
was likely to be more dangerous with
a gun than a tough man cooper
turned the knob and stepped into the
study

f   here was a little man crouched
in front of the safe his fingers
pressing the dial lightly at the sound
of the opening door he leaped to his
feet there was terror in his white face
as he turned and cooper swore
bridwell

  the man behind cooper relaxed he
evidently hadnt recognized cooper in
the darkness beau bridwell was lean-
ing against the safe for support

  you scared me mr cooper i-
i-

  you thought youd try a double-
cross

  oh no no sir

  baloney whos this wolf

  cooper turned the man with the
gun was holding it like a man in eve-
ning clothes holding a greasy tire iron
he no longer looked formidable
merely disconcerted cooper jerked the
loosely strung handkerchief from his
face and stared at him in astonishment

  the man with the gun was terry
black of the taxicab he flushed un-
der coopers hard stare but his mouth
was sullen there was a raw odor of
liquor about him

  i aint interested in anything but
whats mine he growled

  you mean the two hundred and
fifty dollars

  you bet

  it wasnt yours you owed it
maybe i was willing to admit that
i did if the senator needed the dough
it was his see but when i saw all
that money stacked up-

  okay it still isnt your money
  cooper turned back to bridwell his

jaw hard and you you doublecross-
ing chiseler i suppose you just got
here early and went to work eh

  yes sir thats how it was my
watch only cost a buck in the first place
and-

  and youre a liar you gave me the
doublecross you had my check if any-
thing went wrong and you were going
to glom off that money for yourself

  no you got me wrong on that

  there was white fear in beau brid-
wells face the fear of a man who has
served too many years behind gray
walls and who knows that he will never
come out if he goes in again cooper
stood with his hands on his hips his
eyes shifted from one man to the other
terry black showed less fear but he
was trembling with nervousness beau
bridwell kept moistening his lips

  two men to one and with a gun in
the hand of one of them they had the
advantage over cooper and they seemed
unmindful of it if they wanted the
contents of the safe enough to pull a
doublecross to get it they could still
carry out their original intention with
his check in beau bridwells pocket
greg cooper was in no position to call
for help the thought however did
not alarm him he felt there was no
need of help

  he was dealing with a broken yegg-
man who had dropped into the ranks
of petty thievery and with a desperate
taxi driver who had turned crooked
only because he had learned bitterness
and had washed his bitterness down
with too much liquor small time
crooks were always frightened by the
size of a big job their imaginations
were not equal to it they would steal
a hundred or two-and maybe slap a
man like cooper out of the way to get
it but a safe holding thousands was
frightening they let fright paralyze
money to burn



them cooper shoved his jaw forward
aggressively

  put that gun on the table black
he growled

  the taxi driver stopped trembling
for a second his eyes were hot with
defiance then he shrugged and laid the
gun down you got most of it
wrong he said this aint a double-
cross its a different deal thats all i
was going to bring beau out here even
if you hadnt got to him first i got des-
perate thinking of all the money i saw
out here and how much that two fifty
meant to me i was going to take it
back thats all

  cooper looked at him searchingly
and believed him he turned toward
bridwell and what were you going
to get

  bridwell passed his tongue over his
lips just a little stake for myself
guvner i was just going to take may-
be a thousand

strangely enough greg cooper
found himself believing bridwell
too it was the fear of big money again
beau bridwell had sunk to a level
where he knew that the mere posses-
sion of money in large amounts would
ruin him he wouldnt have dared to
take it-even with it lying under his
hands terry black was lighting a
cigarette

  it was a different deal he re-
peated i was going to blow beau was
going to hang around and when you let
him in he was going to open the box
again for you

  cooper nodded it was fantastic and
it was obviously fact beau bridwell
had merely hired himself out to two
different men-under agreement to
open the same safe twice in a night

  you set the time pretty close
he said

  beau bridwell shook his head

  not us we left lots o time we
were going to try that box at two bells
but there was somebody moving around
down here

cooper stiffened there was what
somebody down here in this room
the two men were looking at him
cooper shook his head slowly he was
regretting that nap that he had taken
upstairs

  did you get the box open he
asked

  bridwell shook his head nope but
i can do it

  okay open it up cooper sat on
the corner of his own desk he ges-
tured with one hand toward the ashes
in the fireplace there are people in
this house he said who will bet you
that there is a lot of money in those
ashes and nothing in the safe ill re-
verse the bet ill bet you that there is
nothing in the ashes and a lot of money
in the safe go to it

  the little cracksman looked at him
curiously and bent over the dial it was
hot in the study and very still as beau
bridwell stiffened with concentration
his head close to the steel door of the
safe and his eyes fixed in a stare that
was almost glassy he moved the dial
slowly calling upon the skill of his
youth-feeling for the fall of the tum-
blers

  greg cooper was holding his breath
it didnt seem quite real and his mind
refused to encompass the idea of per-
sonal danger he was looking at the
safe as earlier in the evening he had
looked at the fire in the open grate
that hadnt been real either

  he had refused to believe then that
it was possible for a man who had been
miserly with money all of his life to
deliberately destroy it as a gesture of
spite trickery and malice were belkjv-

able in bradford weller but never a
big irrevocable gesture

  cooper had been intrigued too by
the fact that the safe had remained
locked during all of the time that the
money was coming into the house
bradford weller the man who
squeezed money till it shrieked had
kept his safe locked and tossed bales of
currency into boxes

  it never had made sense and greg
cooper watched beau bridwells sensi-
tive fingers with a feeling of thrilled
anticipation when that door swung
open he expected to see currency in
stacks currency that had never been
destroyed and never intended for de-
struction

  beau bridwell was only four min-
utes at the safe four minutes that
seemed like hours then he straight-
ened his face was streaming with
sweat easy guvner he said hoarse-
ly a baby could a opened this old
can

  greg cooper came to his feet as
bridwell gripped the handle and pulled
the door open the little cracksmans
jaw dropped and he turned incredulous-
ly to cooper

  empty guvner he said some
papers but   

  greg cooper was beside him in a
stride he looked incredulously at the
yawning emptiness of the big box the
silence of the room blanketed on him
and he felt an emptiness within him
that corresponded to that of the safe

  he had sat tamely on the sidelines
while the senator had his bonfire and
he hadnt worried because he was sure
of his hypothesis now for the first
time it occurred to him that he might
actually have witnessed over a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars going up in
smoke

  beau bridwell wiped the back of his

hand across his forehead what now
guvner

  cooper turned to him-and stiffened
upstairs a woman screamed three
times

chapter viii

death without dignity

reg cooper charged across
the study he heard the other two
men behind him beau bridwells voice
was hoarse with fright

  we gotta lam he said

  it was no time to argue the ques-
tion greg cooper did not know what
he would encounter upstairs but what-
ever it was if it were sufficiently grave
to wring screams from vi dawson he
had no time to waste on beau bridwell
or terry black

  greg grabbed blacks revolver he
took the black stairs three steps at a
time and in the pale light of the upper
hall he saw vivian dawson she was
reeling away from the senators room
her arms held stiffly away from her
sides her features were rigid with
shock and her green negligee had
fallen away from the flimsy night-
gown beneath greg cooper put his
arm around her and steadied her

  vi what is it

it-its in there uncle brad dead

i	touched him 

  he looked toward the senators
room then turned mildred harney
was coming down the hall her face
was chalk white

  what has happened she said
greg cooper shook his head ill
find out take vi into her room will
vou

  sure

  the blonde girl seemed relieved at
having something to do she slipped
her arm over vivian dawsons shout-
money to burn



ders vivians lips tightened and she
straightened

  oh she said thank you im
all right

  she turned as though to go back to
the senators room but greg cooper
shook his head at the blonde girl and
went down the hall alone he stepped
into the senators room and closed the
door behind him before he flipped the
light switch

  bradford weller was lying on his
back in the bed with his glazed eyes
staring at the ceiling there was an
italian stiletto that had probably come
from his own collection buried hilt-
deep in his chest his fingers were
resting lightly upon the hilt as though
he had plunged the stiletto home and
then relaxed his grip as death took
him away

  in the cruel light of the central ceil-
ing fixture that he so seldom used his
bald head gleamed on the floor beside
the bed his false teeth lay with frag-
ments of broken glass about them

  greg cooper stared for a long min-
ute at the corpse and slowly shook his
head fake he said he never
killed himself

  he moved gingerly into the room
conscious of the fact that he must not
touch anything lest he disturb valuable
clews his mind raced over possibilities

  all that he was immediately sure of
was the fact that bradford weller
would never have taken his wig off and
removed his teeth if he were contem-
plating suicide the senators vanity
would have survived even death

  as it was death had found him
stripped of everything-even of dig-
nity

  he didnt figure to be murdered it
doesnt make sense

  cooper shook his head a few hours
ago bradford weller had made a show

out of the burning of currency with
the expressed intention of foiling those
who had designs on his money and
who he claimed were waiting for him
to die now bradford weller was
dead there was a fine irony in that
but cooper could not see the possible
motive he did not believe that sane
people killed for vengeance unless there
was another powerful factor working
there were people in the household
who were resentful but they were peo-
ple capable of seeing that murder
would make a bad situation worse

rphere was a clicking sound from
the direction of the door and
cooper turned tim weller stood
framed in the doorway a tall spare
figure in a faded blue bathrobe striped
pajamas and loose house slippers he
blinked at the light and ran one thin
hand through his disheveled gray hair

  bradford he said huskily dead
isnt he

  he continued to blink into the glare
of the room he did not have his cane
but he gripped the door frame for sup-
port cooper nodded

  yes he said gently hes been
dead for hours i imagine his body is
rigid

  tim weller continued to stare at the
body he was mad he said in-
sane

  i dont think so cooper had
started for the telephone but he turned
back youd better go to your room
judge its pretty tough

  he never called tim weller judge
except on special occasions the old
man shook his head my place is
here

  im going to call the police

  its the thing to do call alexandria
police station tim weller crossed
the room to the chair farthest from the


detective fiction weekly

bed and sat down you know he
said i made bradford started him
in law made a politician out of him

  i know cooper picked up the
phone he swore softly there was no
buzz in the receiver the old man
looked up cooper put the phone back
on the stand the wire is cut he
said

  he was frowning again there was
a cold-blooded professional touch
about cutting the phone wires he
looked casually along the line he
couldnt see the break and because he
couldnt he found the wire-cutting more
baffling a phone in a bedroom would
naturally be an extension phone to
isolate a house without phone service
the line would have to be cut down-
stairs

  an amateur would never have
thought of that he said aloud

  tim weller blinked at him what
he said

  cooper shrugged somebody fig-
ured that he needed a head start

  he moved away from the phone and
looked at the body on the bed despite
his newspaper experience he felt that
queer sense of helplessness that sweeps
a person in the face of violent death
he would have to go after help now
and he had a strong disinclination to
go the murderer might want just that

  but he couldnt figure out any rea-
son why the murderer would want him
out of the house-except that the safe
had been empty when he had beau
bridwell open it if the safe had held a
small fortune in money earlier in the
evening-as he suspected-then its
present emptiness provided a possible
motive for murder and a good reason
for the murderer to want a head start
or time to hide the money after the
money was considered cooper swung
around

  did you come downstairs tonight
judge after once you went to bed

  tim weller blinked downstairs
no

  somebody did cooper ground his
palms together thoughtfully tim wel-
ler lifted his head

  how do you know

  cooper did not answer he was re-
membering what beau bridwell and
terry black had told him they de-
layed their attack on the safe because
there had been someone in the senators
study coopers eyes passed over the
lean body of tim weller it was easier
to believe the judge than to disbelieve
him it would take a strong motive to
make tim weller negotiate stairs that
he didnt have to climb

  he looked at the corpse the senator
hadnt been down there he had been
dead for hours before beau bridwell
arrived at the house who was left
the girls yes either one of them
might have been in the study he didnt
believe that either one had hito
well he would have to check up on
that the thought of hito gave him
an idea

  he didnt have to go for the police
he had someone to send

  ill have to consider the possibility
that bridwell and black lied he
thought grimly bridwell may have
been closing that safe instead of try-
ing to open it when i came in

  he still believed in his theory of
little crooks being afraid of big money
but this had been an extraordinary
night-and he was not unmindful of
his own position there was a man
with a criminal record who had one of
greg coopers checks that had been
drawn on the day his employer was
murdered

  greg cooper had had the opportu-
nity personally-and any one of sev-

	d-
money to burn



eral motives that would look good to
the police-for murdering bradford
weller

 he was aware of tim wellers
blinking eyes fixed upon him he didnt
know how long the old man had been
studying him but tim weller was
shrewd he might be greg coopers
worst witness before a grand jury if it
came to that his report on coopers
unusual actions in the death room
would carry weight the old man was
nodding his head slowly

  it is no disgrace for a crazy man
to kill himself he said huskily his
mind broke he didnt know but you
better go for the police

  greg cooper stared at him you
think that he killed himself

  tim weller blinked obviously
he said he waved his hand toward the
corpse with its stiff fingers resting on
the stiletto hilt

  for a long minute greg cooper
stood where he was and some perverse
and cowardly thing inside of him said
why not he could send hito to
tell the police that the senator had com-
mitted suicide they would come pre-
pared to find a suicide and the digni-
fied grief of tim weller who apolo-
gized for the disgrace of suicide by
pleading his brothers insanity would
convince them

  it was a temptation but he set his
jaw against it im sorry judge he
said but it isnt that simple he didnt
commit suicide he was murdered
murdered tim weller raised his
head his eyes widening and for the
moment ceasing to blink

  thats right and im going to
send hito for the cops

  greg cooper was heading for the
door as he spoke he had taken only
two steps out into the hall when a gun
boomed outside the house there was

	d-iq

a hushed beat of time and then an-
other shot from a gun of lighter cali-
ber somebody shouted and on the
highway the brakes of a car squealed

chapter ix
suspects

f i the door of vivian dawsons
room opened on the echo of that
second shot mildred harney came out
running she started for the stairs and
greg cooper was only a step ahead of
her he gripped her arm and she struck
at him

  let me go she said

  he gripped harder and swung her
around she struck at him again and
her body stiffened then suddenly she
went limp the desperate look went
out of her eyes and she clutched at him

  oh please she said dont go
out stay with us im frightened

  he shook her and over her shoulder
he saw vi dawson vivians face too
was pale but she had recovered her grip
on herself

  see what it is greg ill take care
of her there was a catch in her
voice another shot sounded outside
and she flinched but she kept coming
she caught the blonde girls arm as
greg cooper let go and copper
whirled to the stairs

  he went down fast he was thinking
of bridwell and of terry black won-
dering if they had recovered the gun
from the table in the study and if they
were shooting it out with someone on
the grounds the sense of personal
danger pressed on him anything that
happened to beau bridwell was likely
to be bad medicine for greg cooper
apart from that he didnt want to get
the little yegg into anything serious
he was responsible for beau bridwell
being out here and he had practically

given the man guarantees of safety
even the later doublecross did not nul-
lify that unless the doublecross was
worse than he knew

  he bounded across the lower hall
and out of the front door upstairs he
had left mildred harney in care of vi
dawson that was another irony of a
case that was full of irony the girls
took turns taking care of each other
but there was a difference

  vi dawson had gone to pieces with
shock but had found herself when
there was danger to be met mildred
harney had not been affected by the
senators death but she had found fear
in her being when the shooting started
why 

  cooper expected to find the answer
to that question out on the grounds-
when he found who was doing the
shooting

  traffic was stopped on the mount
vernon highway a hundred yards or
so away and cooper had an idea that
the occupants of the cars were under
cover from stray shots

  a dark figure moved on the sloping
lawn that rolled down to the highway
from the house instantly there was a
flash of flame from a point near the
garage the dark figure folded and
went down and cooper saw another
man crawling out of the garage shad-
ow raising himself for another shot

  hold it cooper shouted and
started forward he had lost the sense
of personal danger he knew only that
the man out on the lawn had been hit
and that with the car lights from the
highway behind him he would be a still
target for the other marksman there
was something chilling about the idea
of seeing a bullet pumped into a fallen
man cooper raced toward the garage

  the man with the gun got up on one
knee he was wobbling badly but fight-

ing for balance cooper put on a last
burst of speed and struck at the gun
with his open hand the gun spun end
over end and the man who had wielded
it sank forward on the grass cooper
recognized him

  hito he said youre hit arent
you

  shot bad the japanese rolled
over he was shaking his head blood
flowed over the front of his light pa-
jama jacket greg cooper dropped on
one knee beside him and the japanese
drew a deep sobbing breath

  lady scream he said and i get
up pretty soon after man jump out of
window and run look dishonest i
remember lady scream and i shoot
yess

  you fired at him without knowing
who he was cooper was wadding a
handkerchief against the mans wound
and looking toward the road a car
with green lights had pulled in through
the gates and there were two men with
flashlights moving gingerly toward the
man who was lying on the lawn hito
sighed

  i shoot to scare he said not try
to hit he shoot back and i try to hit
next time

  okay take it easy well have a
doctor for you dont talk any more

ooper rose to his feet one of
the cops threw a flashlight beam
at him and he knew that there was a
gun pointed down the beam he raised
his hands high

  theres a man shot here he said
  theres one shot here too

  well have to get them into the
house

  yeah who are you

  cooper i belong here

  the policeman walked up to meet
cooper he was a young cop with
money to burn



broad blockv shoulders and a rolling
walk he was wearing the uniform of
the district park police that limited
his jurisdiction to the mount vernon
highway but he had the aggressive
manner of a man who having blun-
dered into something intends to see
it through

  whats it all about he said
cooper shrugged

  i dont know yet myself our jap-
anese servant shot someone running
away he got shot himself doing it
there was another car pulling into
the driveway three men piled out and
entered into conversation with the po-
licemen down on the grounds they
were scoutmasters visiting washing-
ton for the boy scout jamboree and
while one of their number stood guard
to keep curious persons off the grounds
the other two helped cooper and the
two policemen to get the wounded men
into the house

 the second wounded man was
george arlington master con man

  he smiled grimly wtith pain-taut lips
when he recognized cooper i thought
we said no hard feeling cooper
thats right but i didnt shoot
you and the senator hadnt been mur-
dered then

  murdered arlingtons small eves
opened wide cooper stared hard at him
the block- policeman straightened
from his examination of hitos wound
he was the senior cop of the patrol
and his name was brennan

  whats this about a senator being
murdered he said

  bradford weller he was stabbed
in his bed cooper said grimly by a
person or persons unknown

  and this guy was running away
the policeman jerked his thumb at
arlington

  there was a commotion at the door

and mildred harney broke away from
vi dawson and tim weller she threw
herself down on her knees beside ar-
lington and would have put her arms
around him if the second policeman a
lean youngster with red hair hadnt
gripped her shoulder

  he didnt do it she said he
didnt do it

  brennan turned to the scoutmasters
we need some authority here he
said be good guys and get us a
couple of medicos and some law from
alexandria

  the scoutmasters saluted and went
out on the double brennan ran his
hand through his hair how do you
know that he didnt do it he said

  mildred harney looked up defiantly
because he didnt have any reason to
do it and he was in my room all
night thats why he ran away

  she was like a tigress at bay her
eyes flashing brennan looked em-
barrassed he looked to his partner for
suggestions but the red-haired youth
didnt know what to do either tim
weller sank into a chair his eyes on
mildred harneys face he looked
very old and tired

  you had promised to marry my
brother he said accusingly

  she looked at him and laughed bit-
terly i didnt she said your
brother was careful about that he
didnt make any offers that he didnt
have to make

  but you would have married him
i couldnt im married to george
her voice caught in a sob and the fight
went out of her she tried to put her
arms around the injured con man
again are you hurt badly darling
she said

  the red-haired policeman kept her
back hes just nicked miss thigh
and shoulder hell be okay

greg cooper had been bending
over the japanese hito decidedly
was not okay he had been hit in the
chest and he was bleeding internally
there was froth on his lips his eyes
however were alive he seemed to be
vitally interested in everything that
was being said in the room

  i am fidelity always he whispered
missy scream i shoot

  you were right about that hito
greg coopers voice was soft take it
easy

  george arlington was speaking to
the blonde girl sit tight and keep
your nerve he said were in the
clear see

  mildred harney nodded vi dawson
came over beside greg cooper is
there anything i can do greg

  yes try to keep hito comfortable
till the doctor comes

  cooper rose slowly to his feet
george arlington was looking at him
with narrowed calculating eyes the
blonde girl watched him with open
hostility tim weller had his chin on
his chest the two policemen were
standing awkwardly charged with re-
sponsibility but lacking authority greg
cooper looked slowly around the room

  somebody here murdered senator
weller he said gravely

  tim weller lifted his chin from his
chest he stretched out one thin arm
wait he said let me ask this girl
a question he leaned forward in his
chair

  you couldnt marry my brother
he said so you had no chance of col-
lecting his insurance he had a lot of
that and it was all that he did have
after you let him burn up his money
what did you stand to gain

the girl looked at him and laughed
suppose you guess she said defiantly
greg cooper measured her with his

eyes and there was no friendliness in
his face suppose that i do the guess-
ing he said what you stood to gain
was exactly one hundred and fifty-four
thousand seven hundred and sixty-five
dollars

  the girl stiffened and george ar-
lington ignored the pain of his wounds
to come up on one elbow tim weller
was staring haggardly as though only
dimly comprehending what was said
greg cooper shifted his stare to the
con man

  i couldnt figure out your business
with the senator he said until he
pulled his grandstand act about burn-
ing up his fortune then i guessed i
knew bradford weller for too many
years to believe in that gesture it
would break his heart to burn up a
single dollar and he didnt burn a
single dollar-not one

  the room became quiet the sen-
ator wanted to eat his cake and have it
too he said he wanted his relatives
to think that he had no money-and
he wanted money to throw away on
blondes he bought hot money or badly
made unpassable counterfeit money
and he substituted it for the real thing
before that big show of his and you
arlington sold it to him

  arlington winced but mildred har-
ney managed a laugh how silly
she said why those bills that he
burned had your tags on them

  sure and the senator had plenty
of time alone in his study while i was
down town to take those tags from one
set of currency and transfer them to
another

  mildred harney tried to laugh again
but the laugh did not quite come off
coopers voice was relentless you
two swindlers could have clipped the
senator for every dime of that money
and he wouldnt have been able to do
money to burn



a thing about it he growled his for-
tune no longer existed legally he had
burned it before witnesses he could
never have accused you of stealing
what he had burned it was the perfect
con game

  big george arlington found his
voice you dont arrest people for
what they might have done he said
mildred and i had nothing to do with
killing him we had no reason for
killing him

  greg coopers face looked drawn
thats right he said and i dont
believe that either one of you did kill
him

  big george and the blonde girl re-
laxed visibly the room was very quiet
and greg cooper seemed reluctant to
say more hito the little japanese
was watching every one of the tense
actors in the scene his eyes unnaturally
bright he coughed to call attention to
himself

  i kill him he said i kill the sen-
ator all okay now

         chapter x
         the motive

greg cooper whirled to the
sound of hitos voice he stared
blankly at the little yellow man who
was struggling to sit up against the
support of vi dawsons arms two
cars stopped outside and there were
strangers entering the room brennan
was explaining the case

  senator weller has been murdered
we are about to get a confession the
murderers dying i think

  greg cooper was kneeling now be-
side the japanese tim weller had come
unsteadily to his feet and was moving
forward a man with a doctors bag
knelt on the other side of hito the
japanese smiled almost happily

  very simple he said no money
left insurance maybe yess miss boss
come from hospital no money very
bad miss boss come from hospital
much insurance very good you see
yess

  all right ive written your confes-
sion as you gave it it says that you
know that you are about to die can
you sign it

  yess hito reached for the foun-
tain pen and scrawled rapidly across
the bottom of the sheet his eyes had
a swimmy look but he was staring up
at tim weller much better he said
i have nobody no family nobody
the police had their confession and
they did not pay much attention to that
greg cooper did-because greg cooper
knew that hito had lied

  he looked at tim weller the old
mans hands were clenching and un-
clenching there were tears in his eyes
and a vast hopelessness the hopeless-
ness perhaps of a man who sees him-
self chained to an endless responsibility
and an unsharable secret greg cooper
knew then what he had suspected be-
fore he bent above the japanese

  i understand hito he said softly
fidelity always

  yess fidelity always good motto
hito smiled and died greg cooper
came slowly to his feet he wanted to
take vi dawson in his arms but he
couldnt do that yet he linked his arm
to tim wellers and drew him across
the room to the chair that he had oc-
cupied before

  you better sit down judge he
said your sister emily will need you
when she gets out of the hospital you
have to be fit for the job

  the old man looked into coopers
eyes you know he said huskily

  cooper nodded i know that you
killed your brother yes and hito


detective fiction weekly

knew that you did he was dying and
he took the load from you he be-
lieved in fidelity you have to carry
on judge

  tim wellers eyes misted i will i
made bradford you know i made a
lawyer out of him i made a politician
of him and i made him a senator
he was mumbling half to himself
when greg cooper left him tim wel-
ler had told his brother in this very
room that no man had the right to
destroy what he did not create tim
weller felt in his heart that he had
made the man that bradford weller
had been-and he had been consistent
with his philosophy when he destroyed
the man for what he considered the
greater good

  perhaps the officers of the law were
entitled to the facts but greg cooper
felt no obligation to tell them

  he was crossing the room and he
saw the young policeman brennan
the blonde girl was gripping him by
the arm george arlington was sup-
porting himself on one elbow and look-
ing at them

  theres nothing that we can be
held for nothing the girl said

  coopers jaw hardened here were
the perpetrators of a callous and pre-
meditated crime a crime predicated
upon the gullibility of an old man who

believed that a young girl loved him
these two people would have stripped
a family of money and lived at ease

  now this precious pair thought that
they could walk out cooper took a
short step

  no he said there isnt a thing
that you can be held for unless george
arlington took that money out of the
senators safe tonight and hid it in
your room take a look brennan
cooper was watching the girl as
brennan left the room with another
officer the bravado was out of mil-
dred harney now and she was wax
white in a few moments brennan was
back he opened a bag solemnly and
stacks of money tumbled out-thick
stacks of currency that were never in-
tended for the fire cooper snapped
his fingers

  you killed that japanese while you
were engaged in a burglary arling-
ton he said grimly and the girl was
your accomplice maybe you think that
you cant be held for that

  he turned his back and he was sud-
denly weary of it all

  he stepped out into the hall and vi
dawson was waiting for him

  i think i can get a good job in
cuba he said huskily

  she lifted her face to his cuba
would be lovely she said

-and the patient dies

danny lane muttered

now what the devil
as the flood relief spe-
cial slowed clankingly to a dead
halt he peered through the night-
blackened rain-washed window of the
smoker coach danny saw his own re-
flected face nothing more than that

  a big tropic-tanned black mus-
tached man came along the aisle to
the brakeman who was adjusting the
wick of his lantern he said where
are we

  about twelve miles out of river-
side

  the big browned mans voice held
a slight accent probably spanish
whats the trouble

  must be a tree blowed onto the
track the brakie said this-heres
the old quarry spur-its hardly been
used for years

  need any help

  the brakeman said well holler if
we do and pushed through the ves-
tibule door

  shrugging the tropic-skinned man
turned to the water tap he took a col-

lapsible metal flask from its leather
case drained a thin vein of water into
the flask

  it was very quiet in the smoking car
grave-faced men spoke in low tones
they knew what lay ahead of the spe-
cial-there was suffering ahead and
destitution and terrific threat of epi-
demic disease there were a hundred
thousand flood victims some of them
ill and more of them homeless-all de-
prived of sanitary sewage disposal
safe drinking water milk for their
children

  the worst flood in fifty years swung
its five hundred mile scythe of destruc-
tion through the valley riverside lay
isolated at the scythes tip tons of
crashing water had smashed the citys
concrete highway outlets boiled across
the main railroad trackage and left the
rusted quarry rails as a last link with
the outside world thousands of lives
depending on two threads

  help from that outside world would
come as the red cross and army bat-
talions fought through the destruction
of half a dozen other cities up the river
as planes found landing sites on the
rough hilltops

  the doctors in the smoking coach
were volunteers flocking in from the
small towns of the states south-western
tip bearded grandfathers called out of
retirement sat side by side with young
internes from the famous randall
sanitarium

  dr randall himself was there-a
tall man with a face that had once been
ascetic but was now fleshed out with
success and good living sanitarium
owner and race horse fancier he was
telling a weatherbeaten little country
physician now my experience with
typhoid has been-

  there was typhoid fever in river-
side scourging those homeless folk
huddled in the refugee camps

  so i am lucky to see the new tech-
nique put to the test the speaker was
captain-doctor almonez randalls
guest the public health director of a
banana republic almonez was touring
the united states was specially in-
terested in the oral vaccine technique
perfected by randall

  hes lucky thought danny lane
what about the victims in river-
side- 

  danny thought this didnt say it
two years out of school danny was
one of randalls glorified internes-
resident doctor so-called the job
didnt pay much in money-paid mostly
in experience danny a dark-haired
clean-cut young chap was building
himself a future but it wasnt for him
to rebuke almonezs callous expres-
sion the man didnt mean anything by
the remark anyway people in those
banana countries died like flies any-

way almonez was hardened to whole-
sale death

tanny crushed his cigarette
walked out of the smoker a few
of the white-clad nurses in the coaches
pored over magazines most of them
were wise enough to doze in their
seats knowing the sleepless frantic
hours of toil twelve miles ahead

  but one of them neither read nor
dozed lucy orr turned from trying to
peer through the coach window
danny

  lucy orr was one of the sanitarium
nurses-blonde pretty danny had a
hunch shed play a big part in that
future of his

  he asked well and put a lot of
fondness into the single word

  what can be holding us up here
lucy worried her blue eyes deeply
troubled do you think this track
could be washed out too

  danny said oh the floods not this
high the brakeman said there might
be something on the track

  she tried vainly to see through the
window again i thought i saw water
out there right beside the train-
danny knew the worry which
gnawed in lucy orrs mind her folks
lived in riverside and not on a hill-
top either her invalided mother would
have had to be carried out on a
stretcher if she got out at all and
there were kid brothers and sisters
kids who could only be inoculated
against the dread typhoid when the
special got through

  ill look lucy he said quickly
ill find out whats the matter

  danny lane walked out into the ves-
tibule and hopped off into the darkness

  he trudged up the track there was
water out there a dark sheet of it glim-
mering evilly in the light from the
mercy hijacked





coach windows weeds thrusting up
beside the sleepers took wet slaps at
the internes ankles the quarry spur
certainly had been neglected in recent
years but danny speedily forgot about
the weeds

  his feet crunched the cinders faster
something wrong ahead that knot of
men working beside the slowly puffing
locomotive-no beside the baggage
car they were-they were what

  dannys stare focused on the yellow
glow of lanterns beside the track good
heavens it looked as if-

  yeah no doubt about it they were
unloading the baggage car the medi-
cal supplies those gelatine cells of heat-
killed typhoid bacilli mixed with starch
coming out of the car and going down
into a scow moored where the water
lapped against the embankment

  this couldnt be right must be some
mistake here why the devil unload
twelve miles from the track end un-
less there was a washout ahead-

  danny lane froze in his tracks that
was when he saw the metallic glitter of
drawn guns the train crew lined up
beside the tender hands in the air

  danny lane couldnt believe his eyes
couldnt realize anyone would be low
enough contemptible enough to hijack
the relief train

  it was happening though the reali-
zation burst like a bombshell in the in-
ternes bewildered brain realization-
and fear fear because he knew the
supply of new type vaccine was so ter-
ribly limited-it wouldnt be easy to
get more-and it gave maximum pro-
tection two weeks sooner than doctors
could obtain it with the old subcuta-
neous vaccines   

  a yell of warning pushed into the
internes throat as he thought of that
a yell that ended suddenly in a

choked grunt there was no warning
for danny lane he never saw the
stealthy shadow behind him the gun
butt descended silently crunched
against his skull with sickening force

  danny crumpled

  a toe prodded his ribs turned him
over he rolled limply down the em-
bankment slowly at first then faster
a dull splash followed   

  a few minutes later its terrorized
crew huddled in the locomotive cab
the special chuffed slowly up the
quarry spur gathering speed lucy orr
sighed her relief at the click-clack on
the rails turned her cheek to the plush
cushion squeezed shut her eyes

  in the smoker dr randall consulted
his strap-watch said lost ten minutes
here

  captain-doctor almonez murmured
torres break out the brandy-eh
whered that man of mine go

  the big tropic-skinned man had dis-
appeared

hphe shock of the ice cold flood-
water aroused danny lane to semi-
consciousness congealed the agony in
his skull to a dull intolerable ache but
it congealed the strength in his limbs
too he struck out feebly but his gar-
ments prisoned him in a freezing
straitjacket of waterlogged cloth
prisoned and dragged him down the
pull of the current swept him out into
mid-flood

  then his fingers locked spasmodi-
cally on a wet-slicked length of board
somehow danny got his chin out of
the water a blacker outline showed
above him against the blackness of the
night he was clinging to the scows
stern

  voices came to him as from an in-
finitely great distance the words might
have been uttered in a foreign language

for all the sense he could make of them
danny did not cry out for help for he
knew that none would help him these
men had tried once already to murder
him he concentrated trying to cling
to the scow it wasnt easy he had to
keep pushing off the current moving
faster than the scow tended to push his
legs under the craft

  and gradually it did so now the
least slip of his numbed hands meant
death for once drawn under the scow
he would certainly drown and he was
already under it up to his hands and
head

  this could not have lasted long
though it seemed for hours could not
because his strength was measured in
minutes

  then the current changed sharply
danny heard the grate of poles going
over the scows side his own body shot
out to arms length behind the craft
one hand was torn loose from its grip

  the scow moved slowly jerkily
suddenly it struck with a jolt that ran
its whole length the impact knocked
danny lanes other hand away he
had an instants vision of a bridge a
skeleton shape in the night then the
water rushed over his head blotting
out everything

  he no longer felt the current trun-
dling him along or the weight of his
watersoaked clothes he went spinning
into a black void   

  in reality he lay unconscious-half
of him in the water half of him cast
upon the weedy bank-a dozen yards
below the railroad bridge

  half an hour later danny became
fragmentarily aware-of life in his be-
ing that is to say he became aware
of pain his body was a chilled huddle
of quivering flesh his skull a queer
and pulpy weight was filled with a
soggy ache

  something in the night went ku-lunk
ku-lunk like a slowly beaten jungle
drum ku-lunk ku-lunk or did he
imagine that was the drum inside his
bruised head

  he passed out cold more time
passed then a ray of light played
eerily on the weeds over his head a
voice said only place along the line
they could get a boat that close to the
rails

  another voice yeah that so

  im telling you i know we still
roll a few boxcars up here danny
lane had heard that voice somewhere
before it went on farmers load a
little hay on the siding here it saves
em the truck haul downtown-

rphe voices were going away

 danny lane picked himself grog-
gily out of the weeds saw two sil-
houettes walking up the track one of
them carried a flashlight he was say-
ing cant track em across water
might as well go back and-

  danny lane cried hey feebly
the blood came storming into his head
again and he fell flat the men walked
away not having heard him

  after a while danny lane came
staggering over the embankment onto
the roadbed the clouds had broken
overhead and a full moon shed its cold
light over the scene there was no sign
of the two men obviously they had
come out to investigate the robbery and
as obviously had found nothing to in-
vestigate

  danny lane looked around back of
him there was nothing but floodwater
a mile-wide bay of it glittering omi-
nously under the moon the water ex-
tended under the bridge to his left
spread a lake on the farmland across
the tracks there

  danny peered up the siding it had
mercy hijacked



originally been a double-tracked sec-
tion permitting empties to pull off the
line for loaded trains coming out of
the quarry that had been years ago
the siding was largely overgrown with
weeds now a little string of boxcars
stood there the door of one was open
a bit and the moonlight revealed the
rectangular ends of hay bales inside

  the little strings of boxcars held no
interest for the young interne danny
looked on up the track twelve miles
to riverside he remembered the brake-
man saying

  it might as well have been twelve
hundred danny couldnt walk it not
weak as he was drenched and with
chattering teeth with a head which
burst from smouldering pain into red
agony at every step he took

  he turned stumbled across the
bridge there was a dirt grade cross-
ing with a cattleguard beyond that a
wooden gate crossing a clay-packed
road it wasnt really a road but a lane
at the end of the lane danny could
see a little dark clump of farm build-
ings

  the farmer would have an automo-
bile a telephone or at least a horse
some means of communicating with the
city he would also have dry clothing

  danny stumbled up the clay road
he gasped with relief as he reached
the farmhouse porch the building was
a small oblong of dingy gray set in a
muddy flat yard with barns and sheds
at the rear the sound of dannys
knuckles on the door echoed across the
yard brought no other response

  he muttered teeth clacking g-got
to b-break in

  but the door wasnt locked danny
pushed into the stale warmth of a
kitchen moonlight at the uncurtained
window showed a bare table a stove a
cream separator he went to the stove

  hunted across its metal top until he
found a box of matches

  an oil lamp rested in a bracket over
the table danny fumbled it lit then he
turned to the stove there were cobs in
a coal bucket a packing box stuffed
with chopped wood a tin kerosene can
with a potato on its snout

  trembling with cold the interne
dumped fuel into the stove spread
kerosene liberally dragged a match
across the blacked lids the flame was
instant bright warming it howled
pleasantly into the pipe

  a coffee pot with some dark liquid
in it stood on the back of the stove
it would be hot by the time he found
some dry clothes

  danny took down the lamp pushed
open the door at the other end of the
kitchen stopped short holy-

 a man lay on the floor just over
the threshold he wore rubber
boots denim overalls and a denim
jacket an irregular red blotch the
size of a dinner plate stained the over-
all bib there was a good deal more
a lot more red on the carpet about
him the man had been shot not
through the heart but in the lung

  danny lane stood stock-still a long
moment his throat contracting as he
stared the man might have been fifty
or seventy-there were no special char-
acteristics identifying his time-worn
face-or at least the interne observed
none after that moment he turned
away climbed the stairs to the second
story when he returned it was with
an armful of clothes

he dressed in the kitchen a half-
full bottle of whiskey stood on a win-
dow sill back of the cream separator
danny drank a cup of mixed whiskey
and bitter coffee the stimulation from
the rank medicinal dose coursed

through his veins pleasantly he felt
wanned but still weak his head
swollen charged with heavy internal
pressure

  danny paid no more attention to the
dead man in the next room it did not
occur to him that the farmers death
might in any way be linked with the
train robbery he was not one of those
super-sleuths who can be knocked cold
one moment and wake up the next with
a perfect crime solution in mind he
was not a sleuth at all just an ex-
hausted youth with one thought inside
his battered skull to get to riverside
and tell his story to the authorities

  danny went outside the eastern sky
had brightened to a pale mauve which
found reflection in the swollen pond
covering the lower end of the farm
fence lines marched down into the
water disappeared the brown thatch
of a haystack made a tiny island in
the flood

  his stare stopped on a muddy ring
perhaps forty feet in diameter a few
rods from the water and near another
stack sliced in two like a loaf of bread

  it held no particular meaning for
him

  he looked across the barnyard
there were a good many footprints
in the mud water stood in some these
were old before the nights rain
others were fresher-and the makers
feet had skidded leaving furrows and
grooves rather than identifiable prints

  the tracks led to the ramshackle
barn danny followed them he pushed
the barn door open clumsily a move-
ment inside made his pulse leap sent
a crackle of agony through his bruised
head then danny grunted-it was
only a rat scurrying along a manger
timber three cows and a team wrere
stabled in the stalls

  dannys lips twisted in perplexity

a salty rime of sweat traced the out-
lines of harness on the horses danny
went in mumbled who-a-a boy
and touched one of the rumps the
horse was warm the mud on its fet-
locks looked fresh

  danny lane muttered well ill be
damned

  for the first time his fogged brain
began to grip a meaning in all these
circumstances he came out of the
barn hurrying and looked around
again

back of the barn the cattleyard
was a straw-choked quagmire
danny circled the hen house and im-
plement shed came abruptly onto a lip
of the old quarry it had been closed
commercially for years but some stone
for local use had been coming out
lately a wagon track meandered down
to the quarry floor there was a wide
expanse of bare rock across the quarry
and beyond that a view of the railroad

  a long ways off danny could see a
moving dot he strained to focus his
eyes on it the dot took form-the
form of an old-fashioned handcar
danny could make out the tiny figure
of a man pumping it along

  the interne started down the wagon
trail into the pit his jarring footfalls
increased the torment in his head as he
picked his way carefully a thin
orange-peel of sun slid over the hori-
zon as he pushed through the bushes
at the other end of the quarry and came
out onto the track siding

  a frown tightened dannys tired
face as he inspected the scene the
muddy road along the track was
blandly smooth

  but nevertheless the door of the last
boxcar of the string on the siding was
closed it had been open during the
night and the rising sun discovered
mercy hijacked



certain tiny marks on the rails-
brighter bits visible where the rust was
broken

  danny lurched through the mud got
his hands onto that door a surge of
his body moved it only an inch on the
next try he got it six inches farther
presently he had an opening wide
enough to admit a mans body

  he jumped weakly succeeded in
grasping the latch with one hand claw-
ing desperately he got the toe of a
shoe braced onto the metal-stripped sill
he climbed shakily

  the boxcar was filled nearly to its
roof there was barely room for
danny to crawl across the tiers of
baled hay he peered at the bales each
would weigh around a hundred pounds
and was encircled by two wires

  lacking a pincers he struggled to
break one of the wires bare hands
couldnt do it danny drove his heel
into the bale used all the strength in
his leg and the wire snapped

  the hay bulged out in accordion
pleats danny muttered yeah and
drove his hands into the pleats he
twisted out a small wooden box and
again muttered yeah

  he didnt need to open the box he
knew what it contained it held the
bile capsules administered as a prelim-
inary to the oral vaccination

  now why should anyone hijack
stuff like this the oral vaccine was
ideal for flood conditions-you didnt
need complicated equipment your pa-
tients didnt suffer the severe reactions
but still it could be used only by a phy-
sician no doctor or hospital would buy
anything like that except through legiti-
mate supply channels what in the devil
could the hijackers do with it what
was the purpose

  however that problem wasnt for
dannys aching head to solve let the

cops figure out the whys and where-
fores

  he wriggled feet first out of the box-
car the handcar was less than a hun-
dred yards away it slowed to a stop
the crew of one got off stared at
dann lane walked slowly toward him

  danny recognized the specials
brakeman a strapping big fellow he
carried a handful of metal seals and
pasteboard cards the recognition was
one-sided at first nothing in dannys
overalled appearance suggested the neat
interne of the preceding night

  hey you the brakie said bellig-
erently cant you damned hoboes stay
out of-great guns he dropped the
seals came closer stared say aint
you the guy they drozwied last night

tanny lane grinned feebly
-- im the guy they almost
drowned but never mind about me
how fast could you get a message to
dr randall in riverside

  the brakemans broad face remained
a map of astonishment well ill be
a so-and-some-more he ejaculated
ignoring the internes question is the
other feller alive too

  what other feller

  that foreign one the brakie said
torres they dont know if he was
killed like you-like youre supposed to
be-or if he run off with the robbers
it was an inside job the train slopped
because somebody pulled the emergency
cord see huh whered you get them
overalls 

  farmhouse danny replied laconi-
cally how about getting a message
into the city

  the man considered first i got to
seal these cars and tag em theres a
switch engine coming up from merion-
ville to clear this siding for the milk
trains to come in he kept staring at


detective fiction weekly

the overalls what farmhouse doc
  the closest one

  the brakie said oh you mean joe
barkers place his tone held a nag-
ging curiosity it occurred to danny
lane that the man might be suspicious
of his sudden reappearance--especially
if the robbery had been an inside job
it seemed so for the brakeman con-
tinued warily barker couldnt help
you any-getting your message into
town 

  danny spoke earnestly listen
barkers dead-murdered i think
anyway theres a dead man in the
house up there he went on put that
part of the story in as few words as
he could the hijackers killed him i
suppose they used his horses and bal-
ing outfit the stuffs hidden inside the
bales in this boxcar here thats the
message weve got to get to randall
he said this excitedly and the brake-
man got excited too he exclaimed
sure they musta figured nobodyd
look inside them bales this here hay
was supposed to be loaded before the
stickup- he broke off then you
bet doc you leave it to me i know
this country here see why i helped
shunt these empties onto the siding
thats why they put me on the spe-
cial-on account of knowing the quarry
spur and her switches ill get that mes-
sage through the quickest way is for
me to go down the spur theres a
phone at the crossroads store two miles
down you stay here and watch huh
danny nodded and-theres a per-
sonal message tell randall to let miss
orr know im all right

  miss orr huh what address
shes one of the nurses randall
will know

  maybe you better write the name
out doc the brakie fumbled in his
pocket found a stub of indelible pencil

danny picked up the pasteboard cards
the man had dropped in his excitement
at seeing a supposed dead man come to
life and wrote the name he handed
the card over

  okay doc i got it

  the brakeman jumped aboard the
handcar and started down the track

  hey danny called you for-
got- but the man did not hear

  danny bent over to pick up the rest
of the seals and cards and stuff them
into his pocket when a word caught his
eye a very familiar word to danny
lane

  he grunted stared hard at the card
for this hay was consigned to the ran-
dall farms-the farm where dr ran-
dall quartered his racing horses

anny lane gasped holy-
and sat down on a rock his
mind was more of a confused jumble
than it had been a moment before but
one aspect of the puzzle leaped star-
tlingly clear if it had not been for his
almost miraculous discovery this box-
cars contraband cargo would have
wound up in dr randalls stock barns
how did this tie up with torres dis-
appearance 

  danny shook his head slowly prob-
it was all coincidence-just as much a
matter of accident as the fact that he
randalls interne had gotten off the
train last night

  he stood up thrust the cards into his
overall pocket turned to look after the
handcar it had already vanished
around a curve below the bridge

  he leaned against the boxcar stared
thoughtfully up the barren track to-
ward riverside gradually his stare
narrowed there was something wrong
about this scene only the rails the
weeds growing up to the trackside and
the gray waste of water beyond but
mercy hijacked



there was something wrong some-
thing missing

  yet for the life of him danny
couldnt think what whatever it was
eluded his pain-numbed wits he
struggled to remember-and failed
like having a name almost at the tip
of your tongue but only almost per-
haps if he didnt think about it for a
moment the correct answer would
come-

  danny jerked around warned too
late by the sound of a footstep the
rising sun silhouetted a head and shoul-
ders leaning around the end of the
boxcar cast a reddish glimmer along
the rifle barrel aimed at the internes
chest

  come along quiet the silhouette
said we got you covered from both
ways

  true enough they had both ends of
the siding covered another man came
up behind danny snouted a gun
against his back and said walk a
rail kid we aint leaving any foot-
prints see

  they all walked the rails danny
ahead of the others sometimes his
head swimming dizzily the interne
would stumble and be rewarded with
a curse

  they headed him away from the
quarry down the track and across the
cattleguard at the road until they came
to a cindered footpath leading back un-
der the bridge

  down here kid

  the bridge stood on tall creosote-
treated timbers flood  water had
backed in was within eight feet of the
sleepers overhead one of the men went
ahead of danny up to the wall of
planks at the lower end of the bridge
it was a retaining wall built to keep
the roadbed from landsliding into the
creek bottom there the man lifted two

of the planks aside said you crawl
in

  the two planks had concealed a
length of concrete ditch tile the tile
was barely large enough for a man to
crawl through danny could see a glow
of white light at the other end

  the man with the rifle prodded
danny now crawl

  the interne crept into the tile

  he emerged into a cave hollowed un-
der the railroad it was shored up with
boards lighted by an electric lantern
hung on a twisted copper tube the
tube was part of an old still clearly
the cave had been a bootlegger hideout
during prohibition

  there were already two men in the
dugout one of these was a pug-nosed
fellow slouch-hatted with an air of
authority about him much of the au-
thority derived from the revolver in
his fist

  danny blinked hed never seen a gun
like it before an hr  with three
inches of knife steel protruding from
the barrel end-an ugly little bayonet

  the other man crouched in a corner
of the cave almost hidden in shadow
knees were drawn almost level with
his tropic-skinned features

  danny muttered torres

  the big brown man stared but said
nothing

  dannv growled so it was an inside

job

the pug-nosed one turned the lan-
tern aimed its beam squarely onto
danny never mind him-ill do the
talking for the outfit he said harshly
listen young fella you want to get
out of here alive dont you

  the question required no answer
and danny gave none

  sure you do pug nose said
and you can-if you obey orders


detective fiction weekly

  he paused while the other two came
crawling into the dugout their bodies
ringed danny into an uncomfortably
small space pug nose drew a slip of
yellow paper from his pocket and a
small pencil

  you write what i tell you he said
put it in your own words just say
that a gang has got the vaccine we
want twenty thousand for it when
they come across with the dough well
turn you loose to tell them where the
stuff is hidden theyll know its on
the level having your name signed on
the note

  danny nodded said sure ill do
that because by this time the brake-
man would be phoning in the mes-
sage-

  in old five dollar bills pug nose
said tell em to send one man in a
rowboat along the south shore until he
sees a blue shirt waved on a stick tell
em-

  danny didnt hear the rest he was
staring at the yellow slip of paper a
bank check it had mutual savings 
trust printed in big letters across its
face at the stub side was pictured a
tree smaller letters said big oaks
from tiny acorns grow

  then danny lane knew what hed
been trying to remember and the
knowledge of it leaped like flame in
his brain a crazy flame burning rea-
son clean out of him he forgot that he
was one against four-and that the
four were armed forgot that he was
weakened by exposure that his skull
was a thing of torture

  danny lane snarled-and smashed
his fist into the pug-nosed ones face

  he didnt knock the man flat far
from it the blow was only a gesture
no more hurtful than a womans slap

  but it brought them all down on
him pug noses backhanded punch

knocked danny to the wall the rifles
butt crashed into his groin as he
staggered

  and torres came plunging out of
his corner of the cave

  torres brought plenty of noise with
him there was baling wire around the
big brown mans waist wire firmly
twisted onto the boards at that end of
the dug-out along with the noise the
big man brought the whole boarded-up
wall ripping the timbers right out of
the earth

  a shower of dirt cascaded onto
danny lanes head the dugout was
full of falling dirt

 danny heard a scream shes
a-cavin

  in fact the whole roof tottered and
groaned a cloud of dust obscured the
lantern in the gray half-light danny
saw the three hijackers simultaneously
leap for the tiles mouth

  what followed wasnt pretty there
were two men wedged and struggling
in the tile screaming and cursing as
they fought and there was the pug-
nosed man standing over them
whipping that bayoneted revolver into
the squirming flesh of his partners

  torres stood watching twisting his
big arms out of the wire he didnt say
a word

  this lasted perhaps fifteen seconds
and then torres had his arms free
his hand shot out caught the pug-
nosed one by the neck shook him as a
terrier would shake a rat and threw
him aside he reached down and
dragged the other two out of the tile
one in each hand and smashed their
heads together then he threw them
on top of pug nose

  a bad hombre that torres

  but quite gently he took dannys
shoulder and pushed him to the holes
opening he still hadnt said a word

	d-
mercy hijacked



ecause he couldnt say any-
thing danny lane explained
this was later of course danny rested
on a cot in the refugee camp with his
head swathed in a great many band-
ages and talked a good deal more to
lucy orr than any nurse ought to let
her patient talk

  they had tape inside his mouth
across his teeth said danny so he
couldnt warn me you see theyd
wanted him to write the note and he
wouldnt-figured theyd kill him after
they got the money rather than leave
a witness alive hed seen a lot too
much he got off the train just before
it pulled away and saw the last of the
robbery being unarmed he ran up to
the barker farmhouse to give the alarm

  lucy said but barker was in it
too

  not in the hold-up itself he had
a team hitched to the hay baler so they
could hide the loot an old trick that
gang had used they used to ship out
booze from barkers still that way
anyhow barker saw torres go up to
the house he followed with a gun
and stood guard over him but torres
made a break and in the fight over the
gun killed barker but when he came
out of the house the rest of the gang
were there and had him covered

  danny thought a minute so they
baled the vaccine into the hay that
was the ker-thunk sound i heard then
by the time i got to the farmhouse they
were loading those bales into the car
they ran the car down to the bridge
and threw out part of the hay in it
and substituted the contraband and
used a trainmans spud to push the box-
car back up the siding leaving the
marks on the rails i saw thats why

there werent any footprints around the
siding in the mud

  lucy frowned but if the car was
being shipped to randalls farm-
they knew it wouldnt go in a
hurry common freight like that would
stand on a siding somewhere while the
relief food trains came through the
car wouldnt be opened for weeks
said danny no matter whod bought
the hay from barker randall being
in it was just coincidence

  the blonde girl shook her head and
said but what possessed you to try
to fight all those men when you even
thought torres was one of the hijack
gang

  i know muttered danny apolo-
getically i didnt have a chance but
i lost my head when i realized the
brakeman was the gangs inside man
-that my message would never be de-
livered by him because he was the one
who pulled the cord to stop the special
for the robbery-and tipped off the
gang in the dugout to nab me this
morning too

  her blue eyes were surprised dubi-
ous how could you know that
the check reminded me the pic-
ture of a tree on it thats what i was
trying to remember said danny the
brakeman claimed to know the quarry
spur so well but when the special
stopped i overheard him tell torres
there was probably a tree blown onto
the track

  a slow grin spread over most of
danny lanes face the part of his face
which wasnt hidden in bandages

  you see honey i had looked up
and down that track both ways there
were plenty of weeds-but not one
single tree in sight

plan in short it was his claim that
one of three prisoners in the institu-
tion was a stoolpigeon

   criminals have different terms which
they use in referring to informers

a true story
by convict 

the inside story of convicts who
trade in the trust of their fellow men

those men who curry favor by carry-
ing tales of the activities of their as-
sociates to officials the most common
term of course is a stoolpigeon but
they are also called rats cats and finks

  in most institutions the punishment
of a stoolpigeon when he makes the
mistake of informing on the wrong
man is death usually by a quick
thrust of a prison-made knife this
usually is done in a crowd of convicts
going to or from work or the mess
hall and many times the murderer is
never identified

  it has been more than  years
since i a youth of  in jail for the
first time heard an old counterfeiter
in the role of judge of a kangaroo
court describe a stoolpigeon

s

  there are men here in this jail
he said although i should not call
them men who will sell you out send
you to prison or place the hangmans
noose around your neck in return for
a smile from one of the turn-keys
these creatures-stoolpigeons rats
finks or whatever you call them-will
gain your confidence and betray you
for even less than the proverbial mess
of pottage so if you are innocent or
guilty keep your business to yourself
for there is no one in here who can
help you

  this little talk by a crook of the old
school one of those rare criminals who
had a code of honor something that
apparently does not exist among crim-
inals today made little impression
upon me at that time for i soon ob-
tained my release but some months
later when i checked into my first penal
institution a reformatory i recalled
his words of wisdom and it was not
long before i recognized among my
fellow workers my neighbors in the
cell-house and everywhere in the yard
where i went the species of the human
rat there was at least one there whom
i recalled as a schoolmate in my gram-
mar school days and i remembered
that even then he bore the reputation of
being a tattle-tale this caused me to
believe and observation in later life
confirmed this belief that stoolpigeons
are born and not made

  tolerated by prison officials and law
enforcement officers for their under-
cover work and hated by their fellow
criminals these creatures are a type
they have a shifty hang-dog look
about them are unable to look in the
eye of the person they are about to be-
tray and almost always they are the
lowest type of criminal the petty
thieves the panderers who live off their
women and drug addicts who would

put their own mothers behind the bars
to satisfy their longing for dope

  in this reformatory there were
official stoolpigeons prisoners who
wrere given authority to report other
prisoners for rule violations and their
reports carried as much weight as
those of the paid guards these un-
paid guards known as non-coms
wore a different uniform than that is-
sued to the rest of the prisoners and
were the most hated inmates in the in-
stitution they had their quarters in
dormitories in a building separate from
the cellhouses in which were housed the
 or more other prisoners these
special quarters were presumably a
form of reward but in reality they
were to protect these men from pun-
ishment at the hands of those whom
they had caused to be punished for rule
violations

had been in this institution but a
few months when i saw a demon-
stration of this stoolpigeons system
which was later to result in a vengeance
-delayed but none the less effective
i was employed in the office of the as-
sistant superintendent and in this
capacity worked after the hours when
the most of the other prisoners were
locked in their cells it was my duty
to certify the correctness of the count
at the close of each day a count which
was made by the non-coms one eve-
ning there was considerable delay in
the reports coming in from the various
cellhouses and a little later it was re-
ported that there was one man short
in b cell block immediately all the
guards and non-coms were congregated
in the institution yard and then the
superintendent made his appearance

   now men he said this man who
is missing has not been here long he
was assigned to the print shop and it is


detective fiction weekly

obvious that he has not yet made good
his escape from the yard he is hiding
somewhere within these walls it will
soon be dark and if we dont find him
before then he may succeed in getting
over the wall you prisoners who are
gathered here are men who have
proved that you can be trusted tonight
you will work with the guards in an at-
tempt to locate this missing prisoner
to any one of you who finds this man
or gives any information leading to his
hiding place i will give my word that
you will receive a governors parole
now scatter out and lets see if we cant
find him before it gets too dark

  i stood in the doorway of the as-
sistant superintendents office and heard
these remarks as the superintendent
made the promise of early liberty to
the prisoner non-com instrumental in
locating the missing man i could see
their faces light up with pleasurable
anticipation but only one of them was
to be rewarded the line had no sooner
broken than this non-com stepped up to
the superintendent and saluted smartly
what he told the official i of course
do not know but immediately follow-
ing this conversation the superinten-
dent summoned two guards and he ac-
companied them to a huge pile of coke
in the institution foundry and in a few
minutes the missing prisoner was
yanked from beneath the coke his face
and clothing streaked with dirt he
scowled at the smiling non-com who
had turned him in

  some day he said i will get even
with you for this

  the non-com received his conditonal
parole a week or ten days later while
the would-be escape artist went to the
punishment cell later i talked with
him in the recreation yard and he told
me that the non-com had suggested
that he hide out under this pile of coke

and it appeared that the informer had
deliberately framed the prisoner to
further his own personal interests the
man who had attempted to escape was
required to serve additional time and
although he swore vengeance upon the
man who had turned him in i did not
think at the time that he would ever
have an opportunity to fulfill these
threats

some two years later i was at re-
vere beach in boston when i met
the man who had hidden under the pile
of coke he told me he had obtained a
parole had received permission to re-
turn to boston his home and was
working steadily and doing well i
asked him if he had ever met the man
who had framed him he replied that
he had not but was sure he would
some day we walked over to a re-
freshment stand where i bought him
a soft drink with the glass halfway
to his lips he stopped and stared toward
a group of sailors a few feet away
then without a word he slammed the
glass on the counter and dashed to-
ward the group before i could catch
up with him he had grabbed one of the
blue-clad figures by the throat and had
him down on the ground pummeling
him severely

  there was no question as to the
victor of this fight up until the time
when they were taken in custody by the
police my friend the man with whom
i had been talking soon obtained his
release on bond provided by his par-
ents and it was not until then i
learned that his sailor victim was the
same man who had led the officers
to his hiding place in the reformatory
several years before he laughed off the
incident and seemed to be well satis-
fied that he had obtained his revenge
even though it had been delayed

  it seldom happens that a stoolpigeon
offers his services to a prison official
without being asked and when this
does happen the official usually be-
comes suspicious

  not many years ago in a midwestern
prison there was a man by the name
of mickey doolin his commitment
showed that he had received a term
of  years for robbery some two
weeks after his arrival he was inter-
viewed by the deputy warden in ref-
erence to a work assignment

  doolin said the deputy you have
a pretty bad past record this is the
fifth prison you have been in besides
a number of jails and workhouses you
have a long term here i know it is use-
less to try to reason with men of your
type youll probably try to escape and
of course it is our job to try to keep
you here but i want to warn you that
when a man tries to escape here we
shoot and we shoot to kill

  you got me wrong deputy said
doolin i didnt come here with any
intention of escaping its true ive got
a bad record but you wont find any-
thing on it about escaping you can
believe it or not but this is a bum beef
that got me this  years im not guilty
of this rap

  whether youre guilty or innocent
said the deputy is not our concern
the courts found you guilty or you
wouldnt be here if you can prove
your innocence and get out we shall not
put anything in your way well treat
you right as long as you treat us
right

  thats what i wanted to talk to
you about deputy said doolin pull-
ing his chair closer to the officials desk
and leaning forward confidentially
you see ive done time in so many
joints and hung out with crooks all my
life and ive got so i know most of

them either personally or by reputation
these men trust me deputy for ive
never been known to put the finger on
a man in my life but now its different
ive got  years to build and im get-
ting pretty well up in years ive got
sense enough to know that if i play
ball with you people you can help me
get out of here now i always said if
i ever turned stoolpigeon i would be
a first-class one and im ready to do
just that and ill guarantee there isnt
another man in this joint who can do
you more good and never be suspected
than i can

  i dont believe you doolin said the
deputy i think youre trying to work
some kind of an angle on me but im
willing to gamble a little with you to
find out our warden here doesnt be-
lieve in using informers but you know
as well as i do that no man can run
the inside of a prison without using
them im going to put you to work in
the kitchen for the time being and
meanwhile im going to keep an eye
on you and see just how sincere you
are

  doolin reported to the kitchen for
duty and found several men there he
had known in other jails and prisons
these men knowing him to be trust-
worthy in the past put him in right with
the others and it was not long before
mickey was in on the petty rackets be-
ing practiced in connection with food
supplies being stolen from the state
for several weeks he shared in the
profits to be made from stolen bits of
food and then almost every night one
of the waiters going from the kitchen
to his quarters would be called out of
line and searched and in every case
the man would be carrying a contra-
band package of food the kitchen con-
nivers put their heads together in an
effort to discover how the deputy


detective fiction weekly

warden was managing to catch the
right men each night they finally came
to the conclusion that some prisoner
working in the kitchen was tipping off
the official

  we know it aint any of the four
of us said mickey when asked for
his opinion weve all known each
other in other joints and we know
there aint a stoolpigeon in the bunch

  thats right

  the others agreed with him and
mickey continued sending the brief
notes to the deputy warden which led
to the discovery of the men carrying
away and selling the stolen foodstuff
from the kitchen the deputy found
an opportunity to compliment doolin
on his fine undercover work and the
prisoner assured him that he was go-
ing to prove to be the best stoolpigeon
ever to enter the institution

  the deputy warden was still puz-
zled at doolins attitude and wondered
if the man was sincere or trying to
work some sort of an angle to bring
about an opportunity to escape he
decided to watch doolin closely for
many years of experience in handling
convicts had taught him that it was
seldom that a criminal with a long rec-
ord in back of him ever turned stool-
pigeon

  having disposed of a number of
kitchen workers by having them
caught with contraband food doolin
was eventually promoted to the position
of night cook it took mickey several
weeks to have his three close friends
assigned to the hight shift with him

hat could be sweeter than
this doolin asked his com-
panions one night as they ate their mid-
night lunch here we are all long-
timers with records and working at
niht in the kitchen we are closer to

getting out of this joint than any other
guys in the prison

  ill have to admit that you have
done more in a few months than we
have been able to do in several years
admitted red mccarthy a bank robber
doing forty years and ive been
curious to know how you did it

  im going to cut you guys in on the
secret said mickey because i know
were all going out of here together
one of these dark nights some of you
may not agree with what ive done
but it was the only out i could see
and we are doing too much time to try
to do it all when i first come here
i told the deputy warden that i real-
ized  had more time than i could
build and i offered to be a stoolpigeon
for him well he knew that i was
friendly with all the right guys in the
joint and of course he was tickled to
death to add me to his long list of
finks naturally i had it in mind all
the time to crash the joint but i had
to have help i knew all you guys were
doing long jolts and i knew you could
be depended on so in order to convince
the deputy that i was on the level with
my snitching i had some of these guys
carrying chuck to the cellhouses
knocked over they werent our kind
of people anyway and none of them
was doing a long time so my con-
science dont hurt me none for what i
done the result is that we are all work-
ing on the night shift and got the best
chance well ever have of leaving this
place without telling the deputy goodby
what do you guys think of the way i
planned this thing

  wrell drawled red ill have to
admit that you got us in a pretty good
spot to lam the joint but somehow or
other i dont think i could have put
the finger on those other guys still i
suppose it was necessary in order to
big house cats



get in the deputys confidence and have
him accept your recommendations as
to us guys

  those guys who got knocked over
with the chuck dont mean a thing to
us said mickey the most of them
are honest johns anyway and the
few days they put up in the hole aint
going to hurt them now well have to
get our heads together and figure out
how were going to crash the joint we
dont want to lose too much time but
neither do we want to go into the
thing without figuring every angle if
we mess up this chance well never
get another one like it

  night after night mickey and his
three companions went over every de-
tail of their escape plan saw blades
to cut the bars of the basement win-
dow civilian clothing to don after
scaling the wall an automobile for
a getaway these were all discussed
finally after several weeks discussion
the plans were complete and a definite
date was set for the escape hacksaw
blades had been stolen from the auto-
mobile tag plant and were secreted in
the kitchen ready for use saturday
night was set as the time for the es-
cape mickey arguing that sunday
would afford better opportunities for
avoiding the dragnet which would be
thrown out for them mickeys com-
panions were jubilant over the pros-
pects of early liberty which seemed
to be almost within their grasp and
they were loud in their praise of the
man who had made it possible for
them to escape mickey also seemed
to be well pleased but he told the
others he was doing this as much for
himself as for then if his companions
had been present at an interview be-
tween the prisoner and the deputy
warden they would have had a better
understanding of the patience with

which mickey had planned the escape
and his eagerness for his companions
to join him

  i told you deputy said mickey
when i first came here that i would
make you the best informer you ever
had and in return i of course expect
you to do something for me

  you wont lose anything by help-
ing me said the deputy however all
i can do is make recommendations to
the warden but any time a man does
anything for me which i believe de-
serves a return favor ill go to the front
for him until he is rewarded you
have as you say been a good man
for me but still you havent done any-
thing that warrants me trying to get
your time reduced

  youre right deputy said mickey
yes sir youre exactly right but
what ive been doing is using my head
ive been gaining the confidence of the
desperate characters in the prison
what would you say if i told you that
three of the worst men you have here
are planning to escape and if it had
not been for me you would not have
known anything about it until after
they were gone

  who are they asked the deputy
trying to conceal his eagerness

  im going to tell you that said
mickey but first you realize that if
these men had succeeded in getting
away the newspapers would have put
you and the warden on the pan for it
now i think that i deserve some credit
for stopping this escape for i am now
in a position to do exactly that i real-
ize that i have a bad past record and
that i havent been here long but if
you will go to the warden i believe he
will recommend to the governor that
my time be cut so that i can get out in
about two years

  if i find that your story is based


detective fiction weekly

on facts said the deputy and if
your information enables me to pre-
vent an escape i will see that you are
properly rewarded

  okay said mickey  know your
word is good

tvtickey told of all the details be-
ing planned for the escape satur-
day night and of the hacksaw blades
already hidden in the kitchen the
deputy listened with interest

  now ended mickey theres one
more thing to be considered these
guys expect me to go with them and
in order to throw off suspicion ill have
to pretend that i am going along they
will have a long rope with a hook on
it to use in climbing the wall and you
can tell your guards that i will le the
fourth one to go over so they wont
shoot at me in that way it wont get
spread over the prison that i stooled
on these fellows if you want to you
can keep me in the dungeon a few days
to make it look on the level

  the deputy agreed to the plan and
promised that the men would not es-
cape

  of course he said i could put
them in solitary confinement before
they tried to escape but if i did that
i wouldnt have any evidence on them
except your story and the chances are
the warden wouldnt stand for them
being kept in solitary on that alone so
ill let them go through with the es-
cape and have enough guards planted
outside the wall to stop them if they
have to mow them down to do it

  mickey was well pleased with him-
self and began to plan on enjoying his
liberty within two years instead of the
twenty-five years the judge had given
him but to his companions he talked
of the stolen liberty which he said
would be theirs within a few days

  mickey found himself unable to
sleep on the friday preceding the day
set for the escape he wondered if
his companions would halt when com-
manded by the guards or if they
would be shot after all he was inter-
ested only in his freedom these men
meant nothing to him they were only
a means to an end

  friday night after the last of the
late work lines had been fed and sent
to their cells red mccarthy ap-
proached mickey

  mickey he said we have de-
cided that we should show our appre-
ciation of your putting us in a position
to lam tomorrow night so were going
to put on a big feed for you this is
one night when you can sit around and
take it easy were going to do all the
cooking and at midnight well have a
spread for you in the meantime you
go in the back get yourself a maga-
zine and read or take a nap if you
want to after tomorrow night well
have to split up for a while and theres
no telling when we will get together
again

  well said doolin i appreciate
you fellows doing this for me but you
must remember that i am getting just
as much benefit from it as you are
anyway ill enjoy the feed so you
fellows go to it

  it is possible mickey doolin suf-
fered some pangs of conscience as he
waited for his pals to prepare the big
feed they he must have thought
probably considered him a swell guy

  it was just past midnight when
mickey was called back to the kitchen
to find the table loaded with good food
most of which had been stolen from the
prison storeroom

  this is what we might call a fare-
well dinner said red that is its
farewell to this joint for us this time
big house cats



tomorrow night well be getting ready
to climb that wall and get on our way
back to the bright lights

  when the meal was over mickey
leaned back and stretched

  that sure was a swell feed he
said and were going to have lots
more of them in the outside world
well pull some big jobs too when
they get tired of looking for us well
 guess we had better clean up these
dishes and get them out of the way
before the night captain comes in
gosh but im sleepy guess i might
have eaten too much

  well take care of cleaning up
said red you go on back and lay
down if you want to well wake you
up in time to start the main line break-
fast

  mickey went to the back room and
stretched out on a bench in a few min-
utes he was snoring loudly his three
companions stood over him and
smiled

  hell be out for at least two or
three hours said red that stuff i
got from the nurse in the hospital is
sure strong well wed better start to
work on those bars in the basement
its almost one oclock and the captain
comes through about three

mickey was still snoring lustily
when the three men completed
the sawing of the bars which would
give them access to the prison yard
and with but one more barrier between
them and the outside world a thirty-
foot stone wall from a hiding place
in the kitchen storeroom they brought
forth a long rope to the end of which
was fastened a large iron hook hastily
they discarded their prison uniforms
and slipped into unnumbered overalls

  well said red i guess were all
set all we have to do now is keep an

eye on the guard in the corner tower
hes not likely to see us in the dark
and once we hit the ground well be in
the clear wont mickey be surprised
when he wakes up

  it was shortly after three oclock
in the morning when the night captain
entered the kitchen for his usual cup
of coffee seeing none of the prisoners
about the range he tiptoed back to an
alcove where he knew they often played
cards which was against the rules he
found no prisoners there quickening
his step he went to the back room
there he found mickey sprawled on a
bench he shook the prisoner several
times before doolin opened his eyes

  wheres the other boys asked the
captain

  eh said mickey still groggy
from the dope his three companions
had given him why they are clean-
ing up the table

  table repeated the captain
what are you talking about  i believe
youre drunk

  no muttered mickey just too
much-farewell dinner he sank back
on the bench and closed his eyes again

  when the deputy warden made his
appearance having been summoned by
the captain he found a way to rouse
mickey thoroughly

  where are they he demanded
you might as well come clean you
tricked me into this to have us off guard
so these men could escape god help
you if they are gone

  mickeys remonstrations were of no
avail the deputy refused to believe
that the prisoner had been sincere in
acting as an informer and he sent him
to the dungeon

  it was almost two years before the
last of the trio of escaped convicts
were apprehended and returned to
prison and when they had completed


detective fiction weekly

their terms in solitary confinement and
again appeared in the prison yard they
merely laughed when mickey asked
them to tell the deputy that they had
doped him but they did tell all their
friends of his informing on the men
with the contraband food and at last
reports mickey doolin distrusted by
prison officials and hated by his fellow
convicts walks alone in a crowded
prison knowing not when a knife will
be slipped between his ribs and doubt-
less as he contemplates the long years
in front of him he doesnt care when
and if the end comes

while mickey doolins plans
for profiting from being a stool-
pigeon ended as most convicts would
like to see all similar plans end there
have been instances where convicts
gained their liberty by assisting prison
officials without any intention of doing
so bob durant an oil stock swindler
serving a term in a western prison was
the central figure in a case of this kind

  durant was educated more or less
refined and was of a type among whom
are seldom found informers during
the day he worked in the prison library
and on five nights of the week he
taught a class of journalism in the in-
stitution school because of his like-
able personality and readiness at all
times to write letters for other inmates
and to advise them he was liked by
both officials and the inmate body 

  at some time during his life durant
had done newspaper work and his con-
tributions to the prison publication
showed that he possessed some writing
ability and for this reason he was per-
mitted to organize the first journalism
class in the prison durant was smart
enough to realize that his success with
this class would probably determine the
amount of time he would have to serve

on his five-year term consequently he
worked tirelessly with his students
durant soon learned that his class
was more interested in fiction writing
than reportorial work so he frequently
gave them story assignments based
upon plots which he would outline for
them he was outlining one of these
plots one night when the warden un-
noticed stood in back of him

  now men durant said there is
one important rule to follow in writ-
ing particularly while you are learn-
ing and that is to confine your writing
to subjects and locales with which you
are familiar that is why i am going
to give you an idea for a story to-
night which will have a prison as its
locale here is the situation a warden
of a prison is worried because of the
large amount of dope finding its way
into his prison his guards are unable
to locate the source of the dope but
its use in the institution has become
so widespread that news of it has
reached the outside world

  in this prison the inmates are per-
mitted to make curios for sale out-
side such as the ladies beaded bags
which some of you fellows make this
is the manner in which the dope is be-
ing smuggled into the prison one of
the prisoners who makes a practice of
buying up these bags from other in-
mates who have no outside markets is
the man who is the dope king he
is trusted and unsuspected by the prison
officials he frequently sends out bags
in quantities of a dozen or more to
outside customers on approval some
of these are purchased by these cus-
tomers and others are returned to the
prisoner as undesirable in the lining
of the returned bag the dope is con-
cealed and any of you who are familiar
with morphine or cocaine know that
many hundred dollars worth of the
btg house cats



narcotics at prison prices could be
concealed in one of these bags now
your problem is to write a story and
have the warden find a solution to his
dope problem without using a stool-
pigeon you have good material there
for a story and i want you to do your
best with it you will submit your com-
pleted manuscripts two weeks from to-
night and the best story will be pub-
lished in our local paper

  in less than two weeks after durants
talk to his class he was called from his
cell one night taken to the clothing de-
partment and dressed in civilian cloth-
ing from there he was taken to the
wardens office

  durant said the warden handing
the prisoner a long envelope i am glad
to hand you this pardon from the gov-
ernor which just arrived here also
is your ten dollars gate money and a
railroad ticket to the city from where
you were sentenced i want to person-
ally thank you for your services which
enabled me to break up this dope racket
and place the ringleaders in solitary
confinement where they will remain un-
til prosecuted by the federal govern-
ment i also wish to compliment you on

your clever scheme which you used in
informing me of the ingenjous plan
used in smuggling the dope when i
stopped at your class that night and
heard the beginning of your story out-
line i knew you were trying to tip me
off and believe me i didnt miss a
word of it good luck my boy and i
hope you never come back again
thank you warden

  durant shook the officials hand
passed through the big gates and as
he walked down the dark street toward
the railroad station he congratulated
himself upon serving a five-year term
in less than a year and wondered if
the man who had told him of the dope
scheme would believe him guilty of de-
liberately informing or if his friends
would still believe in him and that he
didnt know the warden was within
hearing distance when he outlined the
story plot but back in the prison where
the beaded bag merchant and his co-
conspirators were languishing in soli-
tary confinement durant was being
branded as a stoolpigeon and doubtless
in other prisons which he would visit
in the future the mark of judas would
still remain with him

 i

okay i said ill get you some of
coras clothes

i was lower than the well-known
snakes abdomen and the days take
from the machines wasnt making
me feel any better counting up in
luigis my last stop i found i had
about two hundred bucks in nickels
and while thats a lot of nickels to lift
it isnt such a hell of a lot to spend not
that i had the spending of the whole
two hundred my cut was only ten per
cent twenty bucks i thought a lousy
twenty bucks is all ive got to show for
two months in the racket eight or nine
weeks at a daily average of twenty-five
to thirty dollars and all ive got is
twenty bucks i wished i was back driv-
ing a truck

  it was around nine oclock luigis
was crowded as it usually was at that
time of night the bar was lined three
deep and the tables around the postage
stamp dance floor were full up the slot
machines and pin-ball games were red
hot and the suckers playing them had
been real indignant when i horned in
to make the collection i ought to be
ashamed interrupting their fun like
that if the damn fools had only known
it they might just as well have dropped
their nickels directly into my bag in-
stead of putting em in the machines
first it just made a lot of unnecessary


   a complete novelette
   by cleve f adams

author of murder makes a trade  etc

work you couldnt tell the suckers
that though

  luigi tipped me the wink and we
went down along the length of the bar
to his cubbyhole of an office he signed
the receipt for his cut and got out a
bottle you weel have the leetla dreenk
weeth luigi no 

  and how i said in fact i
wouldnt mind having six little drinks
with luigi or maybe eight i watched
him pour the scotch he was a round
paunchy little guy with very small
hands and feet and neatly parted
slicked-down hair his smile was so
white it reminded you of the dental
ads and he had soft velvety brown
eyes like a setter dogs wise and in-
telligent and friendly yet watchful too
i rather liked luigi

  he said lifting his glass and smiling
at me over the rim you better lay
off too moch from thees stoff hah
jerry

  i set my glass down empty oh
i said like that huh okay my fraan
ill buy my own from now on i
picked up my bag of nickels and started
out the door

  he laid a hand on my arm you
theenk luigi heesa tight weeth hees
liquor hah

from the doorway

  well what would you think

  a smart boy he said a smart
guy might theenk mebbe luigi heesa
like you jerry mebbe heesa try sav-
ing you more trobble as you already
got hah

  i just stood there looking at him
not saying anything for a minute be-
cause all of a sudden my tonsils felt
funny kind of all knotted up if you
know what i mean the little guy was
telling me he liked me too and that
most of the jams id got myself in were
on account of red-eye he didnt know
about the worst one of course nobody
did except big ed harmon the guy i
worked for and a couple more of his
boys whod been in the room at the
time and oh yes id spilled to cora
my wife luigi and apparently every-
body else in town knew about cora
just thinking about the little tramp
made me see red all over again and i
shook luigi off and went outside to the
bar

rphe mob had shifted a little so that
there was a cleared space about a
foot wide i squeezed in ordered a rye
somebody grabbed my elbow as i
picked up the drink and i thought it
was luigi again and pulled the old
olsen  johnson gag the one that
goes get away from me boys you
bother me it turned out to be my
wife instead of luigi and she didnt
think the gag was as funny as olsen 
johnson did

  she said so i bother you do i
she was a little tight and her lip rouge
was smeared i wondered whod been
kissing her now she gave me a baby-
faced stare okay so i bother you
well for fifty bucks i wont bother
you any more not tonight anyway
she smiled then a mean smile

  the guy next to me said hello

sugar if your boy friend aint got the
fifty see me see lil ol georgie

  no i didnt hit him id practically
worn out my right fist on other guys
jaws trying to put an end to cracks like
that it just wasnt any use maybe 
was a little tight too maybe i was just
seeing her for the first time really see-
ing her i mean seeing behind her big
violet eyes and her cornsilk hair and all
the rest of her seeing the thing that
made cracks like this mugs possible
for a while id thought she was just a
fool but now i knew different

  i reached down in the leather bag
and got out ten rolls of nickels twenty
bucks heres twenty i said all
ive got in the world i wish it was
twenty grand and youd use it to buy
a one way ticket

  she looked at the loaded bag
whats the matter jerry-afraid of
big ed

  no i said my lips felt tight across
my teeth no ed wouldnt care if i
gave you the whole works only i
wont i dumped the ten rolls of
nickels in her hands now scram
her voice got shrill you heel
what am i going to do with four hun-
dred nickels

  i said i didnt care what she did with
them i didnt either all i wanted was
to get away from her before i killed
somebody i tossed a quarter on the
bar started toward the front door her
voice topped the slam of the music
against my ears she was calling the
bartender names because he wouldnt
change the nickels into bills

  it was raining again not hard just
a sort of discouraged drizzle i stood
there on the sidewalk for a minute let-
ting the rain hit my face it felt good a
couple of guys came out looked at me
giggled as they went by i knew they
were laughing at me and i faded back

	d-
punk



into the shadows cora came out she
was laughing too she was with the
guy that had made the crack i went
back inside and hoisted a couple of
quick ones

  the bartender looked at me as
though hed never seen me before the
crowd was working hard at having its
fun again not even a ripple i thought
something can happen to you right in
plain sight of a couple of hundred peo-
ple something that tears the heart out
of you and makes you want to get your
hands on somebodys throat and
squeeze and squeeze-i looked around
to see if i was wrong see if somebody
in that mob wasnt reading my mind
and then i got the shakes read my
mind was i actually planning on do-
ing it no i thought no it isnt me
its the liquor and then i got more
scared than ever if i kept on like this
i might get cocked some time and   

  the bartender came back with a
fresh bottle he set it down in front
of me started away i said hey wait
a minute i want you to see my latest
trick he looked bored but waited
leaning his elbows on the bar and
watching me i poured a stiff drink as
if it were a very difficult feat it wasnt
so easy at that my hands were shaking
so that some of the rye slopped over
on the bar i lifted the glass and held it
to the light then very deliberately i
inverted it and dumped the lousy stuff
into a gobboon i gave him a tight grin
that i said is the trick its sup-
posed to be the picture of a guys last
drink pretty good huh

  he looked doubtful he said well
if you pay for it i guess i cant stop
you doin what you want with it he
took the bottle away with him though
somebody touched my shoulder and i
whirled nervously it was slats mc-
kenna

 d-

  mckenna said i heard that jerry
sounded okay to me

  slats mckenna was a dick a hell of
a good one according to the papers 
wasnt thinking of him as a dick
though not even after the tap on the
shoulder exactly the way id been ex-
pecting it for quite a while now you
see slats and i and big ed harmon
had all grown up together south of the
tracks just the three of us for a while
then big-eyed skinny-legged fran had
moved into our block she was mrs ed
harmon now funny how things turn
out huh big ed had shouldered his
way to the top of the rackets picking
up frances on the way slats mckenna
was a dick and what was i well
youve got me there just a bum i
guess

  mckenna said lets go outside
jerry i want to talk to you seeing
you dump that slug of rye makes it
easier he was a tall rangy guy with
a pronounced stoop and a dark serious
face he hadnt changed much in the
last ten years marriage and a couple
of kids on a cops pay had given him
the stoop i guessed the serious look
had always been there

we went out and sat in his car
at the curb the rain was com-
ing down a little harder now the
sound of it on the turret top that and
being with a guy like slats did some-
thing to me made me feel a little bet-
ter somehow

  slats said quietly ive been watch-
ing you boy ever since you got
crocked and married that little cora
tramp shes bad medicine jerry
well you wouldnt think a guy
would let another guy talk that way
about his wife would you i did in
the first place mckenna was my friend
and he wasnt trying to be funny in


detective fiction weekly

the second place there was no argu-
ment about cora being a tramp all i
said was a lop-sided youre telling
me

  after a while slats said not looking
at me just staring out through the
streaming windshield why not try
reversing the english for a change
kid i mean when fran gave you the
air you got crocked and joined the
navy that was smart

  well i said grinning i learned
a trade anyway

  im coming to that presently jerry
you learned a trade but you lost
frances for good the hitch in the
navy kept you out of circulation for
quite a spell if you remember when
you finally did get out and found big
ed had copped frances what did you
do you got crocked again and woke
up married to cora smart huh 

  well putting it like that it didnt
look very smart did it  being married
youre supposed to support the gal and
so id signed on as radio op on a
standard oil tanker yep thats the
trade theyd taught me in the navy
only it kept me away from home too
much id get back from a three weeks
trip and find cora hadnt been exactly
lonesome if you know what i mean
not that i was in love with her not
like id been with fran but still and
all she was my wife and a guy likes to
carry his head up

  slats went on as though id been
talking out loud there werent any
radio jobs ashore and all you could get
was the chance to nurse a truck around
all day only thing was you werent
making enough dough to please cutie
she kept nagging you about how youd
grown up with big ed and why didnt
you get him to do something for you

  i gave him a surprised look how
did you know that

  ive got eyes he said and his
profile looked older more tired some-
how i couldnt get sore at him he was
using no  sandpaper on me and still
i couldnt get sore he said youre
working for ed arent you explain-
ing quite simply that one and one added
up to two working for big ed is also
bad medicine jerry

  i said stubbornly it pays some real
dough and what im doing is on the
up and up as far as the laws concerned
if the da says the machines are
games of skill who am i to tell the
suckers different

  he reached forward wiped fog off
the inside of the glass all right what
youre doing now is maybe not so bad
but how do you know itll stop there
once youre in boy youre in

  nuts i scoffed ed would be the
first one to mitt me if i got out of the
racket the only reason he gave me the
job at all was because of old times
show me a real job and ill get out
he turned then grinned at me
okay keed thats a promise i was
talking to kramer up at cbs i told
him how good you were and he said if
you were that good-

  you mean a technicians berth at
cbs 

  maybe chief theyre having a sort
of shakeup maybe you could talk your-
self up better than i did

  i couldnt say anything for a min-
ute i mean this guy beside me was real
people ed was okay too of course but
id been thinking about what id do
if he ever asked me to step over the
line this way i wouldnt have to find
out i could take a brace and maybe
pay cora off some way and  i didnt
go any farther than that the reason i
didnt was that slats had gotten tired
of waiting for me to say thanks and
was talking again about something
punk



else i cant get a line on the lug he
was complaining you wouldnt hap-
pen to know him would you jerry
guy by the name of heinie ziegler 

  i felt as though hed just clouted me
behind the ear this guy ziegler was
going to be pretty hard to find-i
hoped he was the mug id killed a
month or so back thirty-seven days
to be exact you dont forget the date
of things like that i got a cigarette
out scratched the match but somehow
i couldnt get the two together then i
noticed that my hands were shaking
ziegler i coughed no i dont
think i know him

  slats reached over held the match
steady for me im glad youre off the
stuff keed another week and youd
be in the dt ward out at the county
his eyes burned me i flipped the match
out the window as an excuse to turn
away so he couldnt read the fear that
must have been plastered all over my
face

  he didnt seem to notice

  funny you dont know him he
said musingly he used to be one of
big eds punks i went up to see ed
and he said the guy had gone to chi-
cago but i think he was lying

  the cigarette fell out of my mouth
i just couldnt help it slats mckenna
wasnt my friend any more he was a
dick and i was a murderer he leaned
down and got the cig where it was
burning a hole in the floor mat took
a couple of quick drags threw it away
it reminded me of how we used to
share snipes when we were kids south
of the tracks for a second i almost
broke down and told him the whole
works then i took a gander at his face
and knew i couldnt he was not only
a tough cop he was an honest cop
hed crucify me if he knew

  i	twisted the door handle well

thanks a million slats ill go up and
see kramer tomorrow

  better make it tonight jerry
these things dont wait i told kramer
id have you on deck if i could find
you

  okay tonight then i was out on
the sidewalk now in a hurry i had to
get to big ed and find out what was
happening ill go down and check in
and then ill go see kramer

  swell slats said a shower will
snap you out of it jerry better take
something for that breath though

  i told him id do that too and then i
was slogging toward my own car lug-
ging the sack of nickels that damned
sack was beginning to remind me of an
anchor something i couldnt get away
from i laughed at that of course i
could get away just as i could from
big ed harmon all i had to do was
drop them both getting in my car i
was surprised to note that it was rain-
ing then i remembered that it had
been raining all evening i reached in
the door pocket for the spare bottle
that i usually carried had the cap off
and the neck rattling against my teeth
before i remembered remembered
what fat little luigi had said and
slats i hurled the bottle through the
window it smashed on the sidewalk
and little rivulf of liquor ran down to
the curb somewhere down the street
back of me a horn tooted twice that
would be slats i thought applauding
me for busting the bottle i didnt feel
very heroic i felt like hell

ii

f ihe title guarantee building was
all lit up like a church when i got
there usually at that time of night it
was pretty quiet but it must have been
tax time or something because every-
body connected with the real estate


detective fiction weekly

racket title searchers and all were
working late id always gotten a kick
out of big ed having his headquarters
in a building like that of course ed
was the first big shot id ever known
personally but nearly every one i re-
membered reading about transacted his
business from a more or less swanky
night club it seemed to be the thing
to do big ed was different he had
over half of the seventh floor of the
title guarantee and the doors that
werent marked private were labeled
the harmon amusement enterprises
inc as far as i knew he didnt have
any hideaways or cafes or any of the
usual clap-trap maybe he had em but
 didnt know about em i didnt want
to know about them

  i rode up in the elevator with four
or five clerks whod been out for a
snack a couple worked for ed and
they looked at my leather grip and
grinned i might have been a collector
for the telephone company even in-
cluding the gun in my shoulder clip

  only i wasnt

   checked in with the cashier went
through a couple semi-private offices
and knocked on eds door there were
a couple gorillas sitting there in the
anteroom coats off and rods exposed
but they didnt pay me a bit of atten-
tion believe it or not they were play-
ing checkers after a minute ed him-
self opened the door

  oh its you jerry he was a little
bigger than i was though it wasnt his
size that got him his name he wore
good clothes as if he were used to them
always had agardenia in his lapel and
a faint scent of soap clung to him as
though hed just stepped out of his
bath he looked like a senior executive
in a business whose stock was selling
above par i guess he was at that

  i said yeah its me could i talk

to you for a minute ed something
has come up that 

  he gave me a smile opened the door
wider i went in he came around and
sat down behind his desk okay jerry
shoot

   told him first about slats mckenna
looking for heinie ziegler you sure
im covered ed sure somebody hasnt
popped off

  ed looked at his nails like every-
thing else about him theyd had plenty
of the right kind of attention hed
come a long way since he and i and
slats prowled the freight yards for
scrap iron to sell to the junkie some-
how  was embarrassed in front of
him not like  was with slats  guess
its the same as two guys who go to
college together and one of them turns
out to be a success i hadnt gone to
college but i was the other one just the
same  didnt blame fran for picking
the winner

  ed looked at me and for the first
time i noticed how cold his eyes were
youre covered he said briefly un-
less youve gotten drunk and belched to
someone yourself have you

  i thought about how id told cora
my wife the night i did it god id
had to tell someone  was half off my
nut not that this heinie ziegler hadnt
had it coming in a way it was even
self defense but there wasnt a chance
of making a jury believe that

  eds voice had a little undertone of
menace in it when he repeated have
you jerry

  do you think im crazy i asked
him its bad enough to have you and
danville and skeeter in on it im not
doing any advertising thank you its
just that mckenna picking me to ask-
well i got the jitters is all

  i see he said and then giving me
a quick level stare what else did
punk



you and mckenna talk about you
were with him quite a while

  i didnt get it for a minute then i
did and i was sore as a boiled owl
having me tailed huh whats the
matter afraid ill knock down a few
of your lousy nickels

  now dont get red-headed jerry
one of the punks just happened to be
in luigis and phoned me he thought
you might be in a jam of some kind
as if im not and that reminds
me ed ive got a chance to go to work
for cbs im checking out on you
he went back to studying his nice
nails mckenna

yes hes the one got me the break
and will your wife think its a
break jerry they tell me that even
what youre making with me isnt
enough for cora

  to hell with her im through
washed up

  he shook his head no jerry i
cant let you do it

  you mean you wont you mean i
cant walk out if i want to the hell
with that im going

  again he shook his head he was
smiling but it didnt mean a thing his
eyes were diamond hard nobody
walks out on me jerry maybe theyre
carried out but they dont walk i need
good boys jerry boys i can depend
on i can depend on you cant i
jerry

  you couldnt miss what he meant
you either stuck-or you got stuck
with me it was just a little murder
rap of course nothing serious look-
ing at it from his angle i wrondered
what he had to be afraid of from me
the answer was nothing i didnt know
a thing more than the whole town
knew he could hire a hundred guys to
do the work i was doing well then
why didnt he why did he want to

hang onto me sort of desperately i
asked him i wasnt cut out for the big
time ed im just a punk i guess
whats it to you 

  this time when he looked at me i
actually shivered punks he said
are useful sometimes jerry espe-
cially with a rap hanging over them like
yours and if you ever get the bright
idea that i could be clipped as an ac-
cessory just forget it i couldnt he
sat up a little straighter touched a but-
ton on his desk i think well be able
to get along jerry now that we un-
derstand each other

filhe door opened and the two
gorillas came in i took my hand
away from my gun yep for a second
id seen the well-known red id been
on the point of letting him have it
sick actually sick at my stomach i
stumbled toward the door eds voice
halted me better lay off the liquor
keed its bad for you

  i know i said dully youre
about the fifth guy thats told me to-
night i went out and got in an ele-
vator and dropped to the lobby a guy
looking at the building directory turned
and gave me a screwy stare did you
speak to me

  i guess i must have been mumbling
out loud i said it was two other
guys mister and pushed out to the
street in the car i reached for the
bottle in the door pocket before i re-
membered that it wasnt there any
more there didnt seem to be any-
thing to do except stop somewhere and
get tanked to the eyes only i couldnt
think of any place where there wouldnt
be somebody else too and i didnt want
to see even a bartender for a while i
went home hoping cora hadnt found
that last pint she had though i
flopped on the davenport in the living


detective fiction weekly

room too tired to even undress after
a while i went to sleep

  the ringing of the front door bell
woke me i didnt identify it as the
front door bell right off the bat id
been dreaming i was in a broadcast sta-
tion control room trying to get an
sos through on account of an earth-
quake was rapidly making kindling out
of our fair city it was pretty real i
mean i could feel the building tottering
under my feet but the most vivid of
all was big ed harmon holding a gun
on me and telling me to lay off that
he didnt want anybody to know there
was an earthquake i kept thinking
theyve gotta know ive gotta tell
em and then i remembered the little
alarm button recessed in the floor i put
my foot on this and a dozen alarms
started singing so loud it woke me up
the dozen alarms turned out to be the
apartment bell maybe i should have
been relieved at that but i wasnt i
just lay there for a minute shivering
wondering if maybe big ed hadnt
changed his mind about me not about
letting me go but about making the
parting permanent maybe id worried
him almost pulling my rod like that
maybe hed sent a couple of the boys
over to see that it didnt happen again
the bell kept ringing

  finally i couldnt stand the suspense
any more and got up and went over to
the door maybe i thought its just
cora she mightve forgotten her key
i jerked my gun out of the clip twisted
the knob and leaped back i was so
surprised i couldnt shut my own
mouth it wasnt cora standing there
it wasnt the couple of hoods id
imagined it was fran yep thats
right frances harmon big eds wife
she was as scared as i was her big
eyes looked enormous in the dead white
of her face and her dark hair was all

mussed up and wet from the rain she
didnt have any coat on and her gown
was sopping what there was left of it
somebody had been playing rough

  i grabbed her yanked her inside be-
fore some of the other tenants could
see her in case they got curious

  she started sobbing then not noisily
but as if shed run her heart out i put
my two arms around her held her close
for a minute trying to kid her out of
it its okay fran im here and you
know how ive always felt about you
take a brace keed tell papa

  she put her hands on my chest
pushed me away a little so that she
could look up into my ugly mug oh
jerry im sorry if im putting you on
a spot i-i just couldnt seem to think
of anybody else to go to and i didnt
have any money or clothes or- she
broke off and her eyes sort of rolled up
in her head oh jerry im scared
that makes two of us i said 
picked her up and carried her over to
the couch come on fran tell me
what happened and then ill see about
getting you some dry clothes

she wiped her mouth with the back
of her hand not like a guy remov-
ing the last of the mashed potatoes but
trying to stop her lips from quivering
ed just shot and killed a man i-i
saw it

  where in his office

  no at home home was a pent-
house out in beverly hills i looked at
my wristwatch id been asleep two
hours it was just a little after mid-
night

  okay i said tell me about it
fast fran

  it-it was state senator delgardo
hed been waiting for ed to come
home ed brought another man with
him a man named ames i think the
punk



three of them went into the library and
i went to bed not long after that i
heard shots i ran to the library door
got it open and-and there was the
senator on the floor ames was stoop-
ing over him cursing but it was ed
who had the gun it-it was still smok-
ing  guess i must have screamed at
that they turned and ames started
cursing ed then they both started for
me they caught me in one of the guest
rooms and ames insisted they kill me
too ed said that could wait finally
they locked me in and went back to the
library i guess

  how did you get away

  she shivered out the window i
crawled along a ledge till i got to a
fire escape

   did a little shivering myself i knew
the penthouse knew how it was built
on a corner instead of in the middle of
the roof crawling along a narrow
parapet in the rain thirteen stories
above the street-well it was no won-
der she was jittery

  i said look fran how much do
you know of big eds business besides
this kill who is this ames guy

  i dont know jerry somebody im-
portant i guess about ed-well ive
heard rumors of course i read the
papers lately things havent been go-
ing so well between us she gave me
a direct look i-i guess i never loved
him enough to overlook some of the
things theyre saying about him but
thats all i know hes never told me
anything himself except to mind my
own business

  okay i said ill get you some of
coras clothes

  thats what you think cora said
she was standing in her bedroom door
a nasty little grin on her face and not
much else on her body you could see
right through the filmy nightie but

somehow i didnt get a thrill i won-
dered how long shed been there

  she told me that too long enough
to get the whole picture you heel big
violet eyes stared insolently at frances
i guess youre the dame my husband
is sorry he didnt marry

  frans dark eyes went wide at that
but she didnt say anything i said
now look cora you and i have had
our differences but this gals in a spot
do you give her an outfit or do i have
to slap you to sleep

  just try slapping somebody cora
said she brought a hand around the
one shed been holding behind her and
she had one of those small pearl-
handled purse-guns in it id dropped
my own rod when i picked up fran i
felt kind of foolish

  i said now take it easy cora
well work this thing out

  youre damned right we will punk
well work it out so it adds up to some
real money not the kind youve been
handing me lately she got a curious
speculative look on her beautiful pan
you had to hand her that much she
certainly was beautiful but she was
as hard as nails she grinned in fact
jerry i dont think ill need you any
more

  well i suppose i could have jumped
her gun at another time id have tried
it at least but she was all keyed up to
shoot and she had everything on her
side i mean she zvas my wife it was
our apartment fran didnt have many
clothes on either and cora could shoot
the both of us and claim wed violated
the sanctity of the home probably big
ed and this ames guy would pay her
a bonus for doing the job herself in-
stead of just fingering us a sweet set-
up huh

  i said okay baby its your play
  she came out into the room kicked


detective fiction weekly

my rod under a chair then gun held
almost negligently she gestured us into
the coat closet in the hall the key
turned id never noticed it before but
that damned closet door opened in
fran and i were liable to stay put for
a long time

  the situation wasnt funny

ill

    oras tinkly little laugh brittle
as glass came to us after that we
didnt hear any more until the outside
door closed in the dark i wrapped a
spare overcoat around fran she was
shivering with the cold

  i said cheer up kid were not
licked yet

  she didnt sound frightened i
didnt know women like that really
existed jerry do they or is it all just
a bad dream

  no i grated its bad but it isnt
a dream cora is just part of the well-
known cassidy luck funny you com-
ing here fran i mean of the million
and a half people in los angeles youd
have to pick jerry cassidy and his
wife i didnt tell her that shed run
from one killer straight into the arms
of another there didnt seem to be
any point to making her feel worse than
she did well  thought i wont have
to worry any more about taking the
rap for the heinie ziegler kill ill just
disappear like he did and like fran
will	- f

  frances said you think she will try
to sell us to ed

  no im sure of it i told her to
move over out of the way grabbed the
doorknob with both hands wedged my
back against the wall and put my feet
up under the knob you get a lot of
leverage that way my luck still held
the knob came off in my hands i hit
the floor at the same time the other half

of the knob did only it had the edge
it was on the outside

  fran flopped down beside me jerry
are you hurt 

  only my vanity i told her sud-
denly i chuckled not because that was
a new name for the place that hurt but
because id just remembered some-
thing up on the shelf in that closet
was a kit of car tools the ones id
swiped out of the old car when  traded
it in youve probably done that same
thing yourself its one of those little
not-quite-honest tricks that goes under
the head of good sense you dont get
any more allowance for a car with tools
than you do without so why waste
em they say crime dont pay well
if lifting those tools was a crime the
moralists must have slipped because
they sure came in handy we were out-
side in two minutes

  fran picked out an armload of
coras clothes went into the bath i
prowled through coras vanity came
up with two diamond rings id given
her and a small roll of bills youll
maybe get a better idea of cora when i
tell you there were two cs in that roll
two hundred dollars and not three
hours ago shed nicked me for my last
twenty

  fran came out shed picked the
more quiet things a brown sport suit
brown hat and shoes she looked tired
but like a million to me

  fran i said ive found a little
stake enough to do us for a while if
were careful and stick together we
cant make it separately you ready to
go with a bum like me

  she gave me her hand anywhere
jerry cassidy if youre a bum well
be bums together

  i couldnt say anything to that i just
took her arm and went out to the living
room stooping on the way to get my
punk



rod from under the chair we went
down to my car it had stopped raining
and i thought that might be a good
sign

ate were about half way down
  the first block when i happened
to look in the rear vision mirror a car
without lights had just pulled up in
front of the apartment a couple of
guys got out started inside then one
of them half turned looked down the
street and spotted my tail-light any-
way i guess thats what made him
wave his arm in my direction the car
without lights got under way thats
all i waited to see i romped on the
accelerator till the chewy thought it
was a super-charged vibrator we
raced around the first corner on two
wheels straightened out from a skid
that almost smashed us against the
curb reversed at the next turn and did
it all over again we were probably
making about fifty but it seemed like
ninety

  fran was on her knees looking out
the rear window and cheering me on
like it was a race of high school kids at
three in the afternoon there was a
little pinggg and a slug cut through the
window and smashed the mirror all
right i thought youre asking for it i
yelled at fran  get down on the floor
nit-wit were gonna play games too

  the scenery consisting mostly of
darkened store-fronts was going by us
a mile a minute the street was still as
wet as the bottom of the ocean only
slicker fran was down on the floor
now saying little prayers and i hoped
the chewys body was as good as the
ads said i didnt slam on the brakes i
was afraid to on that greasy pavement
it wasnt necessary anyway from the
tail of my eye i saw the emblem on the
other cars nose creep up then part of

the hood all i did was take my foot
off the throttle youd think we had
stopped dead i put two quick slugs in
an open window as the other job leaped
ahead not knowing how many guys
were inside not caring the big car
wras a full length up on us before it
went into a kind of tail spin it skidded
the width of the street bounced back
to the center started whirling round
and round it went and i knew its brakes
were locked i was half around in a u
turn by this time somebody in the
spinning car took a shot at us missed
then the machine he was in suddenly
quit acting like a dizzy ballet dancer
and went flying off at a tangent the
last i saw of it was when it crashed a
light pole

  i straightened out in the opposite di-
rection and began fanning the air in
earnest the main reason was a prowl
cars siren i didnt want to meet any
cops till id had time to stash frances
in a safe place maybe not even then
what with big ed being on familiar
terms with state senators and one
thing and another i had no assurance
id be any safer in jail this guy ames
had me kind of worried too i mean i
thought his name had a familiar sound
to it but i couldnt seem to place it
fran had said hed cursed ed any-
body big enough to curse ed must be
no small potatoes maybe hes lieuten-
ant-governor or something i thought
anyway between the two of them
they were pretty sure to swing a mean
drag politically enough to see that a
punk named jerry cassidy didnt talk
to the wrong cops   

  i left the car in an alley and fran
and i walked the two blocks to the
hotel mercer it was a good middle-
class house not too gaudy not too
cheap the clerk lifted an eyebrow at
our lack of baggage


detective fiction weekly

  fire i explained practically
ruined our flat and what the fire missed
the smoke-eaters took care of we left
it as is for the adjusters to worry
over

  he accepted that at face value i
thought it was pretty good myself i
peeled a twenty off coras roll asked
for a suite or at least two rooms with
connecting bath we got the two rooms
registering as john jones and frances
jones brother and sister not that i
expected big ed or cora to ever use
the register in a divorce action

  a hop took us up to the third opened
all the windows in both rooms put
them down again when i yelled at him
finally went away with a dollar and a
request for some cigarettes i gave fran
the old grin

  well kid here we are not so bad
huh

  she nodded pretty swell jerry
you i mean

  i said nuts you want something
to eat drink

  she said she didnt she took off her
hat and the suit coat mind if i stay
in here writh you for a while jerry
i saw she was getting the jeebies all
over again well who wouldnt i
wasnt feeling any too good myself
but it wasnt sympathy that made me
say baby you can stay with me the
rest of our lives if you want to

  her nice mouth quirked a little at
that the rest of our lives she said
that may not be very long jerry i
let that ride because there was no use
kidding her after a while she said
jerry would you mind kissing me
just once

  it wasnt any chore i kissed her
then straightened and stood looking
down at her why did you want me
to do that 

  i dont know she admitted i

just thought it might be a good idea
she got up took her-or rather coras
-hat and coat and went to the connect-
ing door im going to lie down for a
while jerry

  but look i said hey you just
claimed you wanted to stay in here
with me

  i know she nodded and then
we gals are funny jerry youll find
that out some day the door closed
behind her

  i just stood there

somebody knocked on the hall
door and i thought it was the hop
coming back with the cigarettes come
on in i said the door opened quietly
and there was detective-sergeant slats
mckenna as big as life and just about
as unpleasant

  to give you some idea of how un-
pleasant he really intended to be he
had his gun out in plain sight his lean
dark face was drawn tired-looking
and the down-drooping mouth was
more than just tired it was cynical
his eyes looked like two burned holes
in a navy blanket he shut the door
quietly behind him stood leaning
against it

  well jerry he said we do find
out things about people dont we
whyd you do it i mean why did
you have to do it that way

  why did i do what i sparred i
knew of course somehow the guy had
found out about the heinie ziegler
kill and what do you mean by that
way what difference does it make
he gave me a screwy look so you
do know what im talking about id
sort of hoped you wouldnt

  well id certainly left myself open
on that one thats the trouble with
cops and a guilty conscience they ask
you two questions at once and youre
punk



so busy trying to evade one that you
trip on the other

  he said all right jerry turn
around slowly now i dont want to
have to hurt you

  no i said i can see that all
you want to do is have my neck
stretched about a yard i turned
around though and he came up behind
me reached around and got my gun
he was sniffing it when i looked at him
again like a bloodhound i couldnt
quite figure this out i mean it had
been thirty-seven days since pd blasted
ziegler and even a punk as dumb as me
wouldnt be expected to carry a dirty
gun all that time besides it wasnt the
same gun big ed had gotten me a new
one then i remembered that id just
got through using the rod on the hoods
that were chasing us maybe i thought
he dont know about ziegler maybe
im being picked up for this other
thing

  i said now wait a minute slats
maybe i can explain

  you dont have to he said tiredly
its all quite clear cora caught you
cheating with this other dame and you
let her have it he dropped my heater
in his pocket he could have made it
vanish in thin air and i wouldnt have
been surprised i was numb from head
to foot already i was supposed to have
killed my wife

  funnyhuh id really killed ziegler
id more than likely killed a hood or
two in that car but was i wanted for
either of those things no indeed no
i was being arrested for murdering
cora it was to laugh-if you felt like
laughing me i didnt my brain sud-
denly unlocked slats was saying i
knew you hated her jerry everybody
knew it and you had plenty cause but
to do it over another woman-to just
toss her out in the gutter like that-

well you never seemed like that kind
of a guy is all who is this dame pos-
ing as your sister

  i tried not to look at frans door it
was closed a little while ago i knew i
hoped it still was hoped she wasnt
getting a load of this oh  know it all
looks quite simple on the surface all i
had to do was get fran to tell slats it
couldnt have been me who let cora
have it shed say why big ed did
it of course right after he got
through killing senator delgardo
only thing was slats wouldnt be-
lieve it there was the old record of
fran and i going together back in the
days when we were all kids there was
my known hatred for cora and my hot
gun ballistics of course could prove
that it wasnt the gun that had done for
cora but at the moment i was all out
of ballistics experts slats would nat-
urally think fran was trying to cover
me and not doing a very good job of
it hed say okay you can come
along too fran suppose he did that
suppose we all went down to head-
quarters by this time big ed and the
ames party would thoughtfully have
gotten rid of delgardos body there
wouldnt be any proof theyd think
fran was lying and let big ed spring
her once sprung it didnt take a very
vivid imagination to picture what
would happen to her

  i wet my lips look slats how
come you found me

  he gave me a sour grin they
found cora first after that there was
a general alarm out for you a prowl
car located your car in an alley near
here and it had a bullet hole in it-you
must have missed cora with that one-
and so they sent me out because i could
describe you better than most funny
huh he wasnt liking this much bet-
ter than i was


detective fiction weekly

  i said yes it certainly was very
funny all the time i kept wondering
what to do about fran if i didnt drag
her into it let slats think shed lammed
then what why then hed grab me
and shed be left alone with a general
alarm out he couldnt keep the pinch
quiet big ed knowing fran had been
with me would send a batch of hoods
after her

  i almost went down on my knees to
the guy slats i jittered i didnt
kill cora she had it coming and i ad-
mit im not so awfully sorry but i
didnt kill her i swear it

  his dark eyes said i was a snivelling
heel who else would want to punk 

well id look cute telling him
big ed had done it i wasnt
even sure he had hed probably
ordered it done and had an unbreak-
able alibi maybe i wasnt thinking
straight maybe you can figure what
i should have done all im telling you
is what i did i took a chance on mc-
kennas gun came out of a sort of half
crouch and hung a hard right on his
lantern jaw his head snapped back
against the hall door after that he
just kind of folded up in sections a
little at a time till he was sprawled out
flat all but his head that still leaned
against the door i wondered if id
broken his neck got down on my knees
beside him his neck was all right he
was just out

  frans door opened and she popped
in gave a little screech oh jerry is
he dead

  no i said better get your coat
and hat fran weve gotta go places
before your dear husband hears where
we are i was going through slats
pockets now after my gun believe it
or not the guy had a big hole in the
pocket hed dropped my rod in the

damn thing had slid way down into the
lining i let it go grabbed his own gun
clipped it under my arm as fran came
back together we went out and caught
a down elevator the lobby of the mer-
cer was l-shaped the elevator bank
around the turn from the desk fran
and i got to the turn just as the night
clerk glanced in that direction i saw his
mouth flop open saw the movement of
his body as his toe reached for the
alarm button under the desk he didnt
step on it just waited to see if slats
mckenna was behind us

  i grabbed frans arm pulled her
back out of sight my left hand located
the roll of dough pressed it into her
fist the elevator operator was watch-
ing us now i said here kid dont
stop to argue youve got clothes now
and money beat it out the back way
go down the alley and snag a cab on
fifth go to the palais in hollywood
and wait for me

  she shook her head jerry i cant
leave you like this youre in trouble
of some kind besides me i mean i-i
heard part of what slats said i can
clear you

  you might i agreed if you lived
long enough i put on the old act here
its really for my sake fran it
sounds like ed and this guy ames
might swing a lotta weight i dont
want you picked up by either ed or the
cops till i know just where we stand
in other words youll do me more good
at present if nobody knows where you
are a fat house dick waddled around
the ell looking important i gave fran
a shove toward the service entrance
tripped the fat guy as he went by he
started yelling bloody murder so did
the kid in the elevator i took it on the
lam out past the desk the clerk had a
gun he shut his eyes as he pulled the
trigger and naturally you cant expect
punk



to hit much with your eyes closed all
he hit was one of the big plate-glass
windows and this went out with a
booming crash just as  made the side-
walk slats mckennas police job was
at the curb there was not a cab in
sight i scrambled into slats car the
well-known cassidy luck was still with
me slats had taken his keys with him

  the clerk and the operator and the
fat house dick were all stuck in the
revolving door i crawled out the far
side of the car just as another car
swung into the street two men got
out slanted toward me not running
just a couple of jay walkers headed for
the hotel the car came on i swiveled
ran smack into a second car this one
was without lights coming from the
other direction i hadnt even heard it
as i went to my hands and knees from
the impact the brakes locked two guns
started a sort of rhythmic one-two
one-two blasting and from the sound of
falling glass i guessed they were shoot-
ing at the revolving door of the mercer
i had slats rod out when the car
nudged me again not hard just enough
to knock me sprawling without exactly
running over me somebody stepped on
my hand somebody else kicked me in
the head then both somebodies
reached down and hauled me to my
feet

  going some place cassidy well
give you a lift this polite offer was
followed by a swing that practically
jerked my head right off and i was
only vaguely conscious of being shoved
into a car motor sound drummed in
my ears presently that too faded out

            iv

y and by  got the idea that
somebody was shaking me and
opening my eyes i discovered that this
was the first jerry cassidy idea that

had panned out all evening the guy
really was shaking me  was still in
the car in the back seat and the guy
working me over had an assistant i
was sandwiched between them

  up front under the wheel was a
third guy who was paying strict atten-
tion to his driving we must have been
miles away from the mercer hotel i
hoped frances was too the guy shak-
ing me found out that i was awake and
rapped his knuckles against my teeth

  the other one said hey cut that
out you been working for ten minutes
tryin to get him awake and the minute
you do you wanna slap him back to
sleep wheres the percentage 

  my pal i thanked him

  oh yeah  he said and smacked
me himself he was nothing but a
hypocrite that guy he took out a
knife and flipped open a four inch blade
and tested the edge on his thumb i
watched that knife with a great deal
of interest wondering which part of
me he was going to try it on first first
my stomach got goose pimples then my
throat he fooled me he jabbed the
point into my knee wheres the
dame  he wanted to know

  what dame

  jab went the knife again this time
in my ribs he must have measured off
the exact distance because it didnt go
past the ribs he pretended it was a
corkscrew taking it out the other guy
had an arm under my chin thats all
that kept me from yelling

  the guy with the knife wiped the
blade fastidiously on the back of the
front seat all right percy leave him
talk he had a face like a wedge
percy took his arm away and i began
to talk you learn a lot of nice words
in the navy i gave them the whole
works in one breath percy got hold of
one of my flailing arms shoved it up


detective fiction weekly

between my shoulder blades shut up
punk

  i shut up the guy with the knife
licked his lips he reminded me more
and more of a hyena id seen in the
zoo when i was a kid this hyena had
been watching a keeper with a chunk of
meat and it was a toss-up which he
wanted most the keeper or the meat
hatchet-face made up his mind on the
exact spot he was going to carve next
he turned a little more in the seat got
my right ear between a thumb and
finger and sliced off a little piece of the
lobe i let him have my right fist in the
kidney percy snapped my left arm i
passed out

  i have no recollection of being taken
out of the car or going up in the ele-
vator or anything the first i remember
was waking up in a chair in front of a
big desk and on the other side of the
desk was big ed harmon my broken
left arm was swollen tight inside my
coat sleeve and shooting flaming arrows
of pain clear out the top of my head
eds face would loom up big as a house
for a minute then fade out till you
couldnt see anything but the eyes

  percy and hatchet-face were telling
him all about it i gathered that theyd
left a couple of their pals behind to find
frances but that they couldnt wait
themselves because the blasting had
brought down a wagon load of cops
big ed told them off as good as i could
have done it myself not loudly
though his voice sounded dead level
perfectly controlled

  you damned fools you knew there
were cops in the neighborhood we ex-
pected that when we heard about them
finding the punks car in the alley
whyd you have to start blasting

  percy cleared his throat we never
started it it was the punk himself he
had three-four mugs chasin him outa

the lobby and we hadda stop em
didnt we 

  a new voice said but you didnt
have to half kill cassidy

  big ed said ill take care of this
ames

  i turned my head a little and looked
at this ames party not until then had
i associated the name with the man
himself the reason of course was
that probably there werent more than
a half dozen people in the whole town
who called him ames he was a h
hutchins to the papers and the public
at large he owned the title guarantee
building the one where big ed had
his offices he was chairman of the
state central committee on the boards
of most of the banks an honorary po-
lice commissioner and a lot of other
things i was too busy to think of he
had nice curlv white hair and one of
j

those skins you love to touch boy
would i have loved to touch it the
fingers of my right hand started jerk-
ing i wanted to get at him so bad my
left hand didnt do much of anything
except hurt like hell

this hutchins guy was the first to
notice i was awake he said get
rid of these-these men meaning
percy and hatchet-face ed told them
to get the hell out i got the impression
that they didnt really know what it
was all about all theyd been told was
to get me and the gal that was with
me the short wave had given ed the
general locality of where i might have
holed up and hed sent out a couple of
cars to patrol the neighborhood even
the cops didnt know the gal was big
eds wife though

  he got up as soon as the two mugs
were gone came around the desk and
held a glass to my lips i drank the
room stopped going round and round
punk



ed sat on the edge of the desk one
foot on the floor the other swinging
 remember he was wearing spats
where is she jerry

  i gave him a grin in china i
hope

  he reached down quite casually got
hold of my broken arm and twisted it
you could hear the bones grating i
went off my nut for a minute tried to
kick him it was then i discovered that
my ankles were tied to the front legs
of the chair i was in where is she
jerry

  i screamed then i couldnt help it
but screaming or not i stuck to my
story shes in china i yelled in
china china china you hear
hutchins said stop it harmon i
cant stand it as if big ed had hold
of his arm i wanted to laugh at that
but somehow all i could do was sob
and here id been thinking i was a
tough guy

  ed let go my arm held the glass to
my mouth again i slobbered all over
it then  remembered i had tivo arms
and tried to paste him one with the
right he just pushed it down as if i
was a baby did you tell slats mc-
kenna anything

  so he knew about slats being there
too i choked on the last swallow
sure i gasped fran and i told him
the whole works he oughta be along
most any minute now

  mr hutchins said great scott
ed just laughed at him imagine
me working for you all these years
why youre a weak sister ames and
i thought you were a big shot i might
have guessed when you went haywire
and shot delgardo well well have a
show-down after we get this thing
straightened out maybe youll be work-
ing for me

  mr hutchins groaned

  ed said dont worry the punk
didnt tell mckenna anything he
bopped the dick and lammed all weve
got to do is find frances and then we
can wash the whole thing up

  the telephone rang ed swung
around answered it okay he said
bring her right up i almost passed
out something told me the her they
were bringing up was frances des-
perately  got the kinks out of my neck
and really looked around we were in
the living room of the beverly hills
penthouse i hadnt known it before

  the door opened and two guys car-
ried frances in they must have
brought her up in the freight elevator
even the dumbest clerk on earth
wouldnt have passed them like that
her feet and hands were taped very
neatly and there were two strips of
adhesive crossed over her lips x mark-
ing the spot i thought the spot where
ed will kick her teeth in he didnt
do it right away though he just
jerked his big good-looking head
toward a fireside divan and the two
lugs dumped her on it her eyes met
mine with a sort of horrified surprise
i guess i didnt make a very pretty
picture i could feel the smear of dried
blood on my cheek where the guy had
operated on my ear

  the two guys looked kind of like
the ones that had got out of the car
there in front of the mercer i couldnt
be sure because it had been pretty dark
in the street at the time and id had
one or two other things on my mind i
couldnt see that it made much differ-
ence anyway neither frances nor i
were going to do any identifying

  ed said quietly you have any
trouble 

  a little one guy admitted shed
already gotten a cab and was on her
way by the time we found out all the


detective fiction weekly

angles we had to wait for the cab to
come back then it was duck soup the
palais is a nice dump he added

  ill make a note of that ed said
and mr hutchins over by the win-
dows cursed him irritably lets get
this over with harmon

  ed said sure ames sure you
want to take care of it personally
mr hutchins turned green and
looked like he was going to be sick
hell man no how can you be so
callous

  well ed said after all it wasnt
i who killed- he broke off as mr
hutchins lifted a shaking hand then
smiling a little as at some secret joke
he said excuse it please and told
the two mugs to scram they went out
that left only him and mr hutchins
and fran and me

hutchins said accusingly see
here harmon its true i shot
senator delgardo but it was in a mo-
ment of panic im not a cold-blooded
murderer

no then what would you suggest
we do with this pair of tramps-give
em our blessing and turn em loose
couldnt-couldnt you have your
men  

  ed gave him a hard little laugh
listen lame-brain you and i are in
this together it doesnt make any dif-
ference to the police who actually
pulled the trigger on delgardo it was
my gun and its my penthouse nobody
but the four of us here even knows the
senator is dead well just keep it that
way and after a while therell only be
two who know you and i will take
care of it

  the telephone buzzed again this
seemed to be big eds busy night he
picked it up listened a moment and
for the first time i actually saw emo-

tion register on his face he looked
scared then he slammed the phone
down whirled on mr hutchins
okay punk well have to make this
fast a flatfoot named mckenna is on
his way up

  cant-cant you have him stopped
downstairs

  sure ed said sure i can but im
not going to now dont go off your
nut just give me a lift with the punks
chair

  they lifted me chair and all and
carried me over to what looked like a
solid-paneled wall i couldnt see how
ed worked it but the wall opened up
and there was a cute little room behind
it it was already occupied yep thats
right senator delgardo was lying on
a leather couch with a very pretty
afghan pulled up to his chin and a
look of utter peace on his face some-
body had very thoughtfully closed his
eyes for him i wondered if id look
that nice-afterward

  ed had a roll of adhesive he slapped
a strip of it around my right arm
pinning it to the chair i tried to bite
him when he tackled my mouth but it
was no go that got taped too he went
back and got fran and tossed her care-
lessly on the floor beside the senators
couch

  then appraisingly he looked at mr
hutchins youd better stay in here
too baby youre too hysterical for
mckenna youd make him nervous
i want a gun the old man
babbled i want a gun in case any-
thing happens i wont be taken alive
i tell you

  if you dont shut up ed said ill
take you myself he went back into
the big room and got a gun though
he tossed this through the panel like a
bone to a whining pup the panel
closed

 d-
punk



  the little room wasnt soundproof
you could hear ed moving around out
there straightening things it seemed
like an awfully long time before some-
body opened the hall door and said
lieutenant mckenna sir

  ed said hello slats in a careless
voice and there was a faint rustle of
papers i could imagine him sitting at
his desk very preoccupied with his
work whats new with you

  same old sixes and sevens slats
said nothing startling except i want
that heel cassidy you knew he mur-
dered his wife didnt you 

  ed said yes hed heard about it over
the radio too bad about jerry i kept
telling him to lay off the liquor but
you know how some of these guys are
have a slug yourself slats there
was a tinkle of glass

  slats said no no thanks ive got
a bad liver and i have to watch it i
could picture him walking around
nervously while ed drank slats never
could stay still very long presently he
went off at a tangent what time did
senator delgardo go home

  i thought mr hutchins was going
to faint his eyes rolled up in his head
and he leaned weakly against the panel
gasping if it hadnt been for that
damned chair id have tackled him
then even bound i could have made
something happen

  ed taking his time answered the
question about eleven i think
why

  i just wondered did he take his
chair with him theres one missing
i can see the leg marks in the rug and
there dont seem to be another chair in
the room that would fit maybe you
made him a present of it

  there was a hell of a long pause this
time finally big ed said with a trace
of irritation whats on your mind

	d-

mckenna i paid for the chair what
i did with it is none of your business
though i dont mind telling you some-
body burned a hole in the fabric and i
had it taken out

  well slats said i hope there
wasnt somebody tied in it at the time
i mean the hole might have been burned
in the party first huh

it was very quiet for a minute so
quiet i thought slats might have
gone and i got jittery trying to get
out of the chair i overturned it instead
and fell on my face skidding smack
into hutchins well hed heard every-
thing i had and was pretty jittery to
start with he fell down on top of me
and the gun went boom-boom-boom
right in my ear like an echo another
gun blasted out in the living room only
this one did it just once that was like
a signal touching off a whole string of
cannon crackers down in chinatown
maybe it was because i had my ear to
the floor that it sounded so plain the
shooting wasnt going on in the living
room it was farther away than that i
tried to scrooge around to see what mr
hutchins was doing all this time and
then the wall panel opened and slats
came in

  he bent down and took the gun out
of mr hutchins fist mr hutchins
didnt seem to mind a bit he didnt
look quite as peaceful as state senator
delgardo but he was just as dead the
last of those three slugs hed fired had
gone in his mouth maybe hed done it
on purpose

  slats still didnt say anything he
righted my chair went over and untied
frances there was a lot of noise out
in the living room now sounded like
the marines had landed a harness bull
with a sergeants stripes came to the
panel and said all clear lieutenant

big eds awake if you want to talk to
him

  slats nodded gloomily his lantern
jaw needed a shave and his dark eyes
had pouches under them fran got
stiffly to her knees clumped over to
my side oh jerry what have they
been doing to you she fumbled at
the adhesive on my mouth it hurt so
bad coming off i forgot about my
busted arm for a minute slats seemed
to come to some kind of a decision and
helped fran get me out of the chair
when i tried to stand up i fell flat on
my face again a couple of cops came
in at that and picked me up and carried
me out to the divan by the fireplace

  slats looked down at me threaten-
ingly you wanna drink

  i did but all i did was give him a
grin that he mistook for a sneer and
say nuts im off it

  he sneered right back at me oh
yeah he turned away to answer
somebodys question turned back after
a minute and said carelessly by the
way you didnt kill your wife with
that gun we checked

  frances kneeling beside me gave
him an indignant of course he didnt
i could have told you that

  slats said he did a pretty good
job on heinie ziegler though

  i nearly passed out well id been
expecting it and here it was i said
weakly how-how did you know
your gun sappo your gun when
they brought zieglers body in we
checked that too the slugs matched
but they couldnt have i yelled
hell it wasnt the same gun and
besides zieglers been dead for-for
thirty-seven-

  not even that many hours kid
you killed him when he was chasing
you in that car i didnt know about it
when i collared you in the mercer

didnt know the gal was fran but give
a case enough cops and theyre bound
to fit some of the pieces eventually
even dumb cops

  i dont know maybe it was the
news that i wasnt a murderer maybe
it wras just looking at his face and at
fran maybe it was my broken arm
that made my vision get kind of fuzzy
all of a sudden somehow i got a hand-
kerchief out and blew my nose and it
sounded just like a foghorn at sea
everybody in the room turned to stare
at me resent hilly even big ed har-
mon who was cuffed to his chair and
submitting to an internes cursed in-
structions apparently all that was
wrong with big ed was a creased scalp

  slats said keeping his voice low if
you hadnt been such a punk youd have
smelled the frame jerry its the old
gag pinning a trick kill on a new re-
cruit so he wont squawk when lies
really told to do something only some-
times its a real kill and thats what i
was afraid of thats why i wanted
you to break out of the racket before
it was too late he reached down
touched frans head lightly ive got
him a job kid not much dough in it
but its the right kind

i couldnt see why he was ex-
plaining this to her they seemed
to have something in common that i
didnt know about i said okay okay
im a punk and i dont know which end
is up so maybe youll tell me how you
got wise to so much

  sure he said i was up here
earlier in the evening looking for big
ed to ask him about heinie ziegler
we got a pick-up order from st louis
on heinie an old rap well ed was
still at the office but i saw senator del-
gardo who was waiting thats how i
knew hed been here
punk



  then we found your wife and try-
ing to find you we found where some-
body had busted out of your hall closet
i figured that might have been cora at
first later on the boys bring in a
wrecked car and a dead guy named
ziegler who i knew used to work for
big ed you were also working for
big ed and when i finally woke up
after you bopped me there in the hotel
-well i got curious about this sister
of yours and got a pretty fair de-
scription of frances eds wife it all
seemed to tie into ed see

  kind of i admitted the interne
was working on my busted arm now
and i wasnt feeling so hot

  well slats went on ballistics
reported that your slug hadnt killed
your wife but that it had done for
heinie ziegler i couldnt of course
know that it was heinie you thought
youd killed before i just figured it
was a similar frame on account of you
hadnt gone to see kramer at cbs
like you promised again it sounded
like big eds work

  then there was the battle in front
of the mercer the clerk and the house
dick said youd been snatched i won-
dered what had happened to fran-if
it was fran it stood to reason that
both of you knew something big
something big ed didnt want to
spread and that reminded me of sena-
tor delgardo who id seen here any-
way it was a fair guess that somebody
would make a try for the gal so i
just waited around till a couple of guys

started asking questions of a cabby
then i followed the two guys out to
the palais and there you are

  like hell i am i snorted who
did kill cora and whyd you let those
mugs grab fran

  weve got the boys that killed
cora he said quietly she came to
big ed with the news that she had you
locked up in that closet she wanted
money he paid her off by sending her
back with heinie zieglers crew and
they just dumped her on the way
about fran i didnt have a damn
thing but guesses so far i figured the
two mugs would take fran to where
you were and if i couldnt do any bet-
ter id hand big ed a kidnap rap

  i grunted well i said i guess
i helped some i sort of helped wreck
mr hutchins anyway

  if he didnt commit suicide slats
sneered the only thing i can think
of youre good for is for really tough
guys to practice on just a punk at
heart

  fran said indignantly he is no
such thing

  slats grinned then shook his head
well youre entitled to your opinion
when youre finally free of big ed
maybe you can explain the answers to
the punk youll probably have to

  i saw a hot flush creep up around
frans eyes and it made me sore i
said hey you big lug whadda you
mean by that crack 

  you wouldnt know he said
youd never guess-punk
the miracle man

by eric howard

author of across the border tic

mangasarius knew the
answers to all prob-
lems-except his own
murder

matinee idol
himself no

if it meant anything
at all it was over
my head but a
thousand people mostly
women were eating it
up nodding their heads
murmuring to them-
selves how true this
fellow up on the plat-
form in the auditorium
was as handsome as a
mangasarius he called
first name no initials just mangasari-
us like caesar or napoleon man-
gasarious the great

  in his forties perhaps with a little
gray at the temples and a full head of
curling dark hair big strong with a
suggestion of great vitality about him
graceful gestures and a voice that was
a velvet flow in the great hall what he
said didnt have to make sense

  he had a good racket if it was a
racket free lectures like this several
mornings a week just enough to lure

              them into special courses
of lectures for small
groups at a hundred
bucks a course and pri-
vate lessons at still
higher fees besides that
he collected anything
they wanted to give-
money stocks and bonds
property jewels

  thats why i was here mrs rufus
g hyde was about to give mangasari-
us something and rufus objected he
didnt know what to do about it so
he hired me to watch her and man-
gasarius if she handed him a necklace
a bunch of securities or a wad of
dough i was to try to get the goods
on him evidence that would show he
had unduly influenced her

  a tough job but rufus was paying
the bills rufus had plenty of the root
of all evil he could afford to let his
wife shell out to a grifter if mangy
-as i got to calling him-was a


the miracle man



grifter but rufus hated to see the jack
he had taken away from people dropped
into mangys hand rufus hated to be
out-smarted

  mangy spread his hands in a wide
gesture let us not pray dear
friends he said in that dulcet voice
rather let us pause for a meditative
moment let us look inward let us
tap that reservoir of power that well
of spirit that dwells within our
hearts

  there was a moments silence then
he gestured finally and walked briskly
off the platform immediately a beauti-
ful girl in a white dress came out she
was mangys niece and co-worker so
he said she went into a crisp busi-
nesslike number mangys book was on
sale in the lobby theyd better buy it or
theyd never know happiness it was
only four dollars and for those who
wanted to take mangys special course
of lectures the line formed on the left
for private lessons in the miracle way
which was what mangy modestly called
his method theyd have to see her do-
lores the niece and pony up she an-
nounced other lectures she was a
bright clever baggage but she didnt
have mangys velvet flow but she sold
them

  i was watching mrs rufus g hyde
she was a little woman and she must
have been very pretty once now you
could see that she was desperately try-
ing to hang on to her youth she had
been through the mill-diet facials
hair dyes massage and all the rest she
looked worked over she had a kind
of silly look on her face and there
was probably only one idea in her head
-to try to stay young and beautiful
she was getting on to fifty and it was
hard to take because she had the idea
that she should always be a beautiful
twenty-year-old she had nerves she

fidgeted but mangy was her hope
he could give her everlasting youth
as no one else could he had even im-
plied that his dope would conquer
death

  i chewed my gum and looked at her
also at the girl beside her her social
secretary a sweet blonde package
named irene the blonde wasnt fall-
ing for mangys line she didnt need
it-yet she had youth and beauty and
allure when mangys dark beautiful
niece dolores went into the sales song
and dance irene smiled cynically she
knew the ropes

the meeting was breaking up
people moving around all the
dames had a glow in their eyes mangy
had given them something whatever
it was faith hope but no charity

  my job was to follow mrs rufus i
did but my eyes were on irene she
could have had my vote in any beauty
contest-bathing beauty especially
the girl had everything

  mrs rufus was heading for the
hall back-stage that led to mangys
office here in the auditorium thats
where he gave his small group lectures
private lessons were dished out at his
home a big old place on a knoll over-
looking a lake on the edge of town do-
lores the niece lived there too and
a few servants

  dolores met mrs rufus and greeted
her warmly cordially they were go-
ing to collect for irene she had only
an icy nod a cool how do you do
no soap from irene and she probably
knew the secretary was trying to keep
the old dame from tossing baubles into
mangys kitty

  darling mrs rufus gushed to
dolores tell the dear master that i
have arranged it i-

  dont you wish to see him now


detective fiction weekly

dear mrs hyde asked dolores
sweetly he expects you

  oh dear may i mrs rufus
fluttered

   dolores led her to the door that
opened into the suite of offices i saw
another girl at a typewriter as the door
opened she got up at a word from
dolores and led mrs rufus on to the
dear masters private office well i
wasnt going to see what she gave
him or hear what she had arranged

  i moved up next to irene

  great stuff isnt it i said

  she froze me but said what
the miracle way i said the
master mangasarious

  excuse me she said and hurried
through the mob to a tall quick-mov-
ing young fellow in gray tweeds who
was going towards the masters office
she joined him and they went on to-
gether just before they entered the of-
fic she looked back over her shoulder i
had been staring at her but i wasnt
then i was telling the fussy old woman
next to me that it was great stuff she
was agreeing

  they went into the office the typist
wasnt at her desk then the door
closed

  i missed dolores in the crowd for
a few minutes then i heard her talk-
ing to a woman near me she had been
somewhere and had come back she
was telling the woman who wore ex-
pensive clothes and some real jewelry
that mangy would see her soon

  then dolores moved off toward the
office but she didnt go in she went to
another door and entered that her own
private office i guessed

  irene mrs rufus and the young
fellow in tweeds came out of the door
maybe ten minutes later there was a
loud scream and the girl i had seen
at the typewriter ran after them point-

ing her finger crying they killed
him

t crashed through the mob and
got to the door dolores ran out of
her room and started asking excited
questions she called to somebody to
clear the hall mrs rufus looked dazed
and happy irene looked mad the
young fellow holding both women by
the arm looked silly and surprised

  the typist was still yelling they
killed him and the women of the
audience didnt want to be shoved out
if it was their dear master the girl
was yelling about they wanted to lynch
the three who had just left him sev-
eral of them-amazons too-made a
rush for irene and the other two 
spread my arms and shoved all three
back to the door

  back up i said youre not going
anywhere

  irene snapped something angrily at
me the young fellow began i say
sir you cant    mrs rufus was still
dizzy

  i saw that some of the ushers were
herding the gang out so i shoved these
three back into the office

  police yelled the typist

  the marines are here i told her
and grabbed her shoulder i tossed her
into the office too

  then i joined them and shut the
door snapping the lock

  sit down i said

  what authority have you to do
this irene asked

  i winked at her and reached for the
telephone dolores was coming out of
mangys private office and she left the
door open

  dead she murmured like a girl
in a trance dead stabbed my
uncle   

  i could see mangy he was at his
the miracle man



big shiny desk he had been using
the phone at least he had his hand
on it and the phone was off the
cradle now he wassprawled forward
over the desk and i saw the bright
handle of a knife over his left shoulder

  i picked up the phone and called
headquarters

  joe burke talking i told the desk
sergeant give me kelly-homicide

  another murder wherever you
go joe-

  give me kelly

  kelly came on the wire and said he
would be right there with his staff i
hung up and grinned at the suspects

  well wait for the cops i said
pleasantly

  you fool irene snapped at me
we didnt kill him-we couldnt have
killed him

  tell it to kelly i said dont
leave here i want to take a look at
him

  i went to the other door and looked
in the knife must have gone right
into his heart i gave his office the once-
over standing in the door so i could
watch the others the typist was sob-
bing maybe she liked mangy or may-
be she wondered where shed get an-
other job the look of goofy happiness
on the face of mrs rufus had
changed now she looked stricken gray
pathetic irene was downright mad
the young fellow still looked silly

  there was a coat closet at one side
the door partly open the office was on
the ground floor with large windows
on a court they were closed the
whole place was furnished like a movie
set-a six-inch carpet chairs uphol-
stered in velvet heavy drapes at the
windows swell pictures

  opposite the coat closet was another
door closed i took a chance and
crossed to it the door was unlocked

it led into a simply furnished office
with a desk a typewriter a dictaphone
and a filing cabinet this was where
dolores worked-the room she had en-
tered from outside

  they were all sitting there when i
went back but the young fellow had
been leaning over to whisper to irene
then kelly started hammering on the
the door and i let him -in

  some day he growled youll be
the corpse at one of these killings
wtios dead and why

his gang got to work in mangys
office kelly started questioning
the others according to the typist the
three-mrs rufus irene and the
young fellow-had come out of his
office she had heard the young fellow
say thats that she had gone to
mangys door to give him some let-
ters to sign and had seen him with
the knife in his back she had run
out after the others accusing them

  the young fellow was the nephew
of mrs rufus-ronald darrow he
and irene admitted they had followed
mrs rufus into mangys office hoping
to dissuade her from giving him a
necklace worth ten grand hoping to
scare mangy into refusing it mrs
rufus would not be dissuaded and
mangy wouldnt be scared he had
been smooth and hypocritical he had
said he could not reject the free-will
offerings of his devoted followers who
wished to help him with his great work

  did you threaten him kelly
asked

  i told him he could be stopped
ronald admitted

  and i said wed stop him irene
added she was still angry

mrs rufus couldnt talk much she
was dazed but kelly got out of her
that she had left the office a moment or


detective fiction weekly

two before the others who were still
talking to mangy the door was open
but her back was turned

  then either one of you kelly ob-
served looking at irene and ronald
could have stabbed him without her
seeing you which one did

  ronald put his hand over irenes
she smiled bitterly

  you fool she said to kelly

  kelly grinned at her said weve
got a jail matron who likes to work
over dames like you

  he had told one of his men to find
the necklace there wasnt any mrs
rufus had given it to mangy he had
dropped it into a desk drawer but it
wasnt there now or anywhere else

  i went out to a phone booth and
called rufus he exploded when i told
him what had happened and said hed
come right down i met him outside
when his big car slid up to the curb
rufus was a handsome gray-haired
pink-faced old boy gruff and surly on
the surface but with a hearty laugh
he put away plenty of good food and
liquor and he had an eye for a pretty
girl he grabbed my arm and started
cussing he cussed like a longshore-
man then we went in

  he put his arm protectingly around
his wife nodded to irene and ronald
glared at kelly

  he suggested to kelly that they all
be allowed to leave

  yeah said kelly where were
you when this guy was stabbed if
you knew your wife was goin to toss
him the necklace-if there was any
necklace-youd be just the one to
bump him

rufus got apoplectic i put my hand
on his arm and whispered take it
easy boss dont let him ride you
the reporters were in by this time
and the camera boys with all of

mangys followers in town it was a
swell story in spite of rufus objec-
tions they shot pictures all over the
place

  dolores sitting by herself in a cor-
ner was a perfect picture of a grief-
stricken niece i ambled over to her

  sister i said where were you
when this happened

  she looked at me wiping her eyes
i she asked out there in the hall
talking to-

  you ducked into your office i told
her a minute or two before this other
girl started yelling murder you
could have got through that door be-
tween the offices and up behind him-
he wouldnt expect you to knife him-
and out again neat timing but you
could have done it

  she stared at me you think that
i   

  i shrugged you had a chance too
i said as much chance to do it as they
had

  she started sobbing my poor dear
uncle she said he was so good he
did so much for others now-

  kelly cut in with an announcement
im holding you darrow he said
on suspicion mr hyde you can take
your wife and this girl home but i
warn you-

  ronald darrow was as tense as a
race-horse he stepped up to kelly
said you damned fool and swung
at him kelly blocked the punch and
socked the idiot two bulls grabbed
him then rufus protested but it didnt
do any good there was nothing he
could do irene put her arms around
ronald kissed him whispered some-
thing to him then rufus shook his
hand and said hed send his lawyer
around get him out quick i went out
to the car with rufus

  if you were any good on your job
the miracle man



burke he snapped at me youd have
prevented this

  yeah i said and if you hadnt
let the missus give mangy trinkets it
wouldnt have happened you firing
me  or do you want me to stay on the
job and find out who did kill him

  he was mad enough to bite mrs
rufus and irene were in the car

  ronald didnt do it he said nor
irene so its no concern of mine
okay then i quit huh no con-
cern of mine either but if you think
kelly cant build a case against ronald
youre wrong somebody has to be
tried and convicted looks like ronald
is the guy-unless kelly switches to
irene shed be an accessory in any case
or he would but theyre your friends
not mine i shrugged and started
away

  wait burke he protested stay
on the job

  murder cases come higher boss
from now on the ante is raised fifty
a day and expenses

  he growled but agreed

t went back to kelly he was ques-
tioning dolores pretty gently for
him i grinned to myself i was the
only one who knew she had had a
chance at mangy thered probably be
a lot of women willing to testify shed
been talking to them from the time the
meeting ended until the typist yelled
that he was dead

  the necklace was missing kellys
men searched the place but couldnt
find it the knife belonged to mangy-
an oriental thing he had picked up in
india dolores said where he had
studied with the masters whoever they
are

  kelly had traced the call mangy had
been making he had been talking to a
rich divorcee mrs lindsey barrett

when the knife had silenced him she
was one of his followers she had been
trying ever since he was silenced to
get him again one of kellys dicks told
her he was dead and she must have
fainted a cop went up to her pent-
house to see how she was taking it and
found her maid had called two doctors
and a nurse

  kellys mob was moving out taking
ronald with them kelly stopped and
said to me joe if you know anything
come clean ill get your license this
time if you hold out on us

  its open and shut aint it i said
ronald or irene had to do it didnt
they

  ill know more when we get the
fingerprint checkup he grunted im
just telling you-

  id better come clean yeah i
grinned at him or youll get my li-
cense seems like i heard that before
somewhere

  when they had gone dolores and
the typist agnes smith were left
they had been warned not to leave
town of course and to keep in touch
with kelly he had men tailing them
too

  agnes was a dumb bunny she didnt
count but dolores-there was a deep
one

  what will you do now i asked
her

  i dont know she said i can
only try to carry on his work as he
would have wished me to do but i am
ill-trained i dont know-

  he really had something huh i
asked not just a grifter

  she looked puzzled grifter she
said whats that he was a great
teacher a man who taught people how
to live richly and fully he brought
them an ancient wisdom with which to
cure the maladies of our age


detective fiction weekly

  made money didnt he

  his grateful pupils made him many
gifts of course but he taught the poor
too for nothing

  you think this ronald guy did for
him 

  she spread her hands gracefully i
dont know i dont know what to
think i know only that ronald darrow
wanted his aunt to give him money
and that he and her secretary irene
farr had threatened my uncle before
i heard them they were angry because
they thought he had influenced mrs
hyde against them he hadnt really
it was her own thought-that money
would do ronald no good until he
had learned to live

  until he had accepted mangasarius
as a teacher you mean

  yes she nodded but ronald was
a stubborn materialist irene too
why didnt he get money from
rufus hes a materialist too or i
never met one

  dolores smiled he had tried and
failed you see mr hyde wanted se-
curity always and ronald naturally
had none

  why did he want money

  to buy an interest in a business so
that he could marry irene so mrs
hyde said

  she looked up at me out of her
moist large dark eyes she smiled for-
givingly

and you suggested that i she
said might have-stabbed my uncle
sorry sister i said i just meant
you had a chance he was your uncle
huh

  she gave me that sweet forgiving
smile again how terrible it must be
to be a detective she said do you
distrust everyone everything have
you no faith

  i got red and ran my finger around

my collar a dick cant take anything
for granted i said

went away from there and down
to the office of the messenger
where i prowled through the papers
morgue there wasnt much about
mangy he had advertised his meet-
ings but they hadnt run many news
stories about him in one or two brief
notices dolores was mentioned then
i dropped around to the printing com-
pany that had published his book
mangy had paid for it cash in advance
and they had run off five thousand
copies he had just placed an order
for another five thousand at four
dollars a crack he was doing pretty
well for himself the head of the com-
pany was moaning because he had read
the extras with mangasarius dead the
order would probably be cancelled

  have you no faith i handed him
dolores line leave it to his niece
shell carry on and sell his books
maybe hell autograph em if theres
ink in heaven

  but i didnt gather up any info
about mangy he had hit town a year
ago returning from years of study
in india so he said dolores had joined
him a little later he had gone over
big from the start once the dames
heard him talk they were sold-and
told their neighbors over the back-
fence or the bridge-table the cops had
nothing on him they cant tackle a
great teacher like mangy unless com-
plaints pour in a few husbands like
rufus may have kicked but it was
their fault if their wives tossed pres-
ents to mangy

  getting into the penthouse apart-
ment of mrs lindsey barrett where
i went next was no cinch i finally
got in but i didnt see the lady one
of her doctors talked to me she was
the miracle man



suffering from severe shock she had
tried to commit suicide by jumping
over the parapet that surrounded her
garden the doctor was a dry cool
spectacled fellow he made no bones
about his feeling for mangy mrs
barrett had refused medical care and
had put her trust in mangys miracle
way

 like hundreds of other fool
women the medico said savagely
she was in love with the fellow
how did he feel about her

  mrs barrett is an extremely rich
woman he said excuse me please
and do not come here again mrs
barrett can see no one

  okay doc  said and strolled out
past the butler

  f had skipped lunch  gathered up
all the papers and found a steak and
chop joint i chewed a thick one
washed it down with a bottle of beer
and read the papers kelly had ronald
hanging his prints were on the knife
along with mangys he admitted he
had touched it as it lay on the desk
before him while he had argued with
mangy no other prints both ronald
and irene told the same story they had
accused mangy of hypnotizing mrs
rufus and had threatened him he had
laughed at them fingering the neck-
lace the old lady had given him but
they hadnt killed him he was alive
and triumphant when they walked out
if that was true he had been killed
during the few minutes that elapsed
before the typist gathered up her let-
ters and started in to him

  i thought of dolores again she
might still be the candidate

  then i saw a sob sisters story she
had been to mrs barretts penthouse
too and she had it from the rich
dames secretary that mangy and mrs
barrett had planned a trip to yuma-

and marriage they were talking about
it when he was stabbed

  uh-huh i said and what does
that add up to

  i didnt know but i checked on mrs
barretts ex no he wasnt interested
married again and on a world cruise
who else wouldnt want her to marry
mangasarius some of her family
maybe others who might hope to in-
herit something from her or otherwise
get it perhaps a disappointed suitor
mangy had cut out but how could
any of those get in and stab mangy
at just that time no dice

  i still gave dolores a good deal of
thought she was smooth kelly didnt
suspect her she put on a good act
even if the cops had suspected her
they would have a time proving any-
thing mangys followers would spring
to her defense her act would convince
any jury dressed in white with her
forgiving smile and her dark eyes she
looked too angelic for murder

  i phoned rufus from the steak and
chop dump

  listen i said theyve got a lot
on your wifes niece how much is
it worth to you if i dig up the real
killer and get ronald out

  im already paying you well
burke he said are you earning
your wages no

  all right then ill quit never let
it be said joe burke hung on to a job
when he wasnt earning his pay good-
by mr hyde

  wait he snapped its worth-
anything-to get ronald out mrs
hyde-

  ten grand

  you mean ten thousand dollars
he gasped dont be absurd burke
how much

  well maybe five thousand

ing send it right down to my office

that-that faker he asked

  youll get my report in due time
i said i didnt like that nickel nurser
too well

  try to recover my wifes neck-
lace  he begged

  for another five grand i said
and hung up on his sob

  i felt better then if i got a break
it would mean money in the pocket

when i stepped into my two by
four office my confidential sec-
retary rose obrien gave me a dis-
gusted look

  where have you been big boy
playing marbles i wish youd stick
around and take some of these fool
calls

  i leaned over and kissed her ear
mister burke she said

  tell me babe whos bothering
you

  captain kelly and a dozen others

  just tell em im not in

  i do but they think im lying i
see you were on the spot at another
killing tell me

  i told her to get it all straight for
myself as well as for her rose is
a bright kid her father and uncle were
cops she knows the cop business
when i got through she frowned and
tapped her pencil on the desk

  i wish i could see dolores and
irene she said

  you can we shut up shop youre
a sob sister babe lets go get your
story

  rose can be anything at a moments
notice-sob sister actress chorus girl
tough moll debutante or shopgirl she
does a few things to her hair and
makeup gives her mouth a different

twist switches her accent-and there
she is a new girl

  we grabbed a cab and started for
the mangasarius house

  go up and interview her i said
ill wait

  up she went swinging along the
walk and i thought what a gal she
had everything dolores or irene had
and plenty of brains in her red head

  she was back pretty soon too soon
to have got an interview

  the lady is not seeing the press
she said so i was told by a couple
of servants they pushed me around
but i got in i made a plea to her-
told her id lose my job my sick
mother and three small brothers would
suffer she still wasnt giving inter-
views you said she had a sweet for-
giving smile big boy shes as hard
as nails right now and the mug with
her is a stir-bird or im a chinaman
youre no chinaman i said
who is he

  i dunno but ten to one his pictures
in the rogues gallery she shouldnt
play around with his kind unless-
you better go up big boy but put
on your overshoes wear your red flan-
nels and take care of yourself

  yeah you stay here understand
english right here in this cab
yes sir she said too meekly
the driver hadnt heard all this i
told him to wait rose hopped in i
went up toward the house

  i was saying to myself somebody
who didnt want mangy to wed the
widow is the one and that spells
dolores

they gave me a song and dance
too dolores wasnt seeing any-
body but a maid took my name in
and she was seeing me

  she was alone in a big room when
the miracle man



i walked in roses stirbird wasnt
there

  yes mr burke what did you wish
to see me about

  i walked over to her she was all in
white-an evening gown this time
that looked swell on her

  lady i said ronald didnt kill
mangasarius the cops are wrong
it had to be someone who didnt want
him to marry mrs barrett see now
you had a swell chance to do the job
im betting you cant prove youre his
niece im betting he was shoving you
aside for the rich dame and you
wouldnt stand for that

  she laughed in that gentle forgiv-
ing way and then said you have
a marvelous imagination but your
wild surmises do not concern me

  i had expected to draw the thug out
of hiding dolores yawned and put
her hand up to her lips that was a
signal i guess because something
bored into my back and i looked over
my shoulder into the dark and ugly
face of the guy rose had seen he was
a stir bug all right

  whatll we do he asked hoarsely
dolores shrugged better put him
away jack she said hes the only
one that knows i had a chance to go
into the office it would be just as
well if he-disappeared

  yeah ill take him down cellar and
put him away

  i laughed everybody knows im
here i said i told kelly i was com-
ing so you didnt stab mangy
dolores this mug did eh he was
in the closet when the others were
with the boy friend he stepped out
and knifed him while he was phoning
mrs barrett he nabbed mrs hydes
necklace and you let him out through
your office nice work but-

  the mug kept his gat against my

back socked me behind the ear it
stung

  dolores said how absurd

  not half as absurd as the arrest
of ronald i told her who is this
thug back of me

  the guy growled shes my daugh-
ter he said and if you think id
let mangasarius doublecross her an
marry-

  jack dolores protested

  what the hell kid he growled
he wont be the first dick ive put
away you guess too good feller
yeah mangasarius was in college with
me-quentin he read some books up
there an doped out this racket when
he got out i told him to look up the
kid give her a boost he was goin
to marry her until this rich dame-
daddy jack dont talk

  okay come on cop we go down-
stairs

  there was satisfaction in knowing
i was good at guessing games but i
was heading for the door and the cel-
lar with jacks gat pushing me along

  rufus is only paying me five grand
for clearing ronald i said why
dont we make a deal

  no deals with cops jack mut-
tered

  but dolores checked him if you
took him for a trip jack you know
where until this blows over that might
be the best you have to duck any-
way i have proof they wont ques-
tion that i was his niece his will
stjll stands whether they hang ronald
or let him off well be on top
yeah he said ill take him up
to the mine then

i worked in a mine once i
cracked i dont like em i wont go
that made jack mad i hoped it
would he shifted his gat to his left
hand and swung with his right during


detective fiction weekly

the shift i ducked and socked he
tried to swing with the gun but i had
him winded and half down i butted
him with my head and sent him to the j
floor the gun popped and dolores
yelled for help

  i got him by the wrist as he was
twisting the gun around but he was
strong too strong the gun barrel
moved steadily toward my ribs and in
another minute id have been out

  i was half-dazed but i heard a sweet
voice as you were rose said and
hit jack over the head with the stubby
barrel of an automatic

  he slumped under me like a dead
man i grabbed his gun and got up

  the taxi driver had come in with
rose-he was armed with a monkey
wrench-and dolores and the servants
were lined up against the wall

  i told you to wear your galoshes
rose told me

  and i told you to stay put i
growled

  dolores went all to pieces and cried

hysterically i phoned kelly and told
him to come and get em he was
there within fifteen minutes and he
started cussing me for holding out
on him i laughed at him and we went
away rose and i and the taxi driver
where to he asked

  just keep drivin i said any-
where

  it was tough making rufus pay
up he was one of those guys who
wants to settle ten cents on the dollar
but when i got his check i said to
rose kid you and  ought to be
partners lets start with this
why mister burke she said i
am blushing in confusion

  jack went back to college-folsom
this time-for life he took it on the
chin covered up dolores and she got
off you couldnt expect a male jury
to send her up the last i heard of
her she was in frisco town selling
the miracle way

  and mrs rufus still contributes to
the cause

who lives
by the axe

by james w booth

author of the clue of the cylindrically
shaped paper etc

mrs brownell sat
reading with her
cataract - dimmed
eyes

the amassing of sufficient
funds with which to pur-
chase return passage to his
native oslo eventually became an ob-
session with stumpy hard-vistaged
black-haired ludvig halvorsen lee
caretaker of a stolid brownstone
brooklyn rooming house

  it led him on july   to mur-
der his employer -year-old mrs
sara elizabeth brownell one-time
seamstress who had become a rooming
house proprietor when the gray film
of cataracts dimmed her vision after
slaying the defenseless woman with an
axe he dissected her body with grue-
some precision and hid the pieces

  and then lee murdered a second
woman in much the same fashion as

a true story

he had the first and disposed of her
body in the same way she was mrs
alfred bennett formerly owner of
the brownstone house who had come
to pay mrs brownell a friendly call
lee killed her because he feared her
suspicions would be aroused if she
failed to find his aged employer at
home

  but two women can not vanish sud-
denly and completely without suspi-
cions being aroused and questions
asked their strange disappearance was
reported to the police and detectives
commenced a search for them

  they questioned of course but their




detective fiction weekly

questions and the answers to them
threw no light on the strange case the
bullnecked caretaker replied to their
interrogations in a manner which in-
dicated he would be one of the last
persons in the world to contemplate
murder

  there was no plausible explanation
for the disappearance of the two
women and apparently no clues to what
had befallen them numerous such
cases are annually entered upon the
records of the bureau of missing per-
sons they vanish and that is all that
is ever learned regarding them al-
though the authorities make every hu-
man effort to fathom the mystery of
their disappearance

  but no such unsolved notation was
destined to be listed against the
brownell-bennett case for in battery
park at the tip of manhattan island
several miles from the stolid brown-
stone house where lee had wielded the
murder axe a white wing came upon
a blood-soaked paper bundle in it were
pieces of two human legs

even before the medical examiner
had time to determine whether
they were pieces of a womans legs
instinct told the police that they had
found the gruesome answer to what
had happened to the two missing
women

  but who had murdered them they
still had not the slightest idea

  to find the answer to the riddle of
the horribly hacked pieces of limb they
began another methodical and pain-
staking search for clues in the neigh-
borhood of the brownstone dwelling

  and then on a sunday morning
while the church bells were ringing
they stumbled on a chemical link which

started an amazing chain of evidence
that ended with lee in the electric
chair

  on the floor of a dark foul-smelling
cellar close by the east river detec-
tives were attracted to several pools
of water the water had seeped into
the cellar during a recent rain it had
a dark oily look

  bending over a detective wet a
fingertip and touched it to his lips
lye he announced significantly at
police headquarters analysis of sam-
ples of the water proved the detective
to be correct

  what proved of even more signifi-
cance however was a brown paper bag
with figures penciled on it that totaled
up to  which was picked up in
one corner of the damp cellar on the
chance that this slender clue might
lead them to the murderer the police
commenced making the rounds of near-
by shops in a chain store a clerk rec-
ognized his own figures and recalled
that the customer who had made pur-
chases totalling that amount had
bought ten cans of lye a few days be-
fore more important still he was able
to furnish an accurate description of
the customer

  lee was arrested immediately but
with black eyes protruding weirdly
from beneath his bushy eyebrows he
maintained his innocence even up to
the time he was strapped into the elec-
tric chair at sing sing several months
later

  but the jury before whom he was
tried had no doubt that he had left
the limbs of his victims in battery
park and buried the rest of their
bodies in the foul-smelling cellar cover-
ing them with lye to hasten their de-
composition

ing hatch and delevan

ward i feel something pressing
against my spine danny he said
something that feels like a gun

only what i feel its like a
howitzer

mr sanders is no two-gun man

danny hatch said the thing in
your back is a fountain pen

  cripes delevan said

  as delevan twisted around sanders
jerked the pen away from his back and
removed his forefinger from hatchs
delevan seized sanders necktie and
pulled it while pushing his other hand
into sanders face sanders choked

  your automatic danny hatch re-
minded delevan

  thats right delevan said

  he bared his weapon and shoved it
hard into sanders abdomen gasping
sanders lifted himself on tiptoes with
his white-rimmed eyes and his pallid
face he looked like a ghost in the
gloom

  this here gun delevan warned
it aint anything which a guy he uses
it to write with neither

sanders hatch asked

  sanders loosened his tie and swal-
lowed mister hatch in heavens
name give me a chance to explain
whereve you been hiding
sanders forced out i have a room
at the common wealth

  hatch nodded keep him covered
danny and follow me

  delevan put the gun in his pocket
and pressed it to sanders side while
they left the doorway sanders was
docile hatch signaled a cruising cab
he waved sanders and delevan into
it delevan crowded sanders into the
corner of the seat

  ill be back in a minute danny
hatch said he added to the driver
wait for me

  he hurried into a restaurant and
stepped into a telephone booth a mo-
ment later the dial ceased whirring a
womans voice said the alexander

and returned to the cab he sat on one
of the folding seats facing delevan
and sanders

structed the driver

nphe cab ground off and turned east-
ward rain swished against the
windows hatch closed the glass panel
of the drivers compartment

lice wouldnt you sanders hatch
asked

ders said with an effort it will go
blinking hard with me if they catch

you see i had nothing to do with it
that is with killing seligman and
flack i swear i had nothing what-
ever-

  hatch gestured toward the driver

  sanders sank back eying hatch en-
treatingly wincing under the pressure
of delevans automatic

  the cab stopped at a bright marquee
sanders entered the hotel common-
wealth between hatch and delevan an
elevator lifted them to the fifteenth
floor sanders took a tagged key from
his pocket and opened room 
following him in hatch and delevan
closed the door

gloria are away if youll believe me

  with his gun delevan pushed san-
ders into a chair sanders eyes clung
to hatch as hatch took up the tele-
phone and gave the hotel operator the
number of howard westcotts apart-
ment

  the maids voice answered the
alexander residence

turb him for any reason the maid

shining eyes turned upon san-
ders sanders leaned entreatinglv to-
ward him

hatch sanders said the news-
papers made it clear enough youre
doing your best to learn the truth and
youre being damned fair about it
thats why i decided id jolly well

police catch me

  hatch started  the bloody police
great scott you didnt mean the birds

word as a synonym for bally or con-
founded a hell of a fine detective i
am not to have thought of that
sanders seemed confused when i
was in the club grotto-

  not now sanders hatch said
your story will have to keep danny
stay here with him ill be back as soon
as possible-if i dont bump into any
cops

  this is a guy he wont try anything
funny if he knows whats good for him
chief delevan said where you gon-
na go

  im still trying to head off that
damned woman hatch said

  he hurried from the room and
waited impatiently for the elevator
when he reached the sidewalk he
found it swarming with a home-bound
crowd the rain had not abated hatch
lost precious minutes while the starter
whistled for a taxi

  ducking into the cab hatch gave
the driver the address of the westcott
apartment

  congested traffic delayed him forty
minutes passed before he reached his
destination

when he pressed the button in
the vestibule of the penthouse
the maid peeked out

  mr hatch calling

  the maid looked puzzled and uneasy
madame westcott and miss alex-
coffins for three



antler have not come back she said

  hatch stepped in the living room
was empty some of the tension went
out of his bearing

  youll have to disturb mr west-
cott regardless of what he told you
he said its damned important but
whatever you do dont go near mr
alexander

  the maid glanced around uncertain-
ly be seated please she said

  she disappeared down the hall as
hatch moved across the living room
he noticed that a blue glass vase lay
on the rug near a table he took it up
and replaced it on the table then
glanced about with sharpened interest

  the maid returned mister west-
cott is not here she informed hatch
he has gone out

  hatch frowned at her do you
mean he left without your knowing
it

  yes sir

  i suppose youve no idea how long
hes been gone

  no sir

  youre worried about something
hatch said what is it

  the maid shrugged it is nothing
she said

  dont be evasive you know im a
friend of the family whats wrong
it is nothing the maid said again
a lady was waiting

  a lady was waiting here in this
room who was she

  she say her name is mrs west-
cott

  hatchs lips drew thin had you
ever seen her before

  no sir

  who did she want to see

  mr howard westcott

  what became of her

i dont know the maid said per-
haps she left without seeing mr west-

cott because of the call on the tele-
phone

  what call hatch asked

  the call came on the house phone
the maid explained ambrose the
doorman said a man wish to speak
with the lady who is here

  who was the man hatch asked

  the maid shrugged again i tell
the lady there is a call then i go back
to my room perhaps because of what
the man said the lady left

  hatch said ill wait here until mrs
westcott and miss alexander come
back

  the maid said yes sir and with-
drew

  hatch circled the room in front of
the fish tank he paused he stooped to
peer at a dark object lying on the bed
of gravel on the bottom of the tank

  it was a blue automatic

  hatch bared his arm and reached
into the water the colorful fish scat-
tered in alarm he hooked his fore-
finger through the trigger-guard of
the automatic lifted it out and looked
at it closely

  it was the mauser automatic which
rhoda quinn had taken from the office
of sidney seligman

  with his handkerchief hatch dried
his arm then lowered his sleeve he
laid the gun on the handkerchief care-
fully removed the clip and counted the
cartridges in the magazine-ten he
replaced the clip wrapped the gun in
his handkerchief and put it in his hip
pocket

  continuing his circuit of the room
he returned to his chair the lines
around his eyes grew dark with
thought

  suddenly he jumped up and crossed
into the comer where the glass-topped
grand piano sat

  a red silken rope an inch thick was


detective fiction weekly

tied around one leg of the piano other
ropes like it were in use to bind the
window drapes but the drape of the
window nearest the piano lacked its
cord the red line led tautly from the
leg of the piano across the sill and out
an inch-wide crack of the casement
window

  hatch opened the window and
looked down a few inches below the
sill a dead white face was hovering
in the gloom

  it was the face of rhoda quinn

the lower end of the rope was
knotted around rhoda quinns
neck her upturned face was swollen
rain was falling upon her staring eyes
and her parted lips her hair was
matted with water and blood the top
of her head was broken as if by power-
ful blows she was hanging heavily
against the wet wall of the building

  far below her the puddled pave-
ment reflected the street lights people
were scurrying through the downpour
cars were crawling like beetles

  hatch drew back his mouth grimly
tense his lowered lids darkening his
eyes for a moment he gazed at noth-
ing then with sudden decision he
crossed to the opposite corner and took
up the telephone

  he dialed the number of police
headquarters

  the glass door-bell tinkled hatch
turned his pinched eyes to the entrance
the maid appeared from the hall
when she opened the door terry
alexander and lois westcott came in

  the telephone receiver was twanging
faintly police headquarters police
headquarters

  hatch disconnected

  the maid retired terry alexander
and lois westcott hurriedly took off
their raincoats and hats and hung them

in a closet they came to hatch to-
gether

  cy dont you realize you mustnt
come here any more terry said

  i realize youre a lovely little liar
terry hatch answered

  terry colored why-why do you
say that

  where have you been hatch
asked

  lois westcott answered we went
to mr kerrigans office

  together hatch said then you

  lois westcott turned away and went
down the hall terry gazed boldly at
hatch

the least i could do for them

said
coffins for three



  cy when i told you its not-its

not like that between howard and me
-i was telling you the truth then
id be a damned fool to believe it

  i swear it cy

  terry hatch said i made you a
promise it seems like a year ago but
it was only last night i agreed not to
drag howard into this mess if i could
help it ive kept that promise as long
as possible

  terrys eyes widened what do you
mean 

  howard cant be kept out of this
any longer

  terrys breath caught what do
you mean

  lois westcott hurriedly returned
she took hatchs arm

  howard packed a bag she said
hatchs right hand closed hard go
on he said

  he left me a note

  lois westcott put a slip of paper
into hatchs hand he read the mes-
sage aloud

   ive just had an urgent phone call
from pittsburgh tell rupert its in
connection with the amalgamated deal
ill be back as soon as possible dont
worry darling kiss peter good night
for me i love you howard 

  he returned the note to lois west-
cott

  whats wrong with that terry
asked defiantly why shouldnt how-
ard leave for pittsburgh suddenly on
business

  hatch said mrs westcott please
call your maid

  terrys eyes challenged hatch as
lois westcott pressed a button on the
wall in a moment the maid appeared

  what time was it when mr west-
cott received a long-distance call from
pittsburgh hatch asked her

  the maid hesitated

  answer mr hatchs questions
suzette lois westcott said

  i do not know suzette said

  did he actually receive such a call 
hatch persisted

  i know nothing about this call
suzette said

  hatch stepped toward her ive got
to have all this straight a short while
ago a woman came here saying she was
mrs westcott and asking to see mr
westcott what did you do

  i go to mr westcotts room and i
knocked mr westcott did not answer
i went into the loft and mr westcott
was not there i think perhaps mr
westcott has stepped out for a mo-
ment so i came back to the lady and
say mr westcott is occupied please
wait just a few minutes and she say
she will wait until she sees him
then there was a call on the house
phone from a man who was in the
lobby hatch said you called this
woman to the phone and she spoke to
this man did he come up  did you see
him 

  i do not know if he came up
suzette said

  what next  hatch asked

  then the door ring and it is you

  hatch nodded thats all suzette
the maid left the room terry and
lois were anxiously searching hatchs
face

  cy what does all this mean
terry demanded

  youll find out soon enough

levelly

  why not

  in the first place if you dont know
already itll be to your advantage to
remain ignorant of it hatch said in


detective fiction weekly

the second im not sure what im going
to do about it i want a chance to think
it over

t ie strode to the entrance lois
 westcott gazed distraitly at the
note left by her husband terry fol-
lowed hatch into the vestibule

 thats not fair she said

hatch pressed the elevator button
its the best strategy i can think of
he answered youll soon understand
why

if anything goes wrong now cy
hatch terry said itll be all your
fault

hatch smiled dourly when the
whole world comes crashing down
around your ears he said youll
realize it simply couldnt be helped

the elevator panel opened

 stop talking in riddles terry said
 youve got to tell me-

goodby terry hatch said and
stepped into the car

terrys eyes flashed at him the at-
tendant closed the panel the car
started downward

herbert hatch said a short time
ago you took a woman up to the pent-
house

the elevator operator considered an
answer then said yes sir

a few minutes later a man came
into the foyer and spoke to her on the
house phone did you take him up
too

yes sir herbert said

can you describe him

why he was about average look-
ing sir herbert said except he had
a beard

a beard hatch exclaimed what
was he wearing

why i think he had on a dark suit
and a dark felt hat herbert said

hatchs eyes grew keener stepping

 into the foyer he found the big-bellied
 doorman seated on a bench beside the
 entrance

  ambrose hatch inquired do you
remember the man who spoke to the
alexander penthouse over the house
phone 

  ambrose stood with great dignity
of course sir he said

  can you describe him hatch
asked

  herbert came from the elevator to
listen

  as i remember him he was rather
a heavy-set fellow ambrose said

  no he wasnt herbert said he
was average

  he was heavy-set ambrose said
anyway herbert said he had a
beard

  no no ambrose said he didnt
have a beard he was clean-shaven
he had a beard ambrose her-
bert said

  herbert that man hadnt a hair on
his face ambrose declared i recall
him distinctly

  hatch said in an exasperated tone
describe the clothes he was wearing
ambrose

  after a moment of thought am-
brose said he was wearing a dark
gray suit and a dark gray hat

  thats wrong herbert said he
was wearing-

  a dark gray suit and a dark gray
hat ambrose repeated immovably
and a herringbone topcoat

  he wasnt wearing any topcoat
herbert said no topcoat at all
hatch said dont waste time argu-
ing about it you both cant be right
and probably youre both wrong
what i told you is perfectly right
sir herbert insisted

  he doesnt knowr what hes talking
about sir ambrose said with an air
coffins for three



of hurt dignity i saw the gentleman
twice once when he went up and once
when he came down

  did you notice whether he had bits
of plaster stuck on his face hatch
asked

  no sir he didnt herbert said
no sir he didnt ambrose said
on second thought sir he may
have had herbert said

  yes ambrose said magnanimous-
ly he may have had sir

  did he have a small black mustache
with pointed ends hatch asked
frowning

  he had a large brown mustache
and a beard herbert said brown
light brown kind of curly

  nothing of the sort sir ambrose
said he was clean-shaven

  i suppose you both got a good look
at the woman as well hatch said
and you can describe her as ac-
curately

  why certainly sir herbert said
she was-

  never mind hatch said good
heavens sometime ill ask you two
men to help with an experiment to
demonstrate the worst faults of eye-
witnesses

  huh they both said

lte hurried out to the sidewalk
leaving ambrose and herbert in
a hot altercation rain was still falling
thickly keeping close to the building
hatch strode around the corner half-
way along the block toward madison
avenue he paused and looked up

  the dark shadow of rhoda quinns
corpse was visible high against the side
of the building directly below a bright
open window

  at the corner hatch entered a chem-
ists shop the position of the phone
booth enabled him to gaze through the

store window and still see the suspended
corpse

  he dialed the headquarters number

  police headquarters a mans voice
responded

  connect me with the commission-
ers office hatch said

  his eyes caught a movement at the
penthouse window a woman was look-
ing out hatch could not discern
whether it was terry alexander or
lois westcott who was gazing down
into rhoda quinns dead face

  commissioner hatchs office mal-
lets voice said over the line

  this is cyrus hatch calling

  just a minute

  the womans head disappeared from
the window

  the telephone line hummed

  in a moment the womans head re-
appeared she bent over the sill some-
thing in one of her hands reflected the
light she reached down to the head of
rhoda quinn

  hello a gruff voice growled in
cyrus hatchs ear is that you
cyrus

  hold the wire mark cyrus hatch
said

  damnation cyrus the commis-
sioner said yon listen to me

  cyrus hatch did not listen

  the women bending out of the pent-
house window was making sawing mo-
tions with her right arm

  suddenly the corpse of rhoda quinn
dropped it seemed to roll swiftly down
the side of the building then strik-
ing an ornamental projection it bound-
ed out into the air it became a blurred
motion in the rain it struck the pave-
ment in the center of the street bounced
once and became a dark almost in-
visible mound

  the woman disappeared from the
window


detective fiction weekly

  mark hatch was growling over th
line cyrus hatch did not hear him

  he was watching

  a car turned into the cross-street
from madison avenue it proceeded
slowly through the beating rain the
dim shine of its headlamps approached
the body of rhoda quinn

  cyrus mark hatch was saying
wrathfully damnation cyrus do you
hear me if you dont give yourself
up ill be forced to crack down on you
so almighty hard-

  sorry cyrus hatch broke in his
voice strained i may have some im-
portant information for you later
goodby mark

  hatch disconnected shouldered out
of the phone booth and hurried from
the shop as he rounded the corner he
heard a squeaking of brakes the car
was now in the middle of the block it
came to a quick stop

  its left door swung open and a man
climbed out he stood in the rain star-
ing down the body of rhoda quinn
lay huddled behind the front wheels of
the car the man looked around
stooped straightened quickly and
stared around again

  hatch shifted away from the light
of the chemists windows he removed
the blue automatic from his pocket re-
taining his handkerchief he threw the
gun it skipped over the wet pavement
and splashed to a stop in a puddle near
rhoda quinns body

  another car swung into the side-
street from madison avenue it slowed
as it neared the other its headlamps
were bright the dripping beams clear-
ly revealed the broken corpse of rhoda
quinn

  hatch turned away at sight of a
yellow sedan drifting through the rain
he shouted

  taxi 

        chapter xvi
        sanders talks

ttatch left the cab at the hotel
commonwealth long strides car-
ried him to sanders room in answer
to his knock delevan opened the door

  sanders his face haggard was still
sitting in the corner

  cripes chief what happened
delevan asked the gun still in his hand
you look like a guy he would like to
putta slug on somebody

  hatch snapped a wall-switch the
music of a dance band issued from a
grating above the switch allowing the
hotel radio to continue playing he took
up the telephone

  chief delevan complained i get
sorta tired pointing this here cannon
at that guy how long we gonna keep
him here

  i dont know hatch said grimly
as he gave a number

  his call was answered by suzette
this is mr hatch again let me
talk with miss alexander

 after a moment terry said
hello

  why did you do that hatch de-
manded

  terry was silent

  i saw you hatch said it was the
damnedest coldest-blooded act i ever
witnessed and of course you did it
for dear howards sake

  terry said quietly they-they
wont come here now

  you mean the police if they dont
itll be the luckiest break you ever had
in your life

  terry hung up

  hatch replaced the telephone with a
thump and swung around delevan was
not in the room

  where the hells danny hatch
demanded of sanders
coffins for three



  he just went out sanders said

  what for

  he didnt say

  hatch looked into the hall and found
that delevan was no longer at the eleva-
tor door he turned back with his fists
clenched and sat facing sanders

  listen hatch said leveling a
finger im in no mood to be lied to
dont try it if i catch you lying to
me ill break your damned neck

  sanders swallowed

  you killed sidney seligman last
night and this morning you killed sam
flack hatch declared

  no sanders blurted i swear i
had nothing to do with it

t tatch opened his fists and closed
- - them again be damned careful
you dont give me an excuse to get
rough he warned you were coming
out of the club grotto with rhoda
quinn last night when you met selig-
man seligman said something that
scared the pants off you and then you
disappeared where the hell did you
go

  i-i simply left sanders said

  sanders you be careful hatch
warned him again you had rhoda
quinns gun you hid behind the hedge
and just as seligman was going into
the club you shot him

   i didnt sanders blurted

  this morning you and sam flack
had a hell of an argument in my apart-
ment while my secretary was gone
you killed flack she came back just
as you were sneaking out and you
knocked her unconscious vou rat

   i swear i didnt kill flack i didnt
kill either of them sanders insisted

  im going to break your neck
hatch said

  i swear it

  hatch shrugged and turned away

got anything to drink in this place
theres a bottle of scotch in the
dresser sanders said

  hatch found the bottle it was three-
quarters full he brought a glass from
the bath poured scotch into it handed
it to sanders and kept the bottle
want any water in that he asked
no thanks sanders said the
man who made it knew how much
water to put in it

  like hell he did hatch said sit-
ting on the bed they always put too
damned much he drank from the bot-
tle rolled the liquor around his tongue
swallowed it and sighed go ahead
he said

  sanders took a long drink let me
tell you in my own way let me ex-
plain everything from the very begin-
ning

  dont try to put anything over on
me hatch said i feel like beating
hell out of somebody and it might as
well be you

  sanders strained forward in his
chair i began working in seligmans
office four or five months ago

  you forged your law degree
hatch said

  i say sanders took another
mouthful of scotch very well i ad-
mit that in london  was a clerk in a
barristers office i knew law but i
hadnt a degree i needed a good job
here in america flack thought i was
a bit of all right he thought an en-
glishman would give his office class
the trouble began when seligman put
me to work on the quinn case
doing what

  tracing timothy quinn rhoda
quinn had told seligman a great deal
about her husband and seligman had
taken a great many notes i studied
them and began investigating before
long id found timothy quinn


detective fiction weekly

  through the bloody birds hatch
said

  thats right sanders said tim-
othy quinn had kept a loft of homing
pigeons in chicago i kne that racing
pigeons are registered i looked into
the files of the american racing pigeon
union and the international federa-
tion of homing pigeon fanciers most
of timothy quinns pigeons were still
registered in his name though his wife
had gotten rid of them-shed said she
poisoned them after her husband left
her-but a few had been transferred to
another name to howard westcott
of new york

  as simple as that hatch said
  sanders nodded

  timothy quinn had taken a few of
his best birds with him when hed left
home in order to race the birds here
hed transferred the registration to his
assumed name i felt sure howard
westcott and timothy quinn were the
same man because westcott answered
quinns description

  today rhoda quinn took the hint
you dropped and traced him in exactly
the same way hatch said

  i say sanders blurted then he
went on i turned my information
over to seligman he warned me to
keep it strictly confidential then the
bloody crook began playing westcott
and rhoda quinn against each other
seligman had you forge a letter he
took it to westcott and westcott
thought it was from rhoda quinn
sanders stared and said thats
right

  seligman told rhoda quinn he
hadnt found her husband and kept
getting money from her hatch said
at the same time he blackmailed how-
ard westcott

  thats not the half of it sanders
said

  no hatch said whats the
rest

  seligman found out my law degree
was forged hed checked up on me
but he didnt tell flack about it and
he told me i could stay on at the of-
fice if id follow his orders and keep
my mouth shut he said if i didnt do
as he ordered hed send me to gaol
what has that to do with rhoda
quinn and howard westcott

  seligman made use of what hed
learned about me he had me prepare
a death certificate sanders explained
i forged a set of papers showing that
timothy quinn had died and been
buried in the potters field three years
ago

  what was the idea behind that
hatch asked

  seligman showed a copy of the
papers to rhode quinn he told her
that was the end of her search several
weeks later rhoda quinn married
lloyd daly

the bottle stopped midway to
hatchs mouth what do you
mean to tell me that rhoda quinn and
lloyd daly became man and wife
thats right sanders said

  good heavens hatch said she
didnt let me in on that and neither did
daly doesnt anybody ever tell the
whole truth no the answer is no
and they hadnt been married a
week before seligman called rhoda
quinn into his office sanders con-
tinued he told her thered been a ter-
rible mistake he said hed gone on in-
vestigating and discovered that the
timothy quinn in the potters field
wasnt her husband after all

  how could he get away with that
hatch asked

  he showed her where the fake
death certificate said that the timothy
coffins for three



quinn in the potters field had died
of dementia paralytica thats another
name for general paresis he said hed
checked back over some records in chi-
cago and found that the real timothy
quinn had taken a wassermann test
just before his marriage and of course
the test was negative the lapse of time
between the test and the date on the
death certificate wasnt long enough for
paresis to develop thats the way
seligman convinced rhoda quinn that
the imaginary timothy quinn in the
potters field wasnt her husband at
all

  good heavens hatch exclaimed
seligman pulled off all this skuldug-
gery to clear the way for rhodas mar-
riage to daly is that it

  thats it exactly sanders said
he deliberately jockeyed her into a
bigamous marriage she found herself
in a position where she couldnt prove
shed acted in good faith upon sound
evidence that her husband was dead
because seligman got rid of the forged
death certificate-said hed lost it and
of course rhoda quinn couldnt find
the original because it didnt exist
then seligman proceeded to black-
mail rhoda quinn on the basis of her
bigamy and at the same time he went
on blackmailing timothy quinn for the
same reason

  thats right sanders said

  the guy deserved to be killed
hatch said

  he refilled sanders glass and took a
long pull from the bottle he peered at
sanders

  where do you fit into this picture
i knew what seligman was pulling
off sanders said

so did john pirano hatch said
seligman was too smart to tell pir-
ano much about it pirano knew selig-
man was pulling off some kind of deal

thats all pirano tried to bribe me to
tell him what it was all about

  did you tell him

  no because if i had seligman
would have finished me

  then pirano still doesnt know who
timothy quinn actually is

  no all he knows is that rhoda
quinn is married to lloyd daly
flack didnt know anything at all
about it  hatch inquired

  thats right sanders said

  you thought you ought to have a
share of the swag hatch said but
you didnt get it

  sanders mouth drooped sourly i
jolly well didnt seligman sacked me
he warned me that unless i kept mum
hed report me sanders inched for-
ward in his chair hatch i entered
this country illegally i jumped ship i
married an american girl millie black
and millie and i have a beautiful little
daughter i could be deported-sepa-
rated from my wife and child forever
dont try to sound like east
lynne hatch said couldnt they
join you in england

  i-im a fugitive sanders said
theres a charge hanging over me
scotland yard wants me for forgery
good heavens hatch said so
this is why you were so anxious to talk
to me you thought id sympathize
with you and keep you out of it
thats right hatch sanders said
his eyes full of supplication millie
and gloria are visiting millies mother
in sedalia kansas millies sick its
pernicious anemia she took gloria to
her mothers home because ive been
stony since seligman sacked me im
down to my last quid

  this is lovely hatch said in a bit-
ter tone

  if-if you could find out the truth
hatch-about who killed seligman and


detective fiction weekly

flack-perhaps no one else need ever
know about my past if the police ar-
rest me as a suspect theyll investigate
me-theyll discover the whole bloody
mess but if the case is cleared up first
perhaps the authorities wont tumble to
me at all i swear if i ever get out of
this ill go straight as a die hatch

  hatch stared at him whether you
deserve to get out of it is damned ques-
tionable

knuckles rapped carrying the
bottle hatch opened the door
delevan sidled in grinning with satis-
faction

  where the hellve you been
danny hatch asked

  watch this chief delevan said

  he went to sanders removed a pair
of handcuffs from his pocket snapped
one circle around sanders right wrist
and the other around the arm of the
chair

  those there bracelets theyll hold
him chief delevan said confidently
they sure will

  sanders stared at the manacles
transferred his glass to his left hand
and emptied it at a gulp

  where the hell did you get those
things danny hatch demanded

  over in a pawnshop on third ave-
nue chief delevan said they cost
me two bucks now we can keep this
here guy as long as we want him

  very good very good hatch said
gravelv did the two bucks include a
key

  delevan tapped his vest pocket got
it right here you been grilling hell
outa this here guy chief he inquired

  sanders has put me in a worse spot
than ever hatch said apparently
im the custodian of half a dozen dif-
ferent destinies if i dont do the right
thing by everybody concerned ill leave

a terrible trail of broken lives strewn
behind me

  delevan wistfully eyed the bottle of
scotch hatch swigged from it

  you havent finished talking sand-
ers hatch said how did you hap-
pen to be at the club grotto last night
i needed money badly hatch
sanders said twisting his wrist in the
steel cuff i knew seligman often
went there i wanted to ask him to give
me another chance in the office

  then you didnt expect to find
rhoda quinn hatch said

  i hadnt the foggiest shed be
there sanders said when i recog-
nized her i decided my best chance to
get hold of some money was to sell my
information to her i suggested to her
wed better go to another place for
fear seligman might happen in and see
me with her

  but you ran into seligman on the
way out hatch said he knew im-
mediately what you were up to he
warned you he was going to make his
threat good he told you you were on
your way out and that meant out of
the country

  he was going to report me hatch
it got my wtind up i wanted to chuck
the whole business for millies sake
and glorias thats why i went away
seligmans death saved you from
being deported and thrown into prison
but it hasnt done that sanders
protested dont you see it hasnt
theres even more danger now

  you didnt have time to think of
that before you shot seligman

  the radio had been playing steadily
but now it was silent after a moment
an announcer spoke

  we bring you a special dispatch
from the press radio bureau the dead
body of rhoda quinn for whom the
police have been searching in connec-
coffins for three



tion with the seligman homicide was
found a short while ago on eighty-
second street between fifth and
madison avenues the body was dis-
covered by a passing motorist charles
wakefield of flushing who imme-
diately notified the police the cause of
mrs quinns death is thought to be
strangulation

  the police theory is that mrs
quinn was choked to death in some
other part of the city then her body was
dumped from an automobile evidently
she was thrown out with considerable
force to judge from the condition of
her body or she was struck by another
car which did not stop no witnesses
have been found police have begun a
search of all garages in the metropoli-
tan area in the hope of discovering the
car in which mrs quinns corpse was
transported

  some people have incredible luck

into custody by the police the radio

gar this evening he had just arrived

that he left his office this afternoon a
few minutes after flack had left for
the home of professor cyrus hatch
he said he was in a state of nervous
exhaustion and in order to recuperate
without being molested he rented a
room at the montblanc hotel he said
he took a sedative and slept soundly

ing from the newspapers that flack

t t atch removed his coat and vest

        alla time you look more and
more like a guy he would like to mur-
der somebody hisself chief delevan
observed you aint ate anything since

self some dinner

bronze letters off his skull with a
hammer and a chisel hatch rolled
over while the banging persisted he
lifted his head and opened his eyes
good heavens he moaned and in-
stantly closed them again the noise
was still reverberating through his
brain when he ventured to lift one lid
slightly

  he saw the bottle of scotch stand-
ing on the dresser delevan was not in
sight sanders was coming from the
bathroom a glass of water in his free
hand dragging the chair to which he
was cuffed

  what the hell kind of a chair do
you think that is hatch demanded
thats no way to treat it

  its worse than a bloody ball and
chain sanders complained

  sanders maneuvered the chair into
the corner where he dropped into it
breathlessly the loud knocking con-
tinued

  where the hells danny hatch
asked

  hes gone again sanders said
whats more the bloody bounder
robbed me of fifty dollars

  hatch achieved a sitting position
robbed you of how much

  fifty dollars sanders said the
blinking thief took it right out of my
pocket

  dont call danny a thief hatch
said danny might take your money
but hes no thief you told me you were
down to your last quid i dont remem-
ber just how much a quid is except

	d-
coffins for three



that im damned sure it isnt fifty dol-
lars

  fifty dollars was all i had and the
bloody crook stole it sanders said
the knocking grew louder

  hatch howled at the door quit that
racket and wait a minute he moaned
and held his head i shouldnt have
done that why did danny take your
fifty dollars sanders he asked in a
whisper

  im damned if i know sanders
said first he found some sort of
paper in your coat and he sat staring
at it

  hatch dragged his coat onto the bed
and fished in the pockets he took
that photostat

  he sat there grinning like a half-
witted baboon then he went through
my pockets and took the fifty dollars
and left sanders said

  did he say where he was going and
when hed be back

  he didnt even say thank you
knuckles were still pounding the
door hatch struggled up and opened
it kerrigan came in with a bundle of
newspapers under one arm he stared
at hatch and sanders

  mr kerrigan mr sanders
hatch said if it matters

  he went into the bathroom when
he came out kerrigan was opening the
bottle of scotch

  thats fine hatch said send
down for some cracked ice and some
seltzer and four or five stacks of sand-
wiches and a gallon of black coffee and
a bottle of aspirin will you kerrigan 
dont forget the aspirin

  hatch put on his shoes and his tie
while kerrigan telephoned then he
drank a mouthful of scotch

  after a hopeful moment he an-
nounced i still feel lousy i wonder
where danny went

	d-

  he unfolded the newspapers and
tried to read kerrigan gazed from
him to sanders and back hope-
lessly until the bellboy knocked at the
door kerrigan took the tray and paid
the bill while he made highballs
hatch munched a sandwich and drank
black coffee

pass some to sanders hatch said
sanders took a cup of coffee in his
left hand and a sandwich in his right
he had to double over in order to get
his teeth into the sandwich

  what time is it hatch asked
the nights young yet kerrigan
said but personally im aging rap-
idly

  i feel older than the hills hatch
said

t te placed two aspirin tablets on
- his tongue and washed them
down with a highball

  what the hell do you want to talk
to me about hatch kerrigan asked

  kerrigan hatch said the trouble
with these murders is that nobody com-
mitted them

  if nobody committed these mur-
ders then seligman and flack and
rhoda quinn are making damned fools
of themselves kerrigan said

  nobody did it hatch insisted
nobody could have done it its the
only logical explanation

  listen hatch kerrigan protest-
ed im near enough to going screwy
as it is

  hatch drained his cup and refilled it
with black coffee i will concede a
point he said ill grant you that
these murders were committed ill go
even further and say that-assuming
that somebody committed them-all
three murders were committed by the
same person

  they werent all necessarily com-


detective fiction weekly

mitted by the same person kerrigan
said

  how many murderers do you want
anyway hatch asked one is
enough for me

  there might be one murderer or
two or three kerrigan said or
more what do you care

  why shouldnt i care hatch
asked do you mind if i care
kerrigan shrugged

  you and i both wanted to clear
rhoda quinn theres no point in try-
ing to clear her now

  we dont even need to try any
more hatch said she cleared her-
self by getting murdered

  then you can drop out of the case
and forget the whole thing kerrigan
said

  its not that damned simple hatch
said the only way i can extricate
myself from this case is to collar a
murderer

  the hell with that kerrigan said
im not interested in catching any
murderer  dont care a damn who the
murderer is you know why im in
this case my job is to keep certain
parties out of it

  i havent forgotten hatch said
everybody i know is trying to keep
out of it the whole cockeyed world
is trying to keep out of it except me
ive outdone myself trying to stay in
it im in it all right kerrigan i got
the commissioner into a jam and now
ive got to get him out of it ive got
to vindicate myself

  go ahead and vindicate yourself to
your hearts content kerrigan said
but im damned if ill let you do any-
thing that might incriminate my clients
ill see you in hell first

  hatch nodded then shook his head
 havent one little inkling of who the
murderer may be

  what about your handcuffed friend
here kerrigan asked

  sanders winced

  maybe he killed seligman and
maybe he killed flack hatch said
but im sure he didnt kill rhoda
quinn

  sanders gripped the arms of his
chair

  kerrigan asked why not

  i saw rhoda alive late this after-
noon hatch explained sanders has
been with me or with danny every
minute of the time since then if all
three murders were committed by the
same person that lets sanders out

  all three murders were not neces-
sarily committed by the same person
kerrigan reminded him

  i think they were

 why

  because of that gun of rhoda
quinns somebody confiscated it not
for the purpose of framing rhoda
though if anybody had wanted to get
rid of her it would have been a hell
of a lot simpler to kill her anyway
nobodv had a reason for eettiner her

            o	o

into trouble just the opposite it was
to the advantage of everybody con-
cerned to keep her quiet

  all right kerrigan said impa-
tiently

  whoever took rhodas gun did it
for one of two reasons first he didnt
dare use a weapon of his own for fear
it would be traced back to him or
second he simply didnt have one of
his own to use

  all right

  so following the seligman mur-
der the murderer was without a usable
weapon he probably didnt expect to
do any more murdering right away but
he had to anyway twice he found
himself in an emergency without a
weapon and he had to use his hands
coffins for three



flack was strangled so was rhoda
quinn so i say all three murders are
the work of one murderer

  all right kerrigan said and i
still dont give a damn

t t atch took up another sandwich
- i wish i knew where danny
went he said

  all we need to make our joy com-
plete is for danny to turn up dead
kerrigan observed

  dont say that hatch exclaimed
listen kerrigan follow through on
this with me for a moment he
chewed soberly weve eliminated
sanders now take john pirano

  i dont want pirano i wouldnt
take him as a gift i dont care whether
hes guilty or not kerrigan said

  im leading up to something you
will care a lot about hatch retorted

  if i have a kick in the teeth com-
ing kerrigan said hurry up and get
to it

  just keep listening hatch said
pirano might have killed seligman
he had a motive-to take over selig-
mans blackmailing racket he also had
a motive for killing flack flack was
dumb but he was honest and being
honest he wouldnt stand for any
crooked dealing so desperate to save
himself from exposure pirano had to
put flack away also pirano might
have had to silence rhoda quinn for
the same reason

  theres your case kerrigan said
but pirano said he was asleep un-
der the influence of an opiate at the
time rhoda quinn was killed its a
lousy alibi-so lousy it sounds true in
case you ever need an alibi for a mur-
der my friend the best alibi is none
at all maybe pirano can prove it if he
can hes out

  all right hes out kerrigan said

  next take lloyd daly hatch said
eating thoughtfully daly was at the
scene when seligman got it nobody
knows where he was when flack
turned up his toes but he wasnt any-
where around when rhoda quinn was
bumped off tonight

  how do you know he wasnt
kerrigan asked

  i saw daly get into a taxi over on
the west side i heard him give the
driver the address of the trafalgar
hotel as soon as he arrived at the
trafalgar hotel he was arrested

  whos left kerrigan asked

  leaving the ladies out of it
hatch said howard westcott

  kerrigan started with dismay and
peered at sanders

  sanders knew all about it anyway
hatch said

  oh damn kerrigan said

  howard westcott was outside the
club grotto last night when seligman
was killed hatch said he might
easily have been at my apartment this
morning when flack was murdered
at about the time rhoda was mur-
dered this evening he disappeared

  i know all about that kerrigan
said

  do you know zvhere rhoda quinn
was killed hatch asked

  kerrigan poured himself a new
drink and nodded thats why im
damned near going screwy he said

  there was a man who talked with
rhoda over the house phone from the
lobby hatch said he may or may
not be the guilty party he went up
to the penthouse and rhoda let him
in and then he left but that still doesnt
mean he killed her whoever he was
kerrigan do you know whether west-
cott left before or after rhoda showed
up

  kerrigan drank and said no


detective fiction weekly

  the note westcott left was a
phoney hatch said it covered up
his real reason for leaving town now
why did he scram in such a hell of a
hurry and where did he scram to
kerrigan drank again i wish i
knewr he said

  maybe we can find out hatch
said westcott is the man who chipped
the letters off the door of the seligman
tomb last night we know what his
message means all except the symbol
pac

  kerrigan sat forward do you
think thats where hes gone-to
pac

  he appointed a rendezvous hatch
said its only logical to suppose hed
try to keep it pac must mean a city
a city and something else

  kerrigan said it might mean the
pittsburgh amalgamated company
hatch picked up the telephone
operator he said look in your
telephone directory for pittsburgh
pennsylvania and see if you can find
a pittsburgh amalgamated company
or corporation or any other amalga-
mated thing beginning with a c

  hold the line the girl said

hatch munched on another sand-
wich kerrigan drank sanders
sat still

  i cant find anything like that the
operator said

  thanks hatch said and hung up
no go kerrigan but its the right
idea a certain city a certain place-
a certain hotel

  suddenly he dropped his sandwich
opened the drawer of the desk and
rummaged through sheaves of sta-
tionery and telegram blanks he
turned back with a paper-covered
book

  eureka he said

  whats that kerrigan asked
travel america guide and hotel
directory winter edition 
hatch said try to think of all the
cities you ever heard of beginning with
a p

  pittsburgh first kerrigan said
hatch leafed through the book no
hotel in pittsburgh has a name be-
ginning with the initials ac he an-
nounced

  philadelphia

  hatch turned the pages in phila-
delphia theres the adelphia but theres
no c in it

  peoria kerrigan suggested
hatch searched the columns noth-
ing there

  paterson

  hatchs finger pointed over the list-
ings the alexander hamilton he
said that wouldnt be it

  palm beach

  again hatch flicked the pages the
ambassador but still no c
pensacola

  hatch retorted nothing doing
his eyes lighted with a thought it
might be the a-something chambers
do you know any chambers begin-
ning with an a 

  ante-chambers kerrigan said
kerrigan hatch said severely
this is serious

  try paltimore kerrigan said
hatch scowled at him but turned
to baltimore good heavens he said
theres the abby the academy the
albion the altamont the armistead
and the arundel but still no c un-
less it would mean the academy
how about poston or pirming-
ham or puffalo kerrigan asked or
prooklyn or palbany

  hatch went hack to scotch were
not quite on the right track he said
perhaps p isnt the city perhaps p
coffins for three



is the hotel and ac is the city sud-
denly he was galvanized thats it
atlantic city

  damn me kerrigan said

  hatch split the book plenty of
em he exclaimed the palm-hall
the penn-atlantic the palais the
pennhurst the phillips house the
pierrepont the plaza the president
and the princess

  kerrigan said lets get to work
on the telephone

  wait hatch said westcott
hoped that the letters pac would im-
mediately convey to rhoda quinn the
name of a certain hotel in atlantic
city why should they because they
stayed at that particular hotel upon
some important occasion kerrigan it
was their honeymoon

  now youve got something ker-
rigan said knowing the kind of
woman rhoda was-

  well pick out the one she would
consider the classiest hatch said

  shed take the palais kerrigan
said

  absolutely hatch agreed the
message meant rhoda quinn-you
see timothy in the palais hotel at-
lantic city  he took up the tele-
phone operator get me the palais
hotel in atlantic city i want to talk
with mr howard westcott

  hold the line the operator said

t t atch sipped his highball kerri-
- gan sat on the edge of his chair
sanders watched them intently soon
hatch nuzzled the transmitter

  a voice said hello

  hello mr westcott hatch said
whos calling westcotts voice
returned cautiously

  hatch smiled at kerrigan

  damn me kerrigan muttered
  cyrus hatch calling hatch said

over the line have you seen the lat-
est papers mr westcott

  hatch how the devil did you
know- yes-yes ive seen them
then you know its no use wait-
ing any longer for that certain party
to meet you there hatch said

  i know i know

  you chipped the letters off the door
of the seligman tomb with the idea of
connecting with rhoda and helping
her to keep out of the hands of the
police is that it

  yes-yes westcott said

  you knew that if the police caught
up with her and put the heat on her
that would be your finish

  yes-yes westcotts voice was
ragged great scott hatch what can
i do now

  phone your wife and tell her youll
be back on the first train you can
catch hatch suggested good night
mr westcott

  he sat comfortably on the bed and
looked at the light through his high-
ball

  and that lets howard westcott out
also he said

  i hope it does kerrigan said but
how do you figure it

  if westcott had killed rhoda here
in new york he certainly wouldnt
have rushed down to atlantic city hop-
ing to meet her there would he
damn me kerrigan said with a
sigh

  that eliminates all our suspects ex-
cept the ladies i think we should elimi-
nate them also if only for the sake of
old-fashioned chivalry hatch said
just as i remarked at the beginning
the trouble with these murders is that
nobody committed em

  it still isnt necessarily true that
they were all committed by the same
person kerrigan said again


detective fiction weekly

  im still sure they were all com-
mitted by the same person hatch said

  a person who couldnt possibly
have committed them kerrigan add-
ed

  right hatch said

  were all going screwy kerrigan
sighed

  thoughtfully hatch finished his
highball putting aside the empty glass
he took up the telephone

  operator he asked is there a
public stenographer in the hotel

  on the mezzanine the operator
said

  while he put on his coat and hat
hatch peered at sanders

  listen sanders he said you
asked me to help you get out of this
with a whole skin ill do what i can
but i want you to keep one thing clear-
ly in mind if you let slip so much as
one word about the connection between
howard westcott and rhoda quinn
ill throw you to the wolves under-
stand that

  i-i understand hatch sanders
said

  we cant keep the name of timothy
quinn out of this but as far as youre
concerned sanders quinn and west-
cott are two separate and distinct iden-
tities from this moment on howard
westcott is dissociated in your mind
from everything and anything concern-
ing timothy quinn you dont know a
damned thing about howard west-
cott

  i-i dont know a damned thing
about westcott sanders agreed

  hatch nodded

  whats more you dont know any-
thing about timothy quinn hatch
went on you dont even suspect that
there was anything crooked going on
in seligmans office if you accuse john
pirano of blackmail hell retaliate and

your goose will be cooked so far as
you know pirano is a thoroughly hon-
est man if you insist on that hell
keep quiet about you because hell need
your support

  sanders was absorbing every word

  last night in the club grotto you
recognized rhoda quinn as a former
client of seligmans and you simply
asked her if she knew where you might
land a new position when she began
to quarrel with seligman you discreet-
ly retired what seligman said to you
was an angry expression of personal
dislike youve been avoiding the police
on advice of counsel youd better get
busy on the phone and find yourself
a lawyer wholl back you up on that

  sanders nodded eagerly

  but remember if you shoot off
your mouth about howard westcott
youre sunk hatch threatened

  thats right kerrigan affirmed

  ill do exactly as you say sanders
promised

hatch took sanders key from
the dresser as kerrigan fol-
lowed him out sanders eyed them dis-
traitly

  hatch kerrigan said while they
waited for the elevator youre a hell
of a decent guy

  whatever i am im too much that
way for my own good hatch said
wryly

  they left the elevator at the mez-
zanine and stepped into the public
stenographers office a red-headed girl
took her feet off the typewriter closed
her book and smiled

  i want to get off a couple of let-
ters hatch explained but id like
to write them myself

  the girl said go as far as you
like

  she opened a drawer containing
coffins for three



paper and envelopes took another chair
and resumed her book hatch sat at the
typewriter and fed a sheet of onion-
skin under the roller kerrigan watched
his dancing fingers and frowned
hatch paused at intervals thinking
hard finally when the sheet was cov-
ered he folded it and put it in his
pocket

  he wrote a second shorter letter
and typed a name on an envelope he
sealed the second letter in the envelope
then rose and proffered a dollar bill to
the girl

  thank you he said

  thank you she said taking the
bill

  kerrigan followed flatch from the
office down the stairs into the lobby
out to the curb and into a taxi

  hatch leaned forward and whispered
an address to the driver

  the cab started

  what the hell are you up to now
kerrigan inquired

  hatch closed the panel of the drivers
compartment removed the first letter
from his pocket and switched on the
dome light

  this is a dangerous thing to do
he said but im damned if i can
see any other way out

  if you think itll work lets try it
kerrigan said right now id bet on
a million-to-one chance

  hatch began reading  dear mr
westcott you probably remember my
name as that of a man from which you
bought a number of racing pigeons
several years ago i must apologize for
involving you even in this innocent
manner in a murder case and for con-
cealing myself in this way but circum-
stances make it necessary 

  what the hell is this kerrigan
asked

  hatch read on  i am the timothy

quinn who disappeared from chicago
six years ago-rhoda quinns hus-
band recently rhodas lawyer sidney
seligman searching at her behest lo-
cated me i do not know how he ac-
complished this for i had severed all
connection with my old life and
changed my name seligman found that
i had remarried-bigamously i con-
fess and very happily my situation be-
ing what it is i naturally wish to re-
main safely out qf reach of the law

   seligman began blackmailing me
of course i was in no position to take
legal action against him but in hope of
escaping his greed somehow i began
watching him last night i saw rhoda
leaving his office the idea struck me
that rhoda was probably also being
victimized by seligman in some way
hoping that she might forgive me once
she learned my circumstances and also
that she and i working together might
find some means of beating seligmans
game i followed her

   she went from seligmans office
to the club grotto i waited outside
intending to follow her to her home
for a better opportunity to discuss the
matter later i sawr her come out of
the club with a man whom i did not
recognize just as seligman arrived

   i was an eye-witness to the mur-
der 

  damn me kerrigan said

   i saw the murderer fire through
the hedge at the side of the door and
i saw him make his escape through
the information and photographs pub-
lished in the newspapers i learned his
identity i am determined to see him
punished for his crime

   but- 

  hatch youre a terrific strain on
my nerves kerrigan said

   but because i cannot come for-
ward openly i found it necessary to


detective fiction weekly

make use of some -means of communi-
cation which would not reveal my
whereabouts or the name under which
i am now living i remembered your
loft mr westcott and recalled that
you frequently ship pigeons off by ex-
press as i used to do i telephoned your
home spoke to mrs westcott as an-
other pigeon fancier and learned that
you were about to send a crate of
pigeons to boston seizing the oppor-
tunity i confiscated your crate of birds
while mrs westcott was taking them
in her car to the express office

   i have already released all but
two of the birds one of the two re-
maining pigeons will carry this message
to you the last bird may carry an even
more important communication-the
name of the murderer

   but- 

  hatch youre killing me kerrigan
said

   but  hatch continued  i hesi-
tate to assume the responsibility of
condemning a human being even a
murderer to death i write this in the
hope that he will realize he cannot es-
cape justice i take this means of warn-
ing him of giving him an opportunity
to confess

   but if he does not confess to-
morrow i will hesitate no longer i
will write another message to be de-
livered by pigeon in this same way
and name him 

  damn me kerrigan said

   please turn this letter over to the
commissioner of police as soon as con-
venient and arrange matters so that
he will be present when the final
message arrives sincerely yours
timothy quinn 

  kerrigan moaned hatch thats
dynamite what if it dawns on the
police that quinn is westcott

  can you think of any better way

of squeezing out of this  hatch chal-
lenged

  kerrigan said vehemently its
nothing but a bluff it wont work
nobodyll confess tomorrow will
come and go and the murderer will
keep his mouth shut then itll be up
to you to name somebody as the mur-
derer who the hell are you going to
pick

  damned if i know hatch admit-
ted ill have to figure that out when
the time comes

rrihe cab stopped hatch climbed
out and paid the driver kerrigan
followed him into the cigar store on
the corner and stood beside the tele-
phone booth while hatch put through a
call

  suzettes voice said the alexander
residence

  this is mr hatch suzette is
rupert alexander within earshot

  he is in his study suzette an-
swered

  good call mrs westcott

  in a moment lois westcotts voice
said yes

 dont worry about howard
hatch said has he phoned you

  no

  then expect a call from him hell
be back soon and i think hes in the
clear in a few minutes another pigeon
will return to the loft with a mes-
sage-

  lois westcott stifled an exclama-
tion

  learn that message by heart
hatch went on youll grasp the plan
behind it get terry to fall in with
the plan and explain it to howard as
soon as he comes telephone the com-
missioner and tell him about the
message hell probably send a couple
of men around well have to take a
coffins for three



chance with your father but show him
the letter and hell understand that
theres nothing else to be done

  it sounds-dangerous lois west-
cott said

  its dangerous as hell hatch said
but weve got to see it through good
night mrs westcott

  his face was hard when he left the
booth kerrigan trudged with him to
a tenement midway in the block they
climbed to the third floor kerrigan
unlocked the door hatch went in first
and gazed speculatively at the two
pigeons in the crate

  you cant go through with this
hatch kerrigan said its a crazy
chance its too damned risky

  hatch took a spool of thread from
the dresser broke off a length then
opened the cage reached in and closed
his hand over one of the birds

  the night flier he asked kerri-
gan

  listen hatch kerrigan said
you cant do this im damned if
ill let you do it

  hatch rolled the tightly folded let-
ter around the pigeons leg and bound
it in place with the thread he turned
to the window kerrigan gripped his
arm

  put that pigeon back kerrigan
said

  this is the only way out kerri-
gan hatch said soberly

  put that pigeon back hatch ker-
rigan said put it back or ill paste
you to the floor

  hatch opened the window kerrigan
caught his shoulder and spun him
about he tried to take the bird from
hatchs hand the bird squeaked with
fright hatch struck once a straight-
armjab to the point of kerrigans chin

  kerrigan fell back on the bed he
sprang up as hatch reached out into
the darkness holding the bird

  he opened his hand

  the pigeon darted off into the night
 it became a black flutter that vanished
 in the western sky

  hatch looked at kerrigan and ker-
rigan scowled at hatch and they
gravely wagged their heads

  sorry kerrigan hatch said

  thats all right hatch kerrigan
said

  good

  hatch closed the window and gazed
grimly at the one bird remaining in
the crate

  i wish i knew whats happened to
danny he said

to be continued next week
  this is the one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth
  of a series of articles exposing business
  rackets that cost you billions of dollars every
  year i mr wrentmore is an authority on
  swindles and frauds well known to legal
  financial and commercial associations-

write only

that looks like a good job
doesnt it well lets see whats
behind it

 a detective fiction weekly
reader who wanted to establish an
independent business for himself an-
swered the above advertisement and
at the same time wrote me a letter
asking for a report on the company
inasmuch as they maintained a branch
office in greater new york he sub-
sequently sent me the first letter
he received from the firm and this
confirmed the statement in the adver-
tisement to the effect that the route
comprised about  established ac-
counts produced approximately 
in weekly collections and stated that
his earnings would be based on a per-
centage of these collections although
the company guaranteed a minimum of
 weekly the letter wound up by
stating that the company required a
cash deposit of about  to cover

pickingyour
own pocket

       nuts

       by

 frank wrentmore

 the inventory value of the merchan-
 dise needed to service the route

   it still sounded very rosy so i
 dropped around to see the boss their
 office formed a part of their manufac-
 turing plant in a commercial district
 and the firms merchandise-nuts and
 candy in transparent packages-was
 attractively displayed on neat little
 racks around the office i explained that
 mr so-and-so one of their prospec-
 tive route managers had requested me
 to get some additional information for
 him well of course that was all right
 so we sat down

    one of the first things i learned was
  that the route was not established but
  i was told that the company would
  send one of their experienced repre-
  sentatives to the town where mr so-
  and-so lived and develop the route for
  him among the stores there when i
  asked how they knew that an unestab-
  lished route would produce sales of
   weekly i was told that the aver-
  age route produced this amount

    now the essence of any proposition
 of this nature lies in the contract a man
 is asked to sign their distributors
 agreement was drawn of course by
 the companys attorney even a super-
 ficial examination disclosed several in-
 teresting points wholly at variance
 with the impression conveyed by the
 advertisement and the original letter


picking your own pocket



  the  cash deposit wasnt a
cash deposit at all but constituted pay-
ment for the merchandise delivered to
the distributor by the company after
the route was established and the dis-
tributor was required to consign to
be paid for if and when sold this to
the storekeepers on the route to be
established by the companys repre-
sentative in other words he was ac-
cording to the contract to engage in
business on his own account and be
responsible for all credit and other
losses incident to the business

  i said suppose this route isnt prof-
itable and the distributor wants to get
his money back what happens

  oh yes said the manager we
make provision for that in the con-
tract read paragraph eight so i read
that after six months following the
date of this agreement should the dis-
tributor desire to discontinue his serv-
ices as distributor for the corpora-
tion that he will give the corporation
written notice of same and upon re-
ceipt of said notice the corporation
will make immediate efforts to secure
a new distributor for the heretofore
mentioned route

  now thats just fine except for the
fact that it guarantees nothing if the
corporation isnt successful in obtain-
ing a new distributor for that route-
and why should they try very hard
they have other routes to sell-the
original distributors  is repre-
sented by a lot of nuts

  in order to qualify for the so-
called  weekly salary guarantee
the distributor must agree to distribute
a certain minimum number of packages

of merchandise per week-now how
can he do that-and send in a daily
report to the company just to make it
tricky the contract terms the  sal-
ary guarantee gross weekly earnings
and out of this the distributor must
pay freight or express charges from
chicago pay his car expense and stand
for all losses how is that for a sal-
ary guarantee

  another paragraph of the contract
provides that if the distributor fails
to service the route and keep records
and make reports according to the
agreements heretofore set forth para-
graph six the salary guarantee of
this agreement shall be void and in no
way binding upon the corporation
that in my opinion is a perfect out
for the company because they can al-
ways say that they never received your
reports-unless they are sent by reg-
istered mail and a company which
asks a man to sign such a one-sided
agreement and which uses such mis-
leading come-ons is quite likely to
take such advantages

  most individuals who sign such an
agreement and put  in the hands
of these companies do so in good faith
and because they are honest they try
hard to make a living and are certain-
ly entitled to protection but first of all
they must protect themselves

  before you place your name on any
contract especially one drawn by the
other side take it to a good lawryer and
have him explain it to you in detail he
will charge you only a small fee for
such a service and it will insure for
you the safety of your principal

solving cipher secrets

  a cipher is secret writing
the way to solve ciphers is
to experiment with substitute
letters until real words begin
to appear in solving notice
the frequency of certain let-
ters for instance the let-
ters e t a o n i are the
most used in our language
so if the puzzle maker has

used x to represent e x will
probably appear very fre-
quently combinations of let-
ters will also give you clues
thus the affixes -ing -ion

enerally speaking editing a

great magazine is exciting work
sometimes there are dull mo-
ments but what with the constant
treasure-hunting among the incoming
manuscripts and preparing others for
the printer and reading the neat pages
of proof and finally holding the fin-
ished product crisp and shiny in our
hands its about the most satisfactory
work we can imagine

  it really isnt work at all of course
and we can understand our friends who
fail to conceal their amazement that we
actually earn a salary by sitting in com-
fortable chairs and reading stories
every day

  nevertheless although the excite-
ment-content of any day or week or
month is high it is only rarely that we
strike such a peak of pleasure as when
we found mr dale clarks newest
novel its a baffling story called mur-
der wholesale and it will set the pace
for the issue after next probably you
had better reserve your copy now

  we are in a quandary over this letter
from

gus bronson

  dear editor

ive been having a terrible time not long

  ago a friend of mine saw a copy of dfw
  in my room and proceeded to rave it was
  an opiate he claimed reading trash like
  that kept me from using my brains for
  better things

    i tried to explain that i enjoy reading
  dfw and that it is an important item in
  my entertainment i even went so far as to
  state that the stories very often gave me
  something to think about

    my friend was skeptical to say the least
  finally to avoid serious trouble we struck
  a bargain i promised to quit reading the
  magazine for two weeks and my friend
  promised to read it faithfully for the same
  amount of time

    the results are this ive gone back to
  reading the magazine after scurrying
  around and getting a hold of the two issues
  i missed and my friend is a steady cus-
  tomer

    but what bothers me is this he still
  claims that dfw if not actually a narcotic
  is a strongly habit-forming drug and i
  wonder if maybe hes not right

 weve heard of this phenomenon be-
fore in defense of the magazine and
its influence may we remind hesitant
readers that we have read every word
in every issue for a long time now
and although its grown to be a habit
there seem to be no injurious after-
effects

the editors will be interested to hear

first

  dear editor

    for some time i have been intending to
 write you to put in my bid for one of the
 longest readers of your magazine to date
 in your flashes from readers i have not
 seen one letter where the reader started
 with the first copy and finished with the last
 issue january  i bought my first copy
 also your first issue on september  
 at the beach drug store on grandville
 avenue grand rapids mich and my last
 copy in a corner news stand in buffalo
 n y in between times i have bought them
 in about ten different states east of the
 mississippi river and will continue to do
 so as long as you publish it i have no
 favorite authors as they are all good and
 i usually read it through the night i get it

  i	can truthfully say that in the thirteen
  years i have read the magazine that i have
  not found one that can compare with
  detective fiction even in the higher price
  fields and when i read on the average of
  about six different detective story maga-
  zines a week that is saying something

   wishing you a bigger success in 
 and all i ask is keep the magazine as is and
 you will have me for a reader a good many
 years to come

   the reason i remember the date of my
 first purchase is because it was my first
 anniversary and i was shopping for my
 wifes present
