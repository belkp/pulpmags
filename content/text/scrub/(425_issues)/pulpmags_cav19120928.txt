chapter i

a kiss arid a crash

you say that no man ever
kissed you 

    in the tropic moon-
light aboard the slow-
going steamer i sat and
gazed at the softly rounded face and
full ripe lips of angela alvarado the
charming california school maam with
a dash of spanish blood in her whom
i had known just six days that being
the period that had elapsed since the
loyalty had picked me up from the
south sea trading station at florakiva

   yes she replied with one of her
little music-box laughs-only no music-
box ever was made that could emit such
golden notes  no man has ever
kissed-that is except a near relation

  i wondered if the laugh were a chal-
lenge she sat temptingly near me in a
corner of the upper deck-house i
glanced about and saw nobody near us
on the deck

   honest injun  i asked feeling a
strange tremor run all over me as i
gazed at her sweetly curved mouth

    i	c

   honest injun she repeated

   well said i bending quickly and
pressing my lips to hers for a rapturous
second  you cant say it now

    oh  she cried in quick indignant
expostulation her white teeth snap-
ping upon the monosyllable then she
rose all in a flutter and as she passed
the deck-light  could see that her eyes
were wet her cheeks flaming and her
bosom heaving wildly

  as she walked rapidly and deter-
minedly away i sprang after her full
of instant self-reproach and eager to
appease her but she flew on to her cabin
and shut the door with a wrathful slam
saying as she did so  i shall never
speak to you again  

  i hardly thought she meant it and
had no idea she could keep it up but
at breakfast next morning though i
was a model of contrition and sought
in every way possible to make repara-
tion she wouldn t look at me where i
sat next to her at table but devoted
herself to her friend ruth deming a
pretty wax doll of a girl who was also
a schoolmistress

  in fact all the passengers except


the cavalier

myself were school-teachers and of
these voyaging pedagogues there were
just twenty women and one man
of the man i will tell you later i was

chiefly concerned with the schoolmis-
tresses

  they were nearly all from new
england and were bound for manila
to teach the young filipino idea how
to shoot they had taken passage in
the loyalty a poky little old tramp
steamer from san francisco because
they had missed the oceanic of the
regular line the captain didnt want
to take them declaring that his was not
a passenger ship but a committee of
the prettiest schoolmaams had won
him over and now they were more than
half-way down on the voyage and all
as blithe and merry as a  pinafore 
chorus

  but since her act of insurgency be-
cause of my kiss angela had not
seemed quite so joyous as the others
she appeared to be particularly set
upon effacing me from her world the
girl who had never been kissed by any
man save a near relation and now actu-
ally had been kissed by an unrelated
outsider seemed bent upon making that
outsider feel his complete outsidedness

  now although i gloried in the mem-
ory of that kiss i am sure i was as
humble and apologetic when i tried to
get near her as any man might be but
it did no good whatever my goddess
was not to be propitiated she beck-
oned to the steward while we sat at
table and induced him to change the
places of herself and her friend ruth
deming so that i soon found myself
sitting beside a large athletic blonde
named dorothy shaw while angelas
frigid shoulder appeared about ten
chairs away down the long board

  i felt lonely and extraneous but
talked with dorothy shaw who had a
large fund of information on tap about
basket-ball and tennis but athletic
girls never seemed quite so uninterest-
ing to me as at that particular moment

  dorothy shrewdly observed my long
face and smiled as she remarked know-

ingly   seems to be getting cooler as
we approach the equator strange
isnt it 

   yes i replied shortly trying to
smile in turn  its that way some-
times

   they say theres perpetual ice and
snow on some of those equatorial
mountains in south america she
rippled on  i hope in your case the
ice wont remain forever

   then you know how i came to be
placed in cold storage i remarked
though i hated myself for seeming to
make light of a matter so serious
to me

   oh its all over the ship she said
roguishly  all the girls are talking
about it such things always are talked
about you know when theyre confided
in strict confidence to ones most inti-
mate friend

   indeed said i and i tried to
change the subject

  but the animated dorothy kept bab-
bling about it all during breakfast
trying to make me feel the enormity of
my offense as she said though her talk
was all chaff and tending toward the
sarcastic

  after breakfast she challenged me
to a game of ring quoits on the after-
deck she played remarkably well but
i was glad when with flushed face and
little pearly beads upon her brow miss
shaw went to join the other school-
maams under the awning leaving me
to mope about on deck waiting for a
chance to square things with angela

  the steamer had been nosing about
among the islands picking up shell and
copra and that was why my trip to
rutaritari was taking so long but we
were nearing the gilberts now and
there would be only a few more days
of it then angela would be sailing
on to the philippines and i would be
left amid the ruins of my fallen world

  i was miserably self-reproaching
how thoughtless i had been so to
offend the dearest girl in all the world

 tried to get near her to ask her to for-
give me but always she turned away
schoolmaam island



she spent much of her time in her state-
room about which i hung like a dog
waiting for his mistress to come out
and give him a bone but it was no
use this dog was to have no bone
and it served him jolly well right for
being such an impatient upstart and so
free and forehanded at the kissing
game

  but she hadnt seemed to mind my
forehandedness in other ways at the
beginning of the acquaintance on that
tirst evening when i came aboard the
loyalty at florakiva i had been as-
signed to a seat near the end of the
captains table right alongside of her
and she had inspired me at once fall-
ing in love with angela was a mighty
easy thing to do there was gipsy
warmth of color in her face her lip had
a high-born curve and her nostrils be-
spoke a dainty pride eyes-well you
rarely find such eyes outside of span-
ish-speaking countries

  now i had seen plenty of girls with
dark hair and dark eyes in the south
seas and some really pretty ones but
as a rule the faces of the island girls
dont express anything greater than a
desire for a piece of roast pig or some
tinsel thing to hang about their necks
while angelas face was all animation

  we were seated near the end of the
table that first delicious evening a
long way from the chaperon and
there was nobody to introduce us but
i cracked the ice by handing her the
stuffed olives judging that one of her
style would find them to her liking and
they were

  within ten minutes i was telling her
all about the islands and my life among
them - that is all except some things
that would look a little better in the
background though they were not so
immoral-only trading tricks that were
invented and practised long before i
ever saw the south seas she attended
closely especially to the tales of pearl-
divers and sharks and more than once
those delicate nostrils quivered and di-
lated while the dark eyes gleamed with
sympathetic interest

  from that moment i had devoted
myself to her despite the presence
aboard of an offensive third person
who was trying to do the same thing
this offensive third person who by
the way didnt seem to be in the least
offensive to angela was mr wallace
little he had been the principal of
a grammar-school in ohio and had all
the middle western ways plus peda-
gogy for which in the male gender
i had an instinctive distrust not to
say dislike

  now little was an obvious mis-
nomer for he stood six feet two and
was a trifle slim but husky-looking
enough and with a rather prominent
adams apple how angela could
overlook his shortcomings or i should
say longcomings was beyond me but
i will own that the fellow had a good
eye a deep manly voice and could talk
fairly well to women-too well indeed
to suit me

  but the great big bulging fact that
i couldnt get over was that wallace
little was going on with angela and
the other schooimaams to the philip-
pines while i was to be left behind at
butaritari i had half a mind to chuck
my job-south sea trading-agencies
are poor-paying propositions anyway
-and go tomanila in the loyalty 

  you can see how i still clung to the
idea of winning her even when she be-
gan to ignore me after that fatal kiss
avhen i say that with butaritari only a
few hundred miles away my half mind
was rapidly becoming a whole one and
i saw myself telling the manager at
butaritari what i thought of south sea
agencies demanding the remainder of
my months pay and taking passage in
the loyalty for manila

  but wallace little-oh wallace
little he and his long legs were now
escorting her all over the ship and he
was reading to her every afternoon
while she sat in her steamer-chair the
one consoling thought t had was that
he had never kissed her while i was
still in the transport of that heavenly
pressure of my lips to hers


the cavalier

  we swung out of the direct courso
in order to take in alamaka an island
a little to the south which we neared
one hazy afternoon and soon we were
running in and dropping anchor off the
station little had been reading to an-
gela for two solid hours by the watch
and i was brooding on the forward
deck feeling mighty glum when i saw
the king of alamaka coming out in a
big fancy canoe

    knew the chap  is name was tau-
matoa a round-faced slim-built fellow
of forty pretty badly given to dissipa-
tion but active enough he had on an
old black frock coat a dirty panama
hat and a pair of blue-gray trousers
i had been at alamaka two years be-
fore and the king who was a traveler
in a small way had visited our station
at panipa a couple of times and had
played poker to his sorrow with our
traders he was going to butaritari
this time probably to get away from
his wives and the home missionaries
for a while and have an uninterrupted
spree

   it was quite affecting that sad and
sorrowful leave-taking of the chief
from his wives who went back in the
big canoe crying like children but
what smashed a big hole in the pathos
was the broad grin with which tauma-
toa climbed aboard and gazed at our
girls strung out along the rail like so
many bluebirds on a telegraph wire
he ogled them openly and would have
spoken to some of them had not miss
mary peck the chaperon intervened
between his sensual grin and their cu-
riously innocent smiles

  the king was ugly enough at all
times with his flat nose and his pock-
marked face but i never saw him look
so like a mon key-visaged mutt as he
did while he stood and took in those
schoolmaams angela leaned against
the rail her red lips parted in a curious
smile

  hello misser sibley the king
greeted me in his mellow voice and
stuck out his slim brown hand

    varee glad see you again 

  he grinned at me as at an old

friend and out of the tail of my eye i
saw an interested look steal over an-
gelas face

  i hello tom was my returning
salute  how are all the folks 

  oh pretty good misser clarke
he get sick go way-nother misnary
come preach my people yaree good
man-heap too good 

   makes things too quiet for you
eh   suggested

   too damn quiet he said softly
looking shoreward at the dn indling
huts of his village peeping out from
among the palms

   im afraid that miss peck heard
his expletive for she glanced toward
him with distinct disaproval and hud-
dled her brood aft out of hearing

  i helped the chaperon to get rid of
taumatoa by marching him down to
the smoking-room  was lonely and
his soft-syllabled talk full of nothing
in particular was better than mooning
about on deck we burned a good
many mild manila cigars and he bab-
bled confidentially about the mission-
aries and the hard time he had keeping
down a revolt among his people

  a little later in the evening we both
went to a musicale in the saloon the
king was vastly interested in the con-
cert and grunted his appreciation of
the performers

  that was the time to have seen an-
gela violin in hand standing at the
piano and smiling upon her audience
of schoolmaams ships officers quar-
termasters and pantry-boy s the first
thing she gave us was that fetching
little  humoresque of dvoraks
why its called that i dont know for
there are more tears in it than smiles
and the way angela toyed with the
piece was something to bring out the
tears let me tell you she had us all
going in no time

  as for the effect upon me well i
reckon the man for such a girl to play
such a thing to is a susceptible chap
who has been exiled for four years in
the south seas it makes him realize
schoolmaam island



what has been missing all that time
and it fills his soul with old longings
as she slowed down on the last sweet
note she stood there with her pretty
chin tilted up in the air and a smile on
her face was good to see and then the
applause

  angela got up again bowed charm-
ingly and went forward with an airy
little rush smiling like a pleased child
a perfectly artless smile it was a smile
that went home to you and put the
clamps on whatever liking you had
formed for her and with it went a lit-
tle side duck of her head that was all
her own and simply fetching

  she put her violin up over that
plump left shoulder of hers hugged it
tight with her dimpled chin and swept
the bow with a strong swing over the
strings sending forth that wonderfully
appealing old  coronation  waltz
which i hadnt heard for years and
never so well played

  the loyaltys men couldnt keep
their feet still but began to beat time
while they looked yearningly around at
the schoolmaams as if theyd like to
grab hold of them and swing them
about the room i felt sorry for them
because they couldnt the first officer
did offer his arm to one girl and take a
few circling steps with her but they
didnt get much of a dance out of it on
account of the chairs and tables

   him make heap good music 
chuckled the delighted king staring at
angela and pulling out a big cigar
which he would have lighted if i had
not restrained him  like see him do
hula-hula

  the teachers turned with scandal-
ized looks upon their faces and miss
peck pronged us with flashing eyes

  shut up tom i commanded
 guess youd better go to bed i saw
him safely off to his bunk in the
steerage and then went back to the con-
cert but as angela didnt play again
and only sat and chatted with wallace
little between numbers i wasnt par-
ticularly interested

  when the musicale broke up i went

to my room sleep didnt come to me
for a long time for i kept thinking of
angela and planning how i could
square things with her

  it was about seven in the morning
i should say right in the middle of a
dream in which i was  my knees be-
fore angela begging her to forgive me
and be my wife when somebody was
ruthlessly pitched out of his bunk and
banged against the door by an awful
lurch of the ship i awoke to find that
somebody was myself before i could
gain an upright position i heard men
yell out on deck while wild shrieks and
moans went up from the women

  getting into as many of my clothes
as i could lay hands on i pried open
the door which had got stuck some-
how and ran toward angelas cabin
with my shoe-laces flying- on the way
i demanded of a wild-eved deck-hand
what had happened he swore fiercely
and told me the ship had struck a hid-
den reef and was sinking very fast i
could see that she was well down by the
head and it didnt look to me as though
she could float an hour longer

chapter ii

the waterspout

t was broad daylight though rather
misty and i had no trouble in find-
ing no  which i knew was angelas
room but when i got there she was
gone i looked about for her amid the
wild confusion on deck but i couldnt
find her the fog was settling thickly
down over the steamer and that didnt
particularly aid my search i ran about
everywhere calling for her but got no
reply

  the men acted very white and it
thrilled me to see them handing the
women into the boats and lowering
away i wont say what my part of it
was and reaily it didnt amount to
much for i was still looking for an-
gela there was hardly any sea run-
ning and there were pienty of boats
everybody could be taken off some


the cavalier

of them already had rowed away in

the fog

  just as it seemed that the last of the
women was over the side and my heart
was in my boots because angela was
not with them here she came flying
down the deck with her precious violin
case in her hand i didnt know what
had detained her and  didnt ask i
piled her into the long-boat one of the
last to leave the ship and turned to-
ward the deck of the sinking steamer
but she clung to my hand

  dont go back she cried plead-
ingly  get into our boat theres
plenty of room

  well as i glanced about and saw
men getting into other boats it didnt
seem an ungallant thing to follow suit
so i obeyed orders and i tell you they
sounded sweet to me after being denied
a word from that dear girl for three
long dreary days

  two deck-hands had been detailed to
our boat but just before we cast oft
the first officer ordered them out again
and told us to stand by and wait for
them the loyalty was getting danger-
ously low by this time and settling fast
now there are safer things to tie to
than a sinking steamer so i soon de-
cided to cast off and was just going
to do so when a long dark body
clothed only in a pair of blue-gray
trousers dropped heavily into the mid-
dle of the boat among my panicky pas-
sengers there were shrieks and the
fluttering of skirts as the women shrank
away from the half-naked object

   goodness me  cricd a voice un-
mistakably miss pecks  has this
brown cannibal got to go with us 

  i hadnt observed the chaperon be-
fore as one of our boat-load as a mat-
ter of fact i should have preferred the
brown cannibal but theres no picking
ones passengers in a case like this

  - get out of there tom  i yelled
 come forward here with me

  meantime other boats had been filled
with men nearly nil from the other
side of the steamer and though t
called to them repeatedly as we stood

off for i wanted a man or two to help
row they paid no attention to me what-
ever but were off in the fog before i
could realize that one white man and
one kanaka had been left to man a
boat-load of nine schoolma ams among
them the sweetest girl in the world

   glanced about in the boat and saw
that a cask of water and some cases of
provisions had been stoved aft under
a piece of canvas

  it looked to me as if we had better
be getting away from the steamer be-
fore we were drawn down with her so
i shoved off picked up a pair of oars
and with angela at the tiller we were
soon out upon the open sea in a thick
fog rowing south by my pocket-com-
pass for i knew that was where the
islands were nearest and thickest

  angela showed up bravely in that
hour of grave uncertainty when we
faced the fog-fuddled sea faring forth
upon our desperate adventure but
something beside her own situation
was evidently perturbing her and that
something was made manifest when i
saw her lean forward and heard her
say in anxious tones to dorothy shaw
the athletic girl

   i wonder what became of wallace
little did you see him leave the
steamer 

  i did not hear dorothys reply nor
did i know whether the schoolmaster
was safe or not for i had not seen him
on deck nor in any of the boats it oc-
curred to me that if he really had been
as devoted to angela as lie had pre-
tended to be all along he would have
been on hand to see her safely off the
ship

  but with all these women on my
hands i was a man with a mind full
of anxious thoughts and i had no time
to worry about mr little who though
it would have been a calamity to have
lost him was fully capable of taking
care of his own six feet of able-bodied
manhood

  we pulled away slowly all eyes upon
the steamer which had settled down al-
most to the main deck no i dont
schoolmaam island



think any of us really saw her sink
below the waves for the mist soon
blurred out the black funnels

  there was no other boat in sight i
called aloud thinking it was best to
keep in company with the other small
craft but no reply came back out of
the fog that enshrouded the morning
sea so there we were in a lone long-
boat afloat on the great pacific which
so often belies its name riding the
waves in a cockleshell that would last
about ten minutes in a gale and about
as many seconds in a typhoon it was
not the happiest situation in the world
but it had to be borne

   in looking over our passengers i saw
ruth deming who was inseparable
from angela and dorothy shaw i
was glad that dorothy had come along
in a strenuous adventure like this one
needs girls of muscle it was not long-
before dorothy got in her oar and was
pulling like a fisherwoman her ex-
ample was followed by ruth and an-
other girl who sat on the same seat
with angelas chum this helped a lot
for the sweat was trickling into my
eyes

  i must say that the girls behaved
beautifully they spelled each other
from time to time at the oars and i took
a little rest now and again while i called
off to angela the course she was to
steer we were rocking merrily along
under four-girl power when the sun
burst through the fog i looked about
at the clearing horizon but could see
nothing of the steamer nor of the small
boats it was a scene to remember all 
ones life-that wave-tossed long-boat
its thwarts covered by light skirts and
above them the graceful shirt-waists
and middy blouses and the fluffy hats
or navy caps with the glowing hopeful
girlish faces under them the gray can-
vas aft with the big brown shoulders
and the black head resting upon it and
the beautiful girl in the stern looking
bravely to me for steering orders

   least of all there was i never feel-
ing smaller nor more heartsick in my
life a lone tradr on the bow-seat

looking out over a wide and merciless
expanse of indigo sea praying that land
might pop up somewhere or that a sail
or a smudge of smoke might appear
above the great dismal hoop of the
horizon

  a fairish swell had grown out of the
northwest and came rolling and swoon-
ing in rows of wind-wrinkled humps
the wind kept stiffening and as i
leaned over the bow i could feel the
spit of the brine in my face

   do you think we shall reach land
before nightfall mr sibley miss
pecks voice conveyed a tone of keen
expectancy and her look was that of
one who held me responsible

   i hope so was all that i could
offer  we are making fair speed in
this wind and ought to pick up land
of some description before long

  that miserable kanaka asleep in the
bow wasnt helping in the least i
leaned over the drowsy taumatoa and
shook his brown shoulders

   get hold of an oar you rascal  i
cried for i wanted him to know who
was master aboard that boat

   all ri  he said wearily  me
drink first me thirsty

  i handed him half a cup of the
precious water he wanted more but
i covered up the cask with the canvas
and thrusting an oar into his hands i
sat beside angela in the stern until i
was rested it was good being there
with her on any terms though i could
have chosen happier ones her talk
was brave and hopeful but there was
an occasional lapse of anxiety when a
little quiver played about her mouth
and her dark eyes became very serious

  once she asked me  what has be-
come of wallace little do you think
he is safe 

   certainly i replied though i was
far from assured as i had not seen him
on deck after the steamer struck  he
must have gone in one of the boats

   oh i do hope so she said  but
none of our girls saw him still there
were plenty of boats and he must be
in one of them


the cavalier

  we all had a scrappy little lunch at
noon and then the oars dipped and
flashed in the rolling sea a little later
when the wind freshened from the
northwest i hoisted the canvas on a
couple of oars this helped our pace
across the lonely waste of water and
it rested all hands some of which were
pretty badly blistered

  and then i did a foolish thing i
laid the compass down on the bow for
a moment while  shifted the sail arid
when  looked for it again it was gone
i might have known that the tilting of
the boat would have slid it overboard
but a man in charge of nine women
and an irresponsible kanaka has a good
deal on his mind well we should
have to get along without it

   what is that funny thing over
there  asked dorothy shaw  looks
like a big half-opened umbrella with
the top hanging down

  she was pointing toward the south-
west over the boats bow

   isnt it a waterspout  asked ruth
deming  its like the pictures of
them

   very like said miss peck  i
hope it wont come this way

  high-hung in the cloud-flecked sky
ahead of us was a black funnel-shaped
rag that swirled above the sea like a
cyclone and under it the water was
boiling and lifting in an incredibly
short space of time as this awesome
manifestation of nature in her wild-
est mood swung nearer the funnel
swooped down and the sea-dome ilew
up until a wonderful black spout was
formed

   why it has grown out of the sea
and the sky all in a minute right be-
fore our eyes  cried angela her face
overspread with wonder

   and its coming nearer  said ruth
with a shudder

   him water-spou all riy declared
the chief

   unless we get out of its track we
shall all be drowned  cried miss peck
with wild afright  do you see mr
s iley-do you see 

  i had seen and had already pointed
our bow at right angle with the course
in which the liquid demon was coming
on also i had called to dorothy and
the best of the other oarswomen to get
in their oars and pull as hard as they
could

  you should have seen dorothy bend
to her oar even the stout taumatoa
though  must say he pulled as though
his life depended upon it made no bet-
ter showing than she her full bare
muscles bulged under the short sleeves
of her middy blouse her strong body
heaved under the strain and upon her
face was a look of tense determination

  i gave the tiller to angela telling her
to keep the boat steady as she was and
got in my oar beside the chief the ter-
rible spout whirled nearer and nearer

   we all goin down  cried the
king his brown face growing gray with
fear

   shut up  i yelled striking him on
the bare back with the flat of my hand
 keep at it keep rowing or thats
exactly what will happen

  for if the black wings of death ever
hovered near any of that oddly assorted
little party they were hovering then

chapter iii

the castaways

he seething funnel of water was
only a hundred feet from the boat
it came so close that we could feel the
coolness of the whirling column and
soon vagrant drips of spray from the
black cloud above fell in a shower
upon us

  as long as i live  shall never forget
the abject misery and crouching horror
of mary peck as she sat in the middle
of the boat white-faced speechless
faint with the fear of it the bow of
the boat rose suddenly into the air
while the girls screamed and some of
them dropped their oars but not dor-
othy she lay to with the will and
power of a young giantess

as the bow ducked down again
schoolmaam island



and the stem rose high upon the heav-
ing sea i looked aft at the mountain
of water behind us and saw the water-
spout twist itself across our little wake
not fifty feet away and whirl on to-
w ard the north the great waves fell
away from us as if under the wand of
some marine magician the wind
slacked down and the clouds fled from
the lace of the sun

   hooray  shouted dorothy pull-
ing in her oar thats the time we
scored 

   but we couldnt have done it if it
hadnt been for you 

  my praise brought the color again
to her face whitened by the danger
through which we had run i meant
what i said but for her added power
and quick action in that moment of
peril the spout would have struck us
and we should have been swamped

   it was a blessed deliverance said
miss peck  and i thank god for it

  it was a full hour before the girls
calmed down again among the most
hysterical ones was a miss fanny bin-
ney whom we had a great time in qui-
eting miss binney had found every
feature of our boat adventure a terrible
hardship and the waterspout had con-
vulsed her with fear it seemed to me
after we had so safely come out of it
and everything was serene that her
demonstrations were uncalled for she
was a healthy-looking girl whose
nerves were probably as strong as those
of any of the rest and somehow i felt
that she was faking when she continued
to act up every little while she would
throw herself into miss pecks amis
and wail like a baby and then laugh
and squeal

  pinch her suggested dorothy
after she had stood as much of this
show as she cared for and she fol-
lowed up the suggestion by squeezing
the girls arm between her strong
thumb and forefinger

  ouch she screamed that
hurts  but it made her subside and
i felt sure we all wanted to thank the
resourceful dorothy

  we had been sailing south by the
sun but after its red ball sank into the
sea and the evening mist obscured the
stars i lost all reckoning and more
than ever bewailed the loss of the cam-
pass after doddering about for a
while not knowing which way we were
going i called taumatoa aft and told
him of my plight

   thas all ri he reassured me
seizing the tiller kings head all
same as compass

  its a pretty tough statement to
credit but long before the stars shone
forth as they finally did that knowing
islander kept her on her true course
southward with all the confidence of a
man with a dozen compasses

  i was glad when the stars did come
out for we were headed two points to
the east of the cross and that would
bring us in among the western caro-
lines in the course of time

  it was about ten oclock that night
when a tufted black something stuck
up in the south a quarter-mile away
and soon i saw it was a feather-duster
palm which looked as though it were
growing right up out of the sea though
i knew that couldnt be so i was all
aquiver with the promise it gave of
land taumatoa looked at me silently
and grinned

   kings head all same compass--
thas so he chuckled delightedly
 thas land all ri 

  i yelled the good news to the girls
and they set up gleeful shouts as a nut
grove swung into view over the wave-
crests beyond the lone palm

   is it an island cried miss peck
in her sharpest tones

  by this time i could see a low-lying
strip of white coral beach at the foot of
the palms with the breakers pounding
upon it

   well its hardly the china coast
i replied as i stood up in the bow and
surveyed the little croquet ground that
gleamed white in the moonlight  but
it will do for a nights lodging and per-
haps a breakfast of breadfruit in the
morning


the cavalier

   why dont we go ashore  asked
one of the girls impatiently for  had
headed down the little coast

   we must find the lagoon i an-
swered  and enter by that it will be
safer for i must own that the sight
of those breakers awed me

   how do you know there is a la-
goon   asked miss peck sharply

   i dont know it  replied quietly
 but it you leave it to me ill try to
find it if there is one

  she gave a little sniff of displeasure
at these words but held herself to-
gether while we skirted the beach we
must have gone around that fool island
at least twice before  gave up the idea
of a lagoon entrance taumatoa said
it must be there but we simply couldnt
find it perhaps we kept offshore a
little too far but i didnt like the sound
of that surf

  when at last amid the restless ur-
gings of the girls and the importunities
of miss peck i consented to land any-
way and headed her shoreward into
the quietest cove i could find the tide
swung us in more sharply than i had
reckoned upon though the wind at
that point was offshore and our crude
sail was not drawing taumatoa
slacked her off by tugging stoutly with
two oars while i steered keeping as
clear of white water as i could i swung
her in over the barrier reef but did
not escape two or three bad bumps on
the coral which brought the w ater in
by the bucketful

  thg girls shrank away from the wet
and there were little cries of terror
miss peck expostulated when a foamy
wave drove down suddenly upon us
her tone indicating that it was all my
fault but nobody could have steered
more carefully angela behaved very
prettily and though her face was white
she gazed at me with confidence that
put heart into my rather shaky job

  we made the beach all right though
everybody got a good wetting for the
boat was half full of water and pretty
badly stove up the king and i car-
ried the schoolmaams ashore from the

stranded boat it was hard work i
was nearly knocked off my pins several
times by the rollers but it was worth
something to see in the starlight miss
peck struggling in the naked arms of
taumatoa her great mass of brown
hair straggling over her lace and her
wet skirt flopping she acted as though
it was the first time she had ever had
a mans arms about her and perhaps
it was

  you may be sure that i didnt let the
kanaka carry angela but bore her
ashore myself and in no great hurry
for the precious feel of her sweet form
in my tightly circling embrace was
worth being shipwrecked for

  when all the schoolmaams were
shivering on the beach-for tcopic
nights are chilly particularly to folks
that have been sloshed about in the surf
-the king and i hunted about in the
darkness and gathered drift enough to
make a big blazing fire on the coral
near the edge of the palm grove it was
lucky for us that the water hadnt pen-
etrated my match-box

  while the girls were drying out the
chief and i looked to the boat sad
to say there was a big hole in the bow
where she had hammered the reel and
as she was built of compressed steel
there would be no possible way for us
to repair her we pulled her up as far
as we could and got the stores ashore
this was no boys play as the goods
being wet were heavy bv the time we
had landed the edibles and the water-
cask and i had brought the canvas and
had spread it before the camp-fire to
dry i was nearly caved in but after
a few minutes rest i pulled myself
together and got out some tinned beef
and wet crackers

  on these we made a fairish supper
after which miss peck who was very
devout offered thanks to the deity for
our deliverance in what i thought were
rather familiar terms i suppose she
was the one to do the praying as her
voice would go farther than any of the
rest but she rather spoiled the prayer
by turning immediately from the
schoolmaam island



 amen  to scold miss binney for
opening a tin of cakes snatching them
from her hand and saying with new
england frugality

   we must reserve these until we
know where the next are coming
from

   after that the king and i went forth
to survey the island the stars shone
clear and the luminous coral helped
our view of things it was then that i
saw the lagoon spread out before me
three hundred feet back of our camp
and about the same distance from the
grove into the dark recesses of which
the light of the camp-fire was stream-
ing

   it was as i had feared a very small
island only a little horseshoe atoll
probably devoid of any human life save
what we had brought to it from a
central dune that stood like an inverted
teacup we could look all about the
band of low-lying coco-plumed land
that enclosed the dark lagoon and out
upon the naked sullen expanse of the
pacific

   lit bit o island remarked the
king sadlv  me dont know him at
all -

   but him solid ground said i
cheerfully  and thats something

   sure said the king  betterll
ole iron canoe like that one suppose
he no broke we get away to-molla

    let it go at that said i starting
back to camp for i suddenly remem-
bered that the girls might be afraid

  t found them all lying on the sand
under the still steaming canvas and
knowing that their damp bedcovering
would get cold unless the fire were kept
going i directed taumatoa to go and
fetch more wood the king of ala-
maka was not used to being ordered
about like a servant and i could see
that he did my bidding unwillingly
the way he threw down the wood
when he brought it up from the beach
showed that i was going to find him an
unruly servant though servant he must
be he still had his thirst with him
and it was hard to keep him away from

the water-cask but this i did with
angry words and fierce looks

  after a while he stretched his big
brown bulk by the fireside and was
soon snoring rhythmically in which
sluggish pastime he was joined by miss
peck who heroically lay on the outside
of the canvas-covered bed farthest
from the fire to this strange duet
accompanied by the moaning of the
surf i tuned my thoughts as i kept
guard by the cheery blaze throwing on
a dry stick now and then and feeling
mighty thankful that we were all alive
and in as good shape as we were

  another thing i was thankful for
was the feel of the automatic pistol in
my pocket among the islands i al-
ways carried this useful weapon and
it had served me well in intimidating a
native or two who had coveted our
copra or tried to walk off with trade-
trifles as a matter of fact there
seemed little likelihood of the island
being inhabited but just the same that
gun was a comfort to me

  then too there were other solacing
thoughts to be sure we were cast-
aways upon this island and might not
be able to get off for some time but
really i was not as sorry for that as i
might have been had angela been on
her way to manila and i left there
alone with no hope ol ever seeing her
sweet face again moreover the ad-
venture had been the means of break-
ing her silence and of her showing a
new and sympathetic regard for me
there had been little opportunity in
the boat for any interchange of senti-
ment but doubtless there would be
plenty of it on the island

  the only word she had with meafter
getting ashore was about wallace lit-
tle what did i think about his prob-
able escape from the sinking steamer

  again i had to reassure her as to
the undoubted safety of the school-
master though i was not so sure of it
myself meantime i had moments
when i was pleased to think that it was
myself and not little who was there
with her on that lone atoll- and so


the cavauer

 selfish is human nature that there were
 times during that long night of watch-
 ing when i was glad as long as the
 shipwreck had to come oft that the
 voyage had not proceeded and that i
 was with her on the island

   but when i looked at the row of
 womens heads that in the firelight
 showed indistinctly from under the
 canvas i felt such an awed and fearful
 sense of responsibility as  had never
 had before nine women on my hands
 and a brown islander who would be
 sure to be making trouble was ever
 a man more weighted down with the
 heavy duties of wardship

   xo wonder that i took so little ac-
 count of what might have happened to
 the other passengers and the ships
 company afloat in open boats upon the
 merciless sea when i did think of
 v them it was to take it for granted that
 all had made land somewhere or would
 do so before they suffered any great
 hardship

   once i wondered if the captain of
 the loyalty had stuck to his ship and
 gone down with her but that sort of
 thing had always seemed such a gratui-
 tous act of heroism that i wasted little
 speculation upon him i took some wet
 cigars from my coat-pocket and dried
 them before the fire when i lighted
 one of them it tasted a little salt and
 burned badly but it was better than no
 tobacco at all to a smoker like myself

   as the ghostly plumes of the coco-
 nut-trees began to glimmer in the early
 dawn i awakened the king and bade
 him search about for water this he
 did with alacrity and i went again to
 the top of the little sand-dune summit
 which proved to be not more than ten
 or twelve feet above the ocean level
 from here i gazed ufon an empty sea
 and at the insignificant ribbon of coral
 upon which i stood

   the island seemed to be about two
 miles long by a mile and a half wide
 including the inner water the strip
 of land enclosed the lagoon save at the
 lar end where a winding creek ran out
 to sea and this strip must have been

only about twelve hundred feet wide
at high tide though it was now much
wider for the tide was low and the
lagoon shallow alongshore a bitter
smile came to my lips when i caught
sight of that far-off inlet for i knew
that if i had found it the night before
our long-boat would now have been in
good trim and ready for use in case
we should decide to leave the island

  the sun rose a little higher out of
the eastern sea and the palms and pan-
danus with their long green leaves
beamed upon me like old friends i
was used to the sight of them and
they gave me hope though  could have
wished that they had waved above a
more pretentious stretch of land-one
that afforded for one thing a little
better chance for water

  as my eye again roved over the in-
hospitable atoll it caught sight of some-
thing down near the mouth of the la-
goon-the indistinct outline of the hull
of a small wrecked vessel of some sort
well-heeled over and nearly covered by
the sand there could have been barely
anything more than the ribs of this old
craft left there and the sight was a
dismal one but somehow  took cheer
of it for it was a sign that there once
had been human beings upon the island

  if sailormen had once come there
they might come again but this hope
was as uncertain as the crazy flight of
the sea-birds that circled about the bare
bones of the ship and lent to them such
an air of being forever deserted of men
that my mind soon took on a gloomier
strain and yet methought it might
be worth while to pay a visit to that
ancient wreck a little later

  girlish voices came to my ears and
turning i saw the schoolmaams troop-
ing down to the lagoon they looked
a little bedraggled after their hard
days work and their nignt in the open
but they had their spirits with them
for now and then a laugh rang out and
a cry of delight over some new dis-
covery they were making for a brush-
screened cove where a little later i
could hear them splashing in the still



j
schoolmaam island



water by and by they all filed back to
camp as lively as ever

  i caught a glimpse of taumatoa
away down the lagoon shore poking
about among the palms in what  easily
could have guessed was his vain search
for water still if any one could have
found it it would have been a kanaka

chapter iv

we make discoveries

-ood morning mr sibley i
 turned and miss pecks eye-
glasses glimmered before me she was
looking as severely prim as ever but
the wave had gone out of her heavy
brown hair

   i saluted her politely

   what a very small island  she ex-
plained looking at me in an accusing
way as if i should have landed her
upon a larger one

 it is small i admitted ignobly

   do you think it would support us
in the event of an extended residence
 pon it  

   oh yes  i declared offhandedly
i was bound to be optimistic as the
girls were now coming up the dune
angela among them they looked re-
markably fresh and clean after their
mornings ablutions and they certainly
made a fine showing considering the
fact that none of them had been able to
bring from the lost steamer anything
more than a small satchel or bundle so
loaded down the boat had been with its
human freight and provisions

  i never saw angelas eyes look bright-
er than when she gave me her  good
morning but i had no chapce to devote
myself to her as the girls all crowded
about with their questions they took
it for granted that i knew everything
about tropic islands and their volley of
inquiries was rather confusing

  what island was it to what group
did it belong how far was it to a
central station  what were our
chances of getting there and how long
might it be before we could leave

   ladies i said removing my cap
and feeling very much like a lecturer
addressing a teachers institute  in re-
ply to your first question i would say
that tliis little atoll upon which we
are standing is schoolmaam island
the girls looked at each other some
with pleased and others with piqued
expressions

   for many years i resumed  it
evidently has remained an anonymous
negligible dot of land but at present
it boasts a population of eleven if i
mistake not it lies in southern micro-
nesia a little below the equator these
atolls are very interesting and many
of the larger ones are inhabited they
consist like this one of strips of coral
reef from a few rods to thirty miles
in length encircling lagoons and cov-
ered by bright-green vegetation

   but perhaps i am only repeating
what you have already learned in your
normal-school studies i added apolo-
getically  and breakfast is more im-
portant anyway

   pray proceed mr sibley said
miss peck  the information about
atolls given by geographical text-books
is as i recall it very meager and in-
adequate and being familiar with the
south seas you are doubtless able to
tell us much that we should know
about it

  i saw that at last i had struck upon
something that was in her line and that
made her view me with a more tolerant
eye so i went on to tell what i knew
of such places dropping the lecturers
strain however as it was a little too
much for my limited speechmaking
powers i told them that the atolls
were the  tiny deserts of the pacific
with little elevation above the sea and
that the rainfall was very light upon
them

   then springs must be scarce here
remarked miss peck  do you think
that we shall lack for water 

   it is hard to say i replied  per-
haps we shall have to rely upon coco-
nut milk

   coconut milk is verv nice said


the cavalier

ruth deming  i think wc could get

along very well on it

    maybe i could get used to it said
miss binney the hysterical girl of the
day before miss binney had what
may be called the shoulder habit as she
would thrust one or both of her shoul-
ders forward whenever she said any-
thing she wished to accentuate

   i have been looking at the nuts
observed miss peck  and i must say
that they are insignificant in size
they arent half as large as those one
sees in the boston markets again
she looked at me with her accusing air
as if to make me feel my sense of re-
sponsibility for the smallness of the
coconuts on schoolmaam island

   i wish the boston markets were a
little handier said i with a tinge of
irony  but as they happen to be about
eight thousand miles away well have
to refrain from patronizing them

  some of the girls laughed but miss
binney lifted her shoulders again and
miss peck frowned clearly they did
not appreciate my way of disposing of
their objections so i assumed a more
serious air and tried to reply to some
of the questions that had been fired at
me from the teachers institute

  it soon became clear to them that i
had almost as vague an idea as to the
location of the island its proximity to
a civilized center or our likelihood of
leaving it at an early date as any of
them but i was optimism itself as to
our prospects

   there should be plenty of fish in
that lagoon i said  as well as crabs
and turtles and the grove will do the
rest after the provisions give out
though the coconuts are not such as are
found in boston

  the girls laughed again nearly all
of them were inclined to make the best
of the situation and were looking
about the beach and off to sea thinking
they saw islands and sails when they
didnt t had to answer a lot more
questions straining the truth at times
but the glamour and stage business that
i threw around the island together

w ith the fresh morning air and the fun
of preparing breakfast kept them in
fine spirits to be sure taumatoas
report that there was no fresh water
to be found was a little disconcerting
butl had forestalled that besides i
had a secret hope that it might rain in
which event we might catch some water
in the canvas

  after a breakfast of tinned meat and
sea-biscuit we all went over and ex-
plored the grove in w hich i was care-
ful to explain there couldnt be any
sign of animal life-they were des-
perately afraid of snakes and gorillas
-and then i saw that miss peck had
been right in her observations about the
size of the coconuts and the pandanus
or screw-pines upon which the island-
ers often rely for food were scraggly
a whole tree yielding but a few kernels

  as to subsistence the outlook was
not very encouraging while tauma-
toa lay in the shade and gave no heed
to my calls for his assistance i rigged
up the canvas to serve the double pur-
pose of shade and rain-catcher if any
showers should come along

   its too bad we cant use a piece of
that canvas for a flag i remarked
 but its rather heavy for that purpose
and it w ill serve us better as a reser-
voir

   a flag   echoed angela

   yes-a signal for passing ships
  oh

  she stood with thoughtful brow for
a moment and then went over and
whispered to the girls who were
grouped about the boat in a fewr min-
utes they all disappeared into the grove
while i was standing on the mound
gazing far away upon the insolent blue
of the sea they all came out from
among the underwood angela at their
head bearing something white in her
hand she brought the object over and
handed it to me her face slightly
flushed and her eyes averted a little

   heres your flag she said quietly
 we didnt have very strong thread to
sew it with but t think it will hold to-
gether for a while
    thank you i replied  just the
thing ill hoist it over this mound
i hunted about and found a long drift-
pole to which i attached the white flag
and soon it was flying over the mound
in the light breeze

   out of the tail of my eye i caught
proud looks from the schoolmaams as
the banner was spread out in the wind
but when i faced about at them they
were all looking steadily over at the
lagoon

  the day was fair and the sea lay
about the island like a slab of indigo
the tide had receded leaving the boat
lying on her side on the wet sand i
went down to her and looked her over
carefully there were two large holes
near her bow where the reef had
broken through her thin steel shell
and she was badly dished-in along the
middle these dishings might be
straightened out but as to repairing
the holes that job was certainly be-
beyond me with my primitive facilities

   but though i despaired of being able
to set to sea in the boat i determined
to keep her unseaworthy as she was
and so summoned all hands to drag her
up the beach to a safe position the
king did not come at my call as he was
still asleep under his palm-tree but the
schoolmaams heaved away on the
painter and at the sides while dorothy
shaw and i shoved at the stern the
way dorothy laid her shoulder against
that boat and braced to her task was
good to see she certainly must have
done more than any two of the other
girls soon we had the little craft safe
from the clutches of the sea i cleaned
her out and propped her up with lumps
of coral leaving her rent bow high
that in the event of rain she might
serve as a cistern under the canvas

   the rest of that first morning was
spent along the lagoon which proved
an enchanting place to the girls as
the tide was at low ebb the sandy
beach of the lagoon about two hun-
dred feet broad curved along the inner
shore gently slanting to the deeps with
only a few inches depth of water

am island	

  i saw angela wading with bare feet
and picking up shells she seemed to
delight in this game and i heard her
and her friend ruth deming felicita-
ting each other upon their island ad-
venture

   here we school-teachers re-
marked ruth  have been telling the
boys and girls about coral islands and
tropical scenes without really knowing
anything about them and now we shall
be able to go back and give the results
of our first-hand knowledge isnt it
lovely 

   it would be if our relations
wouldnt fret about us said angela
 i worried a little last night i was
afraid of that old king

  tomato oh hes harmless
enough replied ruth  he isnt a
cannibal hes thoroughly missionary-
ized whats that youve found 

  angela held up a reddish-looking
shell and then stooped and picked up
another

    arent they beautiful  exclaimed
ruth  lets ask mr sibley what
they are

  angela turned to me all her for-
mer restraint seemed to have flown
when she held up the shells for me to
examine

  a lucky find miss alvarado i
cried  these are true orange cow-
ries worth fifty dollars a pair

  are they she asked exultingly
 lets look for more

  i took off my shoes and stockings
and was soon wading about with the
two girls the others remaining at some
distance most of them standing upon
the shore chatting among themselves
after a while dorothy came out to see
what we were doing and presently
she and ruth went back to join the
others but angela remained with me

  i suppose that we should have gone
back with them but to me it was so
delicious being there alone with her
that i lost for the time mv point of
view as guardian of the bunch i told
angela where to look for the shells in
the little hollows of the sandy bottom


the cavalier

and within a half-hour or so she and
i had gathered a dozen large cowries
between us we took our treasures up
to the beach to hide them in the highest
reach of the wet sand and then it was
that she observed that we had wan-
dered away from the others and had
traversed half of the curve of the
lagoon

  we splashed campward through the
shallows red and gold fish darted
away from us and polyp anemones
that haddrifted in from thedeepsof the
aqueous garden of the lagoon showed
their opalescent hues to the morning
sun

  what a lovely place she cried
looking across the water to the curling
smoke of the camp-fire  and what
an adventure i never thought i should
be cast away on a tropic island

   nor i either

  l looked down at her bare pink feet
as they daintily trod the sand then i
looked into her dark eyes and said
with a sigh  it is lovely as yon say
but wouldnt it be lovelier if instead of
having eight school-teachers and old
tomato-as you girls call him-along
with us there were just you and i 

   youre always saying and doing
such things she cried while a little
flush overspread her face

   then the others are not de tropf 

   certainly not

  and i think she would have read me
a lecture or lapsed into one of her fits
of asterisks but just then her eye
caught something in the bushes near
the beach

   is that just a mound of sand she
asked  or is it something else 

  i looked to where she pointed and
then walked toward the place with
closely scanning eyes

   its a mound all right said i
 and its something more its a coral
cabin

   what a discovery  cried angela
coming over to where i stood looking
fixedly at the little structure  do you
suppose people have lived here 

   doubtless i replied

   but where arc they now and what
were they-black brown or white 

   qitien sabe looks as if white
men had built it heres the doorway
but its nearly blocked up with sand

  i knelt upon the high-heaped sand
before the oblong rift in the white coral
wall and looked in the interior which
was about fourteen feet square was
empty the only occupant being a land-
crab which scuttled into a crevice

   when do you suppose the place
was occupied   she asked kneeling be-
side me and looking into the dark in-
terior

   it must have been years ago for
the wind has drifted the sand high
about it

  the misleading word  wind  rose
to my lips without hesitation but as a
matter  fact there had come to me
in a flash the ugly conviction that the
inhabitants of this cabin whether
white or black had been drowned out
by a high sea that had swept over the
low-lying island-as it might sweep
again at any time-and washed the
sand into this rude dwelling

  as i now crawled in on all fours
and examined the dark interior ny
thoughts were all this flood and what
a similar one which might come at an
hours notice would mean to us

  while groping about in the half-
darkness of the windowless cabin my
hand struck something hard lying upon
the coral floor in a place where there
was little or no sand i saw that it was
the rusty head of an ax this i seized
and tossed out to angela

  theres a treasure i exclaimed
jubilantly

   oh   she cried disappointed  i
thought you had found a bag of gold

   theres no gold or anything else in
here im afraid said i  yes heres
a little old iron kettle but its so
cracked and rusted it will be of no use
to us

  i rolled the kettle out of the cabin
and then scratched about in the sand
with a sharp shell

   looks as if there wasnt much of
schoolmaam island



anything left in here to discover i
said and then stopped short and
breathed hard for as i spoke i scooped
np a few shellsful of sand and in the
hollow i had made i saw a gray water-
worn skull this i dug out with hur-
ried hands and keeping it between me
and the doorway so that angela might
not see it i studied it carefully

  it was not the skull of a native-i
could have told one of those anywhere
by its bulging base and its cheekbones
-but that of a white man some poor
devil who probably years before had
been caught by the sea in his imprison-
ing hut and drowned for i doubted
not that the rest of his bones lay there
under the sand perhaps they had been
sloshed about by the trespassing waves
time and time again

   what is it  cried angela  why
are you so quiet in there have you
found something 

   nothing worth while i replied
truthfully  ah here is something 
in the little hollow where the skull
had lain was an odd-looking metal-
rimmed object which i picked up and
carried outside after covering the skull
with sand

  what a strange-looking thing
she cried as i handed it to her  it isnt
a shell-what is it it looks like a
piece of heavy glass that had been
ground by sand and water this rim is
all corroded and green

   brass i said not knowing exactly
how much i should reveal to her
 this is the plate-glass eye of a divers
helmet and that green rim is its socket
the rubber helmet has rotted away

   then divers have occupied the
cabin   she exclaimed  how inter-
esting do you suppose they came in
that old wrecked vessel that lies down
there  

   perhaps i replied
  w but what were they diving for 
   pearls

   pearls in the lagoon 

    yes there may have been a good
many  gems of purest ray serene  in
there and perhaps those sailormen of

    	c

the wreck got them up in which
case- i paused for  didnt know
just how far i ought to go with my
conjectures

  in which case she repeated
looking at me with eyes that would
have drawn confidences out of the la-
goon itself

    why if they got up the pearls they
must be somewhere on the island  but
it could hardly be that they would keep
them in the cabin and so far as the
divers story is concerned i cant make
any use of the cabin at all but they
may not have built it or if they did
build it they may have left a watch-
man here while they made voyages to
the home port and back again

 how very interesting  she cried
with flushed face gazing down at the
wreck and then back at the white cabin
 yes i agreed  too interesting
 what do you mean mr sibley 
she asked in pretty bewilderment

    i mean that for the present it wont
do to let the others know what we have
found if we told them it might get
around to the chief

   come mr sibley said angela
with a sudden show of anxiety  lets
get back to camp we have been too
long away from the others miss peck
will read me one of her lectures

  we put on our shoes which we had
carried with us i picked up the ax and
we walked briskly away it was a hot
hike over the dry white coral upon
which the sun blazed down pitilessly
angela looked warm and a bit drooped
i felt a little guilty for having left the
other women so long for there was no
counting upon taumatoa

  but on the way back another thought
kept oppressing me that washed-out
cabin and the grisly remains of its in-
habitant at what period of the his-
tory of the island had the sea poured
its relentless flood into and over it
scanning the lagoon shore sharply i
noticed more particularly a natural
feature of the landscape that had
claimed only a casual glance before
this was a long dry depression in the
the cavalier



bare surface of the land a shallow
swale running northward from the la-
goon toward the sea not far from the
mound from which my first observa-
tions had been made

  we went back to camp by way of
this swale and on searching the ground
carefully  became convinced that it
had once been a channel through which
the flood had poured across the band of
coral into the lagoon but that the
trespassing sea had not confined itself
to this channel was evident from the
fact that the flooded cabin was at least
three hundred feet out of its path and
on the higher ground

  had the whole island been inun-
dated 

  i became convinced that it had and
the thought you may be sure weighed
upon me and it was to weigh still
more heavily as the days went by

chapter v

the white mans burden

when we reached the camp at the
edge of the grove we saw the
schoolmaams sitting in line on a drift-
log under the shading palms the chief
was squatted on the ground before
them like an arabian story-teller in-
deed he was regaling his fair hearers
with yarns about the island judging
by their faces i should say his stories
were probably safe enough but i
determined that this sort of thing
shouldnt happen again for i knew
that the old fellow was not to be trust-
ed with women evidently he had
made a hit with the school - teachers
particularly with miss peck in whose
eyes there was a rapt fervent look as
she gazed at his dark face with its
show of gleaming white teeth

  just to think she remarked to
angela with a romantic sigh  the
kings father was a real live cannibal
and once actually helped to eat three
white sailors isnt that interesting 
so interesting came the girlish
chorus

   not only interesting declared
angela with a little shiver but horri-
ble supposing tomato should get
tired of fish and coconuts and-

   oh but that was a long time ago
interrupted miss peck  he says they
never eat human flesh nowadays and
besides he is a christianized south
sea gentleman and a real monarch
miss pecks confidence in taumatoa
had its humorous side but i did not
smile there was a lot to do in camp
and while i busied myself overhauling
the things and hinting now and then
that the kanaka come and help me
which he failed to do i made up my
mind that if he was to be kept in his
proper place the romantic notions en-
tertained about him by most of the fair
pedagogues must be nipped in the bud
so i took up the white mans burden
and remarked lightly as i threw the
ax down before the chief

   here tom take that ax sharpen
it up put a handle in it and go cut
some wood you have helped mighty
little this morning

  the chief looked at me very surlily
and resentfully for even a kanaka
hates to be obliged to drop his role of
hero there was a sullen look in his
eye as he asked

   where you get ax 

   never mind where i get ax i re-
plied severely  you go chop wood
protesting looks from the school-
maams and little flutters of sympa-
thetic indignation which i feared had
their effect upon the black at any
rate they lent him an air

   mr sibley began miss peck in
the tone of a woman whose sensibilities
had received a shock dont you think
that a king deserves-

   i think that this king deserves
whats coming to a lazy kanaka i
broke in ungallantly  who has put in
a whole morning impressing a number
of susceptible ladies with idle talk
about the noble deeds of himself and
his ancestors he was asleep while we
pulled up the boat and did all that other
work i intend that hereafter he shall
schoolma

do his share of whatever labor there is
to perform

   to be sure lies a real monarch
when hes at home amid his hundred
and eighty - odd subjects on his little
turtle-back island but if i had him
back in california id set him to white-
washing the garden fence here to-
mato i said  take this ax and chop
wood theres plenty of logs down on
the beach get busy

  taumatoa straightened himself up
like a perfectly good imitation of a
monarch and folded his arms evi-
dently he didnt cotton to the idea of
coming down from his high horse be-
fore all those sympathetic women he
saw their protesting looks at me and
he made the most of them pie gath-
ered that ladies didnt like workmen
and that he of all persons should not
be made to labor

   me king he declared cockily
 me  work

   let him have his luncheon sug-
gested ruth deming  were just
going to prepare it

   and its so hot now suggested
another girl  let him chop the wood
this evening when it gets cooler

   but hes used to hot weather i
declared rather abruptly and as for
his lunch let him earn it for i was
bent upon my point which was the im-
mediate subjection of the kanaka

   king no work he repeated
haughtily then he stretched himself
luxuriously in the shade

   noblesse obligei quoted iron-
ically  the king will work when he
has to and thats right now

  too much hot  he yawned taking
his cue from his fair champions and
pillowing his head upon his arm

  look here mr king i cried
 youll have to come in for your share
of the chores you must do as i say
i dont want you loafing about camp so
much youve got to get in and hustle
-understand go down on the beach
you rascal i commanded  and get
busy with that ax

there was another glance of rebel-

am island	

lion in taumatoas big brown orbs but
in the game of eyes the white man can
play the lion-tamer with a south sea
savage when its only one to one

  all ri he breathed forth at
length submissively  me chop wood

  there were little shrugs of disap-
proval among the school - teachers as
they turned to the task of getting
luncheon but i saw by a certain look
about angelas mouth that she rather
enjoyed my mastery of the kanaka

  dorothy too seemed to understand
the point i had been trying to make
of this mastery however i was none
too sure the chief was not much
used to labor and i knew he would
find the tasks i should be setting for
him very irksome his revolt would
be only a matter of time what i need-
ed was the moral support of my femi-
nine charges - for they were my
charges and they filled me with a con-
stant and at times an irritating sense
of responsibility nine guileless white
women to guard and protect upon a
lonely desert islet ah if but one of
them were a man or if they were all
like dorothy shaw

  although tom as i generally called
him after that was a long time putting
a handle into his ax and then swung
it but listlessly the occasional hack or
thud upon the dry driit-logs let me
know where he was and that he was
out of mischief for the time which
was some comfort

  i improved this opportunity to go
over the food and water supply and
see what we had  hand i found
two cases of corned beef each con-
taining two dozen cans and three and
a half cases of sea-biscuits or about
one hundred pounds a large wedge of
cheese a bag of walnuts say ten-
pounds three dozen tins of ready-
cooked pork and beans and a dozen
tins of baking-powder for nine
healthy women and two strong hearty
men there was not food enough for
three weeks if we depended wholly
upon it which of course was out of
the question




the cavalier

   what can we do with baking-pow-
der  asked miss peck holding up a
can  theres no hour to mix it with

i wonder what it was put into the boat
for she shot one of her glances
at me

   probably to raise our spirits
laughed dorothy shaw who generally
as the bright side of a situation

   the baking-powder was put in by
mistake i said to miss peck  they
dont make a carefully prepared
schedule of boat supplies on sinking
steamers

  i gaged the cask anti found that it
contained about twelve gallons of
water the girls helped me to remove
it to the shade of some young palms at
the edge of the grove here again
miss shaw proved the value of her ath-
letic training i verily believe she was
almost equal to me in physical power
we buried the cask in the sand that it
might be kept cool i cautioned them
against wasting it and fixed the daily
share at a half-pint apiece

   that is a very limited allowance
declared miss peck

   why we shall all choke to death if
we dont have any more than that
complained miss binney underscoring
her words with a movement of her
shoulders and looking at me reprov-
ingly  this salt air makes me thirsty
all the time

   you wont choke as long as those
coconut-trees are here miss binney
said i  and we may have a shower
before long

   i trust we may sniffed the young
lady what is that - canned beef
im not fond of canned beef

  if you dont like it suggested
angela with a meaning smile just
run down to the corner and order a
prime rib roast

  miss binney turned away disgusted-
ly angelas dig pleased me and i was
glad to see she could make light of our
sorry situation as the one upon whose
shoulders rested the care of all these
innocent women i was secretly taking
that situation very much to heart

and i took it still more to heart when
after making my inventory ol the
boats stores  went alone into the
grove to estimate carefully the prob-
able food supply it would yield for us

  it had been disappointing at first
sight and as  now went from tree to
tree scanning the high-hanging nuts in
their brown husks  saw that little re-
liance could be placed upon the crop
a good-sized coconut-tree in a rainy
country will feed a man but the
trouble was that schoolmaam island
was as you might say newly built by
the patient millepora and though there
were plenty of trees the nuts were
neither many nor large as for the
sap it is true as w ise naturalists have
held that life can be supported by it
but i have heard of native tribes living
upon small atolls that have resorted to
it when the nut crop was short and
some of them have starved

  this may have been on account of
too great a population it was impos-
sible for me to estimate how long nine
women and two men might survive
upon the visible food supply in that
grove the pandanus-trees were dis-
appointing too on close observation
most of them proved to be fruitless
one thing was quite evident-we must
go fishing

  i got some safety-pins from the
girls and of these i fashioned hooks
out of some strands unraveled from
the canvas we twisted a few strong
lines i baited the hooks with min-
nows caught in the shallows and with
the grudging help of tom i managed
to hook about a dozen fish out of the
lagoon they were all strange to the
teachers but the king pronounced them
edible we tried to land a big turtle
that was swimming about among the
seaweed but he got away though at
one time tom might easily have cap-
tured him had it not been for his lag-
gard indifference to the task

   but there was still other work to do
before sundown it did not seem right
that the girls should sleep out in the
open when housemaking was so easy
schoolmaam island



on the island so i pressed tom into
the service of pole-cutting and in the
mean time i hacked oft a lot of
branches with my hunting-knife w itli
these we fashioned a snug shack
thatched over with coconut-plumes and
carpeted with matting made of the
leaves and fiber which tom showed
tiie schoolmaams how to weave

  what a delightful shelter cried
angela when it was finished  it s
like an indian teepee only more
roomy

   lets get all our things together in
here suggested dorothy

   theres not much to get said an-
gela cheerfully  but im glad of a
place to store my violin the night
dew doesnt do the strings any good

  the treasured violin was the first of
their possessions to go into the shack
and after our supper of roast fish
and sea - biscuit i heard the violinist
tuning up

   play that  humoresque  re-
quested dorolhv  its the sweetest
thing in the world

  so while some of us sat by the fire-
side near the shack angela to keep the
dew off the violin remained inside and
sent the sketchy little phrases of the
 humoresque  vibrating among the
palms her playing put heart into the
castaway women some of whom had
been pulling rather long faces as the
twilight gathered over the island i
saw that the violin was going to be a
great comfort to all of us and you may
be sure that no one listened more raptly
than the ardent trader who was dead in
love with the player

  but through it all i kept reverting
to my discovery of the flooding of the
island wondering how recent it was
and hoping that some sort of craft
might come along and take us away
before the next great storm should
break upon the shore even after the
music ceased and the schoolmaams
had gone to sleep for the night in the
shack after much chatter over the nov-
elty of their bedchamber i sat by the
fire smoking one of my precious cigars

-they were becoming very few now-
and thinking with what devastating
force a tidal sea backed by a hur-
ricane might sweep over that little dot
of land

chapter vi

searching for the pearls

tmid these dismal reflections would
come now and then a thought of
the wrecked pearl-hunters and of the
treasure they probably had left some-
where upon the island but the more
tragic possibility of the inundation of
the island was the one that claimed
most of my thoughts tom slept
soundly beside the lire which i kept
going during my almost sleepless vigil
through the long clear night of stars
and chilly moving airs

  after breakfast next morning as i
saw that serious inroads were being
made upon the water i directed the
kanaka to procure some palm sap he
set about this task with better grace
than he had been showing for his other
work for despite his covert attacks
upon the water-i knew lie had been
dipping into it whenever our backs
were turned-his thirst was still with
him

  he took one of the large coconut
shells and cut it in half with the
point of a knife that he constantly
wore in his belt he drilled two holes in
the upper edge of one of these halves
and tied into them a bit of twine the
girls watched his movements interest-
edly and when he walked over to one
of the smaller trees they followed him
without a word with the shell dan-
glirrg from the string which he held in
his teeth he climbed the tree until he
reached a clump of flower-stalks these
he cut off with his knife and as they
fell to the ground the girls picked them
up smelled of them and then looked
curiously up at the kanaka while he
fastened the shell below the pruned
flower-stems instantly the sap began
to drip from the stems into the shell in


the cavalier

pearl-like drops tom descended and
said to the watching women who could
see the liquid drip into the little vessel
 catch um sap all ri 

  how interesting  cried angela
turning to me  this sap caught in
shells tied up that way will supply us
with drink

   that is if we can drink it ob-
served miss binney

   why said the dearest of girls
sweetly  well simply have to be-
sides it may prove to be nectar

  that is one thing among hundreds
of others that i liked about angela-
she was never the least querulous or
exacting in dealing with the hardships
of our situation

   palm sap hasnt a bad taste i re-
marked  when you get used to it and
when it is fresh it is healthful and nu-
tritive now if you girls will gather
a lot of the largest shells you can find
and what tin cans you can spare tom
and i will rig up a lot of sap-con-
tainers

   all right responded dorothy
 come on girls  and they trooped
oft to the grove to get the shells

  i knew that there would be no end
of work involved in this sap business
as we should have to be shinning up
those trees pretty often to empty the
shells if we were to keep up any sort
of a supply but i intended to make
tom do most of that work like all
his people he was an agile climber and
i felt that he must be kept busy the
sap soon begins to ferment in the tropic
heat which was another reason why
the shells would have to be emptied
quickly and there was still another
if the contents of the vessels were al-
lowed to stand and proceed to the tod-
dy stage i should have a besotted na-
tive on my hands-and with all those
women yes he must be kept busy

  as soon as the shell-rigging was
over i made him help me assort the
stores and fix up a camp kitchen among
the palms between the shack and the
place to which we had dragged the boat
we took a large packing-case which



had contained most of the stuff and
in this we tacked some partitions made
out of pieces of another box using
nails which we-drew from the lids
we nailed the box to a tree and it made
a handy cupboard which the delighted
girls at once named  tris fragile
from the warning sign stenciled upon
it by some far-away frenchman who
little dreamed that it would ever serve
as a cupboard upon a south sea island

  the girls helped me put together a
rough table the top of which was made
of a couple of sea-worn drift-planks
from the beach alongside this table
and at the two ends i made stationary
pole-seat benches the legs of which
were stakes driven into the ground
we all sat down about the table miss
peck at one end and i at the other
the girls made merry by drawing bam-
boo sticks to see which four should sit
regularly at one side and which at the
other

  remember this arrangement
doesnt hold for more than a week at
a time said dorothy when the sides
were chosen

   why who expects to stay on this
island more than a week  asked an-
gela with an optimistic smile

  we all looked out upon the empty
sea when she said this as we were do-
ing half the time in anticipation of
sighting a sail

   oh we may be sitting at this very
table a year from now observed miss
binney dismally  what frumps well
look  why our shirt-waists-

   fanny came ruths reproof
 why in the world cant you show the
proper spirit things might be worse
than they are and you know it ill
admit that a little cold-cream wouldnt
go badly but as for our sitting here in
these same shirt-waists a year from
now why its not in the least likely
is it mr sibley 

   not in the least replied the oracle
with as convincing a tone as he could
summon though himself far from con-
vinced

   why of course therell be a steam-
sciioolmaam island



er or a schooner or a brig or some
sort of a vessel coming here before long
to take us oft said miss peck nibbling
a bit of coconut and looking as though
she were sorry she couldn t remember
some other kind of craft that would
happen along

  every little while i went up to flag-
staff mound and made an eager sweep
of the sea and always my eye would
take in the distance-dimmed outlines
of the wrecked vessel lying near the
mouth of the lagoon i determined to
go down there and visit her that morn-
ing before the day should get too hot
so after the schoolmaams with many
a light joke and lighter laugh had
stowed the goods away in the cup-
board and i had rigged up for it a
swing door with canvas hinges i called
tom aside and told him of my pro-
posed jaunt

   all ri  he assented cheerfully
 you go down see ole rotten ship me
stop here and he glanced toward
the girls

   no i declared stoutly  youre
to come along with me i may need
your help if there are any pickings to
bring home

  he saw that i meant what i said
and so after a lingering glance at his
resting-place in the shade he came
dragging along at my heels with the
ax on my shoulder i turned to steal
a glance at angela who was standing
near the shack with the other girls
with an air that plainly bespoke a de-
sire to accompany me but she knew as
well as i that i couldnt be singling her
out on all occasions even though the
others must have come to understand
by this time the meaning of my devoted
attentions to her

  tom and i skirted the lagoon shore
and were soon frightening the long-
winged birds from their perches on the
rotting ribs of the old vessel she w-as
not a large craft and judging by her
outlines half obscured by the sand-
dri its she must have been a schooner
or a brig there was little of her hull
in sight as we approached her as she

was listed over toward usbut on going
around her stem i saw the green-
weathered copper sheathing of her bot-
tom half-way to her dismantled keel
the sheathing was partly covered by
a crust of dried barnacles and bird-
lime and was stove in here and there

   big sea hit him many time ob-
served tom as he twisted off a piece
of the sheet copper

  it was a fact and a very depressing
one to me for though at low tide the
wreck lay well ashore it was evident
that the little vessel had been washed
over many a time by the outside waters
it took but little imagination to see big
combers raking her fore and aft-such
waves i knew must have swept clean
over the island from east to west it
was a wonder to me that the ancient
craft had not been wholly disintegrated
long before we lay eyes upon her

  in vain i looked for something that
would give a clue to her identity but
of any sign of name either on bow or
stern there was nothing visible in-
deed there was hardly a whole plank
left in her in a little water-worn
channel that ran along her starboard
bow i found a piece of anchor-chain
red and flaked with rust and farther
aft i discovered a capstan-bar partly
embedded in the sand here and there
were corroded copper spikes and bits
of glass that might have come from
her broken ports ground dull by the
sea

  for the sake of keeping him busy
while i made a little closer examination
of the wreck  set tom tojvork with
the ax cutting off the cooper sheets
from that part of her bottom exposed
to view- then with a piece of oak
board which i had fashioned into the
shape of a spade i went around on the
other side and began to dig about here
and there in what was left of her hull
an hour of this work brought nothing
more important to sight than the rusty
barrel of an old musket and a few bits
of broken crockery

  the morning was a hot one and as
i was on the sunny side of the tilted


the

cavalier

bottom i had to pause more than once
to wipe the sweat out of my eyes most
of my delving was done in the place
where i judged the after-hold must
have been i plied my spade in the
sand crying out a sharp command now
and then to the lazy tom whenever the
sound of his ax ceased for a while its
deliberate pecking at the copper sheets

   in a little trench i dug along the in-
side of the hull my spade scraped upon
something that cracked under it and
the next moment i had exposed to view
a lot of bone-white objects which i
scratched out in excited haste breath-
ing hard-let me tell you-and with
my pulses all atingle i had found their
shell

  this discovery was important but
what i wanted to know was the extent
of it for in a way that would deter-
mine the amount of pearls they had
taken so i kept lengthening and wi-
dening my trench throwing the sand
behind me and hiding the shell i had
already uncovered in the course of
another hour i had pretty well settled
the fact that they had gotten aboard
about as big a tonnage of good clean
shell as i had ever seen in a vessel of
that size

  toms voice coming from around
the stern set me to scattering sand
and as i had kept the shell pretty well
covered as i worked along he saw none
of it when his eyes lighted upon me
where i sat hot and tired upon a de-
cayed timber looking off unconcerned-
ly over the lagoon

   too much hot work he com-
plained what you find in here
wee you make big hole 

   how about that copper  i flung
out testily  your job all done 

   got big pile copper he replied
evasively  hundred-dollar pile

  if men and tools had been available
there would have been little delay in
attacking that wreck and reducing it
to kindling-wood if necessary or in
digging out its old shell of a hulk and
finding the treasure but the removal
of the sand-heaps from the after part

of the hold probably would be the most
effective work of recovery there
were tons and tons of this sand and to
remove it was going to be a long and
hard task for one man with a wooden
spade

  after all would it not be wise to
enlist the services of tom as we
trudged wearily back to camp under the
fierce sun-blaze i considered this idea
carefully but could arrive at no con-
clusion he was known far and wide
among the traders as a treacherous
beast and whoever trusted him was
likely to rue it

        chapter vii
        the brass chest

hthe next day was sunday accord-
ing to a little calendar in ruths
pocket-diary and we all lay about in
the shade after a unique morning serv-
ice conducted by miss peck the day
of rest was good for me after sta-
tioning tom as lookout on flagstaff
mound i stretched out in the shade
and caught up a few of those lost hours
of sleep

  during my waking moments and
whenever i looked abroad upon the
island my mind kept running upon the
probability of the recurrence of the
terrible marine trespass by which it
now seemed to me every point of land
was marked

   again and again  wrestled with the
problem what should we do in the
event of the flooding of the atoll

  i promised myself that i would de-
vote all of the next day to devising
some means of escape from a high
rising tide but when the morning came
the sea lay so calm about the isle and
the lost treasure so fascinated me that
t could not resist the impulse to be on
my way to the wreck the girjs to
whom i had not imparted my discov-
er of the shell went half-way to the
creek with me i left them on the
lagoon beach hunting for cowries and
other interesting things in the shal-
sciioolmaam island



lows i set tom to fishing in the
creek and resumed my hunt for the
treasure

  in digging under the spot where
the chips galley must have been i
unearthed a dozen or more pieces ot
broken crockery plying my rude-
spade still farther i dug out a dented
copper saucepan and a rusty iron pot
these utensils which would be inval-
uable in our kitchen were laid aside
to be carried back to camp i knew
how the girls would appreciate them
and could hardly keep from hailing
them and crying out my discoveries
but deferred the bestowal of that pleas-
ure in the selfishness of my search for
the pearls

  thus far my digging had been like
that of a mining prospector the holes
had been dug at random here and
there i now concluded that if i were
to find anything i must confine myself
to that part of the wreck where the
after-cabin had been- so it was there
that i now set steadily to work

  it was a strange business this treas-
ure-hunt in the ancient wreck with the
curious sea-birds flitting about some-
times swooping so near that their
wings fanned my hot cheek the
lonely wash of the surf came to my
ears mingled now and then with the
far-away calls of the schoolmistresses
to each other from the shore of the
lagoon

  with the rude tool my work was
slow and difficult and spadeful after
spadeful of sand brought up nothing
more interesting than a broken bottle
an old door-lock a twisted hasp or a
bent bolt at last in the muck of rot-
ted wood and wet blackened sand i
struck something hard and stooping
dug out with my fingers a strange
dark object about a foot long it
looked like the sole of a shoe but it
was too heavy for that with my
knife i scraped off the outer surface
of the thing and then slivered off a
thin slice of metal that shone dully in
the sunlight

  at once i knew that it was a sole

after all-the lead bottom of a diving-
boot but though it was a further
indication of the particular kind of
work these ill-fated seafarers had
done in the lagoon it was not of the
least value to me yet it made my in-
terest in the search more feverish than
ever just then the lusty voice of
dorothy shaw called up from the
creek

   mr sibley mr sibley come
down and see 

   i wiped the sweat from my face and
went down to where the girls were
bending over some objects on the
shore of the creek

   what are these shells  asked
dorothy holding up a couple of large
mollusks which i instantly knew to be
pearl-oysters

   where did you get them i
asked curiously not heeding her ques-
tion in my eagerness to know where
they had come from

   the king brought them up from
the bottom of the lagoon right over
there she pointed to where the little
lake joined the sluggish creek moving
slowly out through its narrow channel
to the sea  we saw him bring them
up he took out all these but he
didnt want us to see them at first
what are the- 

   pearl-oysters i said for i did
not have it in me to return any other
answer to that frank honest-eyed
young woman then i glanced over
to where taumatoa standing up to
his shoulders in the clear water was
searching the bottom intently

   come here tom  i call to him
sharply

  he gave me one of his rebellious
stubborn looks then tossed his head
indifferently and waded ashore with
a laggard swing of his wet legs- in
his hands he held a dozen or more
pearl-oysters which he dropped upon
the sand with the others

   you were told to catch fish i
cried angrily  and have been fooling
away your time picking up these
worthless things


the cavalier

   no ketch uni fish to-day he re-
plied sullenly-  all gone way ketch

urn to-molla

   wry well if you cant catch fish
to-day you can chop wood go back
to camp and gel to work on that drift
pile

   maybe bimeby fish bite he sug-
gested lazily not relishing the wood-
cutting job

   go this minute i cried angrily

   it seems to me mr sibley in-
terjected miss peck  that the king-

   pardon me was my abrupt in-
terruption  but the king takes every
opportunity to shirk his little tasks-
the fish are there-you can see them
swimming about-and he could catch
them if he cared to failing in that
he must busy himself at the wood-pile
and i shall be obliged to you miss
peck if you dont encourage him in
his indolent wavs

                          

  miss pecks reply was a scornful
little sniff there were also resentful
looks on the faces of some of the other
schoolmaams clearly the king had
become a favorite with them-proba-
bly because he was an interesting nov-
elty i was sorry that they had not
had some of my experience with the
particular breed to which he belonged
then too his story-telling had im-
pressed them and was to impress them
still further as i was soon to discover

  the kanaka walked slowly away
toward camp miss peck and the others
following the principal was still in
her hiiflr anti i was not anxious to
accompany her yet i agreed to myself
that i would return to camp soon so
as to keep an eye on tom whose be-
havior toward the women hardly could
be relied upon but that old wreck
and the treasure that probably lay
hidden within it held me longer than t
should have stayed- an hour or more
passed during which the digging pro-
gressed slowly as t was tired and heat-
harassed

  i was now down to the bottom planks
of the side of the ship that lay upon
the beach and was scraping along aft

and chucking out an interesting lot of
ancient junk-rusty iron clews tnar-
linespikes battered gimbal lamps
pieces of an old-fashioned air-pump
musket - barrels metal snatch - blocks
and among these telling their own
tragic story human bones  regret
to say that my respect for these grisly
relics was not what it should have been
for in my greed for the treasure  flung
them out as carelessly as i did the
rest

  once i had a twinge of conscience
as i thought of angela and the other
innocent girls off in camp there with
that irresponsible kanaka indeed i
was about to climb out of the hole and
hasten to them when i gave one more
lunge with my spade and it grated
upon something that looked like the
top of some sort of a box

  in another moment after a wild
thrust with the spade i determined that
that was precisely what it was  flung
myself down upon my knees pulsing
all over with a fervent excitement
clearing away the remaining sand and
debris with my fingers soon an ob-
long piece of heavy brass green with
years about one foot wide and two in
length lay under my trembling hands
and i made no doubt that it was the
lid of a chest-the treasure-box of the
ship

  i seized my spade again and jabbed
it down into the sand alongside of the
chest seeking for the hasp or handle
by which it might be opened the
crude tool struck something hard and
a moment later i was lifting out a
human skull the only sign of those
who had lost their lives for the con-
tents of this little brass box there
were no other bones near at hand the
skull probably had been washed away
from the rest of the skeleton in the
general dissolution and jumbling up of
everything aboard but there it was
grinning up at me and somehow as i
laid it aside upon my pile of debris
 couldnt help taking it for a lucky
sign

  what i took to be proof of this was
                
schoolmaam island



the fact that at the side of the little
rounded hollow where the skull had
lain was the padlock that had secured
the lid this lock was of iron and
was so deeply corroded that it tumbled
before the attack of my spade my
shaking hands tried to pull up the lid
but it was welded to the chest by the
green seal of time i kicked it sev-
eral times and then with my hands
gave a vigorous tug that brought the
whole chest which with its contents
must have weighed about forty pounds
out of its resting-place

  panting from my fierce exertions
i laid the box upon the pile of debris
gave it a few bangs with my shovel and
then pried away with frantic fingers
the lid yielded with a strange creak
upon its ancient hinges the move-
ment tilted the chest forward upon the
pile and instantly a little rill of age-
dulled coins came pouring and jingling
out upon the sand these coins i
thrust into my pocket after glancing at
one and noting that it was a british
sovereign dated 

  righting the chest and placing it se-
curely upon a flat-lying timber i drew
the lid back and looked in at first
there was visible only a sodden musty
mess of rotten canvas-little bags tied
with moldy leather strings their puck-
ered tops intact but the rest of their
fabric fallen apart with age clawing
away the ancient litter from a corner
of the chest i saw where the coins
had come from there were several
handfuls of gold and silver the gold
red with years and moisture and the
silver blackened so far as i could
see by cursory glances at the coins none
bore a later date than  anc they
were all british showing that the ship
doubtless had been manned by english-
men

  though glad of the gold you may
be sure my fevered imagination played
more fondly with a treasure of greater
value i pawed away the encumbering
mass of canvas and there they were
smiling up at me with their gray iri-
descent eyes-the pearls such a no-

ble though ill-assorted collection i had
never seen the chest was half full
of them

  as my fingers went diving like a
misers into that pearly hoard there
was a world of gloating in my greedy
heart i scooped up hundreds and hun-
dreds of gleaming gems and they rat-
tled back into the box some of them
were yellowed with canvas-rot or
greened by contact with the brass but
what mattered it in the hands of
the polisher ther would soon lose their
external discoloring and my sweat-
blurred eyes were seeking for size and
shape and not for color

   and the size and shape were there-
i picked out pearls as large as hazel-
nuts and saw that it would take but
little work of matching to sort out a
necklace of these fit to adorn the neck
of a queen for those old sailors had
gathered for me bag after bag of the
big pearls of the days when the virgin
lagoons yielded jewels over which pi-
rates fought and died-such jewels as
had gleamed from the throats of
spanish princesses of olden times

   here under my hand in this great
casket was the ransom of a king for
if i knew anything at all about the
value of pearls-and i hadnt been
knocking about the islands four years
without learning something-these
were worth at least half a million of
money a good many pearls had
passed through my hands in the way
cf trade but none had ever been like
these

  angela what would be her de-
light when she sawr this wonderful
treasure what wrould be the delight
of any woman alive with the remnant
of that barbaric instinct for rich deco-
ration which all women have in their
hearts ah the golden wealth of it
all i felt as if i had rifled golconda
the thought of it made me gasp

   yesterday a poor trader or at the
most a man of small means who in
the event of his ever getting off that
remote little island would still be at
the beck and call of the master spirits


the cavalier

of a commercial company in which he
had no interest save a salaried one
here i was suddenly rich-rich beyond
my wildest dreams y as it any won-
der that i was nearly crazed by my
discovery that i whooped with delight
in the face of the sounding surf that
j danced like a dervish and sang in

riotous glee 

  deep down my lingers dived clear
to the bottom and save in that corner
where the broken bags of gold and sil-
ver had lain it was pearls pearls pearls
all the way to the green hard bottom of
the chest no my first estimate had
not been a wild one making due al-
lowance for all the seeds and blisters
here was a safe half-million in that
hoard and perhaps a great deal more

  five hundred thousand good hard
american dollars even though i
wasnt an expert i felt confident in
placing the figure as high as that judg-
ing by the other collections i had seen
in the hands of the spoilers of the
lagoons

  but even in my most miserlike mo-
ments while i ran my crazy hands
through that treasure pile i did not
gloat over it as my exclusive property
no each school maam should have a
share-just how much i did not decide
but even the sharp-elbowed miss peck
even the shoulder-shrugging miss bin-
ney should have her portion of the loot
they were all fellow voyagers and fel-
low castaways they all had participa-
ted in the hardships and the toil of the
island camp and they were entitled to
a part of whatever reward might come
to us as a party of human beings who
had labored and suffered together

  as for angelas share in the bulk of
the treasure that of course would be
greatly increased in the event of her
acceptance of the finder who now had
enough to make his wife feel herself a
rich woman and-well it was too soon
to begin sketching out that part of the
future

  what was more to the purpose just
then was to find a good hiding-place
for the treasure i ran over in my

mind several places while i dumped the
coins out of my pockets into the chest
and replaced the lid but for the present
i could think of none better than the
old wreck itself

  i made my cache up forward in the
very peak of the bow covering it with
sand and throwing a few large lumps
of coral over it

   going back to the place wrhere i had
been digging  again ransacked the
whole space that had been occupied by
the chest but there was nothing there
of any value whatever save a few shil-
ling pieces which i put in my pocket

   to conceal the traces of my treasure-
hunt would have been an easy matter
for i could have dumped the sand back
again and filled up the hole without
much trouble this i wanted to do be-
fore tom should come down that way
again but the thought of my neglect
of the schoolmaams kept smiting me
so flushed with my exertions under
the hot sun and reeking with sweat i
picked up the old copper saucepan and
the iron pot and strode quickly back
to camp full of the triumph of my
treasure-finding and eager to tell an-
gela of my tremendous stroke of for-
tune

   perhaps it was bccause of the self-
accusing thoughts of my ungallant
treatment of the schoolmaams in leav-
ing them so long in the company of that
brown rascal that i kept adding to
their share in the discovery as i ha-
stened toward camp but whatever it
was as i neared the place with every
step i took their shares kept increasing
until i had settled upon each a goodly
fortune

   beach while the indolent tom squat-
ting before them was stretching his
island imagination in further flights of
romance angela was not among the
listeners she was with ruth and
dorothy near the cupboard preparing
luncheon there was no opportunity
to tell her of my discovery

  being very tired i flung myself
down upon the side of flagstaff mound
while i awaited a chance to take her
aside and impart the great secret the
sea-wind blew cool about me and i
was glad of the rest looking down
upon the silent row of women sitting
there enchanted by the chiefs talk i
could think of nothing but the cheap
spell that a swami weaves about his
lady listeners not a word could i
hear for toms voice was low and
somehow the lazy drone of it got upon
my nerves

  why couldnt the man obey orders
and do the work i had set for him
angrily i sprang up and took a few
steps in a detour that should lead me
casually up to the party from the beach
i had gone but a little way when a
slight turn of my head showed me the
six schoolmaams walking hastily to-
ward camp through the heavy sand i
caught a glimpse of miss pecks face
it was as red as a tropic sunset the
other schoolmaams glanced at me
with uneasy self-consciousness and ha-
stened back to join the three who had
stayed in camp

  my detour at once became a bee-
line i charged down upon taumatoa
and i grasped him roughly by the
shoulder

   what did you say to those ladies
just now  i demanded giving him a
sharp shake

   me talk um islands-my people
he replied drawing away from me
with an innocent injured air

   no i declared  you say some-
thing bad-something very bad they
 like

   no he shrugged his shoulders
deprecatingly  i tell um good-tell
um bout islands bout misnary

   you miserable liar i cried with
rising heat  i dont suppose i shall
get it out of you but ill tell you what
 think of you in your own tongue
with that i fell to cursing him in
choice rarotongan which i knew
would bite deeper than english i
told him he must keep away from the
women except when i was with him
of course he had been encouraged by
them in this last swami talk of his
but i doubted from the look i had seen
on the girls faces if they wrould be
hunting him out again as a story-teller

  the chiefs fur rose while i was
landing into him but he smoothed
down after a bit and said

    you no like me talk white women
but if white women my wives it all
ri eh

   what do you mean  i glared at
him hotly

    we got here on this lit bit island
he said more calmly  nine women
maybe we stay here long time may-
be no boat come one-two year we
got here nine women you like lit
girl what make music you take him
fo wife you white man you take
one me blong islands me take eight
missee peck him got bible you be
misnary and make wedding every-
thing all ri then not so 

   his sensual face lighted up and his
llat nostrils dilated a little

    oh thats the kind of talk youve
been handing out to the ladies i
cried  well youll have to be exiled
from our bunch come with me you
old turk come on  

  i grasped him ungently by the arm
and led him up over the low ridge and
down to the lagoon and along to the
little coral hut among the bushes

    ha  he exclaimed staring at the
hut curiously  lit house some-
body live here sometime

     es and youre going to live here
now you clean out that cabin and
make yourself some matting to sleep
on theres the lagoon full of fish-
you wont starve this is your home
understand 


the cavalier

   whas matter he cried protest-

ingly i am taboo

   thats what you are i replied
sharply  that is so far as tire women
are concerned you keep away from
them except when im around  call
you when  want you to help me
theres going to be a lot of work to do
and this is where you sleep and eat and
youre not to come intocamp till i tell
you to have you got that 

   but me want wife-give me one
wife he pleaded  for my lil house
 well then sw im over to the near-
est island and get her i said deter-
minedly  as for those ladies up
there in camp if you lay a linger on
them youre a dead man

  with that i pulled my automatic
from my hip pocket the flash of its
bright barrel in the sunlight gave the
chief a start

   theres just ten bullets in this
gun said i  and youd better do as
i say

  u oh you no shoot me-me ol
fren me know you on panipa an
alamaka-long time me know you
 well old friend keep your dis-
tance said i  and come when youre
called for heres where you stay in
this little house

  as the white walls of the cabin
stared forth at me and i glanced along
the sun-drenched beach of the lagoon
hack toward that sea-worn swale my
mind again turned upon the dismal
prospect always impending though it
had been lost sight of in the treasure-
hunt and other diverting occurrences
the likelihood of this low-lying island
again being swept by the waves as i
left tom to his reflections and walked
campward the fear of this overflow
again oppressed me effacing for the
time the glory of my mornings discov-
ery  and as i neared camp where the
girls were sitting quietly on the benches
talking low among themselves i
stopped for a moment studied the
grove above me and an idea suddenly
came into my head

  it was a plan for a high-and-dry

refuge of some sort it hardly seemed
passible that when the waves should
sweep over the island they would rise
higher than ten feet above the highest
ground well as nearly as i could
figure it out the ground at the foot of
the coconut-trees rose to the proud al-
titude of six feet above sea-level and
as the tallest was about fifty feet a per-
son who climbed up into one of them
would be safe enough at high-water if
the tree was not washed away

   now there were evidences that trees
had been uprooted by the waves for
there were many that lay prostrate and
had been so lodged among the standing
trunks that the sea could not carry them
away others whose roots had been
washed by the overflow leaned against
the upright ones and though half-
dead or sickly were making brave ef-
forts to get a new hold upon the soil

  my idea was to take the dead and
leaning trees cut off the roots and
branches and fasten two or more of
them high up and horizontally to four
sturdy upright trunks that i now se-
lected and by laying other poles across
this rude sill make a sort of platform
to which we might all retreat in case
the island should be inundated again
the four trees which were tall
straight and firmly rooted were at
such a distance apart as to make con-
venient posts to support a floor about
twelve b fifteen feet in size

  the idea of this safe refuge from
an in sweeping flood or tidal-wave
struck me as such a feasible one that i
wanted to get to work upon it that very
day but i was nearly worn out by my
arduous labors at the wreck and as
hungry as a bear beside there was no
sign of any storm it would be best
to wait until morning and go at the
work with fresh vigor so i strode
into camp and sat down at the table
upon which the schoolmistresses had
laid luncheon though none of them
were eating

   it seemed strange that they had not
called me but what seemed stranger
was the hush that stole over them as i
schoolmaam island



sat down at the table i could not ac-
count for it they served me silently
barely glancing in my direction some-
how it occurred to me not to question
this odd and sudden aloofness on their
part glancing over at angela who
sat near the other end of the table i
saw that she was gloomy and preoccu-
pied

  i had been scheming to get her apart
from the rest to tell her of our won-
derful good fortune thinking to give
her the pleasure of being the first to
receive the great news but evidently
the reason whatever it was for this
strange treatment of me had affected
her most of all while the others
talked but little and only among them-
selves addressing no word to me she
said nothing at times she bit her lip
which quivered now and again she
looked as if she wanted to cry

  is the king coming to lunch i
heard miss binney ask

   i dont know replied miss peck
 where is he 

   he is ostracized for the present
i remarked stiffly for i was resentful
of their treatment of me

  ostracized miss pecks tone
was a curious one

   yes ostracized - tabooed hes
down at the coral cabin i will call him
if you are ready to feed him but i wish
to stipulate that he is never to be in
this camp or with you ladies anywhere
save when i am present

  oh was all the principal said
then she colored deeply

  two and two were put together
pretty quickly just then let me tell you
and the sum of my calculations was
that it was what tom had been telling
them that had resulted in their silent
and contemptuous treatment of me i
was too proud and too angr to ask
what his evil communication had been
surely they might have taken it for
granted as between a white man and
a kanaka that my word was better
than his but they had not even afford-
ed me a chance to set myself straight
by denying his charge

  i thought that angela at least
might have given me the benefit of any
doubt as to the truth of his story but
it looked as if she had accepted it with-
out question even when i brought
the pot and pan from the mound where
i had left them she took no interest in
the discovery but dorothys eyes
brightened and she at once set to work
to scour them

   now well have something to cook
in she said with a satisfied smile
 theres nothing like having a few
kitchen things in camp

  for a time the schoolmaams made
no comment on the taboo i had placed
upon the king his wholesale mar-
riage proposal had shocked them i
made no doubt though they probably
had attributed it to his innocent island
way at that moment their shares in
the treasure were pretty well below
par i felt like a crusty old moneybags
who was revising his will and thought
that it would have paid them hand-
somely to scout the chiefs story what-
ever it was and to believe well of me
perhaps some of the pride of wealth
was added to the pride of name for
when i thought the matter over i was
inclined to be as cool and as distant as
they had suddenly become

  i lighted my last cigar leaned back
calmly saying nothing while i blew the
white smoke up into the palm branches
when the cigar was smoked down to
an inch-long butt which i hated to
throw away but at last did manage to
toss aside into the sand i watched it
as its glow died out then rose gath-
ered up some food from the table and
walked slowly down to feed tom the
schoolmaams were talking low among
themselves as i left but angela was
sitting apart in the shade looking off
silently over the lagoon

   misser sibley cried the chief as
i approached the cabin and saw him
standing a few rods away from it
among the green brush  me no stop
in that house me no can sleep such
place his face wore a haunted look
as he spoke
	the cavalier

  why not i asked and even
before his reply came i thought of the
skull i had found there

   dead mans lie blong cabin-leave

bones

   oh thats all right i laughed
lightly though  was sorry i had not
removed the human relics before i had
assigned the cabin to him

   me no like dead mans he insisted
very gravely  mebbe he come in
night want bones

  well give em to him said i
 dont worry about a little thing like
that hat your lunch and then take em
out and bury them somewhere

  lie shook his head but took the food
and bolted it when he had finished
the last morsel and had washed it down
with a drink of sap i made him go
over to the cabin which he approached
gingerly but it took all my mandatory
powers coupled with the careless
drawing of my pistol to persuade him
to touch those bones but when he saw
the little gun he went at the work like
one anxious to be rid of a distasteful
job and at my order buried the grisly
relics about a hundred yards away in
the sand but even after this was done
and the rubbish was removed so that
the inside of the cabin looked clean and
inviting it was plain to be seen that it
had no attraction for the superstitious
chief

  being in no hurry to go back to
camp and again be subjected to the
chilly treatment of those icy maidens
i had lain about in the shade of the
cabin while tom performed his task
i think he felt that the labor i was ma-
king him perform was part of his
punishment for the evil word he had
passed about me with the women

  feeling rested after an hour or two
and in a little better humor i began
to make light of the attitude of the
schoolmaams which it seemed to me
judging by our situation upon that
little island in midocean could last but
a short time again i turned my
thoughts to the erection of the plat-
form among the palms

  i have been all among the island anti

atolls of micronesia and i have never
seen even on the lowest lying ones
most exposed to storms and tidal
waves any attempt at the erection of
such a safe retreat as our little hand
of castaways was to be provided with
against the coming of a great overflow
but it was practical and might save all
our lives

  tom was told of the plan and was
asked to come with me which he did
the more readily since the flashing of
my automatic had illumined his dark
intelligence the idea of the platform
did not strike him very hard as it in-
volved labor in his slothful way he
would rather have run the risk of be-
ing washed out to sea than to go to all
this trouble

  voices came from the shack as we
passed it but none of the schoolmaams
came out to greet us i had hoped that
angela would come to me and demand
if toms story whatever it was were
true but  saw nothing of her though
a little later while we were beginning
our work i heard her violin flinging
out a merry air that i djd not recog-
nize this piece of bravado made me
smile for t knew that she was not so
happy as she was trying to appear

  i gave tom a twelve-foot stick of
lximboo as a measure for the poles and
told him how thick they were to be
he was soon chopping away in quite a
meek and docile mood he gave an
industrious grunt whenever his ax de-
scended and stopped frequently to make
an impressive show of wiping the
sweat from his face the four trees
i had selected as posts for the platform
were of the largest and best rooted
palms in the little grove about fifty
yards from the shack and in plain view
of it

  about the roots of these i piled all
the loose lumps of coral i could find
near at hand to prevent the washing
of the roots by the waves stacking the
crusty chunks to a height of three or
four feet around the poles this gave
them a stanch look then i took my
schoolmaam island



turn at pole cutting while tom wove
fibrous portions of the palms into
rough strong cordage with this we
secured two of the strongest poles to
the trunks of our tree-posts at a height
of twenty feet from the ground and
then proceeded to lay the other poles
across them at right angles close to-
gether and fastened firmly with twist-
ed fiber

  while we worked the schoolmaams
came out of the shack and gazed curi-
ously in our direction now and then
but they did not come near us it dis-
pleased me to think that angela should
take no nearer interest in my work
than to stand off there with the rest
and gaze at it indifferently as i
handed the poles up to tom i glanced
over toward my wards from time to
time they were sitting upon the sand
under the canvas talking in low but
earnest tones miss peck as usual
dominating the assembly

  it was something like a gossipy
gathering at a new england tea and
it came to me that i was probably the
chief subject of the conversation
though whether i was being grilled or
not i couldnt tell indeed i gave the
matter little thought so intent was i
upon the important business in hand
just to be sociable however i called
across the sands

   dont you wish you had brought
along your rocking-chairs 

   oh were getting on very well
thank you  screeched back miss peck
with an intonation which showed me
that i was still under the ban of her
disapproval

  again i fell to wondering what it
was that tom had been telling them
about me for clearly it was he who was
responsible for their changed attitudes
toward their protector and again i de-
manded of the rascal what he had told
them but he strenuously denied hav-
ing maligned me in any way during
the drift-log interview or even having
spoken of me in anything but the most
friendly terms

  i was handing a heavy pole up to

    	c

tom almost staggering under the
weight of it when i heard a voice at
my elbow

   you must be thirsty-wont you
have a drink -and there was doro-
thy shaw with two shells oi water in
her hand she looked very neat and
clean and wore her straw-colored hair
in two big braids down her back

  i took the drink thanked her and
passed one of the shells up to tom
who came down part of the way to
get it

   i am very curious to know what
you are doing she remarked glancing
up at the cross poles

  in return i came near telling her i
wras very curious to know why i was
under taboo but pride got the better
of me rather stiffly i informed her
of the nature of the structure and gave
information as to the reason for it

   and do you really think theres
danger of the island being overflowed
by the sea 

  her blue eyes grew large and she
gazed about over the little atoll as if
she expected to see the ocean begin-
ning to rise above it

   well i replied  i dont wish to
alarm anybody unnecessarily but
there is a possibility of such an oc-
currence the island has been washed
over before-there are plenty of evi-
dences of that-and theres no telling
when the same thing might occur
again

   oh said she with a little shrug
of dismay  let me help you-those
poles are heavy lets get it done
quick

  she seized upon the pole i was just
picking up and i made no protest in-
deed i was glad of her help

  tom grinned down as he saw her
pushing at the pole one end of which
he leaned over to grasp i could feel
the pulsing strength of this young
brunhild with her bobbing braids of
hair lightening the load for me she
gave a new zest to my weary spirit
when she bent her splendid limbs to
pick up piece after piece of the long


the cavalier

heavy green wood and heaved her
magnificent shoulders in the upward
push there was an inspiration in her
glowing face and in her line athletic
strength that made me wish for a time
that all girls were of that robust order
and yet angela was petite and delicate
of nature no it wouldnt do to have
them all brunhilds

  while we worked  kept thinking of
the treasure it lightened my burdens
it expanded my breath and at times
it made my heart beat with riotous joy
when i looked at dorothys flushed
face and carelessly bobbing braids the
thought kept rising that when it came
to the division of the precious loot she
would get her full share i wanted to
tell her about the discovery but some-
thing in me held it back as the
shadows gathered in the grove i saw
a tired look in dorothys face

   there said i  you had better
go back and get your lecture thank
you very much

   lecture oh i wont let her lec-
ture me she replied disdainfully
 i dont have to go in lock-step at her
command she tries to dominate our
crowd too much anyway

  of course we both referred to miss
peck again i wanted to ask her what
tom had been telling that had set the
schoolmaams against me but i now
reflected that it might embarrass her
i felt too that if she could have done
it she would have enlightened me
without waiting to be asked

  with about three-fourths of the
cross poles in place ami firmly secured
tom and i quit work for the day

  the platform was now in shape to
receive refugees and i intended to fin-
ish it on the morrow tired as lie was
i made the chief climb the shell-hung
trees and help to fetch down the sap
which we poured into some of the pro-
vision cans we had left there for the
purpose then bidding him to retire
to his hut which lie did very reluctant-
ly i carried the brimming cans into
camp and set them down before miss
peck

    have a drink i said offering her

some of the sap in a coconut shell

  she barely looked at me as she took
the rude cup from my hand thank-
ing me stiffly

   it isnt bad she remarked when
she had tasted it  yes it will do very
well

   offered a cup to angela who
seemed more coolly disposed she
tilted her chin in a haughty little way
and in her eyes as she glanced at me
there was an unmistakable look of
disdain

     -vo thanks she said curtly with
a queenly little wave of her hand and
a decided lift of the shoulders  im
not thirsty

    but its not only drink i said in
a persuasive placating tone for i was
bound to sec this unpleasant situation
over as soon as might be  its meat as
well and i want you all to get used to
it and like it

  but she turned to lay a stick upon
the fire and hardly deigned to look at
me again indeed during the whole
evening meal while we sat in a rather
constrained circle in which little of the
conversation was addressed to me she
kept three girls between us all the time

  i wanted to ask for an explanation
but somehow i held my tongue tt
seemed clear to me that it was prob-
ably something of a delicate nature
and not to be discussed with maiden
school-teachers old or young per-
haps the best way to deal with the mat-
ter was to ignore it as far as possible
as nearly as i could do so i retained
the lightness of tone that i had adopt-
ed since the beginning of our adven-
ture and showed no vexation but
after supper when i had taken a good-
ly allowance of food down to the sullen
tom and was slowly returning from
his hut to the camp a wave of selt-
pitv swept over me

   here i had been toiling like a galley-
slave all the hot long day for those un-
grateful women who with one excep-
tion had sat apart taking no interest
in my labors and were even yet treat-
schoolmaam island



ing me with cold hauteur that morn-
ing i had discovered treasure of great
value a goodly portion of which  had
decided to divide among them and
during the whole afternoon i had
labored to build a safe retreat for them
in the not unlikely event of the flooding
of the island and there they were
setting me outside the social pale be-
cause of the fool story of a fool ka-
naka it was too much for my ameri-
can blood i shut my teeth tight and
determined to break up that icy barrier
if possible and if not to keep away
from them and let them run affairs to
suit themselves

  but no such course was necessary
when i got back to camp i found that
the ice had been broken and was not
long in discovering the reason doro-
thy shaw had been telling them why
the pole platform had been built in-
deed she was still talking as i came up
unobserved and saw them all sitting
there backgrounded by the dark palms
whose branches were tinged by the
pale pink rays of the western after-
glow

chapter ix

a talk with the girls

kf hy mr sibley came the stri-
 dent yet cordial tones of miss
peck  do you really believe the island
is likely at any moment to be inun-
dated

  at any other time i might have tried
to allay their fears by minimizing the
menace of the sea and putting it among
the bare possibilities but just then i
felt somewhat ruthless as to the mat-
ter of exciting feminine fears

   not at any moment i said a little
coldly  unless a tidal wave should
rise but it is a part of the history of
these low-lying islands-and i air sure
it has been the history of this one ly-
ing as it does only a few feet above
sea-level - that hurricanes sometimes
sweep the water over them

 and such a storm is likely to occur

at any time  miss peck gave a little
shudder

   yes particularly in this equinoc-
tial season-

   and that is the reason why you
have been so thoughtful as to provide
us with that high place of refuge over
there  her tone was really friendly
yes the ice had thawed

   do you think asked ruth dem-
ing  that we are in any immediate
danger

   no i replied  there will
doubtless be warning enough but if
you take my advice you will never
venture very far away from camp for
gales swreep up suddenly in these parts
which you as students and educators
must know

   but those poles in the trees-they
are so high objected miss binney
 how shall we ever get up there 

   dont worry about that chided
miss peck then she turned to me
 its very kind of you mr sibley to
plan and build that safe retreat for us
and i want to thank you on behalf of
all the ladies im sure were all very
grateful

   indeed we are declared ruth
deming

  there were little purrs of approval
from the others but though angelas
face softened a bit my alert ear caught
no kindly word from her when 
looked at her questioningly where she
sat upon the sand she averted her eyes
and clasped her hands about her knee
with a set air of alienation

  though the coolness of the others
had become as you see rather dissi-
pated by what they felt to be a com-
mon danger in her case there had been
no change but i was crafty enough
to follow up my advantage in the case
of the others

   and now if i have been sufficient-
ly disciplined- i said and paused

  oh thats all past cried miss
peck with a show of warmth for
which i could have hugged the ancient
maiden unhuggable though she was
 lets forget about it its nothing
the cavalier



of our affair anyway-your adoption
of the native marital customs of these

islands

  what marital customs  i cried in
amazement

   i refer to your panipa wives she
said and looked away while the color
rose to her sallow face

   native wives  i screamed in joy-
ous outburst laughing until the palms
rang with my mirth  thats what
youladies have been worrying about 
i glanced to angela whose face had
reddened as she heard me but she did
not deign to look back

   yes said miss peck as if choos-
ing her words  in view of all the
stressful circumstances of our situa-
tion and particularly the danger of
which you speak and which i do not
doubt - for the appearance of the
island now that i come to look about
upon it certainly bears out your asser-
tions- we will waive the matter of
your three native wives and work with
you and be guided in all material ways
by your superior-

   but the wives are not going to be
waived  i cried righteously  and
for the very good reason that they do
not and never have existed i am not
going to rest under that calumny i
presume that the worthy taumatoa ut-
tered it for reasons of his own-as an
introduction to a subject he has already
broached to me but which i neednt
discuss here

   yes acknowledged miss shaw in
her frank outspoken way  lie pro-
posed to all of us in a bunch-that is
all except miss alvarado whom he
probably reserved for you

  dorothy cried angela with a
flash of white teeth and an angry up-
thrust of her pretty hand while her
little foot kicked in the sand

  dont be so personal please ob-
jected miss peck who had been look-
ing at me as if she had expected my
denial and was taking it as a matter oj
course

 but what ive said is quite true
declared dorothy  he did offer to

marry eight of us in a bunch and its
more than likely that its the first time
some of us -she looked squarely at
miss peck with a getting-even expres-
sion- have ever been proposed to

  speak for yourself dorothy
exclaimed miss binney

  miss pecks eyes hashed she sat
up very straight looked a few of those
oft-quoted daggers at the calm-faced
robust young woman who had made
this gross insinuation and then as if
to cover her confusion and make a
swift transition in the talk she said to
me

   in case of a storm to-night would
the platform you are building be ready
to accommodate us 

   i think so i replied  and by to-
morrow noon it will probably be com-
pleted

  there were no gathering clouds any-
where in sight so i calmed any present
fears that the schoolmaams might be
entertaining by saying that there was
every promise of good weather and 
that they might sleep soundly if
there should be sounds of a storm dur-
ing the night i would arouse them

   but you shouldnt do all the watch-
ing said ruth deming coming over
to me in her quiet little way  it isnt
fair youll be worn out we ought
to take turns

   i was thinking of that said miss
peck  and if mr sibley will permit
me i will keep watch until one
oclock

   and ill sit up with you offered
ruth  thats a bargain

  she turned to me in such a deter-
mined way that being dog-tired and
barely able to keep my eyes open i
consented reminding them that they
must awaken me if the slightest occa-
sion should arise not only that of the
weather but - i finished by glancing
toward the coral hut down by the
lagoon they understood it is al-
most needless to say after their morn-
ings experience with the matrimonial-
ly inclined monarch that they knew lie
would bear watching as well as the
schoolmaam island



weather in fact they were now all
desperately afraid of him but how
they came to be so agreeable to a man
of my reputed immorality as to offer
to let me rest while they stood watch
i could not understand

  one thing i determined as i threw
myself down upon my rude fiber bed
and that was that  the morrow i
would make taumatoa take back the
absurd tale he had told the school-
mistresses about my panipa wives
this i would do even if third-degree
tactics had to be resorted to i could
not bear to think of angelas averted
gaze and her air of studied indiffer-
ence i was sorry i had not immedi-
ately fetched the chief before the
women and made him retract his ly-
ing statement

  the stars were paling in the east
when ruth deming came over and
awoke me by a cheery  good morn-
ing i sprang up guiltily for it was
long past the hour when my watch
should have begun ruth and miss
peck responded pleasantly to the scold-
ing i gave them for not waking me
before

   we thought you needed a good
rest said the principal  after all
your hard work

  they went to the shack quietly to
lie down with the other women and
in a few minutes the elder school-
maams rhythmic snore was heard be-
yond the camp-fire mingled with tired
sighs from ruth

  just before sunrise i went down to
the coral hut to call taumatoa that he
might help me to finish the platform
he was not there because of his
superstitious fear of the place where
the dead mans bones had been lain
this hardly surprised me still i
thought he could not be far away and
so kept calling him as i beat about in
the bushes thinking to find his retreat

  down in a little brush-covered gul-
ley half-way from the camp to the
wreck i was startled nearly out of my
wits by the sudden uprush of a great
mass of white and brown sea-birds

these were evidently of the same flock
that had fluttered about the old ship
and here was their home the nests
lay all about in the thicket some of
them half full of eggs it was a great
find-a food supply that set at rest all
fear of starvation in case the coconuts
ran short or the fish wouldnt bite

  after gathering a capful of what
seemed to be the freshest of the eggs
i returned to camp disappointed in my
search for tom and thoroughly dis-
gusted by this latest errant act of his
and yet pleased to be able to bring in
evidences of a food store that probably
was inexhaustible

  dorothy was the only one in camp
the others were all shell-hunting she
was highly pleased when i set my cap-
ful of eggs  the table

   have you been marketing she
asked  are there more where these
came from

    hundreds i replied

   lets go and get them she
sprang up her golden braids bobbing
 lets go right away

  so we went back to the gullev ta-
king the pot and pan with us the
birds had returned to their retreat and
they made raucous protests while we
rifled their nests dorothy was a little
fearful of their attacks at first but i
assured her they were as harmless as
geese

   oh im not afraid of geese  she
said  only these fowls have such
ugly beaks and they look as if they
wouldnt mind pecking a person and
i dont like their horrible squawking

  but despite the wild threats of the
birds we filled the pot and pan with
eggs and took them back to camp

  then i went over -to the platform
and set to work cutting and laying
more poles on the cross-beams doro-
thy helped me as before her strenu-
ous days upon the island were making
her a little thinner of face and figure
and she was getting pretty well tanned

   i feel as if i were training down
for a basket-ball tournament she re-
marked to me as unaided she raised


the cavalier

one of the heavy poles up to the edge

of the flooring

   but you mustnt strain yourself
i advised from the top of the platform
 its pretty hard work for a girl

   oh it will do me no harm and i
enjoy it so much  she replied  i
want to see this thing finished before
the high tide washes over the coast of
lincolnshire

    cusha cusha cusha calling
sang out ruth doming as she ap-
proached us  what can i do to help
the good work 

   you can weave fiber for binding
ropes i said  ill need it to finish
tying on the poles

  some of the other girls came over
and helped in the weaving once in a
while one of them cast an interested
eye at dorothy as she plied the ax or
lifted a pole when we told them
about the eggs they rushed over to the
cupboard to have a look at them miss
binney doubted if they would be as
good as hens eggs but the others were
delighted with our new store of pro-
visions

  in an hour or two the roost as the
girls had dubbed it was finished

  a very picturesque dwelling
pronounced ruth deming when we
surveyed the result of our work

  it isnt the picturesqueness of it
that appeals to me remarked miss
peck so much as the fact that it is
safe and high enough to afford us a
refuge in the event of an inundation

  we were now as it seemed safe-
guarded against any sudden rise of the
sea and it was time that i should be
taking better care of my treasure so
far from camp and so insecurely hid-
den in the bow of the old wreck

chapter x

my troublcsome treasure

jll the while that t had been work-
ing upon the platform the thought
of my sudden affluence and the good
fortune of the schoolmaams had kept

flashing up within me and filling me
with the most exalted views of myself
and the potential part i should play in
the world w hen our release from this
island exile should come as it must
come in the course of time  kept
wondering whether i should impart the
news of my discovery to the school-
mistresses somehow i hesitated to
do this

  but how was i to get the pearls into
camp and safely hidden without the
knowledge of the schoolmaams it
was the old fox-goose-and-corn story
all over again if i went down to the
wreck alone there would be the danger
of that lurking islander poking into
camp and renewing his wooing of the
women there was no telling in what
offensive way if i took the teachers
along they would try to find out what
was in the brass chest and if  caught
tom and forced him to go with me his
curiosity would also be excited if i
could find the fox and tie him up so
that he would not get at the goose i
might go that evening in the dusk and
get the corn but how was one to
fasten a fox if one couldnt catch him

  this problem bothered me for hours
during a part of that time i kept scan-
ning the grove and peeping about in
the brush for the king but no trace of
him did i see the girls who had be-
gun to be somewhat fearsome of him
stood upon the mound from time to
time and kept a lookout for him if
the female of the species were in the
least consistent the schoolmaams
would by this time have treated what
he had told them of me as so much
raving but it was plain that the story
had stuck save in the case of the hon-
est dorothy their attitude toward me
though not unfriendly was changed
the change was a subtle one but it
was there

  as the shadows of the palms length-
ened upon the beach i went over to
where dorothy was standing alone near
the cupboard and quietly handed her
my pistol telling her i was going out
in search of tom who might elude me
schoolmaam island



and creep into camp while i was absent
at first she scouted the idea oi dan-
ger but i insisted upon that point

   ill tell the girls to keep watching
for him she promised in reply to my
cautions as to vigilance  but please
dont be gone long mr sibley if you
really think hes on the war-path i
think some of the girls are rather afraid
of him since-since his wholesale pro-
posal she smiled and put the pistol
in the pocket of her blouse

  are they said i a little coolly
 then why are they so ready to be-
lieve what he has told them about me 
 but one of them doesnt believe
it she declared earnestly gazing at
me in a friendly way out of her quiet
blue eyes  im sure you have better
taste than to select a kanaka for your
wife and as for three of them-why
its ridiculous 

  i seized her hand and gave it a little
squeeze i couldnt help it perhaps
some of the girls saw the action but
i didnt care

   thank you dorothy  i cried for
the name came naturally to my lips
 but if you think its ridiculous why
doesnt angela think the same 

   why its different with angela
she is-well pardon the expression-
but her spanish blood- oh i
shouldnt say such things shes a
dear girl and - well shes angela
shell want proof that theres no truth
in the story before shell come around
again

   i could make tom take it back if
i could find him said i  ill hurry
away now before it gets any darker
with my knife ready at hand i
strode down to the lagoon and along
its smooth beach with the purpose of
bringing either taumatoa or the treas-
ure into camp as a matter of fact
i was more intent upon securing the
treasure for i doubted not that the fox
would return when he got hungry
enough for he had a particular fondr
ness for tinned beef

  i passed down the long stretch of
jungle and presently the lonely out-

lines of the old wreck rose before me
out of the twilight all was still down
there save the drone of the surf and
the humming of the evening wind
through the bleak bare ribs of the
water-worn craft i entered the old
hulk amidships as i did so i was
startled and dismayed to see a dark
figure dodge away from the bow steal
silently aft and out between the stand-
ing timbers

   tom  i yelled at the top of my
voice here i want you

  but he flung on over the sand along
the lagoon taking no heed of my call

  had he found the treasure and had
he hidden it away from me pulsing
all over with the thought and in a
mighty unpleasant frame of mind i
rushed up to the bow there i saw
the coral covering of my cache strewed
about in the peak of the hull and the
brass chest stood fully exposed to view
the lid of the treasure-casket had been
pulled back and stood open

  i gave an eager searching look into
the chest and though the light was dim
i saw at once that the contents had
been disturbed a part of the pearl
treasure was gone-how much i could
not tell but at least a double handful i
had reached the wreck just in time i
wouldnt have given a two-bit piece for
my share in that treasure had my com-
ing been delayed ten minutes

  true the island was small but there
were plenty of good hiding-places
upon it and as for hunting down the
robber it might have been hard work
for one man

  shutting the lid tightly i took the
chest under my arm and hurried camp-
ward it was quite dark before i got
there and i sang out so that the girls
would know who was coming all was
quiet the rascally tom had not visit-
ed the place in the dusk i was able
without attracting any attention to what
i carried under my arm to reach the
brush shack where i intended to sleep
as the girls had removed their belong-
ings to the platform and were now up
there with the ladder withdrawn


the cavalier

  after hiding the treasure-box in the
sand in a corner of the shack i went
over and called up to dorothy who
was sitting on the platform outside the
tent pistol in hand she let the ladder
down to the ground descended and
came over to where  stood

   i never realized how much comfort
it is to have a man around the house
she said with a nervous little laugh
 until you went away and left us lone
school-teachers to roost up therft

   you could have given a good ac-
count of yourself i said laughing in
turn it was easy to laugh now that
the treasure was rescued from the
covetous hands of that rascally chief-
all but the pocketful he had purloined

   well  see you safe up said i
 and then ill hie me to my little
shack

   speaking of safety do you think
mr sibley that youre quite safe
sleeping there on the ground  her
tone was solicitous and i liked it  i
should have helped you to build an-
other retreat like ours those storms
-they come up suddenly dont they 
 sometimes i replied and then
went on to reassure her that if a storm
should rise there doubtless would be
plenty of time for me to climb up to
the platform

   but that poor man who lived in the
cabin down there she said  he was
surprised by a storm wasnt he 

   then you saw tom removing the-
the-

   bones she finished  yes i
went for a walk down that way alone
and saw him taking them out and bury-
ing them in the sand

   and you said nothing to the rest  
   not a syllable

   you are a wonderful young wom-
an i said in a frank outburst of ad-
miration  you sasv him taking out
and burying those skeletons and yet
you said nothing to any one about it
not even to angela 

   not even to angela and i knew
by the look upon her sweet serious face
that she spoke truly

  why not i inquired gazing at

her in appreciative wonder

   because i saw that you wanted
your discovery to remain secret

   youre a good girl i burst forth
in admiring spontaneity  one of a
thousand if you can keep a secret
without being asked to do so you can
keep one on promise i am sure

   oh yes i can do that  said she
in such sincere tones that i readily be-
lieved her  what is it 

   its-its-i dont know that i
ought to tell you but if anything
should happen to me it would be well
for some one to know it and its evi-
dent you can be trusted

   oh im dying to know  she said
eagerly

  w then come a little farther away
from the platform where we cant be
overheard

  she followed me into the grove and
there as we stood together in the
darkness of the palms i told her the
story of the finding of the treasure

   pearls  she breathed forth in an
excited whisper isnt that dandy
why you are rich mr sibley let
me congratulate you she seized my
hand impulsively with the grip of a
strong man  you are rich 

   and so are you miss shaw

   oh i dont come in for any of it
you are the discoverer-the treasure is
all yours

   no as fellow castaways each of
the school-teachers will get her share
and you among them i dont know
just how much it will amount to in
cash but you get your share with the
rest

   well all i can say is that youre
the most magnanimous- and after
the way youve been treated too oh
this is too good to be true are they
really so valuable you say you know
how pearls are valued 

   i know something about it i re-
plied with affected modesty

   its too good its too good  she
cried dancing up and down in the sand
like a delighted child
schoolmaam island

    not so loud please i cautioned
 remember its a secret

   oh but cant i tell them-cant i
tell them theyll know it in time-
why not now  theyve been so grumpy
to-day theyve all looked so long on
the sea for a sail or something and
angela-

   what about angela  

   she was crying when i left them
it will brighten her up and she
added with a touch of illumination
 it will change her tone toward you-
shell make up with you and-

    please dont i broke in  i dont
want her on those terms or on any
terms except- well you know
youd better go back to them now
give me the pistol ill keep watch
over the platform from the shack and
guard the treasure its in there

    is it oh id so like to see it-to
see all those beautiful pearls

   not to-night ill go back to the
roost with you and help you raise the
ladder

   half an hour later i sat on flagstaff
mound and stared out over the starlit
sea the lonely night wind was sweep-
ing over the sands the lagoon was all
achurn while from the barrier reef the
outcrash of the breakers sent up a deep
and tragic music what a lot of
trouble that kanaka had made for me
and he was likely to give me further
annoyance his itching fingers had
been dipped into the pearls he would
want more for riches mean as much to
an island chief as they do to any man
alive

  the wind was upon my nerves as i
stretched my tired body upon my palm-
leaf couch at the entrance of the little
brush hut which commanded a view of
the ladder and part of the platform
there i lay looking out upon the blow-
ing palms now and then they lifted
their long arms and their fingers beck-
oned to me so unmistakably that twice
i rose abstractedly and took a few steps
toward the grove then i shook my-
self out of my morbid state went back
and lay down again upon my rough

bed with my eyes still staring toward
the palms at times when a great gust
shook them their branches clattered
wildly it was as if a group of ghosts
clapped their hands what a dismal
night there was an irritable feeling
down my back as if a spider or some
other insect were moving about on my
skin my tired muscles twitched and
once or twice when i dozed off i felt
as if i were falling from a great height
and suddenly leaped up from the couch
aud was wide awake in an instant
truly a torturesome night

  at last while i lay with my eyes
upon the ladder counting its twenty-
one rounds up and down and up and
down again in the starlight the beck-
oning and clattering of the palms lost
their hold upon me and i fell into an
uneasy slumber out of which i was
suddenly startled by the uncanny feel
of a hot breath upon my face

  as i opened my eyes i suddenly be-
came conscious of a dark figure bend-
ing over me and an upraised hand that
held a steel blade glimmering palely
in the starlight quickly my own hand
shot out and grasped a greasy fore-
arm upon which it vainly tried to get
a hold i realized at once that my sud-
den movement had averted the mur-
derous descent of the kanakas knife
but it did not avert his intention to
slay me as my fingers slipped from
his oily arm he made another lunge
at me but i dodged awav into the in-
side darkness leaving him in the en-
trance exposed to the starlight

  had my pistol been in hand i could
have made short work of him but it
lay under the head of my couch near
the entrance for the moment out of
reach i determined to get hold of it
at all hazards and quickly decided
upon a bold move the only one that
occurred to me in my hard-pressed
state i pounced upon his back from
my corner and tried to get a hold
upon his neck but again i could get
no grip my fingers slid as though
they were closing upon a flounder
while i still bore heavily down upon


the cavalier

him i could feel myself slowly sliding
from his slippery naked back as he
wriggled under me his head well
down upon the ground and his arms
sprawled out upon it then it came to
me that he had prepared himself for
this encounter as island thieves some-
times do by smearing some kind of
lubricant perhaps fish-oil all over his
naked body

chapter xi

catching a greased pig

oure a pretty smooth fellow
i thought as the well-anointed
body of the kanaka chief wriggled and
twisted in my nervous tackling fingers
but ill get hold of you yet

  for even as the islander slid under
my fingers like a greased pig and
squirmed away from under me a hap-
py expedient occurred to me i reached
down and seized a handful of sand
which i quickly threw upon his neck

  i could have yelled for joy when i
felt my fingers getting a firm gritty
hold upon his thick throat soon my
other hand gritted with sand closed
securely about the wrist of his knife
hand so tightly did i hold his face
down into the sand that it almost
smothered him

  up to this moment neither of us had
uttered a sound save the hard-breath-
ing grunts of two struggling antago-
nists but i now said to him as quietly
as i could so as not to alarm the
schoolmaams

  let go that knife tom if you
dont ill choke you to death where
you lie

   no me no let um go he panted
from under me  me no your man-
me no do wha you say no mo me
kill you-thas wha me do again
he writhed and thrashed under my
grasp

   if theres any killing to be done
i said with the cool consciousness of
the man on top  i guess youll be the
victim let go that knife

  he gave a deep grunt of defiance
and thrashed his legs and his left arm
about wildly striking the brush walls
of the shack and making them rustle
and creak so that i felt sure he would
awake the women on the platform but
the noises mingled with the sounds of
the wind in the trees and they did not
rouse the sleeping ones

  the king was a large sinewy man
but he was older than  and there was
still another point on my side-the dis-
sipated life he had led

  it was not long before he lay pant-
ing under the clutch of my fingers upon
his windpipe he made horrible cho-
king noises and relaxed his hold upon
the knife which i seized with my left
hand and raised above his back

   now i breathed hotly as i
pricked him between the shoulders
with the point  you just lie still or
youll be a dead king which i dont be-
lieve is quite as good as a live rabbit

   you no kill me  he growled fee-
bly  me be your man-me do wha
you tell you no kill met 

   i think you will be my man i said
triumphantly as my left hand stole
over to the head of my couch and i
grasped my automatic as though it
were the hand of an old friend  ive
got a pistol and a knife here and nows
the time for you to get up very quietly
so as not to waken the ladies and come
with me move on old chap -and
i pressed the muzzle close to the back
of his head

  he knew what that meant and
crawled out of the hut assuring me
that he wouldnt disturb the ladies for
anything in the world i led him along
to where i knew a piece of rope the
boats painter lay at the foot of a tree
he did not resist while i tied his hands
behind him and made him march down
to the coral hut showing gray in the
clear starlight near the edge of the
lagoon inside the hut i sanded his
ankles and tied them together saw to
it that his wrists were securely lashed
and then stood over him as he lay there
upon the rough floor
schoolmaam island



  he tried a little cajolery to induce
me to let him go free assuring me that
he would be my man and a very good
man indeed

   well see about that in the morn-
ing said i  and also well have you
hand over those pearls you stole

   you have urn pearl he assented
readily  you bring my clo me
cold

   where are they 

  he pointed to a near-by palm clump
and going over there i found his hi-
ding-place and in his trousers a pocket
nearly full of the pebbly gems i took
out die pearls threw him his clothes
and left him to reflect upon the evil of
his ways

  as i walked back to the shack the
knife and pistol in my hands i felt
dead tired and ready to fall all in a
heap upon my couch but the eastern
sky began to pale the wind died and
the palms ceased their clatter before i
dozed off to sleep

  it was a depressing fog-bedeviled
morning when i arose aching in every
joint and muscle after the strenuous
efforts of the previous day and night
as i looked about the island from the
foot of the flagstaff i thought i had
never seen a more lonely sight

  at breakfast miss peck said she had
heard strange noises in the night and
miss shaw remarked that she had
heard them too but the other girls
had slept soundly while i had been bat-
tling for my life in the shack not more
than a hundred and fifty feet away

  when i hinted that the sounds were
probably those of the wind among the
palms nothing more was said about the
nocturnal disturbances in fact there
was little going by way of conversa-
tion that morning as the girls were all
under the dispiriting influence of the
gray mist and dark lowering clouds

  there was one good omen in those
dark clouds and that was rain i saw
to it that the boat was in the best posi-
tion to catch what rain-water might fall
upon the slant of the tent and placed a
jar and some tin cans under the other

side then i gathered tip some food
left over from the breakfast-table and
went down to feed my prisoner what
should be done with him would it
not be best to keep him tied up in the
hut for a day or two until a full sense
of his subjugation should sink into his
thick-shelled coconut

  on first catching sight of me com-
ing into the cabin there was a gleam
of sullen defiance and rebellion in the
big liquid eyes of my prisoner but the
idea of food appealed so strongly to
him that these dark looks soon gave
way to more pleasant ones he was
permitted the free use of his hands
while he ate but he objected strongly
to their being tied again declaring that
he would be a  good man  and do
whatever i directed with a pitiful
vanquished look he said he was very
sorry for his attempt upon my life
and that thereafter he would do every-
thing all  ri  if only i would give
him his liberty

  offering no reply whatever to his
appeal i made his murderous hands
fast at the wrists in a series of good
strong hitches and then went back to
camp i still held to the quixotic no-
tion that for the present it was best
to keep from the schoolmaams all
knowledge of toms attack upon me
at the same time i felt that there was
no harm in telling them i had captured
him and made him a prisoner but it
was a mistake not to have told them
at once of the kanakas attempt upon
my life it would have saved a lot of
trouble as events proved

  they all went down with me a little
later in the forenoon to see the pris-
oner although miss peck showed by
her talk that she thought i had cooped
him up on account of his matrimonial
advances she seemed to have lost some
of the feeling of repugnance for him
that had been generated by his whole-
sale proposal of the day before she
and some of the other women looked
at him curiously for a while during
which he sat eying them with interest
and a most innocent expression


the cavalier

   dont you think he might be lied
a little more - more mercifully
asked the principal looking at me
 that rope must cut his wrists

   if it were any looser i replied
with perhaps a shade of resentment
 he would be slipping out of it when
we werent looking

  miss binney lifted her shoulders
 i shouldnt care to be in such an un-
comfortable position she observed
 and right in the hot sun too

   oh the sun shines in at the door-
way now i replied making light of
her suggestion  but it will soon swing
around and leave him in the shade

   i am sure he would behave with
propriety if he were paroled re-
marked miss peck  he has spent a
night of reflection in durance vile and
has doubtless learned a lesson in the-
the etiquette of marriage proposals
if you will pardon me i said
somewhat testily  i am going to keep
him as he is for the present until i
have decided what to do with him i
feel that i have good reasons-reasons
besides those you have referred to-
for pursuing this course to be sure
they are just a mere mans reasons
but i trust you will consider them suffi-
cient though i cannot name them

   what are they  asked one of the
girls

   you shall all know later i said
 i think i know what they are
now said miss peck wisely

  i did not ask her what she thought
they were i went back to the grove to
gather sap and do some other chores
and dorothy and two or three other
girls accompanied and assisted me
but miss peck miss binney ruth and
angela remained down by the lagoon
for over an hour and once i saw them
hanging about the oral cabin and
looking in at the open doorway after-
ward when the four returned to camp
where i sat sharpening the ax on a
fine lump of coral i heard them talk-
ing about taumatoa miss peck who
was certainly of a forgiving nature
again spoke as if she could not under-

stand why the king was kept a

prisoner

   its because hes too dangerous to
be allowed at large said dorothy
 mr sibley who knows these natives
sees that and-

   oh come dear  piped miss
binney in strange championship of the
king im sure hes not so bad as you
think one must make allowances
for ins early training

   quite right clicked out miss
peck who was sitting near by fashion-
ing a fan from a large palm-leaf
 one must make allowances particu-
larly when it is considered that so
many of our ideas are wholly alien to
his temperament

   alien to his temperament  i
nearly growled aloud while i rubbed
the stone savagely upon the ax alien
to his fiddlesticks

  did you say something asked
miss binney glancing at me out of
her curious gray eyes

   no was my coolly studied reply
for it was the place to choose ones
words  but if you ladies will per-
mit me i may remark that its unneces-
sary to waste any time in the study of
the temperament of that chocolate-
colored rascal or in bestowing any
sympathy upon him

  as i spoke these words i saw the
other girls looking on angela among
them

   you have virtually said that be-
fore mr sibley said miss peck

   well let me say it again said i
 please dont waste your compassion
upon him

  miss binney lifted her shoulders
and drooped her eyelids in an injured
way and there was also a hurt look on
miss pecks face dorothy said noth-
ing but i think she enjoyed my little
outburst and that the turn of her head
hid a smile of appreciation

   i was only looking at the human
side of the matter remarked miss
peck frigidly  the human side she
repeated impressively looking at the
group of girls under the platform
schoolmaam island



some of whom nodded assent  y oti
will admit  hope mr sibley that
even a poor polynesian savage has his
claims upon the caucasian race

   im not disputing that point i
replied in the same studied tone  but
tins particular caucasian has good
reason for looking at still another side
of the creature under consideration

    oh you refer to his report to us as
to certain practises of white men
among the islands said miss peck
frigidly and in a tone that was not lost
upon the assembled schoolmaams

  that was the time when i came near
bursting right out in meeting and tell-
ing about toms murderous attack
upon me indeed it was hard to turn
the other cheek and i shouldnt have
done so but for angela whom i did
not care to alarm though she deserved
it so my teeth pressed closely upon
my tongue while dorothy came to my
rescue

   you promised mr sibley that you
would waive that matter she cried
in the tones of a loyal champion  and
you asked us all to suspend judgment
though i never believed a word of the
story and now you are bringing it all
up again i think wed better talk
about something else

  anything you please grated miss
peck  though it presents itself to me
as a topic that should not be summari-
ly dismissed

  the scandalized look of this virtu-
ous spinster in my direction filled me
with a sudden resolve to go down to
the cabin bring up tom and wring
from him his delayed confession as to
the spurious nature of his information
about my matrimonial adventures
among the islands

        chapter xii
        sympathy for tom

 struck off at a hot pace but the
nearer i got to the coral cabin the
slower became my stride and by the
time i had reached the place and gazed

down upon my prisoner it came to me
that to hale him into that prejudiced
court of women and make him deny his
own story at the pistols point as it
were would be anything but convin-
cing it would require very little of
the much-vaunted feminine insight f r
them to see that he was speaking under
coercion i could hear miss peck say
oh yes he has the man completely
intimidated it would be better to
wait until he was more thoroughly
tamed and then to let him confess in
a way that at least should seem vol-
untary

  while taumatoa in whining tones
was endeavoring to convince me that
the best thing  could do would be to
give him his freedom a half dozen of
the schoolmaams came down through
the blurring fog and stood in the shade
of a nut-tree looking in at us neither
angela nor dorothy was among them
it was evident that the sympathies of
these six women were with the king
in his cruel captivity

   why are you still keeping him
manacled asked miss peck in a re-
sentful tone

   have you any further torture
in store for him demanded miss
binney

  as i looked at them hardly knowing
what to say in reply thoughts of mis-
guided women at home who had
fetched flowers to condemned mur-
derers came to me and i could not help
smiling

  tom knew enough english to take
his cue from the schoolmaams and to
assume a most virtuous look as he
bowed meekly before the ladies piti-
fully extending his hemp-bound hands

  now i can see the funny side of a
situation and it may have been my ap-
preciation of the fantastic turn of this
one that kept me from getting angry
and blurting out the tale of the mans
attack upon me then too i had a
shrewd feeling that nothing i might
urge in justification of my act in
making him my prisoner could weigh
against the firm belief of these fair
	the cavalier

judges that the poor fellow was being
punished as an in former but more
than anything i believe it was angelas
violin the rich clear notes of which
were now floating down from the plat-
form in a lively scherzo that helped
me to see the comedy side of this ap-
parent tragedy

   dont be alarmed ladies i said
lightly  i am merely keeping the
king in durance that he may not en-
force his royal order that you shall all
accompany him to the altar

   the idea  sniffed miss peck

   the idea  chorused the others

  to be sure as your suitor miss
peck i continued looking calmly into
the scandalized feline eyes of the prin-
cipal  and as the suitor of the other
ladies present he may have acquired
privileges which i with my callous
mind am not qualified to perceive
and it may be miss peck that you
would like to have his majesty restored
to liberty and given power to enforce
his decree if that is your wish and
the wish of the other ladies i will not
stand in the way any longer i made
a feint of untying the rope that bound
toms hands

   why said miss binney whose
sense of the ridiculous was fully equal
to that of a mouse in a bath-tub  i am
sure that we would not have him re-
leased for that purpose would we miss
peck it is quite true she went 
without waiting for a reply from that
outraged spinster  that he did pro-
pose to us

   en masse i interjected with a
world of enjoyment of her serious ac-
ceptance of my speech at the same
time i ceased toying with toms rope

   en niasscj as you say continued
miss binney l but of course we
couldnt listen to such a proposal

  the rippling tones of the allegro
from the platform inspired me to sug-
gest 

   separate overtures would have
been more to your taste 

  miss binneys thin lips parted in a
look of wrathful contempt while tom

rubbed his nose against his rope and
looked as if he would like to know

what was going on

   i didnt say anything of the sort
she snapped forth

   pardon me  replied politely
 but it seemed to my dense under-
standing that that was the implication
now if you dont wish to have him
released for marital purposes-though
remember i stand ready to do so and
doubtless could remember enough of
the ceremony to officiate-

   mr sibley  never in all my life
have i heard my name hissed forth
with such a wonderfully sibilant effect
though  admit it lends itself to such
utterance than when miss peck threw
it at me from between her teeth

  did you address me madam i
said innocently turning to her

   i did she said with a downward
jerk of her hand  and i wish to
say that your perverted ideas gained
doubtless by your prolonged residence
in these loose-moraled latitudes have
led you to- she paused and looked
about on the sand for a word

   oh yes the latitudes are loose i
assisted angelas scherzo flung down
by the breeze was leading me to a
reckless mood

  he admits that they are loose
she cried triumphantly turning to the
other school-teachers

   as loose as you like said i
 tom will bear me out in that

  the king perked up at the mention
of his name rubbed his nose again and
sat down

   but you must understand that we
dont like them loose was miss bin-
ncys righteous fling  to be sure this
island seems to have no government-

   no government save that ofa man
who is ready to marrv us off to such a
creature as this burst forth one of
the chorus

   well said i with full enjoyment
of the incident which was better than
a play  ill admit im a little weary
of trying to manage the affairs of this
territory small though it is and with
schoolmaam island



so charming a population-here i
lifted my cap- and  certainly dont
relish that part of my duties which in-
cludes the taking and guarding of pris-
oners i would be ready to abdicate to
you ladies and let you govern allairs to
suit yourselves but-

   t think that would be best broke
in miss peck very seriously and the
others nodded

   but i resumed  it never would
work that way brute man would as-
sert himself and seize the reins of gov-
ernment if i laid down those reins
tom would take them up so until
further notice i intend to exercise my
power and keep this undesirable citizen
here in this little ready - made prison
unless of course you petition for his
release on the ground i have named-
that he be permitted to carry out his
royal marital decree the music from
the platform ceased and losing its
inspirational accompaniment i ceased
too

  the schoolmaams looked at each
other in a fluttered furious way a
few of the girls who seemed to pos-
sess more insight than miss peck or
miss binney looked at me in a curious
inquisitorial way as if they saw some-
thing dark behind all this-something
unsuspected by the principal - and
would like to know what it was

  angela dorothy and ruth coming
down from the camp now joined the
party

   look said miss binney with a
sad slow wave of her hand as she
gazed at the newcomers  the poor
king he is still tied up here as pun-
ishment for his crime as an informer
dorothy glanced at tom and then at
me and i saw the same loyal look in
her eyes that i had seen before

   mr sibley has other reasons for
doing this i am sure she said quietly
 reasons which he hasnt given you
and doubtless very good ones

   we are not children - we can see
his motive plainly enough said miss
binney

   yes affirmed miss peck as if

  the fact had not struck her before  we
are not children and we are not to be
treated as such and i resent the face-
tious turn mr sibley has sought to give
to the matter come ladies let us go
back to camp

  as they turned away tom made a
sniveling plea to them in the midst of
his assurances that he was a good man
and that he had done nothing to merit
this outrageous treatment i shut him
off by an impatient  cut it out  at
which a few of the schoolmaams
glared back at me resentfully and then
resumed their walk toward camp

  half an hour later i saw the indig-
nant ones sitting under the platform in
solemn council doubtless considering
what to do about this matter of my in-
human treatment of his majesty but
i doubt if any actual conclusion was
reached at the meeting for i saw miss
peck and miss binney sitting together
after the others had adjourned as
though they were a committee appoint-
ed to suggest some means of action
had i dreamed what the action would
be i should not have been so self-con-
tained and composed that afternoon
but who can predict what a party of
schoolmaams on a desert island is like-
ly to take into its precious heads 

chapter xiii

pleading with angela

any times during that da i had
thought of the chiefs attempt
upon my life his motives for putting
me out of the way were manifest in
the first place he wanted to rid himself
of an odious master secondly he
wanted to rule the island and the cast-
away women but more than anything
he wanted that treasure it would
make a big man of him if ever he
should be able to get back to alamaka
w ith that treasure he could buy as
much of the tinsel trade stuff as any
island monarch possessed and there
would be no end of good things to eat
and drink as for the life of the white


the cavalier

man that stood in the way of these
happy conditions it was of  more
consequence to him than that of a fly

  the fog had lifted and great white
cloud-puffs were floating lazily over the
smooth lagoon a little later ripples
began to dance upon its surface and
toward evening these were succeeded
by white-caps while from the outer
strip of reef the doleful boom and roar
of the surf went up again it was the
same old wind and the same old dismal
beat of the sea that had made the pre-
vious night so unbearable to me

  after supper during which but little
of the talk was addressed to me i went
down and fed my prisoner after which
with my pistol in hand  let him exer-
cise a bit by walking up and down the
sand then after securing him again
and going to my brush shack where the
pearls lay hidden i dug the chest up
out of the sand and while the daylight
lasted i counted the old british coins
there was a little over four hundred
pounds of gold and silver something
like two thousand dollars a handy bit
of money in case we ever should be able
to leave the island

  i replaced the pearls tom had stolen
and matched up a score or more of the
larger ones in the chest it was a
pleasant occupation and one which the
teachers would no doubt have enjoyed
too but i was less inclined than ever
to tell them of my great discovery
dorothy knew to be sure but i felt
that the secret was safe with her

  they were all over at the flag-mound
sitting upon the sandy little slope and
talking low among themselves-that is
all save angela who sat alone under
the platform slowly swinging her bow
in a dolorous adagio her form and
her movements reflected the rare grace
and rarer beauty that i had seen in her
at all times but now she appeared to
me as one who sat upon a distant
height that i could imagine this upon
that low atoll shows what point  had
reached in my wooing her

  truly there had been a lapse in that
wooing and a very uncomfortable if

not a hopeless one for though to me
she was still the whole horizon  was
to her one to be kept at a distance i
wondered if she would have acted the
same toward wallace little if he had
been here in my place and i had been
lost at sea as wallace probably had
been but an analogy could hardly
have been drawn as wallace never had
lived in the islands and never had been
accused of having three panipa wives

   with my hand in the jar among the
big gleaming pearls i looked over to
her and wondered what she would say
if  took the treasure over and showed
it to her perhaps it would soften her
perhaps she would be more favorably
disposed toward me - a man of for-
tune and able to shower fortune upon
others but my heart rejected this sor-
did suggestion  wanted her love for
my own sake i did not wish to bargain
for it and besides she was a proud
little thing and instead of her being
more interested in me she might think
the less of me after all

  putting the treasure back in itsf
hiding-place i made bold to go up to
the platform and stood leaning against
a tree not far from where she sat it
was a strange scene - that lone girl
playing the music of a far-off land
upon that little desert isle her mel-
ancholy air lent to her beauty such a
depth as i had never seen in it before
her dark hair hanging in a flat lus-
trous loop over either side of her fair
brow gave her an old-fashioned look
that to me was very engaging there
was a mystic touch in the slow insist-
ent appealing drone of her violin that
held my heart

   i knew that she was conscious of my
presence and yet she made nothing of
it i might have been a stick or a stone
or the sand under her feet she was
not playing for me and my coming had
made no change in her mood which
matched the lonely roar of the surf
even when the last low note had died
away she still sat there looking out
upon the sea through the palms amid
which shadows were deepening
schoolmaam island	

   may i ask what that was  i said
when she laid the violin in her lap

   its a little hungarian song i
have forgotten the composers name

   it is divine i burst forth rhap-
sodicauy  and you played it divinely
i have never heard any one else plav
it and i never shall want to

   i am glad you like it she said
with little expression of interest
thousrh her face had softened under

 o	b

my ardent appreciation

   dont put it away play some-
thing else play  ich liebe dich no
i dont suppose you would be willing to
do that for me

  the cold far-away look came into
her dark eyes again as again she looked
out through the darkening palms to
the sea

   im not in a mood for that to-
night its a trivial worn-out thing
anyway

  it could never seem trivial or out-
worn to me i said passionately and
with a significant look at her that deep-
ened the color upon her face  and
you know why angela

   mr sibley if you talk to me at
all  - her dark brows drew together
as she spoke- it must not be in these
terms

   then the silly tale of a silly
kanaka-

   i have made no reference to that
she interrupted

   but you have it in mind and its
absurd i could bring him to you in a
moment and make him take it all back
 doubtless you could she said
with a significant air of distrust  but
i am not interested in that chapter of
your life it means nothing to me

    but you are interested in it i in-
sisted moving a little nearer to her on
the bench  i cannot believe otherwise
you strongly suspect that theres some-
thing in the story that has set all the
women here wtagging their tongues
against me-that is all but one doro-
thy shaw surely if she regards it as
an idle tale you should be able to take
the same view of it

    	c

   has she told you she disbelieved
it   she asked a little curiously and
with what seemed to me a touch of re-
sentment

   she has

   oh dorothy is a very charitable
girl-she never pays the slightest heed
to-to reports about anybody

   an admirable trait i spoke care-
lessly without ttfought of the effect of
my words

   glad you think so she flung out
crisply  no doubt she has many
other qualities that you admire a
flash of white teeth went with these
words and i knew that her proud
spanish blood was stirring

  it was not the manliest part in the
world to plav but being human and
rejoicing to find that her indifference
was only a mask i could not help
adding

   yes-frankness ready friendship
and sociability then too she lias
none of the mob spirit she thinks for
herself she doesnt accept ready-
made opinions

   i have the mob spirit i suppose
she remarked a little scornfully

  no i dont say that but you are
influenced by what those women have
said about me and particularly by their
complete acceptance of that fantastic
tale of taumatoas the teachers have
treated it like a rich piece of village
gossip and you have listened to it

   oh i have listened she admitted
 but it has had no effect upon me

   but it evidently has had some ef-
fect i insisted  why couldnt you
have let it pass as dorothy did 

   oh dorothy she said with an-
other touch of irony  is a very nice
girl a girl of a thousand they say
she has many friends and admirers at
home-men friends as well as girls
she added as if to give me a draft
of my own medicine and then she
must have bethought herself that there
was something too concessional in
what she  ad been saying for she tact-
fully retreated behind her violin

  with a quick movement she thrust


the cavauer

the instrument under her chin and
flirted out the little scherzo she had
played that morning the music dain-
tily tripping through playful passages
wrought a change in the mood of each
of us i think it brought out more of
her good nature but  received little
benefit of it still it was something to
have talked with her on any terms

  when her violin had sportively
trilled out the last notes of the piece
and i saw the schoolmaams coining
back i thanked her said good night
and went off to my shack

  perhaps it betrays a mean spirit in
me to say so but as i lay there on my
low couch looking down upon the la-
goon i was glad that i had aroused
that jealous humor in her for of course
it could have signified nothing else than
that her air of indifference was studied
and assumed it was good to be as-
sured of this the night wind came
more gently to my ear and the surf
had a more friendly sound after all
hers was a deep nature and-well i
loved her and could no more help lov-
ing her than the wind-lashed waves
could help rolling in upon the beach

  but despite the vaguely gratifying
interview with angela i had a new and
strange sense of anxiety that night as
i lay there upon my brush couch which
crackled and creaked under me as i
stirred and turned uneasily trying to
sleep when i took out my watch and
made it repeat the hour i was vexed to
find it was only a quarter past nine i
was vexed because i knew it would be
hours before i could sleep there was
nothing to smoke nothing to read and
 longed for human companionship

   the girls were sitting by a little lire
they had lighted near the platform i
wanted to get up and go over and talk
with them but i should have felt con-
strained with the echoes of our un-
pleasant debate over tom still in the
air and so i lay there until one by
one they mounted the ladder in a queer
little procession and pulling it up after
them went to roost in their odd retreat

   as  look back upon it all now it was

not the days that i spent upon that
island that seem so irksome to me it
was the nights when they closed in
there was always an eery feeling
abroad and to-night more than ever
 could not get it out of my head that
there was something sinister impend-
ing you will say this was quite natu-
ral after my tussle with the murderous
tom only the night before but i had
seen the kanaka safely secured and
was not thinking much about him nor
was it the thought of an oncoming
storm for of that i should have been
warned bv a violent increase of the
wind which was now blowing steadily
but not heavily from the west and
yet so impressed was  with a feeling
of approaching danger that i lay awake
with my eyes fixed upon the platform

  i have known persons to go to the
country for their health and to come
back with fully developed cases of in-
somnia referable to the strangeness of
their surroundings and i tried to trace
my own symptoms to this cause and to
discount all the danger but it would
not be discounted for in spite of my
self-assurance that he was safe from
mischief my thoughts kept reverting
to tom and something told me that i
should be looking after him again i
was like the farmer who must be get-
ting up in the night and going out to
see that his horses are safe and it was
with just as little relish for the noctur-
nal chore that i rose and went down to
toms shack

  when i reache  the place struck a
match and looked in i found that my
horse was gone there on the floor
were the ropes with which he had been
bound and before my match went out
i saw that those which had bound his
hands were cut in three or four places
while the leg lashings had been untied
in an instant it came to me who had
cut those knots it was not tom for
he had no knife or other sharp instru-
ment at hand it was some of the
schoolmaams whose precious sym-
pathy for outraged humanity had led
them to take this misguided step
schoolmaam island



  well they had overreached me and
shown their contempt for masculine
judgment and masculine brutality but
they had left him to loosen his own
feet which showed that they had given
themselves time to get away before he
was at liberty

  now i deplored my decision to keep
in the background the real reason for
toms imprisonment i saw it had
been a piece of absurd chivalry this
sparing them the constant fears they
would have had on their own account
if they had known that the kanaka was
capable of such a bloodthirsty attack
as he had made upon me the night be-
fore

  nor was there much comfort in the
probability that because of my fancied
wish for retaliation upon him as an in-
former against me they would not
have credited my story and would still
have clamored for his release

  but it made me more sore than ever
to think that they could not have relied
upon my judgment in my male self-
sufficiency it seemed clear to me that
they should have done so in any case
judge if i was not hot as i picked up
the several strands and took them up to
the waning light of the camp-fire and
proved to myself that they were really
cut

   i was so distraught with anger par-
ticularly when i recalled the sneering
looks and biting tones of miss peck
and miss binney during our verbal
tussle that for a time i was for throw-
ing over my guardianship of the supe-
rior-minded females and letting them
shift for themselves i believe that if
it were not for angela and dorothy i
could have done so

  going back to the coral cabin re-
volver in hand i peered into the shad-
ows of the near-by palms hoping that
i might espy the runaway tom i
searched the thickets along the jungle
edge down to the lagoon and back
again but i saw no trace of him

  but once just before i gave up the
hunt a queer call from away down the
beach was blown to me upon the wind

it may have been the cry of some lone
night-bird but i fancied that it was the
voice of the released chief and i
thought i detected a note of derision
in it

chapter xiv

the fight on the platform

vwell the rascally tom was at large
 and there was no use of hunting
about for him any more that night so
i went back to my shack and lay pistol
in hand where my eye could take in as
much of the camp as possible for the
white mans burden now lay more
heavily upon me than ever and i had a
new and more justifiable sense of dan-
ger than when i had first lain down for
the night

  about two in the morning while the
dipper was lying low in the northwest
a sleepy glance toward the roost re-
vealed to me the sight of something
detaching itself from the black border
of the grove and stealing toward the
girls camp it was a low creeping
thing and in my drowsy state i at
first took it to be a wild animal of some
sort but nearing a palm trunk that
formed a corner-post of the platform
the creature rose suddenly and began to
climb the tree with the obvious inten-
tion of mounting to the tent

  of course it was that infernal tom
instantly i sprang up and made toward
him with my automatic in my hand i
thought to surprise him by dodging in
among the trees and pouncing upon
him before he could learn that i was
on the alert but i had not gone ten
steps from the shack before my foot
caught in a tangled mass of palm-roots
and i fell headlong dropping my pistol

  i rose quickly and groped about for
the weapon found it at last and flung
on impatient of the loss of time soon
the dark square of the roost rose above
me i determined at once to climb one
of the tree-supports and if possible
capture the intruder without awaken-
ing the schoolmaams


the cavalier

  as things turned out it would have
been better for me to have called out
and frightened him away for lie had
now gained the platform but  did not
wish to alarm angela and dorothy the
only ones among the teachers who had
not forfeited my esteem also 
thought this the best way to effect the
recapture of the released prisoner who
would have jumped down and escaped
had he heard me approach

  so silently and without hesitation
i climbed one of the nearest tree-posts
and paused for a moment upon a cor-
ner of the platform to recover my
breath and look for the intruder
there he was on all fours his head and
shoulders inside the tent i moved
quietly toward him and pressing the
cold muzzle of the pistol against the
back of his bare neck i whispered

   come out of there you beast or
ill blow your head off and dont
make any noise about it

  of course he knew who it was that
had made this rear attack upon him
he obeyed my order on the instant and
so quietly as not to disturb the girls it
seemed easy sailing to me and already
i saw him back in the coral hut safely
secured for the night

  but theres no counting on a kanaka
as i might have remembered when i
motioned him toward the ladder which
i directed him to let down that we
might descend quietly from the plat-
form he made as if to obey meekly
but pretended that he did not know
how to perform the simple act im-
patient of delay i slipped the pistol
into my pocket seized the ladder and
was about to swing it into position
when of a sudden he flung himself
forward as if from a catapult and
clutched me by the wrists with violent
hands

  the ladder banged down upon the
ground and at the same instant in
trying to pull away from him i
brushed heavily against the tent my
foot tripped over one of the fiber stay-
ropes and down we both came upon the
platform in a rolling struggle shaking

the roost as if by an earthquake while
the screams of the terrified teachers
rent the night air

  among the wild voices i recognized
that of angela and  could not help
smiling grimly as i tried to break loose
from my antagonist when i heard her
call my name in a terrified little treble

   im here  i called back between
gasps  dont be alarmed stay in-
side the tent all of you 

  vainly i tried to free my right hand
and get it into my pistol-pocket he
saw what i was trying to do and held
on to that hand with clenching fingers
and presently with his teeth with
his sharp fangs buried in my right fore-
arm he still clung to both my wrists
while we lay struggling upon the plat-
form often rolling perilously near the
edge of it

   this is what you get for letting
him loose  i heard dorothy cry out
to miss peck and while i fought off
the mad attacks of the frenzied kanaka
i had the satisfaction of hearing the
principal admit amid frightened sobs
yes it was a mistake-all a mis-
take he should have been kept tied
up there oh dear oh dear i
hope he wont kill poor mr sibley

  yes they understood the situation
for as i afterward learned one of the
girls had seen tom poking his head
into the tent and had lain in terrified
silence until the outside uproar had
brought from her the screaming in-
formation of what it was all about

  but  was paying little heed to my
charges just then i was trying des-
perately to free my right hand but this
was not so easy clutched as it was at
the wrist by toms sinewy fingers and
in the viselike grip of his jaws so
deeply did his sharp tusks enter my
forearm that i could feel the warm
blood trickling down my shirt sleeve

  tt looked as though he had the bet-
ter of me but of a sudden i turned
and getting my knees under me i
raised myself a little and jerked my
left hand free from his grasp in an-
other moment i should have borne him
schoolmaam island



down under me freed my right hand
and got my pistol into play but he
twisted over to the very edge of the
platform

   caught a glimpse of dorothy who
had sprung out with something white
in her hand which she lifted above the
head of the struggling kanaka he
gave a violent lurch the platform
swayed under us and in a twinkling
we both dropped heavily to the ground
amid the shrieks of the girls

  i must have come down like a log
with tom atop of me my head smote
the earth so that i saw more stars than
ever were in heaven but though pow-
erless to rise i was still conscious
enough to feel him groping for my
pistol in the murk of my muddled
mind there was now but one idea and
that was to keep him from securing
that invaluable weapon as if in a
nightmare my hand instinctively
sought the pocket which held it and
my fingers closed upon its hard handle
as the fingers of the oft-quoted drown-
ing man close upon a straw

  but his lean brown hand gripped
mine of a sudden and though i clung
to the weapon with what little of my
spent force remained he surely would
have wrested it from me but for dor-
othy and angela i heard them shout
from the platform and some missile-
i knew not what-thudded down upon
the kanaka as he bent over me intent
upon the possession of the pistol again
and again a hurtling object flew down
upon him at last he groaned spas-
modically his clutch upon me relaxed
and in the feeble light i saw him rise
and dash away among the trees

  i tried to get up and go in pursuit
of him but the effort was a vain one
my head swam my ears sang the
dusky palms swung before my eyes
and i lay back limply upon the ground
the cries of the women sounded as
from afar and soon they were lost in
the gray mist of a mind inert

  when i awoke i was lying in the
tent and angela was bending over me
it was broad daylight i could hear the

low buzz of the schoolmaams talking
in quiet tones and saw them sitting in
a row upon tbe edge of the roost
they had drawn wide the flap of the
tent to give me air but as they had been
afraid of a further attack from tom
they were sticking to the platform

  angelas fervent eyes looked the joy
and relief she felt in my coming round

  are you much hurt- she asked
eagerly

   only my head i replied after i
had bestirred myself to see if any bones
had been broken  its still a little
groggy if he hadnt fallen on top of
me i dont fancy serving as a shock-
absorber for one of his weight

   was he on top of you when you
fell   she cried sympathetically
 oh the miserable villain 

   thatwasnt so much his fault i
said trying to smile  we came down
together and- i moved my right
hand and saw that it was bandaged

   thats a bad wound you have
did he stab you  she asked in a sym-
pathetic little tone

  no i believe he gouged me with
his teeth was it you that band-
aged it 

   yes she replied quietly

   im glad i said in a low whisper
and she smiled

  after all it was worth while to have
been bitten by the beast and i began to
say so when she put a finger upon my
mouth and nodded toward the others

  how did they get me up here
i asked

   carried you dorothy did most of
it we came near breaking the ladder
with so many of us on it

   you beat him off didnt you you
threw things at him 

   yes the cowries

did you break any of them 

   a few

  too bad-theyre very valuable
those shells

   oh wed have thrown them if
theyd been gold nuggets but dont
talk too much if your head hurts do
you want anything-a cup of water 


the cavalier

   it would go pretty well said i
s but i fancy there isnt much left

   you shall have it if its the last
drop she declared fervently  will
you go with me dorothy to ietch some
water from the cask  

   certainly said dorothy

   take the pistol said i handing it
t them and use it if he ventures
near

  the schoolmaams let down the lad-
der and the two girls descended

   keep a sharp lookout warned
miss peck  and be ready to run it you
catch sight of him

   girls she said to the others  i
w ish you would all act as sentinels for
a while  want to speak to mr sib-
ley she came in with a contrite air
which i was just mean enough to enjoy

   mr sibley she began in an hum-
ble friendly tone  i owe you an apol-
ogy you evidently had the best in-
terests of all of us at heart when you
imprisoned that miserable tom we
had not dreamed that he was capable
of such a-a misdemeanor you know
the islanders better than we do and in
future we shall abide by your judgment
in all such matters are you much
hurt  

  no thank you said i just
shaken up a bit by my fall my head
feels a little fuzzy-thats all

   i hope you will be better soon
she said in sympathetic tones

  presently angela came up the ladder
and into the tent with a shell containing
water which she handed to me i
drained it gratefully dorothy had
also brought water in another shell
angela wet her handkerchief folded it
and laid it on my forehead while the
others retired to the little porch

   that feels good i said and
thanked her but what felt better was
the touch of her cool dainty fingers
upon my brow as she stroked it gently
in smoothing back my hair before she
put on the handkerchief

  have they seen anything of the
kanaka lately  i asked her

   not for a couple of hours just

before sunrise we saw him poking about
in the woods in and around your

shack

  was he in the shack long i
asked eagerly and with a sinking feel-
ing at my heart

   in the shack yes-half an hour
or more he was in and out several
times

   did he-did he carry away any-
thing  i sprang up as i spoke and
she looked curiously at me

   we didnt see him go away he
must have torn aside the brush and
gone out through the woods lie down
again it isnt good for you to be-

   are you sure lie isnt there yet 
i broke in excitedly

   yes we saw him through the gap
away down below the coral hut just
before you woke tip

   there he is now-away dowrn the
beach  cried dorothy pointing at a
distance - diminished figure walking
along the lagoon shore a quarter-tnile
beyond the coral hut then she turned
and looked at me in a way that made
me know she understood my eager in-
quiry about tom having taken some-
thing from the shack  some of you
keep a lookout wrhile ruth and i go
and get breakfast im hungry enough
to eat half a dozen eggs

   very well said i  but give me
the pistol ill keep guard up here
and i sat up in bed with the weapon
in my hand and a miserable sinking
feeling at heart for it mattered not
how well i guarded the camp he had
the treasure and i might never see it
again

  soon the smoke of the camp-fire was
drifting past the roost and appetizing
smells arose to where i lay the girls
though still on the alert were jolly
again and were venturing little jokes
about the situation

  as i was able to eat a good breakfast
i knew that my injuries were not se-
rious what troubled me most was
the thought of the kanaka having ran-
sacked my shack the chest was buried
in the sand in a corner near my couch
schoolmaam island	

had he ferreted it out it so it was
no wonder that he had made a secret
exit through the rear and into the
grove

  i was burning to be up and to find
out the worst but it was some hours
before i could persuade angela to let
me leave the roost and go to my couch
in the shack she consented only upon
my insisting that i felt much better and
was fully able to walk

  but i had to brace myself pretty
stiffly as i made my way light-headedly
along the sand and into the shack
there i found everything in the wild-
est confusion the brush couch had
been torn to pieces and the sand under
it had been burrowed into the ground
had been probed all around as if with
a sharp stick and a quick glance into
the corner where the chest had been
buried revealed the sickening fact that
it had been unearthed and removed

chapter xv
watching and waiting

though i live a hundred years i
probably never shall feel again
such a bewildered sense of bafflement
and dismay nor such anger as i felt
standing there in that little shack and
staring into the vacant hole from which
my precious treasure had been rifled

  the brass chest and its great wealth
of jewels and gold were gone and
might never be recovered and all be-
cause of the silly sentimentality of a
lot of meddling schoolmaams true
the island was a small one but the jun-
gle was over a mile long and the
hiding-places were many it might be
difficult for the kanaka king ever to get
his loot off and away to a place where
he might enjoy it but that loot was in
the possession of a man who as proved
by what had happened during the past
two nights had lapsed back into a state
of perfect savagery

   it would be necessary to maintain the
strictest guard over the camp to keep
him from descending upon us and kill-

ing us all i felt that his greedy regard
for the treasure and the safe making
away with it to alamaka whenever
occasion might arise would lead to
such a bloody action on his part i he
could devise the means just what
those means might be seeing that he
was not armed in any way i could not
surmise but one thing was certain-
from that time forth ray vigilance must
never be relaxed for a moment

  here was the white mans burden
with a vengeance but nothing remained
for me to do despite my enfeebled con-
dition but to take up that burden and
bear it as best  might it came to me
as i stood there looking off over the
sands in the vain hope of catching sight
of the robber that the wily islander had
planned the looting of the pearls in a
manner to do justice to the most stra-
tegically minded white man

  what better way could have been de-
vised to have gotten me out of the
shack away from the treasure than
this ruse-for it evidently was a ruse-
of trying to enter the girls tent in the
night it had been a clever though
dastardly plan and worse luck it had
worked

  for a long time i stood in the door
of the shack looking down over the
lagoon and the dazzling strip of white
sand that lay on either side of it and
trying to rally my physical forces to
the point of going forth to hunt down
the piratical chieftain but the more i
endeavored to prod myself up to the
action the weaker i seemed to become
and soon i dropped limply upon the
couch

  i must have lain there half an hour
in a sort of drowsy torpor during
which i tried vainly to keep on the
lookout for the return of the murder-
ous chief when i heard angela calling
to me

  i	steadied my voice to reply but my
tone must have alarmed her for she
came running down and soon her
sweet face was bending over me and
she was crying in a dismayed voice 

   oh i should never have let you
tiie cavalier



come out here you are worse off
than you were trying to make me be-
lieve you must go hack to the roost
and remain there until you arc well

   im all right i tried to reassure
her  its just my head its awfully
hot and-

  her hand touched my forehead

   why you are feverish  she cried

	you must go back at once

  she went out and called dorothy
who came immediately and was be-
ginning to scold me for overtaxing my
strength when of a sudden her eye
took in the upheaved condition of
tilings in the shack and she cried off-
guardedly

   the treasure has lie stolen it 
what treasure demanded an-
gela with a puzzled air

  tell her  said nodding to the
other girl

  dorothy told her

  angelas face whitened a little it
was in character that she should care
less for the pearls or the loss of them
than for the humiliating fact that no
knowledge of them had been trans-
mitted to her

   oh a secret  she flung out with
a show of coolness  and i was not
considered of enough importance to be
let into it 

   well you see- i began in apolo-
getic tones

   remember my dear angela
broke in dorothy  that at the time
mr sibley brought in that treasure
from the wreck you and the others
were not in a state to inspire con-
fidences in fact mr sibley couldnt
get near you you had chosen to ac-
cept the idle tale of that criminal
kanaka rather than any statement a
reputable gentleman might offer

   oh i was wrong-i was wrong 
admitted angela readily  only i
couldnt bear the thought of-

   of my having three native wives
in ianipa i put in rather indifferently

   no t couldnt bear it repeated
angela  i suppose it is my nature
to be-

  to be awfully jealous finished
dorothy with a smile  will you let
me say something it has been appar-
ent from the first that you two have
cared a lot for each other  dont
know just how much you were taken
by that long-legged wallace little
dear but i am sure you cared for mr
sibley and that you have been very
silly to listen to these tales about him

   he couldnt tell any of you about
the treasure while you were holding
him off at arms length and looking so
accusingly at him but he did tell me
for he knew that i didnt believe what
that old tomato had been babbling to
us just before he sprung his wholesale
proposal but now you know every-
thing about the treasure and the fact
that it has been stolen which is enough
news for one day

   what i propose is that after we
get mr sibley back to the roost he
shall let me take the pistol and go and
hunt down that thieving kanaka and
take that brass chest away from him

  i shook my head i said that she
was a brave girl but that i could not
dream of letting her go out on such a
dangerous errand in a little while 
should be able to go myself and per-
haps she might accompany me the
idea of her going along was put forth
simply to satisfy her for i had no in-
tention of letting her help me hunt
down a desperate thief in the jungle

  they fussed a lot over me and so
did miss peck and the others all in-
sisting that i should return to the plat-
form but i stubbornly remained there
in the shack until toward evening when
a cool wind rose and seemed to revive
me then with angela on one side
and dorothy on the other and the rest
trailing along in the rear i was led to-
ward the roost my queer procession
of schoolmaam escorts helped me up
the ladder to the platform and at my
suggestion a couch was made on the
little porch in front of the tent

  by this time all the teachers knew
about the treasure and of its loss miss
binneys interest in the story was fair-
schoolmaam island



   ly palpitant she kept talking and talk-
ing about the pearls and bewailing the
loss of them

    i have always hated school-teach-
ing i heard her say to ruth deming
 and to think that i have really had
a fortune of at least fifty thousand dol-
lars - thats what he said each girl
would have gotten didnt he - and
knew nothing about it  think its real
mean he didnt tell us we might have
kept those pearls in a safer place-on
the platform or somewhere

   mr sibley did what he thought
was for the best replied ruth  and
really fanny as long as he was staying
each night in the shack guarding the
treasure and us with his revolver 
dont see how he could have done any
better

    but if he had told us we should at
least have had the pleasure of knowing
about our good fortunes while they
lasted demurred miss binney as
it was theres no satisfaction in it at
all

   i dont see what youve got to
grieve about my dear said the sunny
ruth  why should you bemoan the
loss of a treasure that you knew noth-
ing about 

   but i ought to have known about
it-he should have told us all instead
of simply making a confidante of
dorothy shaw

  oh fanny cried miss peck
who like the rest of us had overheard
this strange bit of talk  dont chatter
so we ought to be thankful matters
are no worse beside the treasure may
be recovered

    i certainly hope it will be re-
turned miss binney though i sup-
pose theres small chance of that
despite my lack of sympathy with
the girls cynical way t could not help
thinking that her last remark held a lot
of truth

   i lay on the platform before the tent
that night pistol in hand nervously
thrashing about on my rude bed an-
gela and ruth deming kept watch
through the tent-flap and thus i was

able to sleep a little from time to time
awakening now anil again to peer into
the palm shadows or down the beach
for the return of murderous tom

  during the night i planned to rise
early and go forth in quest of my rebel
caliban but when the gray dawn stole
up from the eastern sea and  started
up to venture forth on my quest 
found myself still giddy and uncertain
of motion so that i was compelled to
lie down again which i did with a baf-
fled sigh and with such a nervous fret-
fulness as i never felt before

   in the morning that i might not be
in the way of the girls i insisted on
returning to my shack that day
thanks to the ministrations of the
schoolmaams i gained some strength
but three days and three nights of this
irritating almost maddening waiting
and watching in the shack and on the
roost must needs pass before i was
in any sort of condition to begin the
man-hunt and the quest of the stolen
treasure

chapter xvi

angela in peril

fefore setting out upon what was
to prove the most hazardous ad-
venture of all this island history i gave
angela my knife and dorothy the ax
and asked the schoolmaams to help me
gather as many heavy lumps of coral as
could conveniently be stowed upon the
platform to be used in case of a threat-
ened attack by the kanaka outlaw who
might easily elude me in the jungle and
make his way back to camp during my
absence

  the teachers obeyed the order with
alacrity and soon we had piled upon
the plat from a formidable stack of
coral ammunition as well as all our
stores of food water and sap

   i did not know or even suspect that
while they worked away so diligently
gathering the coral they were planning
something outside the bargain and of
which they doubtless knew i would


the cavalier

wholly disapprove but though  heard
them talking low among themselves
nothing of their plan drifted to my

ears

  the schoolmaams made light of the
loss of the treasure which most of
them seemed to think would be recov-
ered if not that day at least before we
should leave the island

    dont want to go until those
pearls are found declared miss bin-
ney if he lias hidden them as he
probably lias we ought to rake the
island with our side-combs until we
turn them up

  for once she seemed to share the
sentiments of the majority for on
looking about i saw the eyes of the
girls brighten and their faces set deter-
minedly they acted just as a lot of
men would have done in a similar case
but to what length their feeling in the
matter would carry them i did not
dream though i was soon to know

  after breakfast i saw them all safely
up the ladder to the roost and waving
my hand to them and bidding them to
stick closely to their present position
and not to come down on any account
i strode away hastily across the little
sand strip and plunged in among the
palms deeming it best to do my hunt-
ing under cover

  i had not been gone from camp five
minutes when i heard fleet footsteps
behind me and a scurrying through the
brush turning revolver in hand i
saw the whole troop of teachers bear-
ing lightly down upon me through the
grove dorothy leading the way with
the ax followed by angela with the
knife and all the others armed with
clubs which they had cut secretly and
hidden away until their plan of action
was ripe for carrying out

  yes this was the plan and as i
scowled back upon the armed amazons
they must have seen how much  rel-
ished it not but that i admired the
spirit that had led them to join the
chase but to go man-hunting in an
island jungle with a lot of school-
maams was not to my taste

  my protests however were as little
heeded as the dropping of the coconuts
from the trees they had forestalled
them all

   we knew that you would object
said miss peck smoothing back her
great mass of rich brown hair which
had been disarranged in her run
through the brush  that would be
only natural in one of your chivalrous
character i bowed and smiled satiric-
ally  but we knew that you were far
from being well and strong and we
wanted to assist you

   also put in miss binney  we
felt that as each of us was to have her
share in the treasure we should all help
to recover it

   thats putting it on very merce-
nary grounds protested angela  we
wanted to help because-

   because it was our duty finished
miss peck

   and because wed be glad to see
king tomato safe in his coral prison
again added dorothy

   yes owned miss peck  we un-
wisely let him loose and caused you all
this trouble and we wanted to make
the best amends we could

   but i cant let you go with me to
hunt down this wild cannibal i said
 you dont know what it means its
too dangerous

   but we are all armed said angela
 and there can really be no harm in
our going along if we all stick to-
gether

   come  cried fanny binney
lets be moving on he may be
burying our pearls this very minute

   well said i seeing that objection
was useless  if you will stick together
as miss alvarado suggests you may
come let there be no stragglers

   all right they chorused and we
started i in the lead with my revolver
dorothy and angela just behind with
the ax and knife and the rest of the
schoolmaams bunched up in the rear
with their clubs

  there was a world of devil-vine in
that jungle and the girls were con-
schoolmaam island



stantly getting hung up on it again
and again i had to assist them to disen-
tangle their skirts from the impaling
 stickers as they called them but
they were all so good-natured about
these mishaps and so apologetic and
their faces were so bright and hopeful
that i didnt have it in my heart to
send them back as i was on the point
of doing several times

  although i had deemed it best that
we remain under cover during the
greater part of the hunt we twice left
the wood and cautiously emerged upon
the sand once we ventured out to
where we could see the white surf
pounding upon the outer beach and
looked up and down the long strip of
glaring white sand over which the heat
lines were twirling but we saw nothing
of our man we looked for footprints
in the sand but there were none

  when after another fight with the
jungle i led the way out upon the la-
goon side of it we all stared up and
down the flat rim of sand but saw no
living objects save the wheeling birds
and the land crabs that scuttled away
upon our approach

  we were now midway between the
camp and the wreck and could look
back through an opening in the trees
and see the white tent upon the roost
and the curling smoke of our camp-fire

  in the direction of the wreck and
about five hundred yards distant was
a little palm clump thick with cluster-
ing shoots above which rose tall
smooth trunks topped by long-leaved
branches-a green island in the sand
standing about two hundred feet from
the grove and gazing long and narrow-
ly at this clump i thought i saw a dark
figure move quietly amid its shadows
and then disappear in them

  springing forward instantly and
telling the teachers to remain where
they were i ran toward the place
where i had seen the figure which of
course must have been that of the
kanaka

  thinking possibly he might try to
escape from the tree-island to the main

belt of woods i approached the plate
from that side of it and standing be-
tween it and the edge of the jungle 
leveled my pistol and called forth in
commanding tones

   come out of there tom and give
yourself up 

  there was no reply the light
wind rustled and the palm branches
and a sea-bird squawked from some-
where those were the only sounds i
heard save the moaning of the surf to
seaward and a singing in my ears
which reminded me of my weakened
condition

  but though he now probably was
able to overcome me if it came to a
tussle i was armed and he was not at
least he had no firearms and if i got
within range i would be master of the
situation

   it seemed likely that he had chosen
the detached clump of trees as a place
from which he could get a good view
up and down the inner beach and be on
guard against my coming but i was
not fully assured that he was there as
i had seen no further sign of his pres-
ence beside that first and possibly de-
ceptive one

  again i called demanding that he
come forth and saying that if he did
not do so i would come in after him
but still there was no reply

  i hesitated about carrying out my
threat to go into the clump fearing that
he might elude me and dash away into
the forest while i stood there i heard
a flurry of skirts and the sound of foot-
steps and here came my precious
schoolmaams all in a flutter of excite-
ment

  is he in there demanded dor-
othy

    i think so i replied but you
girls had better go back he might-
 lets rout him out  cried the ath-
letic maiden waving her ax while her
eyes blazed with excitement  lets
surround the place set fire to the brush
and roast him out if he wont come any
other way

  but the pearls protested miss


the cavalier

binney  if he has them in there the
fire might damage them and-

   the better plan suggested miss
peck  is for us to surround the thicket
-its small and theres enough of us
to do that-while mr sibley goes in
and tries to secure him if he should
emerge we women can set upon him
with our weapons and i am sure we
can overpower him

  it was a sight to see her wave her
club like a queen of melodrama and to
see her eyes flash defiance toward the
kanakas hiding-place

 dont try anything of the sort i
objected  its too dangerous better
fall back while i go in and nab him
but while i advanced toward the
thicket to carry out my resolution they
proceeded to  surround  the place
as the doughty miss peck had sug-
gested the sight of this thin line of
valiant schoolmaams strung out about
twenty feet apart all around the palm
clump would have made a strategic
warrior smile but they took their sen-
tinelship seriously and no one more so
than miss peck who stood with her
club raised ready at a moments notice
to close in with the rest upon the ka-
naka chief as for angela she stood
quietly knife in hand looking at me
with interested fearful eyes as if she
did not fancy my beating about alone
in that dangerous bush

  peering cautiously into the tangle of
vines and young palms i pushed aside
the brush and entered the thicket i
had not gone twenty feet before i saw
my man crouching behind a mass of
small screw-pines

   ive got you tom  t cried flash-
ing the bright barrel of my pistol
toward him  come along with me
 all ri he assented with a grin
as he rose from his hiding-place and
took a step or two toward me

  it looked like an easy game and i
felt that lie and the treasure were al-
ready mine for doubtless he could be
made to yield it up now that he had
surrendered still i was on the alert
for a kanaka trick it came quickly

enough-quicker indeed than i had

anticipated

   where are the pearls  i asked
him  did you bring them here 

   yes-me got um all rim he grunt-
ed still grinning

   well show them to me give
them up or youll get a hot shot or two
out of this

  u all ri-all ri  he assented eager-
ly  pearl ri over there he pointed
to the tallest of the palms in the clump
 me get um bring um you

   well hurry up i cried eagerly
anxious to get sight again of that old
brass chest

  that was where i made my mistake
i thought that while i had him covered
he would hardly dare to elude me but
that is precisely what he did i lay it
all to my impetuous haste to get my
fingers again on that brass chest
while he went over to the big palm and
stooped down and poked the dead
leaves away from its roots i could
have yelled out in delight over the pros-
pect of the speedy return of the treas-
ure but even while i was gazing full
at him and covering him with my gun
the shifty kanaka with incredible
swiftness dodged behind the big round
hole of the palm and darted through
the brush like a deer towrard its outer
edge

   fired at his retreating form and a
scream rang forth from one of the
cordon of girls on the sand outside
followed by answering screams from
the others had i shot one of them
i ground my teeth in rage to think i
had permitted such a foolish piece of
strategy as the surrounding of the
clump by the teachers i was afraid to
fire again thinking i might risk the life
of some one of the schoolmaams pos-
sibly angela tom probably counted
upon this when he ran out toward them
but i had fired and probably with re-
sults fatal to one of my charges

  in a fever of alarm though with no
thought of letting my man escape i
charged after him through the thicket-
he lashed out a little way ahead of
sciioolmaam island

me as luck would have it the girl
nearest to his point of exit was angela

  i was horrified to see him dash
toward the dear girl though she
flourished the knife threateningly he
made straight at her seized her by the
wrist that held it quickly wrenched the
glittering weapon from her hands and
holding her slight form before him as
a shield from my threatened pistol at-
tack dragged her backward toward the
jungle

  the women screamed again in help-
less fright but dorothy waved her ax
and ran to the rescue while i dashed
toward the treacherous kanaka who
still shielded by angelas form backed
away while he pressed the point of the
knife close to her bosom and cried out
you come near me me kill him
me tink you no come 

  doroth and i paused in uncertainty
while the kanaka pulled the half-faint-
ing angela toward the jungle i did
not dare shoot for fear of killing the
sweet creature whom he was using for
a shield nor did i dare to move for-
ward but stood in agonized terror for
the life of the precious girl for i
knew that the desperate islander would
have carried out his threat in an in-
stant had we ventured upon an attack
but dorothy did not seem to realize
this fully and i had to hold her back
from rushing in pursuit of the treacher-
ous tom with her ax

  it was a terrible moment-the most
terrible in my life-but all i could do
was to stand there and gaze in helpless
rage and horror while the beast made
his way toward the jungle holding my
angela between him and danger and
all the time threatening her with the
knife

      chapter xvii
      hunting for the loot

es it was an awful moment while
i stood there in agonized im-
potence quickly revolving plan after
plan for the rescue of angela from the

hands of the big brown brute nor
was it conducive to clear thinking or
ready action to hear the shouts of the
teachers to each other and to me nor
even those of dorothy who though
cooler than the rest suggested nothing
but the impossible

   why cant we rush in and get her
away from that savage  she cried as
she clutched the handle of her ax and
would have made after him had i not
seized her arm and held her back

  for gods sake dont move i
cried  if you go toward them he
will kill her stand back all of you 

   do you really think he would do
such a thing  cried miss peck

   of course he would i replied in
tortured tones

   well perhaps he would she ad-
mitted  you know his nature better
than we do and im very sorry we
ever let him loose

  she continued to babble on but i
hardly heard her for i was frantically
intent upon every move made by the
desperate islander while he dragged
angela across the sandy space between
the tree clump and the jungle

  presently they reached the fringe of
the forest a mass of short bushy
screw-pines into this dense foliage he
bore her and soon they were lost to
view among the thick dark shrubbery
and still i could trace their move-
ments by the flutter of the branches
and could see that he was going di-
rectly toward the inner wood in which
he doubtless thought to make his
escape would he try to take angela
with him what would become of the
precious girl in such a case

  it hardly seemed likely that he would
make off with her now that he would
 longer need her for a screen a
faint cry issued from the jungle and
as it was impossible for me to stand
there chafing under this terrible re-
straint i started on a mad run across
the sands toward them the teachers
following me into the thicket i
plunged and on to the place whence
the cry had come


the cavalier

  toms entrance had broken a sort of
trail through the shrubbery and i fol-
lowed this like a hound on the scent
until i came to the taller vegetation
not two minutes elapsed between the
time that  heard the crv and the mo-
ment that i caught sight of him drag-
ging angela along through the wood
and looking back furtively from time
to time

  i dodged from tree to tree and i am
sure he did not see me though  gained
upon him in the passage through the
woods deeming himself safe by this
time and no longer in need of his
human shield he was pulling the girl
along by the wrist forcing her to a
half-run by repeated threatenings with
the knife

  it was a mighty risky thing to do
but in that fraction of a second when
i could see the clear space of an arms
length between them i sent a bullet
flying toward the brute it must have
grazed his right cheek for he let go of
the girl and clapped his left hand
upon it

  instantly she sprang aside and he
darted through the underbrush like a
deer with my bullets singing about his
ears i charged madly after him fir-
ing from time to time but he got away
whether wounded or not i did not
know and i went back to angela and
found the precious girl crouching be-
hind the hole of a big palm unharmed

   where is he  she cried stamping
her foot upon the earth  oh i wish
i could have killed him but he was
so strong he got my knife away from
me the brute i wonder what miss
peck thinks of him now and of her
idea of setting him free but oh mr
sibley you saved me and i have for-
gotten to thank you 

 never mind about that i said
are you sure you are not injured 
 not in the least though i was
badly scared where are the girls 
for the time i was glad that the
schoolmaams had not found us-they
had passed a little way to the north
and i had let them go while i attended

to angela pleased to be alone with her
at this delightful moment when she
was restored to me from out of the
hands of that beastly kanaka but
angelas question brought with it the
thought of their danger and of the
pearls and the further pursuit of tom
so  called out to them and they came
trooping over in response to my shouts
full of joy to learn that the fleeing
rascal had left her unmolested

  the schoolmaains wanted to know
all that had happened in the tree clump
and in the jungle and of course i had
to tell them

   well said miss peck with a
heartfelt sigh   am glad that we
escaped a fatality during that terrible
adventure and i am very sorry that
we were unable when we had sur-
rounded his hiding-place to capture
him as we had planned

   i think if he had come within
reaching distance of my ax said
dorothy grimly  that he would never
have troubled us again

   but the pearls  cried miss bin-
ney  perhaps he left them there at
the foot of that big palm-tree as he
told mr sibley lets go back and
see

   yes assented dorothy  well
get them if theyre there

  so we all picked our way out of the
jungle angela proceeding sturdily ap-
parently non the worse for the ad-
venture and not requiring my assist-
ance though it was freely offered i
was more full of joy because of her
escape from the hands of the savage
islander than over any prospect of the
recovery of the treasure

  emerging from the jungle through
the fringe of scrcw-pines we walked
slowly across the sand behind the
others who hastened on intent upon the
treasure i could not help smiling
when with dorothy and her ax in the
lead the teachers broke through the
brush and disappeared in the grove

   i should think you would want to
be there when the treasure is found
suggested angela to me  it has cost
schoolmaam island



you so much labor and so much
trouble

   oh the treasure is all very well i
said  and i am eager enough to re-
cover it but just at this moment i am
glad that they are all out of sight and
that i am alone with you

  her color mounted a little as i
breathed the words and went on in
ardent tones to tell how rejoiced i was
over her escape

   yon dont know how much you are
to me i said  or how much-

   rut mr sibley she broke in in
protesting tones  arent you anxious
about the treasure she started
toward the tree clump but i would not
let her go  arent you interested
in it

   not half as much as i am inter-
ested in you i declared fervently
 you are the treasure i am looking
for now the other can wait forgive
me for bringing it up so soon after
whats happened but its the only
chance ive had to tell you that i love
you angela and i want you to marry
me will you  

  her face clouded a little but just as
her lips parted to make reply a joyous
cry arose from one of the girls

   come quick mr sibley-angela
weve found the chest 

  at this call angela who seemed
little the worse for her misadventure
sprang into the thicket and i followed
her to where the girls were bending
over the brass chest

  isnt this fortunate   cried miss
peck  now we can take the treasure
back to camp and hide it safely away
from that lawless marauder

   i think wed better divide it first
suggested miss binney  lets open
it up and see the pearls

   no said ruth deming  lets
wait until we get the chest into camp
we can take turns carrying it its not
as large as a suit-case

   and it isnt very heavy remarked
dorothy as she picked up the chest

   let me carry it said i taking it
from her hands then i gave a groan

and the girls looked at me reading dis-
appointment and dismay in my face

  i hardly dared to say what was in my
mind but dorothy was right-it was
not heaa-y in fact it was very light
setting it upon the ground i lilted the
lid which had been left unfastened
and groaned again in fact we all
groaned in as dismal a chorus as i ever
have heard miss binneys voice being
heard above all the rest

  why its empty she wailed
 its empty that miserable thief has
taken them all out

   and the gold is gone too  cried
ruth

   where do you suppose he has left
them  asked dorothy turning to me
with an anxious look

   i cant surmise i said with a
world of depression  perhaps some-
where among these trees

   lets hunt for it  cried miss bin-
ney beginning to poke about with her
club

  soon all the teachers were searching
the little grove i took the ax and cut
cross-sections from one end of the
thicket to the other and the girls pulled
aside the cut brush and prodded about
in every little hollow place but no
cache did we discover

  flushed and tired the teachers at
last gave up the search the shadows
were lengthening upon the sands as
hungry and weary we made our way
back to camp i was angry with my-
self for not having gotten angela back
there long before and helped her to a
little of the nourishment but when
walking by her side i spoke of this she
said blithely

   oh treasure-hunters live upon ex-
citement you know  i havent seemed
to miss my lunch at all

chapter xviii
the menace of the sea

the next morning i tried to get
angela away from the others and
have an understanding with her before
the cavalier



i ventured forth again to recapture
tom and his loot all during the night
that picture of her in the arms of the
big savage had fluttered wildly before
my eyes never had i known how
much i loved her as in that moment of
her great peril

   was burning to pursue my inter-
rupted wooing at the earliest possible
moment whether or not the pearls
were recovered was a matter of small
importance compared with her longed-
for promise that she should be mine

  impatiently and fretfully  awaited
an opportunity to have a word with her
alone but none came and when i tried
to make one she would be no party to
the plan but held aloof

  not that she was suffering in any
way from the effects of her adventure
of the day before for she seemed to be
as blithe as ever but she paid little heed
to the tender looks i gave her covertly
from time to time and seemed to be
fearful of being left alone with me lest
i should be harping upon the love-
string

  what did this mean  i was not one
to count upon the part i had played in
rescuing her from the arms of the
kanaka and she must have known it
all i wanted was a chance to renew my
suit and she would not give it to me
though she had been so solicitous of
my welfare after my fall from the plat-
form and evidently had abandoned the
notion that there was anything in
toms talc about my native wives it
seemed that i had gained nothing by
my devotion to her sometimes i
fancied that after all she had left her
heart upon the sinking steamer with
wallace little

  but our situation demanded that i
put aside all thoughts of jove and make
our position more secure for it was
anything but secure and was constant-
ly threatened while toni was at large

  ft was oppressively hot that morn-
ing and the sea lay dead about the
island with no surf to speak of and
not a breath of air stirring when i
set out to renew the hunt the girls all

wanted to go with me but my pro-
tests in which  did not fail to cite the
sorry example of what had happened
the day before made them desist from
their importunities at last

   i know i could be of some assist-
ance to you said dorothy in a dis-
appointed tone  but of course if you
dont want me i wont go

   you just stay here and help guard
the platform i directed then 
walked away waving my hand to them
and stealing a quiet look back at
angela

  whether it was mere fancy or not
the little one seemed to me a bit more
dejected than the rest though they
were all thoughtful enough and loath
to let me go upon what they evidently
considered a perilous errand

  it was perilous enough that i knew
for there was but one bullet left in my
automatic and unless i could bring
him down with that i should be at a
decided disadvantage for he had my
knife and i had insisted upon angela
keeping the other the one i had taken
from tom on the night of his first at-
tack upon me but i knew he had a
wholesome respect for the pistol at
close range though at a little distance
he had seemed to disregard it which
latter feeling unfortunately might have
been aided by my bad markmanship on
the previous day still though  had
not distinguished myself in the matter
of running shots it pleased me to think
that the one that had grazed his cheek
had saved angela out of his hands

  going down to the coral cabin across
the hot sands i stood there for a little
while in its welcome shade and looked
down the open space in the direction of
the wreck the lagoon lay like a pan
of quicksilver under the cloudless sky
and i had never heard the outside surf
send up such a low lazy roar i knew
the signs it was going to be a day ol
merciless heat-such a day as wre
traders used to loaf away in our ham-
mocks but there was no loafing to be
done with that wild beast loose upon
the island
schoolmaam island

  as tom was nowhere in sight upon
the sands on either side of the lagoon
i went over to the little grove with the
intention of skirting it from end to end
and looking into every opening as i
passed

   had got no farther than a quarter-
mile and was just rounding an out-
lying point when i was startled by
shrill cries from behind and around the
nearest palm-clump swung into view
my precious flock of schoolmaams
each with her club in her hand waving
me wildly to halt i stopped and gazed
at them in consternation what in the
world had happened

  when they came up miss peck
called out in explanation 

  we saw him from the platform
pie came out of the woods near the
coral cabin a few minutes after you
left it

   yes cried miss binney  and he
had something in his hand-a white
bundle

   do you know what i think that
bundle is said ruth i left my
middy blouse hanging on a bush near
camp two days ago and i havent seen
it since its made of good stout
drilling and he took it along to put the
treasure in as it would be more easily
carried than in the brass chest

   where is he now  i demanded
angry with myself for having over-
looked him though he doubtless had
hidden away from me very carefully
 in the cabin  

  no said dorothy he stayed
there only a minute or two and then
hurried into the woods his bundle in
his hand but he didnt come near the
platform and hes nowhere between
here and camp for we have hunted all
the way along for him

   probably he crossed the woods and
went along the outside beach i sug-
gested if so he must have gone on
ahead toward the wreck you girls
go back to camp and ill attend to him
 no persisted dorothy  were
going along and help hunt him down
 were not going to lose those

    	c

pearls declared miss binney no
doubt hes got them in that bundle
we want to help you get them back

    but i cried sharply  i cant let
 you come its horribly hot and going
 to be hotter and-

    dont send us back  pleaded an-
 gela  we must help you you want
 to capture him and it might be hard to
 do that alone and unaided

   my reproving frown probably lost
 something of its sternness when i
 looked at the girl i loved

   ruth and the others all joined in the
 plea to be allowed to go along and help

   for a moment i threatened not to
 proceed and in fact made a half-
 hearted pretense of returning but i
 saw that they were all in dead earnest
 and there was nothing to be done but
 to play male leader again to this ama-
 zon chorus

   one thing i stipulated however and
 that wras that i was to precede them
 by at least a hundred yards which 
 thought should keep them out of im-
 vmediate danger to this arrangement
 they reluctantly consented after all
 they were as brave a lot of girls as ever
 was and i could not help being proud
 of their soldierlike loyalty and sym-
 pathetic comradeship

   but brave as they were and ready
 to aid me it must have been a hard
 tramp for the girls over that torrid
 sancl and through the thickets where
 the air was stiflingly close and humid
 they trudged valiantly forward how-
 ever rarely resting for a moment for
 they were as determined to remain near
 me as  was to keep the allotted dis-
 tance ahead of them their faces were
 red and their hair tousled but they
 held to the pace their sticks in their
 hands and their bright eyes peering all
 about about noon after we had ex-
 plored every cluster of palms every
 thicket and every stretch of barren
 coral sand from our camp to the lower
 end of the island i halted under a wide-
 spreading palm and as the girls came
 up i gave them a good rest there

    isnt it terribly hot  complained


the cavalier

miss binney throwing herself down
languidly on the ground  so op-
pressive i can hardly breathe

   it is warm rejoined miss peck
rather severely for she like the rest
of us was tired of the girls querulous
tone  but we shall have to make the
best of it

   but theres such a sticky stuffy
feel in the air persisted miss binney
 its generally been quite dry but now
its so sultry-almost prostrating

  something significant was conveyed
to me by her idle words i rose and
stepped forth into the clear space just
outside the shade of the palm and
stared across the sands and down to the
waters edge on each side of the narrow
land-strip as i did so i became con-
scious of a meteoric condition that had
probably held for some time though
owing to the rigor of the search i had
not observed it before a coppery glow
was reflected from the sky upon the
island turning the bright verdure of
the palms to a sickly spectral green and
making the dead waters of the lagoon
burn with an unearthly liquid light
while the sand shone forth a pale
yellow

  the air was thick and more oppress-
ive than in a tight steam-heated room
with the mercury at ninety there was
a deathlike silence all about-the out-
side surf having almost ceased to roll
and the palm leaves standing as still as
though in a conservatory

  of a sudden the silence was broken
by the squawks of a great flock of sea-
birds hurtling through the air from
some distant place and settling down
upon the placid lagoon

  i had not cruised four years among
the islands not to know what these
signs meant a big blow was coining
from some quarter it might be an
hour or two before the hurricane struck
the island and it might be half a day
going back to where miss peck sat
in the shade still fanning herself i
spoke to her quietly about the coming
storm and urged her to take the girls
back to camp

   do you think there is any immedi-
ate likelihood of its approach she

asked

  she saw me hesitate in my reply and
instantly added with a smile oh i
fancy you dont apprehend that it
looks so calm i think we might stay a
while longer there is only a small
part of the wood left unexplored we
shall soon find him and get back the
treasure

   protested against their remaining
there a moment longer

   very well said miss peck  we
will do as you say but you must come
with us

   go on back  i cried  ill rejoin
you before the storm breaks and i
swung off through the brush on the
wav to the lower end of the woods

    

  presently i heard a cry behind me
and turning saw angela who had run
after me leaving the rest undecided on
the sands at the edge of the jungle

  ir sibley she called in wild
protest  you must go back with us
you mustnt go any farther away from
camp the sea might rise while you
were down there and-

   i dont see any special reason why
you should worry about that i said
a little coolly though i was glad she
had been the one to run after me and
insist upon my returning  but we are
losing time if the storm comes it will
probably mean the loss of the treasure
and i dont intend to lose it now that its
almost within my hands run back to
camp with the rest like a good girl and
ill b with you almost as soon as you
get there

  well if youll promise to start by
the time were half-way to camp she
said  you can be looking out at us
from time to time cant you

   yes i said  hurry back now
dont lose a moment

  she walked back rather reluctantly
while i pressed on through the jungle
hopeful every moment of sighting the
quarry and the white bundle which i
knew must contain the pearls

  meantime the menace of the storm
schoolmaam island

which meant the menace of the sea in-
creased slowly but palpably the palms
stood stock-still the island was at
peace but there was an oppressive feel-
ing in the air the spectral yellowness
of the sunlight increased in tone and
catching a glimpse of the far northern
sky through the trees i saw just above
the horizon an ink-black cloud that
grew slowly before my eyes

chapter xix

the race for the platform

tv little way ahead of me stood
a cluster of tall palms that looked
down upon the rest of the wood to-
ward these palms i made my way
through the underbrush no sooner
had i stepped into the shade of the first
tree than i heard a sudden scurry
ahead and there about two hundred
feet ahead of me ran my man with the
white bundle in his hand

   stop  i cried as he made away
amid the woods at the same moment
 raised my pistol  stop i want you 
come along with me 

  he paused irresolutely then ran on
again at a sharp clip again i yelled
for him to stop but he dashed through
the thinning vegetation and i ran after
him

  my only remaining shot was hardly
to be risked at that distance i thought
to get a little nearer and make my sin-
gle bullet an effective one but to do
this was not so easy for he probably
had been resting there in the shade and
refreshing himself while i had been
plodding up and down in the jungle
and was dog-tired and heat-worn

  he had headed straight on through
the jungle toward the lower end of the
island but though he was still gaining
on me i managed to keep him within
sight or sound and soon i saw him
breaking through the brush and across
the sand on the way to the lagoon as
i emerged from a tangle of devil-vine
four or five hundred feet behind him i
glanced up the open stretch toward

camp and saw the schoolmaams stand-
ing midway between me and flagstaff
mound the white flag was flying
straight out from the pole and i knew
that a stiff breeze the forerunner of the
storm had struck the northern part of
the island and would soon be sweeping
my way

  tom was nearing the lagoon on a
slant that was taking him back toward
the wreck but of a sudden i saw him
pause and turn a little his head up and
his eyes taking in the great black cloud
that was swinging rapidly down from
the northward

  as the cool breeze blowing down the
island whisked over the lagoon streak-
ing its smooth surface i saw without
surprise the brown brute wheel about
and make northward toward camp i
say without surprise because it must
have flashed upon his native intelli-
gence that the coming storm boded de-
struction to life upon the island and
that the safest place to be was on top of
the platform which he knew had been
built to serve us in just this kind of an
emergency it is true that he might
have climbed a tree above the threaten-
ing wash of waters but in such a storm
as was coming only one tree out of a
hundred might stand loosely rooted as
they were while the well-braced cral-
heaped posts of the platform would
probably endure a pretty harsh siege
from the wind and waves

  his back-tracking slight as it was
had been to my advantage for the dis-
tance between us was lessened and
though he was soon gaining again as
we ran up the smooth lagoon shore
with the freshening wind in our faces
i still hoped to overtake him counting
upon the handicap of the treasure but
for one advantage he was barefoot
which was probably why he had not
kept to the jungle with its spiked devil-
vine  and what was unaccountable to
me his burden of treasure did not
seem to weary him

  when i remembered how heavy the
contents of the brass chest had been in
my hands i could not see for the life


the cavalier

of me how he could run so fleetly over
the sand if the white bundle contained
it all which  was beginning t<_> doubt-
my heart sank when the thought came
to me that he might have left the great-
er part of it hidden somewhere in the
forest

  if the sea swept the island as it
threatened to do judging by the sudden
uplift of the surf which was now roar-
ing loudly our chances of finding his
cache after the waves subsided would
be pretty slim but  was grimly de-
termined to have whatever of the treas-
ure he carried and to have him too
though the chances of either acquisi-
tion seemed remote at the moment

  he kept on ahead of me in the in-
creasing wind making straight up the
lagoon shore toward camp gaining
slowly but steadily as we made our way
over the heavy sand

  and now let me relate the most ex-
asperating of all the baffling circum-
stances that beset me on that fatal
forenoon those schoolmaams-of
course it relates to them instead of
keeping on toward camp as i had par-
ticularly directed and as they had ex-
pressly promised what should they do
but stand in a huddled bunch on the
lagoon beach in about the same posi-
tion in which i had sighted them on
getting into the open in other words
they had moved no farther on the way
to the platform and safety but were
intently observing the cross-island
marathon and looking as if they would
like to take a hand or a foot in it

  presently i saw them separating
miss peck waving her club and dor-
othy shouldering her ax while i
groaned inwardly and tried to wave
them on toward camp they stationed
themselves in a straight line some little
distance apart miss peck nearest the
lagoon and awaited the coming of the
desperate taumatoa their skirts flut-
tering wildly in the wind which was
now blowing a gale it was plainly
their intention to intercept the flying
kanaka and to assist me in running
him to earth

  again i waved to them to be off to

camp which was about half a mile
away but my signals meant no more to
them than the leaves in the wind and
by this time let me tell you there were
not only leaves but branches flying
across the sand and into the troubled
lagoon whose waves were lashing the
shore in a cheap imitation of the titanic
rollers that were running up the out-
side beach

  great rushing ink-stains were streak-
ing the sky and blotting out the sun
the air was full of sand and soon it
became difficult to see the brown run-
ner ahead while only now and then
could f catch sight of the heroic school-
maams where they still bravely held
their ground

  presently the wind became so strong
that it was hard to make headway
against it but still pursuer and pursued
pressed on the race was an uneven
one and after all i must have gained
a little upon the chief for when he
neared the girls i was not more than
two or three hundred feet away and
could catch little glimpses of them
through the gathering murk of the
flying sand

  taumatoa made a feint as if to buck
the center of the line and then when
most of the girls had gathered there
he dodged down toward the lagoon
with the obvious intent of running
around the end miss peck being near-
est the lagoon was in a way to encoun-
ter the savage chief but through the
flying sand i caught a glimpse of dor-
othy rushing down that way to help
her again i yelled to them to hurry
on to camp while there was still time
to reach the platform but the wind
blew my words away

  seeing that the lagoon side was
blocked by dorothy and her ax sup-
ported by the others with their clubs
the chief without hesitation splashed
into the water that he might round the
line in that way dorothy pluckily
splashed in after him and the other
girls lined up on the beach and kept
moving along to intercept him if he
schoolmaam island



should come ashore the waves of the
little lake were running so high that
they came near tumbling the chief oft
his feet two or three times so he waded
in a little nearer toward the beach

   i was now well up with the teachers
and shouting every little while for them
to be off on their way to the platform
telling them that i would attend to
tom but they gamely kept after him

   twice when i was within thirty or
forty yards of him i leveled my pistol
with the intention of firing but each
time i desisted not caring after all to
risk my last bullet

   the chief began to see that he was at
 a disadvantage in the water taking a
 moment when i had rushed to the as-
 sistance of angela who had tripped
 and fallen in the sand the heavy wind
 having made her lose her balance he
 dashed shoreward and made another
 dash to get around the women on the
 beach as it so happened miss peck
 ran directly into his path brandishing
 her club he made at her with his
 knife but before i could spring to her
 aid she had hit him upon the forehead
 with her heavy stick and the knife
 dropped from his hand she struck at
 him again but he jumped in close to
 her and seizing her by her heavy hair
 stooped to regain his knife while she
 screamed lustily for help and tried to
 beat his legs with her club

   by this time i had nearly reached
the place where the two were contend-
ing and was rushing in to throw my-
self upon the kanaka in his half-recum-
bent position when dorothy who was
a little nearer sprang toward him with
her ax upraised

   he saw us coming and picking up
-the knife he started forward still in his
bent position and dashed away up the
beach in the teeth of the wind one hand
still clinging to the white bundle while
in the other was a dark mysterious ob-
ject something like a birds nest

   so again the chase was taken up
with tom leading us all myself second
and the teachers stringing out behind
while the wind hooted over our heads

and roared in our ears and the leaves
and the sand scudded about us

  tom had not gone but a little way
when i saw him drop the dark object
from his hand and as it flew toward
me in the wind it opened out and in
the next instant it was fluttering lov-
ingly upon my breast-a big brown
switch of human hair i knew whose
it was- because i had seen from what
particular head it had been wrested-
miss pecks i brushed it aside and it
went flying down the wind while i
chased after the fleet kanaka

  for now it was a race for the plat-
form with tom too far in the lead for
comfort his obvious intention was to
gain the safe retreat above the threat-
ening sea and probably to prevent the
rest of us from climbing to the place
if he could do so

  you may be sure considering this
threatening state of affairs that i was
glad i had saved that last cartridge

       chapter xx
       my last cartridge

t s nearly as possible my eyes held to
the bounding silhouette of the
kanaka making its unsteady way over
the low undulating dunes that lay be-
tween us and camp his black figure
would beat its way up one side of a
sandy hillock and then down again
for by this time the wind was a dis-
tinct factor in the race and particularly
so with the skirt-hampered girls

  such fleeting glances as  cast be-
hind dimly revealed the forms of one
or more of my dianas outlined by the
wind against which they were fighting
their way i was glad to see that an-
gela was holding her own with the rest
but i feared that if the gale increased
none of them would be able to reach
the platform

  presently the air grew less gritty
all the loose grains seemed to have
been blown away so that far ahead
in the direction of the camp and away
beyond the struggling form of tau-


the cavalier

matoa  coiild see the flying spume

from the breakers as it was tossed like
cotton-balls high over the land the
spray fell upon the dark wind-tortured

palms of the grove like snow and to
seaward the air was full of it

  a mass of lather blown up from the
outside beach was thrown at my feet
and as it rolled back toward the girls
i shuddered

  was this the first assault was this
the hour i had foreseen from the time
of our landing upon the low atoll
how long would it be before the whole
island should be swept over by the
waves which judging by the increasing
volume of their roar were rising at
every moment as the wind and tide
certainly were rising

  to gain the platform was now our
only hope but what if tom got there
first and kept us from mounting i
knew his nature and knew he could be
as merciless as that it might be that
he would let the women up though in
his maniacal mood there was no count-
ing upon it but there was one thing i
could rely upon and that was that he
would never permit me to get up there
as long as he could fight me off

  those heaps of coral ammunition
i groaned to think that we had pro-
vided him with stones to heave down
upon us

  stung to new effort by this madden-
ing thought i set myself against the
wind and pushed on so determinedly
that i soon had the cheering satisfac-
tion of seeing that i was gaining a little
upon the wild kanaka if i could but
reach him and detain him no matter at
what cost until angela and the others
should arrive at the platform-that
would be a victory worth fighting for
it might mean the lives of all of us

  but here was the irritating feature
of the pursuit the terrific buffets of
the wind so hampered our progress that
it was coming to lie like a race of
turtles neither tom nor myself was
now proceeding at anything faster than
a dragging walk but i kept gaining a
little and before long i was almost

within pistol-range while not far
ahead through the feathery spume
which now llecked all the island i
could see the platform with the over-
turned tent thrashing crazily from its
fastenings

  i decided to approach the camp by
way of the grove thinking to gain a
little by its shelter and willing to risk
the danger of the toppling palms if
only  could keep him from getting pos-
session of the platform

  but no sooner had i turned toward
the grove than i saw him do the same
thing so i was not to be advantaged
by that though i thought i might gain
upon him somewhere among the over-
turned trees there was a tremendous
uproar in the grove the great gusts
bellowing through it in a bull-like
chorus from the sharp serrated
branches which cut the gale there
came a prolonged hiss as of escaping
steam while the tumultuous clatter of
the flat hard leaves was like the noise
of some colossal mill great leafv



branches hurtled through the air the
coconuts pelted the ground with re-
sounding thumps and now and again a
tall palm would measure its length
upon the ground or fall supine upon its
fellows

  though my strength was pretty well
spent i should have reached the plat-
form as soon as he but for the over-
throw of one -of these very palms its
branches crashed down upon me and
threw me to the ground luckily i
was not struck by anything but the
lighter foliage but when i had disen-
tangled myself from the mass of ver-
dure and gotten to my feet i saw the
savage chief spring toward the ladder
mount it quickly and pull it up after
him

  when  approached the place my
welcome home was a well-aimed coral
lump that came near putting an end to
me for it whizzed past my head within
an inch or two but as he was rais-
ing another lump to fling after the first
i raised my automatic took careful
aim and fired
  for a moment i saw no result from
the shot save that he did not pick up
the stone but retreated a little way
from the edge of the platform

  when next i saw him he was press-
ing his left hand upon his right arm
near the shoulder while a look of pain
and anger flashed forth from under his
scowling brows my last bullet had
crippled him that was something to
be thankful for

  i darted toward the nearest post of
the platform seized it and was about
to climb up when a piece of coral about
half the size of my head dropped sud-
denly upon my back i dodged the
next one and retreated tinder the plat-
form amid a surprising volley of
lumps despite his wound he was not
only able to fight me off by throwing
with his left hand but it seemed by the
number of missiles that there were a
dozen embattled men upon that plat-
form all doing their best to hold it

  panting from my severe exertions i
stood for a moment under the center of
the pole-floor deliberating upon what
my next move should be a sudden
and tremendous roar resounded to
windward and the spume flew in more
thickly than ever the sea was rising
rapidly i could see the waves curling
above the roots of the outlying palms
soon they would engulf the whole
island and the teachers-my precious
angela among them-were nowhere in
sight

  glancing upward with an agonized
feeling at my heart i saw toms great
black head projected over the edge of
the platform and two malignant eyes
glowering upon me in a mingled look
of triumph and pain

  quickly i raised my empty pistol and
pointed it directly in his face

  let down that ladder i cried
 weve got to get up there  quick or
ill fire

  my answer was a coral lump hurled
so skilfully by the ambidextrous island-
er that it would have struck my head
had i not dodged in time

  your gun no good he grunted

back amid the resounding beats of the
wind and waves  i count uni you
shoot no mo 

  it was useless i retired from the
place believing that if  remained
there i should be killed in which
event the lord knows what would have
become of angela and the others

chapter xxi
a hard climb and a pistol-shot

j ran hastily back with the wind to
look after the girls and to see if
there were not some other way out of
our terrible dilemma there was flag-
staff mound would the sea rise above
it i feared so and that it would be
an insecure retreat

  as i hurried across the sand there
came a lull in the wind would the
storm abate and would we be safe off
the platform after all something
fluttered up from the lagoon beach
and in another moment i saw dorothy
and behind her the straggling line of
schoolmaams making their way to-
ward me

   give me the ax  i cried seizing
upon the weapon as upon a last forlorn
hope

  wheres tom she cried relin-
quishing the ax

   on the platform hes holding it
against us

   he wont let you up oh the vil-
lain   her ees flashed in blazing ire
 but maybe we could persuade him
miss pecks influence-

   oh lies gone completely daffy i
explained  perhaps it was a mistake
for me to have shot him

  you shot him-hes wounded
exclaimed dorothv

   yes

   thats different said the wise
young woman thoughtfully  but still
miss peck may be able to do something
with him

     ell let her try i cried in des-
peration

  a glance at miss peck revealed an


the cavalier

odd sight her head seemed strangely
flat and shrunken over her wet brow
and behind her ears straggled the few
thin locks of thin hair that had been so
carefully covered by the big brown
switch tom had snatched from her
head she seemed twenty years older
but perhaps her hard fight with the
storm had helped to age her

    yes   go she said eagerly when
dorothy quickly explained the tragic
position to her   will reason with
him i think i can persuade him to let
down that ladder and receive us upon
the platform

  and if your urgings dont work
i cried angrily  ill threaten to cut
down the supports that may bring
him to his senses

  of course i went with her angela
and the rest of the teachers lay down
upon the sand in a little hollow to await
our return but to no word from miss
feck would that ugly savage listen-to
no syllable in fact-for he began heav-
ing coral at us the moment we got
within range and kept it up until we
retired a little way out of range to
deliberate

  i had thought the great gale was
abating but it had been a mere lull
for the wind now lashed the palms
with more devilish energy than ever
making some of them bend almost to
the ground while others snapped off
with terrific cracks

  i saw miss peck and the other teach-
ers safely over to flagstaff mound
and then made my way swiftly back to
the platform determined upon a final
attempt to bring the chief to his senses
by threatening to bring down the pole
flooring with my ax

  dodging the white missiles which be
flung in my direction i made toward
him and sprang under the flooring
there i yelled forth my threat and
for a moment it seemed to have its
effect upon him but when his eyes
were not upon me and i struck one of
the posts with the back of the ax to
give a semblance of reality to my
bind he yelled down insultingly and

in the next instant i was dodging coral

again

  it looked hopeless with a more
baffled and dismayed sense than i had
yet felt in this predicament i made a
sudden and desperate resolve to gain
that platform or fall under the attack
of his missiles seizing the post which
i had just struck with the ax i began
to mount it recking not of results and
expecting every moment that my skull
would be crashed in by the falling
stones when of a sudden i heard a
piercing cry above the wind and the
wave-beats and saw angela standing
a little way off with her hands up-
raised in terror wildly she beckoned
me and faintly i saw her lips move in
what was intended for a warning cry
though i could not hear it

  the sight of her gave me heart
dodging the descending lumps as bet
i could i climbed up under the corner
of the platform the nearer i got to
the pole-flooring the better i was
shielded from the coral attacks and
though i could see the white lumps
hurling about me and feel them as they
struck my shoulders or back i was ma-
king my way up against desperate
chances to be sure for he had all the
vantage ground but men will do
hazardous things in such situations

  bruised and bleeding from the sharp
contact of many jagged stones i
struggled up seized the cross-pole
where it jutted from the corner and
tried to pull myself up to the platform
for a moment there was a cessation of
poms hostile efforts and i was won-
dering if after all he might not take
pity upon me and the teachers and at-
tempt  longer to keep us outof this
nne safe retreat

  hopefully i raised my head and
shoulders above the edge of the floor-
ing and was about to climb upon it
when the brown demon darted at me
seized me by the hair and raised his
flashing knife above his head its sharp
point in a direct line with my throat
a piercing shriek rang up from below
and i knew that angela hail run to the
schoolmaam island



platform in a vain attempt to aid me
in my tragic plight

  now me kill yon panted the
islander his black eyes hashing venge-
fully me stick you all same pig
when you dead me let down ladder
and all women come up me let him
live-you die 

  the knife quivered above my throat
but in that tense moment when all hope
of a life of love and joy with angela
were as good as blotted out by the swift
thrust that would follow his murderous
threat i heard a sharp whistle above
my head - the zip of a bullet the
brown brute tottered above me crum-
pled up like a leaf and went down over
the edge of the platform his knife in
his hand

  then i heard a bull voice yelling
from below

   arc you all right old man  

  there was only one person on earth
that had such a voice-wallace little
but there was no time to call back or
to ask how by the wonderful super-
vention of the divine power he had
come upon the scene at that supreme
moment for now the sea was boom-
ing all about the little dot of high land
above which the platform stood and
crashing among the palms and all my
remaining physical force was called
upon to pull myself upon the platform
and let down the ladder

  this i did with a world of pain from
my stinging wounds but it was as in
a fantasmal vision that my blurred
eyes saw wallace and the blessed
schoolmaams seize the end of the lad-
der its foot washed by the first low
foam-crested wave that swept under
the platform the ascending teachers
the splashing palms and the great ex-
panse of wild water that had engulfed
the whole island swam before my eyes

  i dropped upon my knees as the
vision faded murmured some grateful
gibberish or other amid which i could
hear the thankful cries of the teachers
as they huddled upon the platform
then angela breathed some unintel-
ligible words in my ear my head pil-

lowed itself upon her sweet bosom and
the whole surging world about me was
lost to my inert sense

chapter xxii

ich liebe dich

yyhen i came out of it angela was
bending over me her dear hand
gently stroking my hot forehead and
her dark eyes looking their love into
mine the wind had slumped a little
but the platform rocked and creaked
and at times was nearly swept over by
the great combers that rolled high
above the island blotting out every-
thing but the tufted tops of the palms
scarcely a third of these remained
standing the others having gone down
before the heavy waves that had washed
the sand from their roots and had
borne them off to be thrown upon dis-
tant shores or to sink water-logged
into the ocean depths

   wheres wallace little  were
my first words to angela  and how
in the world did he come to be here just
when we needed him most 

   hes lying over there on the can-
vas replied angela  theyre at-
tending to him hes weak and worn
from being so long in the boat in which
he escaped from the steamer

   has he been all this time alone in
a boat  

   no part of the time he was on a
small island which afforded so little
food that he was forced to take to sea
again

   but how did he weather the ty-
phoon in an open boat  i demanded
incredulously

   he didnt he landed half-way
down the island just as the storm was
breaking it was very providential for
him and for us he was driven up here
bv the rising sea saw your terrible
plight and- she shut her eyes in
the horror of the remembrance  but
you-you are injured

   only bruised a little in spots i
assured her  coral lumps are not


the cavalier

very heavy ammunition but about
tom-was he really killed 

   we saw his body drift out with the
first waves that swept under the plat-
form he will never trouble us
again

   and the pearls 

   we found his bundle but it con-
tained only the gold

   then theyre gone  i groaned

   what do we care she breathed
forth with a smile as she looked loving-
ly at me out of her adorable eyes

   we care nothing sweetheart i
replied gently- nothing in the world
but about wallace little-are you sure
you- i broke off for she had put
her finger to her lips

   not so loud  she said warningly
 hes a dear good fellow and he lias
saved all our lives but- theyre look-
ing this way

  is mr sibley all right cried
miss peck above the roar of the aba-
ting wind

   yes but please dont disturb him
hes going to lie back and sleep

  which i pretended to do just to
please her and because when you are
out in the open sea lying on a station-
ary raft there isnt anything in par-
ticular that you can do except to pray
god that the raft doesnt get loose

  but thanks to the bracing staying
and anchoring of the four stout trees
that held the platform in place above
the flood our little company of nine
healthy hopeful women and two pret-
ty well used up men was for the time
out of harms way

  and let me tell you that our station-
ary raft though wet with spray and
sometimes splashed a little by the high-
est wave-tips seemed a mighty com-
fortable thing to be on - indeed far
better than any floating one w-ould have
been though ten times the size i was
glad that tom had used less than half
of the coral ammunition for the weight
of the remaining lumps must have
helped the platform to a stability which
the uplifting force of the great waves
must have tested severely

  but toward night the wind lulled
and a welcome rain began to fall the
teachers rigged the displaced canvas
anew and caught a quantity of water
without which we should have fared
very poorly

  toward evening the clouds rolled
away the sea subsided and the coral
sands gleamed forth again but what
foliage was left looked pitiably be-
draggled and storm-swept

  we had a supper of birds eggs and
such tilings as were handy and were
thankful that we had carried all our
stores up to the platform and that tom
had not disturbed them at supper
wallace little who had been eating
all the afternoon ate again with us

   the next time i set to sea in an
open boat he said between bites
 im going to load her to the gun-
wales with everything in the pantry

  he told us how he had come to be
alone in the boat being a heavy sleep-
er he had not been awakened by the
crash of the steamer striking the reef
nor by the commotion it was only
when the water came into his berth be-
low decks that he sprang from his cabin
to find the ship sinking and deserted
by everybody including the captain
one boat had been left alongside
doubtless because of its leaky condi-
tion  but he managed to stop the leak
and bale out the water he had found
enough food and fresh water in it to
sustain him after a fashion until he
had reached our island

   and it looks to me lie burred
forth in his great bass  as if i arrived
just in time not only to escape that
awful typhoon but to be of some little
assistance to my fellow voyagers

   a great big assistance amended
dorothy with a grateful and it seemed
to me admiring glance at the long-
legged hero of the hour

  what remains to tell neednt take
many words we found the pearls
tied up in another white bundle under
a heap of stones in the coral cabin
this wonderful restoration of our for-
school-maam island



tune made miss binney shed tears of
joy and i know the rest of us were
mighty happy over the discovery of
toms cache which we fully had ex-
pected never to find

  of course wallace little came in
for a share of the treasure though he
protested against taking it and of
course miss binney wanted some of
the biggest pearls when the division of
the spoils was made and of course
she didnt get them

  but we settled it all quite amicably
and when a little trading schooner bore
down upon us a few days later and we
actually saw its boats entering the la-
goon to take us off i am sure none of
us was much the worse for being cast-
away upon schoolmaam island though
we should have had to resort to a pure-
ly fish diet had we remained there an-
other week

  delight was the only word to picture
that cruise down to butaritari where
we all took the steamer for home wal-
lace little and dorothy were not the
least delighted for it w-as  this
cruise that they came to a complete un-
derstanding-the kind of understand-
ing which angela and i had arrived at
with but few words on the platform
with the menacing sea all about us

  yes the teachers now that each had
a goodly fortune all decided to return
home and let others less fortunate fill
the empty young filipino brain with
golden knowledge

  the pearls panned out even better
than i had estimated-theres nothing
like a new york market for such luxu-
rious baubles-and the combined share
of angela and myself invested in secu-
rities that are really secure gives us

the

enough to live in good style in our
monterey home

  the last time i heard from wrallace
and dorothy they were about to buy
a prune orchard in the santa clara
valley

  miss peck invested her pearl money
in a connecticut boarding-school over
which she presides with great dignity
she has many scholars and is highly
prosperous when she came out to see
us last summer she wore a beautiful
blue silk gown and her hair was a
luxuriant and wavy as ever

  fanny binney is married to a new
york stock broker she has her pearls
in a safe-deposit vault holding them
for a rise in the market

  ruth deming is traveling in europe
with her mother

  yes it has turned out very happily
for all concerned and i think angela
and i are as full of the joy of life as
any of the castaways of schoolmaam
island

    but just suppose she said turn-
ing her adorable eyes to me one night
a year after our wedding as she stood
violin in hand in the music-room-
 just suppose that the loyalty never
had touched at florikiva and picked
you up

    its too awful to suppose anything
of the kind i declared  play  ich
liebe dich dear and dispel the hor-
rible thought

    not only will i play it she said
bending over me where i sat on the
divan  but ill act it and her soft
lips sought mine in one of those kisses
that only angela can give after
which she played  ich liebe dich  as
only angela can play it

back from the wilds

      n the far corner of the office-
i  ie particularly cheerful
i i gs corner by the south win-
 r  	dovv - stood a brand-

new desk

  howard street turned from his
own littered high - piled roll - top and
glanced toward it and the energetic
little stenographer after a last survey
of the new blotting-pad the new iens
the new stationery moved away from
the new desk and favored street with
a brief businesslike little nod and

   i think everything is there mr
street

  um-um  street pursed his lips
 did the sign come 

    ive left it on top the girl smiled
 i didnt know whether hed prefer it
on the wall or on the desk itself

  she reached for the flat tissued
package and turned back the wrap-
ping and for a moment howard street
looked thoughtfully at the strip of
black glass with its bold gold

   mr harvey street

  pie nodded then and sighed a little
as he murmured

   well leave that to him er-miss
bartley 

     yes mr street

     when my brother really settles
  down here for work to-morrow or next
  day howard said slowly it may be
  necessary for you to look in here once
  in a while and straighten out that desk
  -for a little time at least until lies
  used to things and preferably when he
  is out of the office  shall hardly have
  time for it myself and harvey -he
  laughed a little- well harvey isnt
  quite as methodical as i am

     the girl smiled faintly

     very well

     and in the general course of busi-
  ness particularly when i am not alout
  you will-oh sort of keep an eye on
  him miss bartley wont you  street
  went on thoughtfully i dont know
  exactly what he has been doing these
  last few years he may have altered
  altogether and turned into the most
  sedate and orderly citizen in the world
  but-

    ilis voice slowly trailed away the
  stenographer paused with one hand
  on the knob of the door to the general

   office

     well do you consider him the sort
  of man one can explain things to mr
  street 

    streets smile was almost miserable
   you mean without rubbing the fur
  the wrong way miss bartley- he
  muttered  not if you go about the
  explaining in a way that may suggest
  youre giving him orders he said
  frankly  i hardly think he has
  changed sufficiently to take orders
  even from me but-oh youll have to

 co
the sinister souvenir



do it diplomatically miss bartley until
weve broken him into the business
thats all

  with a nod of rather dubious under-
standing the girl stepped out howard
street sat far back in his desk-chair
and lighted one of his thick cigars and
stared gloomily at that other glitter-
ingly new chair to a certain small
extent he felt the humiliation of ex-
plaining his brother to his stenogra-
pher-even to so perfect a stenogra-
pher as miss bartley who was business
and sound sense from the tips of her
small pumps to the last coil of chestnut
hair

  and yet unless harvey had lost his
old nature completely and acquired a
new and radically different one he
needed explaining-now before his ar-
rival later after he had become an
office fixture and even-oh bosh

  the proprietor of i he office brought
down his chair with a slam and planted
his elbows on the desk to stare savage-
ly at the calendar and wonder why
on earth did this beastly uneasiness
over harveys advent haunt him-
why had it been haunting him ever
since the arrival of harveys letter
three weeks ago with the news that
he was coming back east to stay cer-
tainly the boy had never been addicted
to crime just as certainly he owned
as lovable a nature as one might find in
a long journey and even more cer-
tainly harvey was howards one soli-
tary surviving relative

   and yet here in the quiet of his per-
fectly ordered office something akin to
nervous terror had crept over how-
ard little beads of perspiration were
standing on his forehead and with a
sharp snarl he rose and stared out of
the sky-scraper window at the roofs
below and presently he understood

  the trouble wasnt with harvev it
was with howard himself a grave
and methodical boy he had grown into
a graver and more methodical man a
book once placed on the upper left-
hand comer of his desk remained
there year in and year out the two

visitors chairs over by the wall stood
each on four clean little spots of floor-
ing so conscientiously had they been
set night after night in the same posi-
tion before he locked up on the stroke
of ten each morning miss bartley
walked through that door and sat in the
same spot to take his letters on the
stroke of twelve she brought in the
morning batch of correspondence for
his signature at one-fifteen to the sec-
ond she appeared once more for the
scanty afternoon mail it was quite
the same with the one bookkeeper the
same with the sober little chap who
attended to the telephone and carried
in cards they worked according to a
perfect system in the little establish-
ment like so many pieces of fine
automatic machinery - and howard
street had devised the system and built
the machine

  and into all this nice exactness har-
vey street was coming-probably the
most care-free and irresponsible citizen
between the two oceans-to take his
own place

  the elder brother groaned aloud
and swore at himself for groaning
actually if he had not mailed the
stern elder-brother letter three wreeks
ago he wtould have gone out at this
minute and looked up a job for harvey
somewhere else a job of course
where some total stranger would have
the task of drilling conservative busi-
ness principles into harvey and -
howard turned with a start for the
sober office-boy had entered

   its only mr colden sir he asked
if youre busy

   ask him to step in here street
said shortly  you know that ill al-
ways see him if nobodys here john

  he turned toward the door and
smiled suddenly and with real pleasure
as a matter of fact he liked colden
immensely and with much cause
colden who conducted the little de-
tective agency across the hall-which
was slowly but surely growing into a
big and important detective agency by
the way-colden was one of the few


the cavalier

people who owned a fund of energy
and perseverance equal to his own

genial always incisive in his methods
of thought as a fine razor coldens
company in leisure moments was al-
ways welcome

  the lithe thin - featured youngish
man cheerfully informal in his shirt-
sleeves and with the long cigar sticking
straight from the corner of his mouth
sauntered into the private office and
kicked the door gently to behind him

   ive come in for congratulations
he said with a grin  ive got my
bank-robber and he hadnt spent more
than fifty dollars of the stuff

   well im mighty glad to hear it 
street cried heartily  i knew-

  you-eh coldens sharp eyes
settled upon the new desk and a grin
lighted up his face  never mind
crime now howard this is the big
day isnt it 	

   big

  the day the prodigal brother gets

back

  streets smile vanished and he sat
down

   yes han eys coming to-day he
said colorously

   well- coldens eyes opened
wonderingly as he found a chair and
dropped into it  you seem tickled to
death

   well i - am and then again
im-not street laughed uneasily

   why is he in trouble  colden
asked sharply

  howard street frowned

   what trouble should he be in 
no

   imagined that there might be a
posse after him from your expression
the detective said mildly  what is
it 

   its nothing except that i dont
know whether hell settle down here
peaceably or not hes not the settling
kind

  colden laughed outright

   hell settle all right how old is
he

   twenty-seven

   five years younger than your es-
teemed sel f eh  

    yes

   whats his profession

   he hasnt any judge howard
smiled grimly as the questions were
shut at him  he never felt the need

of one

   whats his business then

  - hes been dabbling in lumber i
believe

   getting anything out of it 

   experience

   fizzled out as a business man in
the great west then 

   absolutely street said sourly

   well good lord dont you even
like him  colden demanded

  howard street flushed and laughed
angrily

   like him you confounded clown 
he snapped  i dont know whether
you can understand it or not but that
wretched boy is as dear to me as if he
were a son instead of a brother dick
our parents died when harvey was a
little bit of a kid you know and i
wasnt much better ive always had
that sense of being an utterly inefficient
guardian to him ive never been able
to handle him properly and i never
shall be i wanted him to stay right
here when we were both working on a
salary you know but-

  colden threw back his head and
guffawed

   upon my word howard he cried
 when you get one of these fits of
taking yourself seriously it makes the
thought of a methodist funeral seem
like a comic weekly youre sitting
here as if some one were on the verge
of death and the chances are that the
boyll walk in tamed and seasoned
and-how long is it since youve seen
him

    five years

   and hes been knocking around the
west that long eh 

   yes

   coming back east of his own ac-
cord  

   certainly
the sinister souvenir



   well i wouldnt worry about him
howard colden chuckled  hes
reaped his crop of wild oats long be-
fore this very likely hes even more
somber than yourself now he turned
and stared at the new desk and chair
again  and lies certainly a lucky
cuss 

   why 

   to have a job right here waiting
for him

  street shrugged his shoulders

   and its a thundering fine little
concern for a young fellow to be with
colden went on enthusiastically  for
a real-estate brokerage business of its
size and shape ill guarantee that there
isnt another in new york to come up
to this one of yours

   thanks  said street

   but i mean it why youre
knocking a clean twelve or fourteen
thousand dollars out of this three-room
suite

   about seven thousand of it comes
straight from john dobson howard
submitted

   suppose the whole thing came
from one client-dobson or any one
else-so long as it does come said
colden  dobsons property and his
little deals are no harder to handle than
any others

   theyre a good sight easier how-
ard laughed candidly  this last year
or two the old chap has been leaving
me to handle matters in my own way
absolutely

   i know how long has he been
the star client of the office howard 
 nearly four years ever since-
 yes and its nearly four oclock
colden ejaculated glancing at his
watch and starting up suddenly  ill
have to get back to the office whens
the wanderer due 

   hes due now and i wish to good-
ness hed turn up street said irasci-
bly  ive got to catch that five oclock
express for philadelphia

  he scowled at his own watch as
colden departed things were ar-
ranged up at the little apartment hotel

to be sure the clerk would be expect-
ing harveys arrival alone and would
see that he landed in howards rooms
but - howard started for the outer
door had closed a second time and
some one was walking heavily through
the general office of the place a full
voice spoke with total lack of restraint
and-the door opened suddenly and
harvey street strode through

  in one hand a battered suit - case
swung easily without so much as a
glance at the spot of its probable land-
ing the tall brown young man-by no
means unlike his paler older brother-
dropped the case to the floor and bound-
ed forward a quick smile of grave
affection came to howards lips his
grave steady hand went out-and har-
vey street had enveloped him in a bear
hug and was fairly babbling joyful
greetings while miss bartley in the
background laughed a little and closed
the door on them

  some two minutes of chattering
were gone before harvey gripped his
brother by the shoulders and holding
him at arms length cried

   well you havent changed a parti-
cle howard

   youve done some changing your-
self-externally anyway harvey

   well its only externally the
younger brother said as he crashed into
a chair and sat grinning ecstatically at
the other  ive been banged around
a good deal but it hasnt taken the
edge off my glad young nature thun-
der and mars but its good to see
you 

   and its good to see you too kid
and to know that youre back at last to
settle down to business

  business the younger brother
cried with mock terror  you really
meant that about my having a share in
your concern here 

   i surely did

   well its almighty white of you
howard considering that ive had
nothing to do with founding the busi-
ness or building it up-and considering
that ive been mainly a nuisance to you


the cavalier

all my life the returned one said con-
tritely  i-im grateful howard
show it by settling right down to
your desk to-morrow morning and
sticking there boy the elder brother
said with a faint smile

   without even getting used to new
york again howard

   youre well enough acquainted
with new york the elder street
sighed for hesitation before the pros-
pect of immediate serious business
fairly oozed from harveys neighbor-
hood  theres a lot to learn about
this office and you cant begin to learn
it too soon

   and thats my desk eh 

   thats your desk howard said
smiling

   um-um weil its a nice desk
said the younger brother as he shied
his hat toward it and without emo-
tion watched the hat fall to the floor
and roll against the waste-basket
 ill get a lot of use out of it-just a
little later

  he grinned pleasantly at the found-
er of the office and the founder
frowning leaned toward him ear-
nestly

   harvey he said  what have you
been doing out there 

   everybody and everything that
would consent to be done the new-
comer responded blithely

   i mean did you actually establish
yourself in business anywhere

   im alive howard that presup-
poses three square meals a day since
ive seen you

   i understand that boy and that
isnt what i mean at all and you know
it youve been away for a solid five
years and presumably youve leen
working all that time

   not only presumably howard
harvey said sadly  ive worked like
blazes now and again

   all right have you anything to
show for it 

  the younger brother stared blank
amazement

   good lord no 

   nothing in the way of money

saved up 

   ive got about forty dollars in
cash howard the newcomer said
proudly   think thats pretty good
 and i think its pretty bad-pretty
infernally bad as the net result of five
years labor howard street said
flatly  and that brings me to what
 blarted to say harvey youve frit-
tered away enough of your life
you-

   frit-

  yes frittered the elder street
said sternly  youve got absolutely
nothing out of it boy and now the
time has come to quit not day after
to-morrow or next week or next
month but sharp at nine to-morrow
morning youre going to be at that
desk ready for business

   but-

	no no  buts harvey to-
morrow morning

   well howard theres nothing
under the sun id rather do than take
your orders and follow them out to the
letter harvey said rather awkward-
ly if it comes down to that i ex-
pect to do just that for a good many
years to come but there is just one
last piece of indulgence ill have to
beg- let my business career wait
over until day after to-morrow
why 

   because theres something i have
to attend to to-morrow

   what 

   oh a little matter about which
you know nothing harvey said eva-
sively 

   whats the nature of it  howard
demanded suspiciously

   why-theres a fellow i have to
see on some urgent personal business
thats all

  he laughed and glanced out of the
w indow howard streets voice with
a considerable effort changed to a tone
of easy unconcern as he asked

   who is it harvey-any one i
know  

   nope the younger brother
the sinister souvenir	

  grinned at him  fellow named
  dobson

   eh

       john dobson-pretty rich cuss i
   imagine ever hear of him around
   these parts howard  

      he stared out the window once more
   and smiled absently his smile faded
   then and he seemed absorbed in
   thoughts not altogether pleasant-and
   as a consequence he missed altogether
   the sudden startled flush on the elder
   brothers cheeks and hardly noted the
   breathless catch in his voice as he
   cried

      what on earth have you to do with
   john dobson 

      harvey turned slowly and faced his
   brother and there was a distinctly dark
   and peculiar light in his eye

       im going to kill him howard

 he said placidly

chapter ii

to philadelphia and back

  f-or the moment it seemed to how-
ard street harvey was actually
 serious and the elder brothers hair
lairly stood upon end

   you- he began loudly

   and there he stopped for harveys
 smile had flashed out again and-yes
harvey was leaning back in his chair
and laughing mightily as he cried

    well you solemn old owl youre
   five times as sober as you were five
   years ago and you were bad enough
   thee heaven knows

    was that fool remark meant for a
   jest  howard demanded warmly

  it surely was the younger
  brother chuckled  you dont know
  the man  

    i have a client by that name

    wealthy  

    yes

   well im a bad egg howard
  harvey said rather impatiently  but
  pm not quite bad enough for murder
  -yet i-

    tests of that sort dont appeal to
       c -

 me observed howard street  they
 are in rotten bad taste to put it
 mildly

   the newcomer looked at him with
 a rather weary smile

    bad taste or not if it is the same
 man im not at all sure lie doesnt de-
 serve it

    then its not the same man be-
 cause this one-

    tell me about him will you 
 harvey said earnestly  just what is
 he like howard

   like hes-why hes like any
 other wealthy man of course how-
 ard said blankly

    how old is he 

   fifty-one or so i believe

    grizzled-gray-seems older 

    he seems considerably older-
 yes the elder brother admitted
  but how do you-

    wait a while and maybe ill tell
 you   harvey street grinned  i
 want to hear more about this fellow
 how much is he worth  

    im sure i dont know

    about four millions 

    roughly about that

    a-ha  smiled the newcomer with
 growing interest  lived east here
 all his life 

    no

    where did he come from then 
    australia

    when  

   why about four years ago
 howard street snapped  and now
 suppose we drop dobson and talk
 about the business here harvey you
 have plenty of time to get acquainted
 with him in person later on and ive
 got to catch a five-oclock train for
 philadelphia and-

    all right just tell me one or two
 more things about him howard im
 curious and ill tell you why present-
 ly did he appear with-real money
 i have a good reason for asking 

    howard scratched his chin

    his money was all in gilt-edged
 securities when i first met him-nego-
 tiable stuff that was as good as cash
g

the cavalier

   i see and he proceeded to spend

 it 

   on the contrary hes one of the
 most careful and most successful real-
 estate operators in this section har-
 vey youll come to know that i
 handle all his business even to some
 money matters not connected w ith real
 estate

    and he is a pleasant man 

   why he doesnt laugh and crack
 jokes and make an ass of himself
 -no howard said shortly

   in fact he has a rather ugly tem-
 per eh harvey asked eagerly

    if it comes down to that yes

    lives here in the city 

    he lives up at wildcliffe manor
    and where on earth is that 

    just a little beyond the city up in
 westchester he built a big place
 there

   when

   oh three years ago howard
said desperately  and now turn off
that infernal flow of questions and let
me explain about-

  just one or two more about dob-
 son and i will harvey said grinning
  he never married did he he just
 lives there all alone

   with half a dozen servants and
 -the daughter of course howard
 flushed slightly

  harvey street on the contrary
 started violently

  daughter what daughter

   his adopted daughter harvey
 the elder brother snapped  and now
 there is no use in beginning a new
 cross-examination about the young
 lady because ive answered fool
 questions enough this-

    how olds the daughter 

   just half-way between nineteen
 and twenty answered howard

    you have pretty accurate informa-
 tion on that havent you grinned
 the newcomer  do you mind telling
 me her name  

   her name is eva carston dob-
son just now howard said with a
soft smile

    meaning that it may change soon
howard r  the younger brother in-
quired with eyes wide open

   meaning nothing of the sort
howard snapped  i-bah 

well when did he adopt her

 only about six months back
well by jove exclaimed har-
vey street  i believe its the same-
howard do you know why he
adopted her 

  phe elder streets head came up
with a jerk and there was a certain
glare in his eye that stilled the flood of
questions hands on his knees how-
ard street leaned closer to his younger
brother and spoke sharply

   i do not know why he adopted
her neither do i care neither is it
any of your business or mine just now
youve done talking enough harvey
now im afraid that i shall have to do
a little and ill have to do it in a hurry
item one what prompted that fool
remark about killing dobson  

  it was nothing more than a fool
remark you chump i-

   well see that you make  more
like it harvey that sort of thing
may be customary in the section of the
state of washington youve been fa-
voring with your presence but its
likely to be misunderstood here can
you remember that

   i can said harvey humbly

   and item two while were on the
subject i want you to keep away from
this particular john dobson whether
hes the man you want to see or not-
understand hes the best customer
of this office and youre not going to
take any liberties with him

  the younger street grinned and
nodded assent

    and now to get down to business
i want you here to-morrow morning at
nine boy without fail-and that
doesnt mean quarter past nine either
i shall have to be away all day to-
morrow and very likely i wont show
up at the hotel until late in the eve-
ning youll come here and make
yourself ornamental rather than use-
the sinister souvenir



ful lor to-morrow at least look
things over read the mail ask miss
bartley all the questions you like
and-

  he glanced up for the door had
opened and the stenographer was
standing there-

   its twenty-five minutes of five
mr street she reminded him

  is it thanks howard rose
slowly to his feeet  ill have to
clear out harvey you know where
you live 

  the hotel barnard

   thats the place and theyll be
waiting for you here  he scrib-
bled on one of his business-cards
 pass that to the clerk and youll be
sure to have no trouble come along
and ill put you on the car

  he shook his head as harvey whis-
tling sauntered over and snatched his
hat from the floor and kicked his suit-
case into an upright position he
shook his head again as he picked up
his own remarkably trim grip and his
light overcoat and his utterly impec-
cable derby and after a perfunctory
introduction of the returned wanderer
to miss bartley he led the way to the
elevator and the street

   you may as well take a surface car
harvey he said on the corner  and
look over the town youll get up there
about dinner-time if you want to dine
early and this evening he said
anxiously  what are you going to do
this evening harvey 

   id thought of the y m c a but
i may stay home and run through some
of the snappy parts of  pilgrims
progress howard the wanderer
said flippantly why

dont do anything more ex-
citing kid get a good nights sleep

good-by 

  he turned and hurried off for his
elevated train and possibly half-way
down the block he turned back for an
instant-and forward as quickly just
as he had suspected harvey was look-
ing after him and even in the same
familiar attitude he had pictured men-

ially hands behind his back head
low and thrust forward the younger
brother was staring in pensive wonder
after the elder and smiling compassion-
ately

  and for  particular reason the
smile-which had irritated howard in
the old days-fairly maddened him
for a moment now harvey actually
thought him a freak of some sort be-
cause he was all gravity all business
it had been so when they were on an
even footing as regarded money-ma-
king achievements but howard had
cherished a rather smug certainty that
things were wholly different now with
that office to show as a result of his
hard work instead of that-yes by
thunder harvey was still standing
there and grinning his compassion

  a minute or so and the mood passed
and- howard laughed outright as he
raced up the elevated steps it was
the most natural thing in the world
harvey had inherited in its entirety
the nature of their gay petted pleas-
ure-loving little mother and like that
same little mother he was pure gold all
the way through while howard with
equally nice care as to details seemed
to have acquired ever- trait of their
sober energetic father that was the
whole proposition from end to end
and very likely when once he had set-
tled the boy down to business that light
nature of harveys would be a blessing
to his brother

  but just now business lay ahead and
big business and long before he had
settled in his pullman chair the elder
streets mind was absorbed in it har-
vey somewhere or other behind was
old enough and large enough to take
care of himself ahead were marchand
and his little clique of moneyed men

  it was to be quite a feather in his
cap this philadelphia transaction - a
deal so huge in its proportions so fear-
fully involved in complex details that
the ordinary mind might well have
shrunk away from it alone howard
street had engineered the better part of
the thing in most perfect style and


the cavalier

now with marchand sailing for europe
day alter to-morrow they were going
to wrestle out the final details

  and then in some six or eight weeks
when marchand returned and the pre-
liminary contracts were due to expire
the world would be mildly startled at
the putting through of what might be
termed a real real-estate deal with mr
howard streets name carefully adver-
tised and mr howard streets bank-
account considerably the fatter it
was all of it just the sort of mans-
size affair with which howard had
been seeking to identify himself now
it was coming true

  marchand and the car were at the
broad street station when the train
rolled in and marchand took him in
charge the big mans family had
deserted him weeks ago the servants
were going to-morrow and the con-
ference would be held in all the unlis-
tening emptiness of the big home a
hotel dinner and marchand and how-
ard street settled in the formers li-
brary for a short evening of details and
documents

  morning dawned rather unfortunate-
ly with the arrival of a telegram from
kenton telling of the stalling of his
train in a wreck two hundred miles
west kenton was as essential to this
affair as money itself and now he
would hardly be on hand before late
afternoon the others half a dozen
of them drifted in and waited papers
were signed signatures witnessed
checks passed-with blank spaces left
for kenton and an apathetic notary
drowsing over his newspaper in the
corner

  the traveler arrived no more than in
time for the dinner marchand had or-
dered from a near-by hotel he was
passing on again indeed he would
have to board a nine-oclock train for
the south  and there was another grand
scurrying of papers-and when ken-
ton had flitted on again a confusion of
things in general that would have pro-
cured most people a clean ticket to the
madhouse tt would have to be straight-

ened out and alone in the house street
and marchand set about the straight-
ening midnight came and went at
nearly three in the morning with a
million or so of documents neatly bun-
dled and ready for the safe-deposit
vaults two utterly fagged men tottered
to two bedrooms above and rolled into
bed

  as concerned howard street nine
oclock in the morning found him with
as vicious a headache as he could re-
member in all his life he grunted
and yawned and shuffled over to the
mirror and he laughed a little and
shook his head late hours obviously
were not for him when a man ha
made a rule of slipping into bed at
eleven tired out an extra four hours
are likely to leave their marks-and
they seemed to have left them on how-
ard for his eyes were dark-circled and
tired and the corners of his mouth
drooped

  there was more rushing ahead-a
lightning chat between marchand and
his watchman a galloping breakfast a
mad race for the train and a plunging
express for new york marchand
left him at the station and whizzed
wildly off in a taxicab for his pier
howard street yawning still boarded
a humbler surface-car for the hotel
barnard and his comfortable rooms
there was no particular need of diving
pell-mell for his office he had worked
hard enough last night and he would
get down to business after luncheon
and a shave

  a moment he chatted with the clerk
at the hotel desk harvey it seemed
had arrived in good order night be-
fore last and been duly installed how-
ard for no very good reason heaved
a sigh of relief and rode up to his
rooms and on the very threshold he
stood aghast

  for harvey beyond question had
been there

  the beds to be sure were neatlv
made-and there the chambermaid
seemed to have stopped in despair
howard streets books never out of
the sinister souvenir



  their case were piled on the table to
  the number of a dozen or more how-
  ard streets magazines invariably in
  their rack had wandered from one end
  of the place to the other perching on
  floor chairs and sofa impartially and
  his little silver cigar-box was standing
  open with ashes here and there and
  everywhere and his stationery was
  piled in ever possible way on his trim
  desk and-yes even half a dozen of
  his neckties were ranged on the back
  of a chair as harvey had left them
  after making his selection an unin-
  formed observer might have scented
  the recent passing of a cyclone how-
  ard street understood his younger
  brother had merely been occupying the
  rooms after his own fashion

    and the tenant of the place decided
  that hed be hanged if hed set about
  tidying the place now he was too
  infernally tired just at present hed

	emulate harvey by sweeping the things
  off the couch and stretching out-and
  he was in the middle of that astonish-
  ing operation when the room telephone
  rang and the clerk desired to know if
  he would see mr colden

    it was a surprising sort of call
  colden lived in a remote part of the
  city and during business hours as a
  general thing only a case could take
  him from his office yet he and howard
  had discussed the philadelphia proposi-
  tion again and again and now evident-
  ly he had felt sufficient interest to come
  and get the news while it was fresh

    yawning street greeted him cor-
  dially and turned back to his unusual
  task he paused instinctively to bunch
  the magazines and carry them back to
  their rack and only when he had ar-
  ranged them in a neat pile did it dawn
  upon him that colden was staring si-
  lently at him he straightened up and
  faced the other with a laughing

     whats wrong dick 

    colden queerly avoided his eye

     i was-well thinking that you
 looked the worse for wear howard
 he muttered

    street laughed outright

   i am he said  but its only
hard work you know  havent taken
to midnight roistering even away from
home

   i-didnt suspect that you know
the detective muttered

   the session or the tail end of it
lasted until three in the morning dick

 was all in when we were through
with it

   the session-where 

  where street stared at his
friend  in philadelphia of course
why on earth did you ask that
question 

  colden evidently was straying from
his own mathematically straight men-
tal paths colden still avoiding his
eye rammed his hands in his pockets

   you seem thundering uncon-
cerned he said oddly

  the real-estate man laughed again
 im not dick he said  im
tickled to death all through 

   but-

    but im not hysterical about it be-
cause im too tired just now street
chuckled  there were half a dozen
hitches before we were through with
it but in the end everything straight-
ened out beautifully in the whole
affair from one end to the other there
isnt a solitary flaw or-

  with a jerk the detective was at his
side and one rather nervous hand had
landed on his arm

  look here howard youre talk-
ing about that real-estate deal arent
you 

  well-of course street said
blankly

   well is it possible you havent
heard  colden asked looking straight
at him

   heard what 

   at least youve seen the morning
papers  

   i havent laid eyes on a newspaper
since yesterday morning dick and i
didnt pay much attention to them
then i-

  he stopped short for colden had
twitched a folded sheet from his pocket


the cavalier

and was opening it he flattened out
the front page and folded it back again
so that the first two columns were
uppermost and then silently he thrust
it into streets hands and-

    westchester millionaire mur-
dered in cold blood  howard street
read aloud  who-

  guldens laugh was a queer little
bark

   yes  he said  john dobson 

chapter iii

wildcliffe

for a moment or two streets usual-
ly quick brain thoroughly tired
now failed to catch the significance of
the words

  his forehead wrinkled an instant
an odd incredulous little smile flick-
ered across his lips as he glanced at
colden and he muttered

   what

  its there read it the detect-
ive said shortly

   but-good god  the news sud-
denly swept into streets brain with
full force dobson - john dobson
isnt dead 

  colden turned away and found a
cigarette on the table

  isnt he howard he said
 then possibly its a new spaper story
 but-

  read it snapped the detective
 i supposed that you knew

  lie scratched a match with elaborate
care and kindled the cigarette and
limply street dropped to the couch and
stared at the smudgy sheet in his hands
his head seemed to be steadying again
now the printed lines had ceased their
momentary insane dancing

  and the head-line persisted as a fact
and under it john dobson shot
down in library of his home by un-
known assassin he clutched the
sheet until the margins tore loose and
he read swiftly the meager details

  dobson had been murdered that
much alone seemed clear to the indi-

vidual who had written the article at
some time between ten and twelve on
the previous evening a shot had been
tired in the library and dobsons dead
body found with a bullet-hole straight
through the head

   the wildcliffe coroner plainly an
energetic person had gone to work in-
stantly and reached an official conclu-
sion bare enough and obvious enough
the deceased had been shot down by a
person or persons unknown who had
made good their escape most crimes
have a motive this seemed to lack one
o weapon had been found about the
place nor had mr dobson entertained
any strangers-or indeed any callers
at all-last evening the servants had
been verypositive on that point the
butler in fact had sworn flatly that the
door of the mansion had been within
sight all afternoon and evening and
that no one outside the household had
passed it

   but for the early evening hour the
paper went on it might have seemed
that an attempted robbery was at the
bottom of the awful affair mr dob-
sons private safe always containing
more or less actual cash had-for
some reason known only to himself-
been particularly well filled last night
as a matter of fact a quantity of bills
of large denomination had been upon
the very desk beside which he fell they
could have been snatched up in a matter
of seconds yet they were found when
the room was entered

  the window it seemed had been
open the heavy vines beneath it were
broken in several places and there were
footprints on the soft ground for it
had rained most of the evening be-
yond that the article stated the police
were working on the case and-the pa-
per dropped from streets hands and
he was fairly glaring at colden as he
cried

    have you been up there 

   the detective looked at him quietly

    why on earth should i go up there
howard im not an officer of the
county and nobody retained me
the sinister souvenir



   but i thought-why-look here
dick you should have been there
and-

   ivhy f  the detective shot at him
 why 

   why - why- street laughed
helplessly and leaned against the table
his forehead was dripping and won-
dering rather at coldens unwavering
stare he mopped it again and again
 i-lord i dont know why dick
im-staggered thats all this
thing has fairly knocked the senses out
of me you know it struck me that
you were the one bright detective in the
world and-oh i dont know  he
shrugged his shoulders and gripped
himself with an effort and he ended
weakly  its-awful 

   its all of that howard

   who-who could have done it 

   i havent an idea in the world the
detective said steadily  have you 
i of course not i-why who
on earth could want to kill him
street said blankly  do you suppose
with the window open yeggmen could
have-

   yeggs dont wander up to a bril-
liantly lighted house howard with
servants and people about its not
good form in that circle

   but-

   and they dont leave five or ten
thousand dollars lying loose when they
leave you know to my mind there
isnt a sign of the professional crook
about the murder anywhere

   then- the real-estate man
stopped short and his eyes dilated and
in the vaguest way he saw that colden
had winced and eyes narrowed was
waiting for his next words  by
george the girls up there all alone  
 what 

   eva dobsons adopted daugh-
ter street cried feverishly that
poor kids all alone with the tragedy
except for the servants im going up
dick 

   but-

   yes and quick too  street cried
as he dashed for the telephone and gave

the number of his office  ill tell har-
vey to attend to matters as best he can
and then- hello miss bartley 

  is that you mr street came
over the wire

   yes and i want to talk to my
brother quick 

   well he isnt here mr street the
girl said mildly  thats why im an-
swering the phone you know

   not there  street gasped

   no sir

   when did he leave miss bartley
 leave  asked the voice with a ri-
sing inflection

  yes yes es snapped the pro-
prietor of the office  and where has
he gone and when will he be back 
 im afraid lean t very well tell you
that mr street said the even oice
 he hasnt been here to-day

  he-what street scowled sud-
denly  did he telephone in 

   no sir

   then what did he say when he left
the office last night  the real-estate
man went on desperately  if he was
going anywhere to-day he must have
mentioned- it and said-

  he didnt mr street the voice
interrupted  he wasnt here yester-
day either i havent seen him since
you left together day before yester-
day

   and he-he didnt phone in yes-
terday either 

   no sir

  are you-sure of that street
gasped

  quite said the voice crisply
 ive been attending to everything mv-
self

   well youll have to keep at it to-
day then her employer said rather
blankly  i-good-by

  he turned to the detective and found
that calm person smiling faintly and
it seemed with a touch of cynicism

   hes not there dick  he cried
what of it asked colden i
could have told you that i dropped in
twice to pay my respects

   then where on earth is he  street


the cavalier

demanded wildly  he got here all
right hes been here he doesnt

drink or carouse you know and-
  was he here last night  colden

asked suddenly

  of course or-im sure i dont
know  suppose so wait 

  lie turned back to the telephone but
this time the call went no further than
the hotel office and a moment later the
clerks voice came up with

   well sir 

   parker  cried street  do you
happen to know w here my brother has
gone  

   why-no mr street

   was he around the house yester-
day 

   all day long the clerk answered
promptly lie was sitting around the
lobby from morning until night

   sitting around the lobby 

    yes sir

   what for  street asked

   i give it up m laughed the clerk
 he took a chair over by the door
about nine in the morning and sat there
until lunch then he took the table by
the door of the dining-room if i re-
member correctly and kept the lobby
in sight after lunch he spent the
afternoon in the same chair

   but why did he do it  

   he didnt say mr street

   then was he here last evening 
 i cant tell you anything about that
or-yes i can too just hold the wire
a minute mr street the night mans
just coming into the office scowling
howard street waited for perhaps a
minute then lie wasnt here last
night except for a minute or two sir 
 and when was that minute or
two

  another pause and

   he went out right after dinner sir
and came in again for a few minutes
alter midnight he stayed np-stairs
for ten minutes or so and then went
out again thats all i can learn

   well - thank you  muttered the
real-estate man as he hung up the in-
strument

  once more he turned to the detect-
ive watching him still but this time
it was without indecision instead he
shrugged his shoulders and said

   harveys disappeared thats the
usual thing w-ith harvey dick-when
you want him hes somewhere else
well-i dont know that it matters
much just now miss bartley can at-
tend to the ftice im going up to
wildclifte

   now 

   certainly evas all alone there
i cant let her-

  well pardon me howard col-
den said bluntly  but is your presence
absolutely necessary to her

   why- dont know i-

   i mean youre not engaged to
her 

   no 

   well is there an-er-an under-
standing between you or-

   what understanding should there
be between us  street demanded

   well dont excite yourself  col-
den smiled faintly  the point pm
trying to make is just this if she has
no particular reason for expecting you
to rush to her side why go 

  well why not go street de-
manded blankly  i was as close to
dobson as any one and i doubt i f any
one knowing his business affairs is in
charge

   at the same time-dont you
see- colden began haltingly-and
stopped

  and having stopped he looked
squarely at street for an instant and
shrugged his shoulders in the queerest
fashion and turned away he walked
across the room and stared savagely at
a photograph on the book-case he
turned back suddenly and his lips
opened-and again he seemed to
change his mind for they snapped to-
gether again and colden throwing his
cigarette into the open fireplace with an
emphatic  damn  looked at the floor
until street asked wonderingly

   what in heavens name is the mat-
ter with you whats on your mind  
the sinister souvenir	

   well- colden began sharply
 see here howard with whom were
you last night 

  eh marchand of course

    all night  

   yes

   all evening-i mean you were in
philadelphia all evening 

  of course i was street almost
shouted  w hy-

   with marchand  wheres mar-
chand now in philadelphia

   no hes somewhere on the
ocean the real-estate man strode
down on the other and shook him vio-
lently what is it dick whats
wrong with you  why- he glanced
at the clock just before him and start-
ed  see here if you have anything
to say say it quick boy im going to
get that noon train for wildcliffe

  a long half-minute the other looked
straight into his eyes the stare ended
with something as near a tremulous
smile as one could imagine appearing
on goldens thin calm features

   ive nothing to say howard  he
said  go ahead and get your noon
train old man and god be with you
he turned with a nod and hands in
pockets walked straight out of the
rooms

  some few seconds street stared after
him uncomprehendingly outside the
elevator gate clanged and the real-
estate man went so far as to walk to the
door and stare into the empty hallway
colden had indeed left and apparently
colden had also taken leave of his usu-
ally very active senses

  what on earth had he been talking
about in that funny disjointed fashion
had the puzzle of this or some other
crime distracted him or-or what did
his wanderings matter anyhow there
were things ahead of street consider-
ably more important than coldens in-
coherence and the quicker he went
about them the better eva all alone
up there with a hair-raising murder in
the house howard street snatching
up hat and overcoat once more rushed
out of his comfortable-and decidedly

untidy-suite and headed for the rail-
way terminal that sent a train toward
wildcliffe every hour or so

  perhaps half a minute when the
train had started he devoted to won-
dering what had become of harvey
another half-minute too he spent at
wondering w hat was amiss with col-
den that also left his mind prompt-
ly and he settled down to planning a
course of action in the unusual emer-
gency ahead

  very likely it would be best for him
to remain at the four oaks as dob-
son had chosen to name his country-
place until the funeral was over at
least there were a thousand and cue
little details in the unfortunate mans
business which he knew more intimate-
ly than any one else and there was
miss carston-or miss dobson-to be
considered too it was no situation
for any girl to handle alone-and far
less for so inexperienced so high-
strung a young woman as eva mrs
aden the housekeeper was all right in
her way of course and fenn was thor-
oughly capable as a butler and for
that matter genial dr evans was
probably doing probably would do
everything in his power to make mat-
ters easier for eva but the whole
wretched business were better in some
such hands as streets-and into them
he proposed to take it

  excitement buzzed around wildcliffe
depot when he descended

  there were a dozen more or less fa-
miliar faces alxxit he looked absently
at them and found them staring at
himself with round popping eyes and
he grunted the natives seemed thor-
oughly startled - and none of them
more so than the elderly person with
the elderly hack who usually rattled
him over to the ornate dobson place
this elderly person for a moment
looked him full in the face with mouth
wide open he turned then and gath-
ered up his reins and whipped up his
horse - and swearing audibly street
looked about for another conveyance

  he found one in charge of a boy


the cavalier

 and climbed into it quickly and he
 noted with grim amusement the lads
 tart as he named their destination and
 they trotted away from the station
 some hundred yards the boy kept si-
 lence and then

  von one o them city detectives
 mister 

 no have there been some up
here 

  three or four said the boy

  you a reporter 

no

  they wont let em in over there
 my boss told me that

  im glad to hear it

  why   the lad asked wondering-
 ly  who are you  

  my name is street if it interests
 you particularly said that gentleman

  not mr howard street  gasped
 his driver

  certainly

  my lord  ejaculated the boy as
 he lashed the horse

 is there anything amazing in
that

  well-no the boy favored him
 with an uncanny smile  only-some-
 body killed the old man last night you
 know

  well i didnt do it son said the
 real - estate man  did you think i
 did 

  my lord no  choked the unusual
 boy

 speech seemed to fail him after that
 and in cold truth street very nearly
 forgot his existence the rig was ma-
 king time and that was the main thing
 ahead around the turn they were just
 taking the big stone pillars of the gate-
 way appeared and beside them a solder-
 looking native with a shield pinned on
 his coat lie halted the rig unceremo-
 niously with

  nobodys allowed in there

  w ell im mr dobsons broker
 the visitor snapped  and im go-
 ing in

  you mr street  the other rasped
 in plain amazement

  yes

  the man with the shield considered
him very thoughtfully

   all right then he said suddenly
 drive in and say mister we may
want to hold you as - a witness
theres an investigation going on of
course

youll have no trouble getting me
street said impatiently  go on boy

  he turned back frowning for a
final glance at the man by the gates
that individual was watching him still
and - here was the house with a
bound street left the rig and tossed a
dollar to the boy with another bound
he was up the three broad steps and
confronting fenn at the open door

  and fenn usually smiling respectful
welcome scowled at him not that
under the circumstances mr street
expected an effusive greeting but-

   im here at last fenn  he stated

  the butler regarded him for a mo-
ment when he had closed the door

   i beg pardon sir but did any one
send for you  he asked

   what nostreet said blankly
 i came because-why because it was
right for me to come of course are
mr dobsons lawy ers here 

   theyre not sir fenn said flatly

   why not 

   because they telephoned up to
know should they come and i told em
as they might come when they were
sent for the butler said astonish-
ingly

   and who under the sun told you
to take that much on yourself  street
demanded warmly

   miss eva and dr evans sir after
talking it over said fenn  and if
i may make so bold mr street the
matter of sending for you was brought
up as well i may say

   and- street asked wonderingly

  and it was decided not to send for
you sir said the butler as he laid a
suggestive hand upon the knob of the
door

   well- the visitor stopped and
his eyes fiarrowed as he studied the
servant the man it seemed was tell-
the sinister souvenir



ing the truth but-what was wrong
just an instant he searched his memory
for some possible recent dereliction
that might have made him unwelcome
in such a crisis he could find none
and he knew very well that dobsons
lawyers belonged here even more prop-
erly than himself and yet fenn was
waiting with the door open an inch
and-

  f say are you inviting me to go 
street rasped

   i wouldnt make so bold as to say
that sir fenn replied stolidly

   well im not going the visitor
snapped  i dont know whats be-
hind all this but im going to find out
and if i find that youre exceeding your
orders ill see that you smart for it
fenn got that

   i hear you sir

   then say to miss eva that i am
here

   well-

   do it  street snarled savagely

  he hurled hat and coat upon the
table and walked up and down the big
corridor as he waited death seemed
in the very air of the place the tall
clock in the corner had stopped the
shades were drawn and the ground-
floor curtains as well - and a little
shiver ran through him as he came to
the end of the corridor and glanced
through the space between the hang-
ings

  it was the library that lay between
dobsons den and the rest of the house
and just now its sole occupant was a
long still form at the far side of the
room - a form outlined only by the
white sheet that covered it the real-
estate man shut his teeth and turned
away quickly-and even as he did so
quick steps came down the stairs and
he was face to face with dobsons
adopted daughter

  his heart pounded furiously fo- an
instant her eyes were red and her
cheeks white-and even so she was the
most beautiful thing he had seen in all
his life he hurried forward and
clasped the slender hand and he for-

got fenns grim disapproving coun-
tenance on the stairway for eva was
saying

   i knew that you would come mr
street

   id have been here sooner if id
heard of it sooner street said fierce-
ly as he drew her toward the shadowy
drawing-room at the side  and
now-

  he broke off helplessly for she was
crying afresh-not violently or with
any overwhelming grief as street un-
derstood thoroughly but rather with
the relax at the sight of a familiar and
he hoped trusted face in chilliest
truth there had been no tremendous
amount of love lost between john dob-
son and his ward and street was per-
haps better aware of the fact than many
others

  a little while he waited until the
weeping had subsided hardly daring to
move for she was clasping his hand
tightly and unconsciously as they sat
on a little divan at the far side of the
room but the girl looked up at last
and fairly at him-and as swiftly
looked away and bit her lips

  that avas odd too for she had a
disconcerting little trick of looking
straight into ones eyes and reading
their very thoughts it had caused him
more than one uncomfortable flush be-
fore this and for a moment the plain
evasion of his eves impressed street
and then 

   do vou-want to tell me about it
eva 

  the name slipped past his lips and
he started and he started more vio-
lently an instant later for no rebuke
came instead for the tiniest fraction
of time the deep eyes flashed upon him
a mystic smile-and the girls face had
clouded again and she was looking
away

   there is-nothing to tell she said
faintly  dr evans says that the
papers printed everything-everything
that is known

   but there must be a thousand
things big and little that escaped what


the cavalier

reporters hare been here street urged

in some astonishment  there must
be a clue or a dozen of them you
know which-

   no there is not the girl mur-
mured almost inaudibly

   but you dont want to talk about
it and im a brute to urge you the
visitor muttered  ill ask penn and
mrs aden and-

  his words died in utter amazement
for the girl had whirled upon him
she was breathing rapidly and lor the
moment her eyes were dilating with
wild excitement one hand clutched
tighter over his own and the other
caught his arm and clung there trem-
bling

   no no please dont dont ask
them-anything please she panted
no one suspected im sure-oh

chapter iv

questions unanswered

in some remote part of the house a
door closed a womans voice was
audible for a moment and fell silent
again as street and the wide-eyed girl
stared at one another-the real-estate
man rigid with sheer astonishment
eva with-ye it seemed to be fear

  and then as streets lips opened a
little cry escaped her and she turned
swiftly from him and face buried in
her hands shook with hysterical sobs

  the visitors hands dropped helpless-
ly to his sides was it possible that
eva knew-or suspected-or-he gave
it up and stared at her

  and in hardly a minute the girl
straightened up again lips compressed
and a difficult little smile flickering in
her eyes and those eyes gave street a
curious impression which his steady
unimaginative mind did not seek to
analyze there was a hint of appeal
in them a hint of defiance and there
was much more than a hint of firm re-
solve

please pay no attention to what
 am saying mr street she said

very quietly  i-this has shocked me
so-so dreadfully that-

   i know

   there is no one to suspect they
say just now and-and certainly no
one that i suspect it - all came so

suddenly-

   when he was alone 

    when he was alone there in the
library the girl repeated  there
was - just a shot she shuddered
 we-fenn and i-we went in and
found him

   and there was no sign-

   there were no traces of any one
having been there mr street the
window was wide ojen but it-it may
have been that way before you know
they say there are footprints outside
the window that is-all

  the deep eyes rested steadily upon
street again a-s if looking through and
through him and now at his quiet
smile a certain calm came into them
the soft hand was resting in his own
again and he heard

   and now you-will let me thank
you for coming mr street and-let
me go 

   go 

   yes to be alone until i have gained
some sort of control over myself
the difficult smile flickered into being
for an instant and a sudden tremor
ran through the hand within his own
 im thinking-acting-certainly talk-
ing wildly just now im afraid and-
oh i must go 

   well is mrs aden looking after
you  street asked almost fiercely as
she arose

   yes she is-doing what she can
and dr evans i should think
that he-

   oh he is good they are-all so
good  the girl cried brokenly  i-
good-by mr street

  but just one thing the visitor
cricd  do you wish me to remain
here eva  

   yes a sudden wave of
something closely akin to terror drove
the sudden flash of hope from her eyes
the sinister souvenir



a new fit of trembling- had attacked the
girl but they think-dr evans
says-

  she stopped suddenly for the cur-
tains had parted and mrs aden the
housekeeper had entered soundlessly
a second or two she looked from one
to the other and a new wonder came
to street - placid smiling comfort-
able and cheery always-the murder
had brought to mrs adens expression
an uncompromising almost masculine
stern quality and-obvious disapproval
of himself

   i dont think that you are in con-
dition to receive visitors miss eva
she said

   i

   wont you go to your room
again  the elder woman asked stead-
ily not as a question but as a com-
mand  i will see mr street

  she waited angrily it seemed as
with a quick silent pressure of streets
hand the girl turned and hurried from
the room angrily too she glanced
after the slender figure for a moment
and then

   well mr street  she snapped

   well- the visitor began in be-
wilderment

   is this a time to force business
matters on the household  

   but i-didnt come for any such
purpose street stammered i -
confound it either there is something
im incapable of understanding here
or im altogether misunderstood have
i-done anything to offend any one
mrs aden  

   nothing

   then-

   what do you wish here mr
street the housekeeper demanded
impatiently

   why i came to be of what assist-
ance i could the visitor cried as his
senses returned  i was pretty well
acquainted with mr dobson and his
affairs you know and i assumed that
there being  man to take charge of
things-why that i could be of ma-
terial aid of course

   dr evans has attended to every-
thing thank you the woman said
stonily  it will not be necessary to
trouble you

  but - good heavens street
rasped  is there such an infernal
superfluity of executive capability for
such emergencies as these that -
that- he floundered helplessly to a
standstill

  in complete silcnce mrs aden re-
garded him seconds drifted by un-
comfortably a minute was gone-and
suddenly street demanded 

   mrs aden lehat on earth is it
   what 

   this forbidding air this-

   there is no forbidding air mr
street and no mystery except the aw-
ful one of which you already know
it is simply that this is a time when-
and i am sure the rest feel as i do-
when no purely business connection of
mr dobsons should force his way into
the house

  the visitor came near to- tottering
backward she was actually saying
the words he heard actually regarding
him with a stare that savored of posi-
tive hatred - and it was mrs aden
always merry always kindly whom he
had come to regard not as a mere ac-
quaintance or the head of dobsons
household but as a friend and a good
one

  well i-im sorry that-that you
look at my visit in that way mrs
aden he stammered  i ll - go i
suppose or-

  not the slightest hindrance to his
departure was to be offered it ap-
peared  the woman merely nodded and
waited - and street all but shuffled
toward the door and into the corridor
fenn was waiting grim and disap-
proving as before and he picked up the
visitors hat and coat with alacrity and
proffered them unsmilingly rather
stupidly street acquired them-and the
door was open before him-and on the
top step stood dr evans himself
wholly sane and normal at least and
apparently rather astonished


the cavalier

 a moment lie too surveyed the vis-
 itor through his rimless glasses and
 he reached a decision for at a nod the
 door closed behind street and the two
 of them were alone in the open air
 and-

  you want to talk to me street
 the doctor asked as he shook hands

  yes i want to ask you what-

 well what ive done to the house-
 hold  

  nothing that i know of the
 physician looked at him in bland mild

 astonishment

  then-

  it isnt just a time for social calls
  i didnt come to make one evans

 i	came to find out about this dreadful

 affair

  have you read the papers street 
  of course

  then im afraid theres nothing
 more to tell you said the doctor

  and im afraid that there is a good
 deal more the real-estate man said
 vehemently  i want to know the
 whole business from one end to the
 other evans

 the physician looked him over once
 more and this time with mild amaze-
 ment

  the whole business street he
 said smoothly  is that they heard a
 shot here last night in the library
 they went in dobson was lying there
 dead-and they sent for me

  what time did it happen 

  about ten i imagine

  and what time did they send for
 you 

  immediately of course

  and you came 

  i came at once street

 and then

  well then i pronounced him dead
 my dear boy the physician said iron-
 ically  im not a wizard you know
 science as yet hasnt told us how to
 restore a man with a bullet- hole
 straight through his brain

  well was there-was there any-
 thing about the wound- street be-
 gan frowning

  the quizzical smile broadened

   there was this about the wound

street it was the clearest most indu-
bitable case of simon-pure gunshot i
ever saw in addition to the wound
itself the bullet was imbedded in the
woodwork across the library the
main fact is utterly beyond question
dobson was killed by a thirty-eight-cal-
iber bullet fired at short range

   how short  

   i give it up pretty short the
doctor said without great concern

   you - well you looked over the

room of course 

   naturally

   what did you find 

   nothing whatever

  no weapon 

   of course not street the doctor
said rather impatiently  whats the
ptfint of all this 

   the point is that i owe something
to dobson himself and i want to find
out what happened to him and what
has been done toward finding and ar-
resting the murderer street said
forcefully  im-not particularly apt
at asking questions perhaps but i
want to know whats been jon c
and-

   i can inform you fully the doctor
said with a dry smile  the coroner
appeared about midnight and took
charge of things in a cyclonic fashion
the local police also lost their nights
sleep and asked i fancy about three
million idiotic questions they discov-
ered a quantity of footprints under the
library window and just at present
they are carefully covered up with
boarding and a man is standing guard
over the boards they also found that
the creeper under the window is pretty
well torn to pieces which was-even
to our local police-pretty convincing
evidence that the thug whoever he
was climbed into the window by way
of the vines as to the identity of the
murderer ill bet ten years of my life
that they havent a suspicion and never
will have unless some lucky accident
puts them on the trail
pu  s

the sinister souvenir	

 and what is your own idea doc-

tor  lt 

   my own idea said dr evans  is

that im a physician and not a detect-
ive and that just at present im mighty
glad of it he looked at street and
smiled whimsically  im frank to say
that i give it up the thing was
lone unquestionably by some wander-
r whether a professional crook or
otherwise who strayed into the
grounds looking for what might be
picked up perhaps he saw dobsons
money from outside and assumed that
he had a chance of getting it-dob-
sons back may have been turned or
he may have been out of the room for
a moment in his den or somewhere
else the only conjecture ive made on
the known facts is that dobson walked
in and surprised him and that he lost
his head and shot the poor chap and
then jumped from the window and ran
the only two absolute certainties are
that he did do it and that he did get
away

   so that-

   so that thats all there is to it
street concluded the doctor  and
now ill have to go in and see what i
can do for the poor little girl i never
imagined that she was passionately
fond of dobson but this affair has
turned her nerves upside down well 
- he extended his hearty hand and
smiled blandly at street- going home
now- 	

   evidently said the visitor rather
unpleasantly

   homes the best place for you my
boy-anywhere but here at this time
the doctor smiled vaguely  you-
ah theres peter  he turned with an
elaborate surprise that was not at all
lost on street to the chauffeur of the
establishment who had just rolled into
view from the rear at the whee of
poor dobsons big roadster  which
way are you going peter 

   station the driver proclaimed
loudly

 well take mr street along with
you the physician fairly vociferated

 hop in street itll be pleasanter for
you than a hack good-by  

  he turned and walked straight into
the house and the door which had
opened instantly before him closed
with a loud click the chauffeur
staring straight ahead was waiting
and street lips tight shut stepped
down to the car and into it one angry
moment he contemplated quizzing the
chauffeur but even as he studied the
strange wooden expression the man
settled the matter for him by glancing
at the clock on the dashboard they
had if the clock happened to be right
just three minutes in which to make the
next down train-and the car whirled
off down the drive at a pace that drove
back streets puzzled breath

  they made the train with not more
than ten seconds to spare savagely
the rejected profferer of assistance
swung aboard as the wheels began to
turn and mile after mile had rolled by
before anything like coherent thought
came to him

  what had eva meant with that
strange  no one suspected  or had
she meant anything at all  had it
been merely hysteria or-what

  bit by bit the queerness of his whole
visit to wildcliffe came back to how-
ard street-the stare that had greeted
him at the station - the inexplicable
fashion in which his old driver had
fled-the violent emotion of the boy
when he learned his passenger s iden-
tity what had been the significance
of those manifestations

  he dismissed speculation on that
particular score very shortly and with
an impatient snarl the little town it-
self was hysterical over the sensation
doubtless all sorts of wild talk was
floating about-had been floating and
would be for weeks to come until
somebodys fire or somebodys run-
away gave a new twist to local con-
versation

  the townspeople and their attitude
were a matter of indifference to him
after all but what in the name of all
sanity had turned the household against
s

the cavalier

him because they were against him
-fenn and mrs aden and dr evans
-each in their own way had shown
distaste at his presence and why-
why - why eva - and he recalled
with a thrill that twice he had called
her by that very name-would have
preferred him there so much he felt
that he knew but the rest of them-

  a long time he sat with his head
against the back of the seat staring
at the ceiling of the rocking car and
after the long time a slow sheepish
ashamed suspicion began to creep
over him it was possible that in
actual fact he had taken altogether
too much upon himself on going up
there with his unasked assistance

  it was possible-nay in the light of
many facts it seemed probable-that
fenns attitude and mrs adens and
evanss too for that matter had
merely expressed their genuine con-
viction  he was a business connection
of dobsons an employee if it came
down to that and his fancied standing
as a friend of the household simply did
not exist

  such little misunderstandings have
a way of happening where there is
much money on one side and paid
service to the money on the other it
seemed perfectly incredible in this
particular case and yet-there was a
brick-red flush on streets cheeks as
his train came into the city he had
or he had not made a sad and clumsy
break if the former the less wild-
cliffe saw of him until he was sum-
moned for purely business purposes
the better

  	the latter-the real-estate man
came near to tearing his hair as he
stood and looked at the busy street be-
fore the depot it must be the latter
something told him-and be it con-
fessed that the something was alto-
gether eva and her odd behavior-
that there was more behind the queer
situation than he had fathomed

  and if that were the case colden
could and should do the fathoming
mr street startled several people by

bringing his clenched right fist into his
open palm with a resounding whack
after that while they still stared at
him he hurried to the telephone-booths
and called up coldens office

  the sharp young clerk answered
mr colden wasnt there he had nut
been there more than fifteen minutes
all day-and who was this street
informed him and a light seemed to
break on the clerk for he cried

   well i think youre the one he
wants to see mr street

   why 

   i dont know why but hes called
up three or four times to know if you
were in the office

   well if he comes in ask him to
wait ill be down there before closing
time

   well i guess hell wait air
street the clerk said dryly  ive
got four or live telephone numbers
here now and orders to go through
them and find him the second you turn

up-

  so colden was looking for him too

  a little while street stood and won-
dered dully he gave it up with a weary
shake of the head and boarded a car
for his hotel back in town again un-
earthly weariness was creeping over
him once more the effects of last
night wrere returning with new vigor
he had altogether forgotten that such
a thing as luncheon existed too the
first thing now would have to be a
plunge and a long-delayed bite after
that whether he liked it or not col-
den should go straight to wildclifte-

  head down in deep thought the
real-estate man trudged into the lobby
of his little hotel-and the head came
up very suddenly

  some one had fairly shot across the
tiling and grabbed his arm he looked
up to face-colden himself

  and he was no longer the utterly
calm rather cynical private detective
either his face wore an excited
flush and his eyes a perturbed expres-
sion such as street had never observed
before in those keen cool eyes an
the sinister souvenir



instant lie glanced past street and
around the lobby and then he cried
hoarsely

   you really went up there then
and-came back 

   i-of course

   thats good at least the detect-
ive muttered  come up-stairs how-
ard

   but-

   dont stand here and argue about
it said colden with another sweep-
ing survey of the place  cornel

   well ill go without being
dragged dick street said mildly
 but what under the sun-

   hush  whispered the detective
a steady cautioning hand rested
upon streets arm as the elevator shot
upward there it remained gripped
a little tighter as they walked down
the corridor and only when streets
key had admitted them to the upset
suite did the hand fall away one
last look down the corridor-a sigh-
and colden himself closed the door
and stood before his friend

   howard he said  ive known
you for some years

   what 

   weve been pretty good friends
and i thought i knewr you pretty well
-and i still think so for the matter
of that i dont know-just how to go
about this thing colclen said uncom-
fortably  but-i may as well tell you
that i was up at wildcliffe myself at
seven this morning

  there was a remarkable significance
in the words apparently and colden
waited for their effect the effect
failed altogether of materialization
for streeet no more than stood and
gazed at him as he asked

   what sent you there dick  

   primarily t went because i knew
that dobson was one of your main-
stays howard and-well i asked a
good many questions of the natives
you know

  streets face brightened  what
did you find out 

   i found out enough to worry me
    c

howard colden said gravely

 when i got back to the city just
about the time you appeared i
learned enough to wrorry me some
more

   i dont understand

  i hope to god that you dont
the detective cried  but-this after-
noon-ive been around police head-
quarters and from what i heard there
i decided that the time had come to
zvarn you

   of what

   well of the fact- colden began
loudly and desperately

  he said no more a rule of the
house evidently had been broken a
caller and one owming a very peremp-
tory set of rapping knuckles had pene-
trated to the door of the suite unan-
nounced

  a startled second or two they stared
towrard the door and the knob turned
and straight into the living-room
walked a tall broadly built citizen
clean-shaven and determined - and
street started forward gladly because
it chanced to be none other than dar-
ton headquarters detective lieutenant
one of the best-trained minds in the
bureau and streets particular friend

   well im glad to see you  he be-
gan

  are you darton asked grimly
as he dropped the others hand after
a brief strong grip and a quick hard
stare straight into the real-estate mans
eyes

  behind him coldens fingers
snapped loudly and in the detectives
voice came a simple heartfelt

   damn it 

   why damn it  darton asked cu-
riously youre not wise

   im so wise that- colden broke
off with a bitter little laugh

  the fingers snapped again and
street stared from one to the other

   well-whats this  he inquired

    its only that ive come to see you
on business old man darton said
quietly

   business 


the cavalier

  my business you know

   police business  street asked
wonderingly

  yes and ive come to see you
darton said quickly and his hard
eyes bored straight into the real-estate
man  its about the murder of this
john dobson up in westchester

chapter v

     when evidence piled high

it was the first time that howard
street had heard colden sigh in
fact he recalled suddenly several dis-
sertations of the detectives on the sigh
as a promoter of disaster in general
and now at this long whistling trem-
bling exhalation of breath which
might well have indicated that hope
had left the world altogether street
turned and laughed outright with

   whats wrong dick  darton
hasnt come for me you know 
hasnt he colden muttered as
he turned away-

   well-god bless my soul i-
street shouted in utter amazement as
he faced the officer  you-

   listen  darton held up a com-
manding hand  first of all keep
cool i had to come-you understand
that and it was better me than some-
body else wasnt it

   better you-than- street stut-
tered

  certainly were friends street
and i flagged the job quick because i
wanted it for your sake i-

   darton  colden burst out  is
there a warrant-

  the officer grinned queerly

   do you mean have i come for him
this trip

   yes 

   no  the grin broadened  do
you think id walk in on as good a
friend as streets been to me when
there are telephones working day and
night to-

     i understand colden said with
a sigh of relief

well i dont street gasped as

breath returned to him  does this
mean darton d-does it actually mean
that-that im suspected of murdering
the poor devil  

   street if youve made part of your
money winning these here guessing
contests i dont wonder at it darton
said dryly  youre good 

   but- the thunderstruck glaze
left streets eyes and his head went
back in a mirthless laugh  thats
positively the most ridiculous thing 
ever heard in all my life 

  is it asked darton soberly
 why 

   because-what time did it hap-
pen street demanded angrily

   about ten oclock

   well i was in philadelphia  the
real-estate man snapped  and by
george i hate to knock a good
friend but thats about the limit of
you peoples intelligence

  ah said darton without emo-
tion

   yes mr street cried cooling
slowly  i dont know how the thing
got into the hands of the new york
police but its a swell comment on their
methods that while the murderer is
probably somewhere over the cana-
dian border on the trucks of a freight
vou come here and tell the dead mans
-bosh 

he sat down and smiled disgustedly
at colden colden looked away in
complete silence he turned to dar-
ton and the officer smiled faintly
done street he asked calmly
 quite

   will you answer some ques-
tions 

  of course-that is if they dont
relate to dobsons private business

   have no fears on that score
darton said dryly as he pursed his lips
for a moment and considered his half-
smoked cigar  street you really
were in philadelphia

   certainly growled the real-es-
tate man

   where
the sinister souvenir	

   street gave marchands address

   with whom  

   theodore marchand of course

    the millionaire eh  

    yes

   what time were you there-last
  night i mean  

    all night

    early evening too 

    yes

   and until this morning  darton
  frowned

    certainly

  several seconds the police officer
  considered him thoughtfully and he
  ended with a little sigh of relief

    im glad of it he said candidly
    whats marchands telephone num-
   ber  

    i dont know and it doesnt mat-
ter hes gone away

  where

   to europe

   well his servants saw you of
course thats his home 

   it is his home but his servants
were not around last night they had
been dismissed the house is closed
for the summer and fall

    but somebody else wras there 

   henry kenton

  the millionaire too

    the same street grinned

   well you keep elevated company
anyhow darton observed  kenton
has a new york office hasnt he 

   he has but hes not there

   why not  asked darton sharply

   because he went south some-
where or other last night

   well where
   i havent an idea darton

  well who else w-as in the house
during the evening 

   nobody

    not a soul the police detective
asked looking up sharply

    not a soul

   so that kenton who is away and
marchand who is away are the only
two people who saw you last evening
inside the house 

    exactly

    well who saw you outside of the
 house then  

    nobody darton- i didnt leave
 it marchand and  were working to-
 gether until three this morning

    and thats why you look so like
 the devil is it darton asked cu-
 riously

    very likely

   again the officer looked him over
 and there was no impenetrable veil
 over dartons mental processes he
 was weighing the answers in the cold-
 est and most impersonal way and
 perhaps the result of the weighing was
 indicated by the faint shrug of iris
 shoulders as he asked with dwindling
 interest

    marchand sailed this morning 

    he did

    what boat 

  street named it and uneasily
watched the detective jot it down and
renewr his unwavering stare and it
seemed to the real-estate man that a
new quality had come into the stare
a moment back it had held a faint
grin now the grin was altogether
gone and dartons steady eyes might
have meant anything or nothing at all
 i dont like it  he muttered
dont like what street asked
 the color of the moon on a night
like this street darton said lucid-
ly  you dont mind a thousand more
-questions 

    i dont mind a million if theyll
 ease you darton the real-estate man
 answered grimly

    well begin then street did you
 ever have any tremble with dobson  
  what sort of trouble 

  any sort-violent arguments dis-
 putes about money or anything else 
  weve had a good many warm
 discussions first and last but nothing
 that could well be called violent-if
 you mean physical violence darton
  well thats exactly what i mean
 tjie officer said quickly  did you
 ever have any really angry sessions 
 street scratched his chin

   um-no


the cavalier

   sure

   quite

   he never threatened you in any

way n

  of course not

   and still lie had a pretty violent
temper and an active tongue 

   hes dead now but-yes

   and so by the same token
street darton rambled on easily  in
one or another of these energetic talks
you never threatened him

   i never did street replied with
a dry smile-  i dont know how you
treat your customers in the police busi-
ness but in real-estate circles it isnt
considered etiquette to blackguard a
man whos worth seven or eight hun-
dred dollars a month to one

   very likely not said darton as
he leaned back and gazed at the ceiling
through a cloud of cigar-smoke  and
still i fancy that youre independent
enough to speak your mind money or
no money if you were roused

   maybe laughed street

  he too leaned back and sighed
wearily darton seemed to have fin-
ished his rather senseless examination
for he murmured

   it was nasty last night wasnt
it

   what

   chilly for the end of may-

rainy

   yes

  did you wear an overcoat the
detective asked

   i took one with me

   what kind of a coat 

   a plain ordinary spring overcoat
bought three years ago for thirty-two
dollars and fifty cents ready-made and
still doing excellent service street
answered patiently

   what color  

   black

   black  darton looked at him
suddenly

   as black as pitch 

   and not brown  

   certainly not

   but you own a brown overcoat

street-a long loose brown over-
coat  

   ive got an old raincoat that an-
swers that general description the

real-estate man said in some astonish-
ment why

   when did you wear it last  

   oh-weeks ago darton i dont
remember when

   well youre an aristocrat owning
two overcoats like that darton
grinned  you seem to have a lot of
clothes street do you mind telling
me some more about them  

   darton said the other wearily
 all the clothes i own are in that closet
that wardrobe and that dresser if
youll let me lie down and doze while
you do it i give you full and free per-
mission to dig out every rag i possess
and examine it under a high-power mi-
croscope

  id rather have you tell me about
em the detective droned on lazily
and persistently  id like to hear
about your shoes now

   well  street stared at him

 do you own a high-heeled pair 
eh ive got a pair of hunting-
boots with pretty high heels-yes i
bought em down south three or four
years ago why

   wear them last night street 

   i havent had them on since last
fall

   um-um  darton nodded a
little space he seemed to look past the
other and then  street youre sure
that vou never threatened dobson in
any way 

   absolutely 

  in any way 

  street sat up with a scowl

   look here darton theres a limit
to everything and youve reached the
limit of this cross-examination im
not lying you know i dont do it in
the first place and in the second
theres nothing here to lie about ask
me a question once and ill tell you the
truth but dont go on asking the same
thing over and over and over again 
the detective grinned a little
 the sinister souvenir



   all right i wont he said
 street do you carry a gtin 

   i do not

   never tote a pistol with you  

   never 

   well do you mind if i browse
around the room here for a little among
your intimate possessions youve a
perfect right to forbid it you know
 why on earth should i want to
forbid it  street asked wonderingly

  there is nothing here that youre not
at liberty to examine except the con-
tents of that desk

   whats in there 

   private papers that have no con-
nection with you dobson or anything
else except confidential matters of my
clients  street rapped out

   be calm-no finger shall be laid on
em  chuckled darton as he rose

  colden standing by the window
looked squarely at him for an instant
and picking up a magazine sat down
with a thud street looking from one
to the other with weary disgust saw
the police officer saunter toward his
clothes closet and snorted

  and then he ceased to snort and
his eyes opened for darton had not
been in there half a minute when his
face appeared around the corner of the
door and he inquired rather huskily

   one more query street what
kind of soil do they have around dob-
sons place  

   clay mostly

   what color 

redder than sin what ive seen

   and you havent worn those boots
recently street

   no  shouted the real-estate man
 then- the officer disappeared
-and reappeared again just recover-
ing from a quick stoop he walked
directly to howard street and dropped
a pair of boots on the floor before him
and hell old man use a little
common sense with your lying

  he pointed silently at the high boots
he picked one up then and held it di-
rectly before streets face-and a gasp
escaped the real-estate man they

were indeed his own and they were
soaking wet even now and the high
heels and even an inch of shoe above
them were coated thickly with half
dry brilliantly red clay 

   why-i- he stammered
u think it over dont do any more
talking just now darton snapped
 things seem to have reached a point
where  may have to use whatever you
say you know just a moment

  he strode back to the closet mutter-
ing angrily and fumbled about noisily
he strode into view again and this
time his eyes shone unwilling triumph
and he held up a long brown overcoat
hastily slung on a hanger and with
back and sleeves aud shoulders still
nearly black with the soaking they had
recently received

  street started to his feet and reached
for the thing and darton snatched it
back even as he cried

   youll have to keep your hands off
street until ive looked it over he
whisked the thing a yard or two far-
ther from the real-estate man and ran
his hands rapidly over the pockets and
dartons face clouded the more and
he snapped

  upon my word street ive al-
ways known that you were a pretty
solid unimaginative sort of cuss but
im beginning to believe that either
youre a downright fool or youve sized
me up for one

   what 

   keep back and get down to the
truth dont you carry a revolver 
 i do not i-

  then whats this snarled the
detective lieutenant as he reached into
the side pocket of the brown overcoat
and held up-not the battered old
cigar-case which street remembered as
having occupied that particular pocket
but a heavy glittering revolver

  mouth open eyes bulging he stared
at the thing from the gleaming muzzle
to the big flashy pearl handle and in
the end his knees weakened suddenly
and he dropped back to the couch with
 well-


the cavalier

   the same meaning that you never
thought id really look for the things
eh   darton asked shortly as he tossed
the coat to a chair and looked hard at
the revolver  if theres one exploded
cartridge in this thing and lour good
ones- he muttered

  and his fingers had picked open the
action and his sharp eyes were looking
at the percussion-caps of the brass
shells four showed smooth and new
the fifth had been struck squarely by
the hammer of the gun a growl and
the detective emptied the cylinder on
streets table four sinister gray bul-
lets poked from four shining car-
tridges out of the fifth chamber came
an empty brazen cylinder powder-
stained and begrimed

  darton replacing them carefully
dropped the pistol into his pocket and
faced his friend with a bitter smile

   non do you want to hand me a
straight line of talk  he demanded

   but i-i have done that -i-
street stammered

   look here  the detectives voice
rose to a shout and his fist came down
on the table with a slam that sent two
or three books to the floor  ive
got a little bit of intelligence street
i couldnt hold down my job without
some brief lucid spells now and then
you know you may have nerve
enough to sit there and lie to me and
think youre getting away with it and
j may feel sort of inclined to believe
you-when its only a matter of ques-
tions and answers but-by heaven
when it comes to a pile of real actual
material evidence like this even you
must have sense enough to see-

   ive sense enough to tell you that
i dont know anything about it the
real-estate man cried wildly  how
that coat comes to be wet-how those
shoes-

  but good lord howard the
pistol- colden broke in in agonized
protest  hes found that and-

   and thats the first time in my life

a pistol was ever in a pocket of mine 
street thundered  i know no more

about- 

  all right darton interrupted
sternly  well let it go at that and
we wont yell until the hotel manage-
ment sends up to find what the trouble
is just one thing more street-and
by this time you may know enough to
tell the truth first time did you or
did you not threaten dobson f

  i did not

   did you tell him that you intended
to call on him last night  

   most certainly not i never had
such an idea in my head 

  the detective lieutenants eyes blazed
anger for a second or two he snarled
aloud and felt in his coat-pocket-and
he tossed upon the table a folded letter-
sheet

  well-you confounded fool he
said impatiently  read that and
dont try to tear it  he slapped the
bewildered mans shoulder sharply and
lointed at the thing  read it 

  he flipped the sheet open and
streets lips parted for savage protest
closed suddenly

  because for one thing the letter was
written on his own private stationery
-the sort he used at home and never
at the office the sort with  howard
street   and the name of the hotel en-
graved at the top for another the
letter had been written day before yes-
terday and he had not used a sheet of
that paper for a week or more

  but more dreadful than all was the
text itself and howard streets knees
bent under him and with a suppressed
groan he dropped into a chair and
stared at the hastily written lines

donsox

peared ready to settle your score in full

a serial

by arthur stringer

synopsis of preceding chapters

tever-fail blake the second deputy is sent after a notorious bank robber
named connie binhart who had long been successful in eluding arrest the move
appears to be a plot on the part of certain officials higher up to oust blake from the de-
partment the famous detective of the old school and believer in the third-degree treat-
ment being an impediment in their way they trust to his fame for clinging to his
quarry to keep him away while certain departmental changes come about which will re-
sult in his downfall he starts for montreal on a false scent thrown him through the
medium of elsie verriner an old sweetheart of blakes and a woman with a  record
the latter becomes a valuable implement in the hands of the officials in furthering their
scheme

chapter v
the trail warms up

 aiver-fail blake at
        the news that binhart

  i	iac sppec through the

              fingers of the montreal
officials had a moment
when he saw red all that these people
knew was that the man they were tail-
ing had bought a ticket for winnipeg
that he was not in montreal and that
beyond the railway ticket they had no
trace of him blake felt during that
moment like a drum-major who had
 muffed  his baton on parade then
recovering himself he promptly con-
firmed the teal operatives report by
telephone accepted its confirmation as
authentic consulted a time-table and
made a dash for windsor station
there he caught the winnipeg express
took possession of a stateroom and in-
dited carefully worded telegrams to
trimble in vancouver that all out-
going pacific steamers should be
watched and to menzler in chicago
that the american city might be cov-
ered in case of binharts doubling

southward on him still another tele-
gram he sent to new york requesting
the police department to send on to him
at once a photograph of binhart

  in winnipeg two days later blake
found himself on a blind trail when
he had talked with a railway detective
on whom he could rely when he had
visited certain offices and interviewed
certain officials when he had sought
out two or three women acquaintances
in the citys sequestered area he faced
the bewildering discovery that he was
still without an actual clue of the man
he was supposed to be shadowing

  it was then that something deep
within his nature whispered its first
faint doubt to him this doubt per-
sisted even when late that night a teal
agency operative wtired him from cal-
gary stating that a man answering
binharts description had just left a
certain hotel for banff to this latter
point blake promptly wired a fuller de-
scription of his raant had an officer
posted to inspect every alighting pas-
senger and early the next morning re-
ceived a telegram asking for still more
particulars

 this story began in the cavalier for september 




the cavalier

  he peered down at this message
vaguely depressed in spirit discarding
theory after theory tossing aside con-
tingency after contingency and up
from this gloomy shower slowly
emerged one of his  hunches one of
his vague impressions coming blindly
to the surface very much like an earth-
worm crawling forth after a fall of
rain

  there was something wrong of
that he felt certain he could not place
it or define it to continue westward
would be to depend too much on an un-
certainty it would involve the risk of
wandering too far from the center of
things he suddenly decided to double
on his tracks and swing down to chi-
cago just why he felt as he did he
could not fathom but the feeling was
there it was an instinctive propulsion
a  hunch these hunches were to
him working in the dark as he was
compelled to very much what whiskers
are to a cat they could not be called
an infallible guide but they at least
kept him from colliding with impreg-
nabilities

  acting on this hunch as he called it
he caught a train for minneapolis
transferred to an express and without
loss of time sped southward when
thirty hours later he alighted in the
heart of chicago he found himself in
an environment more to his liking
more adaptable to his ends

  he was not disheartened by his failure
he did not believe in luck in miracles
or even in coincidence but experience
had taught him the bewildering extent
of the resources which he might com-
mand so intricate and so wide-reach-
ing were the secret wires of his infor-
mation that he knew he could wait like
a spider at the center of its web until
the betraying vibration awakened some
far-reaching thread of that web in
every corner of the country lurked a
non-professional ally a secluded tip-
ster ready to report to blake when the
call for a report came the world that
great detective had found was indeed
a small one from its scattered four

corners into which his subterranean
wires of espionage stretched would in
time come some inkling some hint
some discovery and at the conver-
ging center of those wires blake was
able to sit and wait like the central
operator at a telephone switchboard
knowing that the tentacles of attention
were creeping and wavering about dim
territories and that in time they would
render up their awaited word

  in the mean time blake himself was
by no means idle it would not be from
official circles he knew that his re-
demption would come time had al-
ready proved that for months past
every police chief in the country had
held his description of binhart that
was a fact which binhart himself very
well knew and knowing that he would
continue to move as he had been mov-
ing with the utmost secrecy or at least
protected by some adequate disguise

  it would be from the underworld
that the echo would come and next
to new york blake knew chicago
would make as good a central exchange
for this underworld as could be desired
knowing that city of the middle west
and knowing it well he at once  went
down the line making his rounds stol-
idly and systematically first visiting a
west side faro-room and casually in-
terviewing the  stools  of custom
house place and south clark street
then dropping in at the cafe acrop-
olis in halsted street and lodging-
houses in even less savory quarters he
duly canvassed every likely dive every
 melina every gambling-house and
yegg hang-out he engaged in leisurely
games of pool with stone-getters and
gopher men he visited bucket-shops
and barrooms and dingy little ghetto
cafes he  buzzed  tipsters and float-
ers and mouth-pieces he fraternized
with till-tappers and single-drillers he
always made his inquiries after binhart
seem accidental a case apparently sub-
sidiary to two or three others which he
kept always to the foreground

  he did not despair over the discov-
ery that no one seemed to knowr of bin-
the shadow



hart or his movements he merely
waited his time and extended new
ramifications into newer territory his
word still carried its weight of official
authority there was still an army of
obsequious underlings compelled to re-
spect his wishes it was merely a mat-
ter of time and mathematics then the
law of averages would ordain its end
the needed card would ultimately be
turned up the right dial twist would at
last complete the right combination

  the first faint glimmer of life in all
those seemingly dead wires came from
a gambler named mattie sherwin who
reported that he had met binhart two
weeks before in the cafe of the brown
palace in denver he was traveling
under the name of bannerman wore
his hair in a pompadour and had
grown a beard

  blake took the first train out of chi-
cago for denver in this latter city an
elks convention was supplying blue-
bird weather for underground  hay-
makers busy with bunco-steering
 rushing  street-cars and  lifting
leathers before the stampede at the
news of his approach he picked up
biff edwards and lefty stivers put
 the screws and learned nothing he
went next to glory mcshane a market
street acquaintance indebted for cer-
tain old favors and from her too
learned nothing of moment he con-
tinued the quest in other quarters and
the results were equally discouraging

  then began the real detective work
about which blake knew newspaper
stories were seldom written this work
involved a laborious and monotonous
examination of hotel registers a can-
vassing of ticket agencies and cab-
stands and transfer companies it was
anything but story-book sleuthing it
was a dispiriting tread-mill round but
he was still sifting doggedly through
the tailings of possibilities when a code-
wire came from st louis saying bin-
hart had been seen the day before at
the planters hotel

  blake was east-bound on his way to
st louis one hour after the receipt of

this wire and an hour after his ar-
rival in st louis he was engaged in an
apparently care-free and leisurely game
of pool with one loony ryan an old-
time  box man  who was allowed to
roam with a clipped wing in the form
of a suspended indictment loony for
the liberty thus doled out to him re-
warded his benefactors by an occasion-
al indulgence in the  pigeon-act

   draw for lead  asked blake

    sure said loony

  blake pushed his ball to the top
cushion won the draw and broke

   seen anything of wolf yonk-
holm he casually inquired as he
turned to chalk his cue but his eye
with one quick sweep had made sure
of every face in the room

  loony studied the balls for a second
or two wolf was a  dip with an
international record

   last time i saw wolf he was out
at frisco workin the beaches was
loonys reply

  blake ventured an inquiry or two
about other worthies of the under-
world the players went on with their
game placid self-immured matter-of-
fact

   wheres angel mcglory these
days asked blake as he reached
over to place a ball

   whats she been doin  demand-
ed loony with his cue on the rail

   shes traveling with a bank sneak
named blanchard or binhart ex-
plained blake  and i want her

  loony ryan made his stroke

  hep roony saw binhart this
mornin beatin it for n orleans but
he wasnt travelin wit any moll that
hep spoke of

  blake made his shot chalked his cue
again and glanced down at his watch
his eyes were on the green baize but
his thoughts were elsewhere

   i got o leave you wolf he an-
nounced as he put his cue back in the
rack he spoke slowly and calmly
but wolfs quick gaze circled the room
promptly checking over every face be-
tween the four walls


the cavalier

  whats up he asked  whod

you spot  

    nothing wolf nothing but this
game o yours blamed near made me
forget an appointment o mine 

   twenty minutes alter he had left the
bewildered wolf ryan in the pool-
parlor he was in a new orleans sleeper
southward bound he knew that he
was getting within striking distance ol
binhart at last the zest of the chase
took possession of him the trail was
no longer a  cold  one he knew
which way binhart was headed and
he knew he was not more than a day
behind his man

chapter vi

and leads westward

the moment blake arrived in new
orleans he shut himself in a tele-
phone booth called up six somewhat
startled acquaintances learned nothing
to his advantage and went quickly but
quietly to the leading hotel there he
closeted himself with two dependable
 elbows started his detectives on a
round of the hotels and himself re-
paired to the levee district where he
held offhanded and ponderously face-
tious conversations with certain un-
savory characters then came a visit
to certain equally unsavory wharf-rats
and a call or two on south rampart
street but still no inkling of binhart
or his intended movements came to the
detectives ears

   it was not until the next morning as
he stepped into antoines on st louis
street just off the rue royal that any-
thing of importance occurred the
moment he entered that bare and clois-
tral restaurant where monsieur jules
could dish up such startling uncloistral
dishes his eyes fell on abe sheiner a
drum snuffer with whom he had had
previous and somewhat painful en-
counters sheiner it was plain to see
was in clover for he was breakfasting
regally on squares of toast covered
with shrimp and picked crab meat

creamed a bisque of cray-fish and papa-

bo tics m ribbons of bacon to say
nothing of fruit and bruillcau

  blake insisted on joining his old
friend sheiner much to the latters
secret discomfiture it was obvious
that the drum snuffer having made a
recent haul would be amenable to per-
suasion and like all yeggs he was
an upholder of the  mocassin tele-
graph a wanderer and a carrier of
stray tidings as to the movements of
others along the undergrooves of the
world

  so while blake breakfasted on
shrimp and crab meat and french
artichokes stuffed with caviar and
anchovies he intimated to the uneasy-
minded sheiner certain knowledge as
to a certain recent coup in the face
of this charge sheiner indignantly
claimed that he had only been playing
the ponies and having a run of green-
horns luck

   abe ive come down to gather
you in announced the calmly men-
dacious detective he continued to sip
his bruillcau with fraternal unconcern

   you got nothing on me jim pro-
tested the other losing his taste for the
delicacies arrayed about him

   well we got o go down to head-
quarters and talk that over calmly
persisted blake

   whats the use of pounding me
when im on the square again 

    thats the line o talk they all hand
out thats what connie binhart said
when we had it out up in st louis

   did you bump into binhart in st
louis  

   we had a talk three days ago

   then whyd he blow through this
town as though he had a regiment o
bulls and singed cats behind him 
blakes heart went down like an ele-
vator with a broken cable but he gave
no outward sign of this inward com-
motion

   because he wants to get down to
colon before the passenger-boat hits
the port ventured blake  his molls
aboard 
the shadow



  but he blew out for frisco this
morning contended the puzzled
sheiner  shot through as though
hed just had a rumble 

   oh he said that but he went south
all right

   then he went in an oyster-sloop
theres nothing sailing from this port
to-day

   well whats binhart got to do
with our trouble anyway what i
want-

    but i saw him start persisted the
other  he ducked for a day-coach
and said he was traveling for his
health and he sure looked like a man
in a hurry 

  blake sipped his bruilleau glanced
casually at his watch and took out a
cigar and lighted it he blinked con-
tentedly across the table at the man he
was  buzzing the trick had been
turned the word had been given he
knew that binhart was headed west-
ward again he also knew that bin-
hart had awakened to the fact that he
was being followed that his feverish
movements were born of a stampeding
fear of capture

  yet binhart was not a coward
flight in fact was his only resource
it was only the low-brow criminal
blake knew who ran for a hole and
hid in it until he was dragged out the
more intellectual type of offender pre-
ferred the open

  and binhart was of this type he
was suave and artful he was active
bodied and experienced in the ways of
the world what counted still more
he was well heeled with money just
how much he had planted away after
the newcomb coup no one knew but
no one denied that it was a fortune it
was ten to one that binhart would now
try to get out of the country he
would make his way to some territory
without an extradition treatv he
would look for a land where he could
live in peace where his ill-gotten
wealth would make exile endurable

  blake as he smoked his cigar and
turned these thoughts over in his mind

could afford to smile there would be
no peace and no rest for connie bin-
hart he himself would see to that
and he would  get  his man whether
it was in a weeks time or a months
time he would get his man and take
him back in triumph to new york he
would show copeland and the commis-
sioner and the world in general that
there was still a little life in the old
dog that there was still a haul or two
he could make

  so engrossing were these thoughts
that blake scarcely heard the drum
snuffer across the table from him pro-
testing the innocence of his ways and
the purity of his intentions then for
the second time that morning blake
completely bewildered him by sudden-
ly accepting those protestations and
agreeing to let everything drop it was
necessary of course to warn sheiner
to exact a promise of better living but
blakes interest in the man had already
departed he dropped him from his
scheme of things once he had yielded
up his data he tossed him aside like
a sucked orange a smoked cigar a
burnt-out match binhart in all the
movements of all the stellar system
was the one name and the one man
that interested him

  loony sheiner was still sitting at
that table in antoines when blake
having wired his messages to san
pedro and san francisco caught the
first train out of new orleans as he
sped across the face of the world
crawling nearer and nearer the pacific
coast  thought of the magnitude of
that journey oppressed him his im-
agination remained untouched he
neither fretted nor fumed at the time
this travel was taking

  in spite of the electric fans at each
end of his pullman it is true he suf-
fered greatly from the heat especially
during the ride across the arizona
desert he accepted it without com-
plaint stolidly thanking his lucky stars
that men werent still traveling across
americas deserts by ox-team he was
glad when he reached the colorado


the cavalier

river and wound up into california
leaving the alkali and sage-brush and
yucca palms of the mojave well behind
him he was glad in his placid sav
when he reached his hotel in san fran-
cisco and washed the grit and grime
from his heat-nettled body

  but once that body had been bathed
and fed he started on his rounds of the
underworld seined the entire harbor
front without effect and then set out
his night-lines as cautiously as a fisher-
man in forbidden waters lie did not
overlook the shipping offices and rail-
way stations neither did he neglect the
hotels and ferries then he quietly
lunched at martenellis with the much-
honored but most-uncomfortable wolf
yonkholm who promptly suspended
his  dip  operations at the beaches
out of respect to blakes sudden call

  nothing of moment however was
learned from the startled wolf and at
coppas six hours later blake dined
with a chink smuggler named goldie
hopper goldie after his fifth glass
of wine and an adroit decoying of the
talk along the channels which most in-
terested his portly host casually an-
nounced that an eastern crook named
blanchard had got away the day be-
fore on a certain mail steamer he
was clean-shaven and traveled as a
clergyman that struck goldie as the
height of humor a bank sneak having
the nerve to deck himself out as a
gospel-spieler

  his elucidation of it however
brought no answering smile from the
diffident-eyed blake who confessed
that he was rounding up a couple of
nickel-coiners and would be going east
in a day or two

  instead of going east however he
hurriedly consulted maps and time-
tables found a train that would laud
him in portland in twenty-six hours
and started north he could eventu-
ally save time he found by hastening
on to seattle and catching a steamer
from that port when a hot-box held
his train up lor over half an hour
blake stood with his timepiece in his

 hand watching the train-crew in their

 efforts to  freeze the hub they con-
 tinued to lose time during the night
 at seattle when he reached the docks
 he found that his steamer had sailed
 two hours before he stepped from his
 sleeper

   	is one remaining resource was a
 steamer from victoria this he
 figured out would get him to hong-
 kong even earlier than the steamer
 which he had already missed he had
 a hunch that hong-kong was the port
 he wanted just why he could not ex-
 plain but he felt sure that binhart
 would not drop off at manila once
 on the run he would keep out of
 american quarters it was a gamble
 it was a rough guess but then all life
 was that and blake had a dogged and
 inarticulate faith in his  hunches

    crossing the sound he reached vic-
 toria in time to see the ship under way
 and heading out to sea blake hired a
 tug and overtook her he reached the
 steamers deck by means of a jacobs-
 ladder that swung along her side-plates
 like a masons plumb-line along a fac-
 f tory wall

    binhart he told himself was by this
 time in the mid-pacific untold miles
 away heading for that vast and mys-
 terious east into which a man could so-
 easily disappear he was approaching
 gloomy and tangled waterways that
 threaded between islands which could
 not even be counted he was fleeing
 toward- dark rivers which led off
 through barbaric and mysterious si-
 lence into the heart of darkness he
 was drawing nearer and nearer to those
 regions of mystery where a white man
 might be swallowed up as easily as a
 rice grain is lost in a shore lagoon he
 would soon be in those teeming alien
 cities as underburrowed as a gopher
 village

   but blake did not despair their
 whole barbaric east he told himself
 was only a chinatown slum on a large
 scale and he had never yet seen the
 slum that remained forever impervious i
 to the right drag-net he did not know 
the shadow



 how or where the end would be but
 he knew there would be an end he
 still hugged to his bosom the placid
 conviction that the world was small
 that somewhere along the frontiers of
 watchfulness the impact would be re-
 corded and the alarm would be given

    a man of binharts type with the
 money binhart had would never
 divorce himself completely from civili-
 zation he would always crave a
 white mans world he would always
 hunger for what that world stood for
 and represented he would always
 creep back to it he might hide in his
 heathen burrow for a time but there
 would be a limit to that exile a power
 stronger than his own will would drive
 him back to his own land back to
 civilization and civilization to blake
 was merely a rather large and ram-

-	bling house equipped with a rather
 efficient burglar-alarm system so that
 each time it was entered early or late
 the telltale summons would eventually
 go to the right quarter and when the
 summons came blake would be waiting
 for it

chapter vii
to the orient

 t was by wireless that blake made
 what efforts he could to confirm
 his suspicions that binhart had not
 dropped off at any port of call between
 san francisco and hong-kong in
 due time the reply came back to
 bishop mackishnie  that the rev
 caleb simpson had safely landed at
 hong-kong and was about to leave
 for the mission field in the interior

   the so-called bishop sitting in the
 wireless-room received this much re-
 layed message with mixed feelings he
 proceeded to send out three secret
 service code-despatches to shanghai
 amoy and hong-kong which being
 picked up by a german cruiser were
 worried over and argued over and
 finally referred back to an intelligence
 bureau for explanation

  but at yokohama blake hurried
ashore in a sampan met an agent who
seemed to be awaiting him and caught
a train for kobe he hurried on in-
different to the beauties of the country
through which he wound unimpressed
by the oddities of the civilization with
which he found himself confronted
his mind intent on one thing seemed
unable to react to the stimuli of side-
issues from kobe he caught a
steamer for nagasaki and shanghai
this steamer he found lay over at the
former port for thirteen hours so he
shifted again to an outbound boat
headed for woosung

   it was not until he was on the tender
making the hour-long run from woo-
sung up the whangpoo to shanghai
itself that he seemed to emerge from
his half-cataleptic indifference to his
environment he began to realize that
he was at last in the orient

  as they wound up the river past
sharp - nosed and round - hooded sam-
pans and archaic chinese battle-ships
and sea-going junks and gunboats fly-
ing their unknown foreign flags blake
at last began to realize that he was in
a new wrorld the very air smelled
exotic the very colors the tints of the
sails the hues of clothing the forms of
things land and sky itself-all were
different this depressed him only
vaguely he was too intent on the
future on the task before him to give
his surroundings much thought

  blake had entirely shaken off this
vague uneasiness in fact when twenty
minutes after landing he found himself
in a red-brick hotel known as the
astor and guardedly shaking hands
with an incredulously thin and sallow-
faced man of about forty although
this man spoke with an english ac-
cent and exile seemed to have foreign-
eered him in both appearance and out-
look his knowledge of america was
active and intimate he passed over
to the detective two despatches in
cipher handed him a confidential list of
hong-kong addresses gave him cer-
tain information as to macao and an


the cavalier

hour later conducted him down the
river to the steamer which started that
night for hong-kong

  as blake trod that steamers deck
and plowed on through strange seas
surrounded by strange laces intent on
his strange chase no sense of vast ad-
venture entered his soul no appre-
ciation of a great hazard bewildered
his emotions the kingdom of ro-
mance dwells in the heart in the heart
roomy enough to house it and blakes
heart was taken up with more material
things he was preoccupied with his
new list of addresses with his new
lines of procedure with the men he
must interview and the dives and clubs
and bazaars he must visit he had his
days work to do and he intended to
do it

  the result was that of hong-kong
he carried away no immediate personal
impression beyond a vague jumble in
the background of consciousness of
buddhist temples and british red-
jackets of stately parks and granite
buildings of mixed nationalities and
native theaters of anchored war-ships
and a floating city of house-boats

  for it was the same hour that he
landed in this orderly and strangely
english city that the discovery he was
drawing close to binhart again swept
clean the slate of his emotions the
response had come from a consulate
secretary one wire in all his sentinel
network had proved a live one bin-
hart was not in hong-kong but he
had been seen in macao he was known
to be still there and beyond that there
was little that never-fail blake cared
to know

  his one side movement in hong-
kong was to purchase an american re-
volver for it began to percolate even
through his indurated sensibilities that
he was at last in a land where his name
might not be sufficiently respected and
his office sufficiently honored for the
first time in seven long years he packed
a gun he condescended to go heeled
yet no minutest tingle of excitement
spread through his lethargic body as he

examined this gun carefully loaded it
and stowed it away in his wallet-pocket
it meant no more to him than the stow-
ing away of a sandwich against the
emergency of a possible lost meal

chapter viii

 clisraas

ry the time he was on the noon boat
that left for macao blake had
quite forgotten about the revolver as
he steamed southward over smooth
seas threading a way through boulder-
strewn islands and skirting mountain-
ous cliffs his movements seemed to
take on a sense of finality he stood
at the rail wratching the hazy blue
islands the forests of fishing-boats and
high-pooped junks floating lazily at
anchor the indolent figures that he
could catch glimpses of on deck the
green waters of the china sea he
watched them with intent yet ab-
stracted eyes some echo of the
witchery of those eastern waters at
times penetrated his own preoccupied
soul a vague sense of his remoteness
from his old life at last crept in to him

  he thought of the watching green
lights that were flaring up dusk by
dusk in the shrill new york night the
lamps of the precinct stations the
lamps of headquarters where the great
building was full of moving feet and
shifting faces where telephones were
ringing and detectives were coming
and going and policemen in uniform
were passing up and down the great
stone steps clean-cut ruddy-faced
strong-limbed policemen talking and
laughing as they started out on their
night details he could follow them
as they went those confident-striding
 flatties  with their ash night-sticks
at their side soldiers without bugles or
banner going out to do the goodly
tasks of the law soldiers of whom he
was once the leader the pride the man
to whom they pointed as the yidocq of
america

and he would go back to them as
the shadow



great as ever he would again compel
their admiration the newspaper boys
would again come filing into his office
and shake hands with him and smoke
his cigars and ask how much he could
tell them about his last haul and he
would recount to them how he shad-
owed binhart half-way round the
world and gathered him in and
brought him back to justice

   it was three oclock in the afternoon
when blakes steamer drew near
macao against a background of dim
blue hills he could make out the green
and blue and white of the houses in the
portuguese quarters guarded on one
side by a lighthouse and on the other
by a stolid square fort swinging
around a sharp point the boat entered
the inner harbor crowded with chi-
nese craft and coasters and dingy
tramps of the sea

  blake seemed in no hurry to disem-
bark the sampan into which he
stepped in fact did not creep up to the
shore until evening there ignoring
the rickshaw coolies who awaited him
as he passed an obnoxiously officious
trio of customs officers he disappeared
up one of the narrow and slippery side
streets of the chinese quarter

   he followed this street for some dis-
tance assailed by the smell of its mud
and rotting sewerage twisting and
turning deeper into the darkness past
dogs and chattering coolies and oil
lamps and gaming-house doors into
one of these gaming houses he turned
passing through the blackwood sliding
door and climbing the narrow stairway
to the floor above there from a small
quadrangular gallery he could look
down on the  well  of the fan-tan lay-
out below

   he made his way to a seat at the rail
took out a cigar lighted it and let his
veiled gaze wander about the piace
point by point until he had inspected
and weighed and appraised every man
in the building he continued to smoke
listlessly like a sightseer with time on
his hands and in no mood for move-
ment the brim of his black boulder

shadowed his eyes his thumbs rested
carelessly in the armholes of his waist-
coat he lounged back torpidly listen-
ing to the drone and clatter of voices
below lazily inspecting each new-
comer pretending to drop off into a
doze of ennui but all the while he was
most acutely awake

  for somewhere in that gathering he
knew there was a messenger awaiting
him whether he was english or
portuguese white or yellow blake
could not say but from some one
there some word or signal was to come

  he peered down at the few white
men in the pit below he watched the
man at the head of the carved black-
wood table beside his heap of brass
 cash watched him again and again
as he took up his handful of coins cov-
ered them with a brass hat while the
betting began removed the hat and
seemed to be dividing the pile with the
wand in his hand into fours the last
number of the last four apparently
was the object of the wagers

  blake could not understand the game
it puzzled him just as the yellow men
so stoically playing it puzzled him just
as the entire country puzzled him yet
obtuse as he was he felt the gulf of
centuries that divided the two races
these yellow men about him seemed as
far away from his humanity as de-
tached from his manner of life and
thought as were the animals he some-
times stared at through the bars of the
bronx zoo cages

  a white man would have to be pretty
far gone blake decided to fall into
their ways to be satisfied with the life
of those yellow men he would have
to be a terrible failure or he would
have to be hounded by a terrible fear
to live out his life so far away from his
own kind and he felt now that bin-
hart could never do it that a life sen-
tence there would be worse than a life
sentence to  stir so he took another
cigar lighted it and sat back watching
the faces about him

  for no apparent reason and at no
decipherable sign one of the jrellow


the cavalier

faces across the smoke-filled room de-
tached itself from its fellows this
face showed no curiosity no haste
blake watched it as it calmly ap-
proached him he watched until he
felt a finger against his arm

   you clum blong me was the
enigmatic message uttered in the de-
tectives ear

   why should i go along with you  
blake calmly inquired

   you clum blong me reiterated
the chinaman the linger again
touched the detectives arm clismas 

  blake rose at once he recognized
the code word of u christmas this
was the messenger he had been await-
ing

  he followed the figure down the
narrow stairway through the sliding
door out into the many-odored street
foul with refuse bisected by its open
sewer of filth took a turning into a
still narrower street climbed a pre-
cipitous hill cobbled with stone turned
still again always overshadowed and
hemmed in by tall houses close to-
gether with black-beamed lattice doors
through which he could catch glimpses
of gloomy interiors he turned again
down a wooden-walled hallway that re-
minded him of a mott street burrow
when the chinaman touched him on
the sleeve he came to a stop

  his guide was pointing to a closed
door in front of them

   you sabby  he demanded

  blake hesitated he had no idea of
what was behind that door but he
gathered from the chinamans motion
that he was to enter before he could
turn to make further inquiry the china-
man had slipped away like a shadow

chapter ix

an adventure incarnadine

j-lake stood regarding the door

     then he lifted his revolver from
his breast pocket and dropped it into
his side pocket with his hand on the
butt then with his left hand he

quietly opened the door pushed it back
and as quietly stepped into the room

   on the floor in the center of a square
of orange-colored matting he saw a
white woman sitting she was drink-
ing tea out of an egg-shell of a cup
and after putting down the cup she
would carefully massage her lips with
the point of her little finger this
movement puzzled the newcomer until
he suddenly realized that it was merely
to redistribute the rouge on them

  she was dressed in a silk petticoat
of almost lemon-yellow and an azure-
colored silk bodice that left her arms
and shoulders bare to the light that
played on them from three small oil-
iamps above her her feet and ankles
were also bare except for the matting
sandals into which her toes were thrust
on one thin arm glimmered an extraor-
dinarily heavy bracelet of gold her
skin which was very white was further
albificated by a coat of rice powder
she was startlingly slight blake as
he watched her could see the oval
shadows under her collar-bones and the
almost girlish meagerness of breast
half covered by the azure silk bodice

  she looked up slowly as blake slowly
stepped into the room her eyes
widened and she continued to look
with parted lips as she contemplated
the intruders heavy figure there was
no touch of fear on her face it was
more curiosity the wilful wide-eyed
curiosity of the child she even
laughed a little as she stared at the in-
truder her rouged lips were tinted a
carmine so bright that they looked like
a wound across her white face that
gash of color became almost clownlike
as it crescented upward with its way-
ward mirth her eyebrows were
heavily penciled and the lids of the eyes
elongated by a widening point of blue
paint pier bare heel which she
caressed from time to time with fingers
whereon the nails were stained pink
with henna was small and clean cut as
clean cut blake noticed as the heel of
a razor while the white calf above it
was as thin and flat as a boys
the shadow



   hello new york  she said with
her foolish and inconsequential little
laugh her voice took on an oddly
exotic intonation as she spoke her
teeth were small and white they re-
minded blake of rice while she repeat-
ed the  new york  bubblingly as
though she were a child with a newly
learned word

   hello  responded the detective
wondering how or where to begin
she made him think of a painted
marionette so maintained were her
poses so unreal was her make-up

   youre the party whos on the
man-hunt she announced

   am i   equivocated blake she
had risen to her feet by this time with
monkeylike agility and showed her-
self to be much taller than he had im-
agined he noticed a knife-scar on
her forearm

   youre after this man called bin-
hart she declared

   oh no im not was blakes
sagacious response  i dont want
binhart

   then what do you want 

   i want the money hes got

  the little painted face grew serious
then it became veiled

   how much money has he  

 thats what i want to find out 
she squatted ruminatively down on
the edge of her divan it was low
and wide and covered with orange-
colored silk i

   then youll have to find binhart 
was her next announcement

  maybe acknowledged blake

   i can show you where he is 

   all right was the unperturbed
response the blue-painted eys were
studying him

   it will be worth four thousand
pounds in english gold she an-
nounced

  is that the message ottenheim told
you to give me he demanded his
face was red with anger

   then three thousand pounds she
calmly suggested wriggling her toes
into a fallen sandal

   	c

  blake did not deign to speak his
inarticulate grunt was one of disgust

   then a thousand in gold she
coyly intimated she twisted about to
pull the strap of her bodice up over fcer
white shoulder-blades  or i will kill
him for you for two thousand pounds
in gold 

  her eyes were as tranquil as a
childs blake remembered that he
was in a world not his own

  why should i want him killed
he inquired he looked about for
some place to sit there was not a
chair in the room

   because he intends to kill you
answered the woman squatting on the
orange-covered divan

   i wish hed come and try blake
devoutly retorted

   he will not come she told him
 it will be done from the dark i
could have done it but ottenheim
said no

   and ottenheim said you were to
work with me in this declared blake
putting two and two together

  the woman shrugged a white shoul-
der

   have you any money  she asked
she put the question with the artless-
ness of a child

    mighty little retorted blake still
studying the woman from where he
stood he was wondering if otten-
heim had the same hold on her that the
authorities had on ottenheim the ex-
forger who enjoyed his parole only on
condition that he remain a stool-pigeon
of the high seas he pondered what
force he could bring to bear on her
what power could squeeze from those
carmine and childish lips the informa-
tion he must have

  he knew that he could break that
slim body of hers across his knee but
he also knew that he had no way of
crushing out of it the truth he sought
the truth he must in some way obtain
the woman still squatted on the divan
peering down at the knife-sear on her
arm from time to time studying it as
though it were an inscription


the cavalier

  blake was still watching the woman
when the door behind him was slowly
opened a head was thrust in and
as quietly withdrawn again blake
dropped his right hand to his coat-
pocket and moved further along the
wall facing the woman there was
nothing of which he stood afraid he
merely wished to be on the safe side

   well what wordll i take back to
ottenheim he demanded

  the woman grew serious then she
showed her ricelike row of teeth as she
laughed

   that means theres nothing in it
for me she complained with pouting-
lipped moroseness her venality he
began to see was merely the instinct-
ive acquisitiveness of the savage the
greed of the petted child

   no more than there is for me
blake acknowledged she turned and
caught up a heavily flowered mandarin
coat of plaited cream and gold she
was thrusting one arm into it when a
figure drifted into the room from the
matting-hung doorway on blakes left
as she saw this figure she suddenly
flung oft the coat and stooped to the
tea-tray in the middle of the floor

  blake saw that the newcomer was a
chinaman this newcomer he also
saw ignored him as though he were
a door-post confronting the woman
and assailing her with a quick volley
of words of incomprehensible words
in the native tongue she answered
with the same clutter and clack of un-
known syllables growing more and
more excited as the dialogue continued
her thin face darkened and changed
her white arms gyrated the fires of
anger burned in the babylike eyes

  she seemed expostulating arguing
denouncing and each wordy sally was
met by an equally wordy sally from
the chinaman she challenged and
rebuked with her passionately pointed
finger she threatened with angry eyes
she stormed after the newcomer as he
passed like a shadow out of the room
she met him with a renewed storm
when he returned a moment later

  the chinaman now stood watching
her impassive and immobile as though
he had taken his stand and intended
to stick to it blake studied him with
calm and patient eyes that huge-
limbed detective in his day had
 pounded  too many christy street
chinks to be in any way intimidated
by a queue and a yellow face he
was not disturbed he was merely
puzzled

  then the woman turned to the man-
darin coat and caught it up shook it
out and for one brief moment stood
thoughtfully regarding it then she
suddenly turned about on the china-
man

  blake as he stood watching that
renewed angry onslaught paid little
attention to the actual words that she
was calling out but as he stood there
he began to realize that she was not
speaking in chinese but in english

   do you hear me white man do
you hear me  she cried out over and
over again yet the words seemed
foolish for all the time as she uttered
them she was facing the placid-eyed
chinaman and gesticulating in his face

   dont you see blake at last heard
her crying  he doesnt know what im
saying he doesnt understand a
word of english and then and
then only it dawned on blake that
every word the woman was uttering
was intended for his own ears she
was warning him and all the while
pretending that her words were the
impetuous words of anger

   watch this man  he heard her
cry  dont let him know youre lis-
tening but remember what i say re-
member it and god help you if you
havent got a gun

  blake could see her as in a dream
assailing the chinaman with her ges-
tures advancing on him threatening
him expostulating with him but all in
pantomime there was something ab-
surd about it as absurd as a moving-
picture film which carries the wrong
text

   hell pretend to take you to the man
the shadow



you want the woman was panting
 thats what he will say but its a
lie hell take you out to a sampan
to put you aboard binharts boat but
the three of them will cut your throat
and then drop you overboard hes
to get so much in gold- get out of here
with him let him think youre going
but drop away somewhere before you
get to the beach and watch them all
the way

  blake stared at the immobile china-
man as though to make sure that the
other man had not understood he
was still staring at that impassive yel-
low face he was still absorbing the
shock of his news when the outer door
opened and a second chinaman stepped
into the room the newcomer clut-
tered a quick sentence or two to his
countryman and was still talking when
a third figure sidled in

  those spoken words whatever they
were seemed to have little effect on
any one in the room except the woman
she suddenly sprang about and ex-
ploded into an angry shower of denials

  its a lie she cried in english
storming about the impassive trio
 you never heard me peach you
never heard me say a word its a
lie 

  blake strode to the middle of the
room towering above the other figures
dwarfing them by his great bulk as
assured of his mastery as he would
have been in a chatham square gang-
fight

  whats the row here he thun-
dered knowing from the past that
power promptly won its own respect
 what re you talking about you
two he turned from one intruder
to another  and you  and you 
what do you want anyway  

  the three contending figures how-
ever ignored him as though he were a
tobacconists dummy they weit on
with their exotic cackle as though he
was no longer in their midst they
did not so much as turn an eye in his
direction and still blake felt reason-
ably sure of his position

  it was not until the woman squeaked
like a frightened mouse and ran whim-
pering into the corner of the room
that lie realized what was happening
he was not familiar with the wrist
movement by which the smallest-
bodied of the three men was producing
a knife from his sleeve the woman
had understood from the first

   white man look out  she half
sobbed from her corner  oh white
man  she repeated in a shriller note
as the chinaman bending low scuttled
across the room to the corner where
she cowered

  blake saw the knife by this time
it was thin and long for all the world
like an icicle a shaft of cutting steel
ground incredibly thin-so thin in
fact that at first sight it looked more
like a point for stabbing than a blade
for cutting

  the mere glitter of that knife elec-
trified the staring white man into sud-
den action he swung about and tried
to catch at the arm that held the steel
icicle he was too late for that but
his fingers closed on the braided queue
by means of this queue he brought the
chinaman up short swinging him
sharply about so that he collided fiat-
faced with the room wall

  then for the first time blake grew
into a comprehension of what sur-
rounded him he wheeled about
stooped and caught up the papier-
mache tea-tra from the floor and once
more stood with his back to the wall
he stood there on guard for a second
figure with a second steel icicle was
sidling up to him he swung viciously
out and brought the tea-tray down on
the hand that held this knife crippling
the fingers and sending the steel spin-
ning across the room

  then with his free hand he tugged
the revolver from his coat-pocket lidd-
ing it by the barrel and bringing the
metal butt down on the queue-wound
head of the third man who had no
knife but was struggling with the
woman for the metal icicle she had
caught up from the floor


the cavalier

  then the five seemed to close in to-
gether and the fight became general
it became a melee with his swinging
right arm blake battered and pounded
with his revolver-butt with his left
hand he made cutting strokes with the
heavy papier-mache tea-tray keeping
their steel by those fierce sweeps away
from his body

  one chinaman he sent sprawling
leaving him huddled and motionless
against the orange-covered divan the
second stunned by a blow of the tea-
tray across the eyes could offer no
resistance when blakes smashing right
dealt its blow the metal gun-butt fall-
ing like a trip-hammer on the shaved
and polished skull

  as the white man swung about he
saw the third chinaman with his hand
on the womans throat holding her
flat against the wall placing her there
as a butcher might place a fowl on his
block ready for the blow of his carver
blake stared at the movement panting
for breath overcome by that momen-
tary indifference wherein a winded ath-
lete permits without protest an adver-
sary to gain his momentary advantage

  then will triumphed over the weak-
ness of the body but before blake
could get to the womans side he saw
the chinamans loose-sleeved right
hand slowly and deliberately ascend
as it reached the meridian of its cir-
cular upsweep he could see the woman
rise on her toes rise as though with
some quick effort yet some effort
which blake could not understand-

  at the same moment that she did so
a look of pained expostulation crept
into the staring slant eyes on a level
with her own the yellow jaw gaped
filled with blood and the poised knife
fell at his side sticking point down in
the flooring the azure and lemon-
y el low that covered the womans body
flamed into sudden scarlet

  it wras only as the figure with the
expostulating yellow face sank to the
ground crumpling up on itself as it
fell that blake comprehended that
quick sweep of scarlet effacing the

azure and lemon had come from the
sudden deluge of blood that burst over
the womans body she had made use
of the upstroke mexican style her
knife had cut the full length of the
mans abdominal cavity clean and
straight to the breastbone he had
been ripped up like a herring

  blake panted and wheezed not at the
sight of the blood but at the exertion
to which his flabby muscles had been
put his body was moist with sweat
his asthmatic throat seemed stifling his
lungs a faint nausea crept through
him a dim ventral revolt at the thought
that such things could take place so
easily and with so little warning

  his breast still heaved and panted
and he was still fighting for breath
when he saw the woman stoop and
wipe the knife on one of the fallen
chinamans sleeves

   wvve got to get out of here  she
whimpered as she caught up the man-
darin coat and flung it over her shoul-
ders for in the struggle her body had
been bared almost to the waist blake
saw the crimson that dripped on her
matting slippers and maculated the
cream white of the mandarin coat

   but wheres binhart  he demand-
ed as he looked stolidly about for his
black boulder

   never mind binhart she cried
touching the eviscerated body at her
feet with one slipper toe  or well get
what he got 

  i want that man binhart per-
sisted the detective

   not here not here she cried
folding the loose folds of the cloak
closer about her body

  she ran to the matting curtain
looked out and called back quick
come quick  then she ran back
slipped the bolt in the outer door and
rejoined the waiting detective

   oh white man she gasped as
the matting fell between them and the
room incarnadined by their struggle
blake was not sure but he thought he
heard her giggle hysterically in the
darkness they were groping their
the shadow



way along a narrow passage they
slipped through a second door closed
and locked it after them and once more
groped on through the darkness

  how many turns they took blake
could not remember she stopped and
whispered to him to go softly as they
came to a stairway as steep and dark
as a cistern blake at the top could
smell opium smoke and once or twice
he thought he heard voices the wom-
an stopped him with outstretched arms
at the stair tiead and together they
stood and listened

  blake with nerves taut waited for
some sign from her to go on again
he thought she was giving it when he
felt a hand caress his side he felt it
move upward exploringly at the
same time that he heard her little groan
of alarm he knew that the hand was not
hers

  he could not tell what the darkness
held but his movement was almost in-
stinctive he swung out with his great
arm countered on the crouching form
in front of him caught at a writhing
shoulder and tightening his grip sent
the body catapulting down the stair-
way at his side he could hear a re-
volver go off as the body went tumbling
and rolling down-blake knew that it
was a gun not his own

   come on white man  the girl in
front of him was crying as she tugged
at his coat and they went on now at
a run taking a turn to the right ma-
king a second descent and then another
to the left they came to still another
door which they locked behind them
then they scrambled up a ladder and
he could hear her quick hands padding
about in the dark a moment later she
had thrust up a hatch he saw it led
to the open air for the stars were above
them

  he felt grateful for that open aw for
the coolness for the sense of deliver-
ance which came with even that com-
parative freedom

   dont stop  she whispered and
he followed her across the slant of the
uneven roof he was weak for want

of breath the girl had to catch him
and hold him for a moment

   on the next roof you must take off
your shoes she warned him  you
can rest then but hurry-hurry 

  he gulped down the fresh air as he
tore at his shoe-laces thrusting each
shoe in a side pocket as he started after
her for by this time she was scram-
bling across the broken sloping roofs
as quick and agile as a cat dropping
over ledges climbing up barriers and
across coping tiles where she was
leading him he had not the remotest
idea she reminded him of a cream-
tinted monkey in the maddest of stee-
plechases

  the town seemed to lay to their
right before them were the scattered
lights of the harbor and the mild cres-
cent of the outer bay they could see
the white wheeling finger of some
foreign gunboat as its search-light
played back and forth in the darkness

  she sighed with weariness and
dropped cross-legged down on the co-
ping tiles against which he leaned re-
gaining his breath she squatted there
cooingly like a child exhausted with
its evening games

   im dished   she murmured as she
sat there breathing audibly through the
darkness  im dished for this coast 
he sat down beside her staring at
the search-light there seemed some-
thing reassuring something authorita-
tive and comforting in the thought of
it watching there in the darkness

  the girl touched him on the knee
and then shifted her position on jthe
coping tiles without rising to her feet

 come here she commanded
and when he was close beside her she
pointed with her thin white arm
 thats saint foalo there-you can
just make it out up high see and
those lights are the boundary gate
and this sweep of lights below here is
the praya now look where im point-
ing thats the luiz camoes lodging-
house you see the second window
with the light in it  

  yes i see it


the cavalier

   well binharts inside the win-
dow

   you know it

   i know it

   so hes there  said blake staring

at the vague square of light

   yes hes there all right hes po-
sing as a buyer for a tea house and calls
himself bradley lee fu told me and
lee fu is always right

  she stood up and pulled the mandarin
coat closer about her thin body the
coolness of the night air had already
chilled her then she squinted care-
fully about in the darkness

   what are you going to do  she
asked

   im going to get binhart was
blakes answer

  he could hear her little childlike
murmur of laughter

   youre brave white man she said
with a hand on his arm she was silent
for a moment before she added
 and i think youll get him

   of course ill get him retorted
blake buttoning his coat the fires
had been relighted on the cold hearth
of his resolution it came to him only
as an accidental afterthought that he
had met an unknown woman and had
passed through strange adventures with
her and was now about to pass out of
her life again forever

   whatll you do  he asked

  again he heard the careless little
laugh

   oh ill slip down through the
quarter and cop some clothes some-
where then ill have a sampan take
me out to the german boat itll start
for canton at daylight

  and then asked blake watch-
ing the window of the luiz camoes
lodging-house below him

   then ill work my way up to port
arthur i suppose theres a navy
man there wholl help me 

   havent you any money  blake
put the question a little uneasily

  again he felt the careless coo of
laughter

   feel  she said she caught his

huge hand between hers and pressed it
against her waist-line she rubbed his
lingers along what he accepted as a
tightly packed coin-belt he was re-
lieved to think that he would not have
to offer her money then he peered
over th coping tiles to make sure of
his means of descent

    you had better go first she said
as she leaned out and looked down at
his side  crawl down this next roof
to the end there at the corner see is
the end of the ladder

  he stooped and slipped his feet into
his shoes then he let himself cautious-
ly down to the adjoining roof steeper
even than the one on which they had
stood she bent low over the tiles so
that her face was very close to his as
he found his footing and stood there

   good-by white man she whis-
pered

   good-by  he whispered back as
he worked his way cautiously and pon-
derously along that perilous slope

  she leaned there watching him as he
gained the ladder-end he did not look
back as he lowered himself rung by
rung all thought of her in fact had
passed from his preoccupied mind he
was once more intent on his own grim
end he was debating with himself
just how he was to get in through that
lodging-house window and what his
final move would be for the round-up
of his enemy he had made use of too
many  molls  in his time to waste use-
less thought on what they might say or
do or desire when he had got bin-
hart he remembered he would have to
look about for something to eat for he
was as hungry as a wolf

  and he did not even hear the girls
second soft whisper of  good-by

  that stolid practicality which had
made blake a successful operative as-
serted itself in the matter of his ap-
proach to the luiz camoes house the
house which had been pointed out to
him as holding binhart

  he circled promptly about to the
front of that house pressed a gold coin
in the hand of the half-caste portu-
the shadow



guese servant who opened the door
and asked to be shown to the room
of the english tea merchant

  that servant had he objected would
have been promptly taken possession
of by the detective and as promptly
put in a condition where he could do
no harm for blake felt that he was
too near the end of his trail to be put
off by any mere side issue but the
coin and the curt explanation that the
merchant must be seen at once admit-
ted blake to the house-

  the servant was leading him down
the length of the half-lit hall when
blake caught him by the sleeve

   you tell my rickshaw boy to wait
quick before he gets away

  blake knew that the last door would
be the one leading to binharts room
the moment he was alone in the hall
he tiptoed to this door and pressed an
ear against is panel then with his
left hand he slowly turned the knob
caressing it with his fingers that it
might not click when the latch was

released as he had feared it was
locked

  he stood for a second or two think-
ing then with the knuckle of one
finger he tapped on the door lightly
almost timidly

  a mans voice from within cried
out wait a minute wait a min-
ute but blake who had been ex-
amining the woodwork of the door-
frame did not choose to wait a minute
any such wait he felt would involve
too much risk

  in one minute he knew a fugitive
could either be off and away or could
at least prepare himself for any one
intercepting that flight so blake took
two quick steps back and brought his
massive shoulder against the door- it
swung- back as though nothing more
than a parlor-match had held it shut
blake as he stepped into the room
dropped his right hand to his coat-
pocket

  facing him at the far side of the

room he saw binhart

a serial

synopsis of preceding chapters

for a six weeks expedition into the unexplored north woods jane boyce the
woman prospector engages ben mitchell as guide there is something unusual
about janes requiring a guide for she is a perfect woods woman herself and a fine speci-
men of physical womanhood but there her attraction ends for she is apparently
without heart utterly methodical and unhnman in her movements entirely introspec-
tive and uncommunicative she treats mitchell like a piece of baggage and his loneli-
ness drives him almost frantic janes mission into the wilds is unknown but thought
to be gold one day ben disobeys her orders by taking the obvious side of a rock in a
rapid instead of the side he was told to take as a result the canoe upsets in the white
swirl

    jane rescues ben from the rapid as a necessary commodity one day she compels
him to lie blindfolded on the bottom of the canoe while she makes a long paddle ap-
parently through a rocky gorge then he is marooned on an island while she takes the
canoe for the day returning with a bag of gold ben resists this action next day and
in a struggle jane falls and cuts her head severely ben nurses her back to conscious-
ness but is thunderstruck to find on her awakening that she is seemingly a totally dif-
ferent woman she says her name is molly hope and of jane boyce and the past five
years she knows nothing moreover this new- creature is kind and womanly and lov-
able they prepare to return to civilization but ben is overcome with the realization
that jane alone knew the way through blindfold passage

chapter xii
the search for escape

 he realization that i had
 more knowledge of
xl w i	the route than she start-

me jane boyce was
but a memory with
her had vanished the pilot i looked
at molly hope helplessly but she did
not see me her eyes seemed to be
fixed on something afar and i knew
that she was thinking of her home and
her people as i felt my own im-
potence i pitied her

 oh yes i said lightly  well
get away to-morrow without a doubt

two things put me in a mood to
linger at our camp the next day des-
pite the anxiety of molly hope to get

	this story bn in the cartliw for september 



 back to her people one was the fact
 that i wanted a chance to explore for
 the channel by which we had entered
 the lake the other was the girl her-
 self who was now so utterly unfa-
 miliar with woods travel that she need-
 ed an opportunity for a brief bit of
 training i had also thought that her
 head might prevent her from under-
 taking a journey so soon but in this
 i was mistaken for her magnificent
 health was asserting itself in fact it
 was this physique of hets that i relied
 upon to carry her through the rough
 work that was ahead of us she would
 have to learn much but her body was
 already inured to the task

   but while i hesitated to set out i
 none the less realized the need of an
 early start our provisions were ample
two women or one



provided we traveled at the same speed
that jane boyce and i had maintained
but i knew we would be unable to make
that rate of progress molly hope
was virtually a novice and further
the wound in her head would prevent
the use of a tump-line by her in crossing
portages- beside that i had a reluc-
tance to ask this woman to undertake
the severe physical labor which had
been a mere incident of the journey
to jane

  there had been a change in com-
mand i was the captain now true
i was without a course for a part of
the distance but i relied upon my
woodcraft to help me there that part
of the journey which i had made with
my eyes open did not worry me for
an instant most of it i had crudely
mapped and even in the absence of
that chart my memory would have
served me

  our reversed conditions had a salu-
tary mental effect upon me i felt that
i had recovered my self-respect janes
manner had constantly impressed upon
me a sense of inferiority that hurt my
pride the most irksome part of it
was that i realized much of it to be
true she had been my superior in
many things wholly so in a knowledge
of the new country through which we
had passed that was not pleasant to
a man who considered himself a
woodsman and a guide i had been
educated to feel a sense of responsi-
bility for the safety of my employers
with jane i had been a mere puppet
serviceable only to cook her food and
carry her burdens her service had
been a humiliation

  the new woman demurred at first
when i suggested another day at our
outpost camp she was restless to be-
gin the return i said nothing then of
the most disturbing reason for the de-
lay but i dwelt entirely upon her own
lack of preparation for the trip she
looked at the matter in a sensible way
and soon agreed with me i offered
to begin her education immediately
after we had breakfasted and i secret-

ly promised myself a chance to search
for the unknown passage

  her first night of consciousness as
molly hope she admitted to me had
inspired in her vague anxieties she
had wakened several times not be-
cause of any discomfort from her in-
jury but apparently because of a rest-
lessness born of her strange situation
the stillness of the woods had awed
her rather than frightened her and
the strangeness of her awakening after
the five lost years was constantly pres-
ent in her mind she had dreamed
too but it was as molly hope with
visions of her home and not as jane
boyce following her lone career in the
wilderness

  i had been wondering despite her
complete mental separation from the
woman prospector whether there lin-
gered in her a subconscious memory
whether the muscles developed during
the chapter she had just closed would
instinctively follow their long training
it surprised me to discover that she
possessed not the slightest notion of
things that had been second nature to
her she had the strength to do all
jane boyce had done without the least
idea how to use it

  she was even timid about entering
the canoe although she assured me she
knew how to swim the absence of a
seat surprised her and when i suggest-
ed that she kneel as jane had done
she did so doubtfully nothing aston-
ished her more as we made that first
experimental trip to discover that this
position neither cramped nor tired her
but was on the contrary quite com-
fortable

  of the uses of a paddle she had no
conception other than that gained from
watching canoeists at a summer resort
she had once visited but the paddle
is at once the most primitive and natur-
al manner for man to drive a craft it
is merely a development of the swim-
ming instinct rowing is artificial it
did not take her long to wield her blade
well although i could see that she was
beginning again at the bottom


the cavalier

   wliither to go in search for the pas-
sage i had no idea whatever when
i lay blindfold in the bottom of the
canoe l remembered clearly sensing
our return into the bright sunlight
after a period of travel through cool
dimness from the instant of emer-
ging from the passage until the canoe
had touched the shore where our camp
was made i had roughly judged the
interval to be in the neighborhood of
ten minutes

  but that was mere conjecture it
might just as easily have been twenty
for the elapse of time under the con-
dition which jane had imposed is con-
fusing to calculate in ten minutes
she could easily have driven the canoe
a mile in twenty minutes twice that
distance whether she had followed
a straight course was also beyond my
knowledge she might have doubled
back and forth among the islands in
order to destroy my sense of direction
to a certainty the passage might be
within a quarter-mile of us for there
was mainland as near as that or it
might be eight times that distance
while i had no serious doubt of my
ability to locate it nevertheless the
waste of time that it might involve
gave me some uneasiness

  there were numerous islands in this
lake though neither so many as in the
adjoining one nor so uniform in their
character i first made a circuit of
our own scanning closely those por-
tions of the surrounding hills that were
in view and finally i struck for the
west shore as being the most likely
for our purpose tt was half a mile
across and showed patches of bare
cliff that looked promising from the
distance on the other side of the
lake the hills were sloping and verdant
it was exhilarating to be at the paddle
again particularly after my experience
in being marooned two days before

   it pleased me also to note that while
miss hope found the manipulation of
her paddle a strange proceeding she
enjoyed the novelty constantly she
would ask me if she were doing it cor-

rectly and i found a readiness in her
to follow suggestions that was encour-
aging the motion of the canoe ceased
to disturb her after a while and she
learned to know that the canvas craft
could rise and dip and even roll to a
considerable angle with perfect safety
balance in a canoe becomes instinctive
with practise and i saw signs that she
would not be long in acquiring it but
there was no hint of memory in this
good progress she made the work was
coming easily to her simply because
she had the physique ready-made to
undertake it

   by and by when you get used to
a canoe i said  ill show you how
to use the stern paddle and steer

   you think  can learn that 

  i know it as a matter of fact
although you do not know it you are
one of the best steersmen i ever saw
in a canoe

  she rested her paddle across the
gunwales and looked back at me

    isnt it strange she said musing-
ly  that all this should seem utterly
new to me it isnt difficult exactly
its just new

   are you tired  i asked

    not a bit that is so puzzling too
 its not astonishing though i an-
swered  jane was absolutely tire-
less

    is that what you called me-jane  
 you ordered me to call you that
i explained  it was shorter than miss
boyce miss hope

  the conjunction of the two names
made unconsciously sounded rather
strangely and she noticed it

   it must be very curious to you
she said  to know a person by two
names each given to you in good faith
but i would like you to forget the other
one if you will and call me molly if
it is good to have short names in the
woods

  it is convenient i answered i
was glad to call her molly because
t here was something pleasant about the
name but as forgetting either jane
boyce or her name i knew full well
two women or one



that to the end of my life there had
been stamped upon my mind a memory
that even though unpleasant would
never fade

  and what did i call you she
asked suddenly

   mitchell i answered with a
laugh  without prefix or handle or
decoration-plain mitchell but if its
just the same to you id prefer to be
called ben while im working at this
job then after we get back to civili-
zation you can give me all the conven-
tional titles that an american citizen
has a right to enjoy

   very well she assented with a
nod and she was picking up her paddle
again when i interrupted her

   by the way jane was paying me
two seventy-five a day does that
hold

  she looked at me with a puzzled air
but saw a whimsical look in my eyes
and smiled

   youve no idea she said  how
odd it is to be told of things that youve
done and dont remember have i
paid you anything yet 

   no but of course it isnt cus-
tomary to pay a guide until the trip is
over theres no place to spend the
money anyhow

   of course ill pay you that is if
i have any money i havent the least
idea about that

   better be careful i warned her
laughingly  about assuming your for-
mer financial obligations you dont
know what they may be but the two
seventy-five was a bona-fide bargain
 it seems little i shall owe you
more than that she answered gravely

  both of us i think had forgotten
about the bag of gold all ideas of
janes mine had been swept from my
mind by anxiety to locate our home-
ward route and from hers by her own
longing to get news of her people

  we were close under the cliffs of the
west shore now and i let the canoe run
along to the southward for nearly a
mile scanning the rocks closely the
contour of this shore-line was almost

straight with no coves or bays
stunted and half-starved evergreens
clung tenaciously to its steep sides
wherever the rock was not wholly bare
but nowhere was there the slightest
suggestion of a passage through nor
even a cavelike aperture to hold out
encouragement i swung the canoe
around when we had gone as far as i
judged would equal the greatest dis-
tance that jane could possibly have
covered and started back over the same
course still studying the rocks care-
fully

  after a while i noticed that molly
had ceased paddling and was half-
faced about watching me

   are you looking for something
she asked

   dont you know  i had not in-
tended to explain my own motive in
this morning paddle of ours for i had
no wish to add to her worries but it
seemed useless now to attempt any
evasion

   im afraid i dont she said help-
lessly  is it something i did-while
i was jane 

   partly i nodded  do you re-
member my telling you how you had
blindfolded me and brought me into
this lake  

   yes i do recall you said some-
thing about that she answered  but
i didnt pay much attention to it then
has it any significance 

  simply this im looking for the
way you brought us in

   you mean you dont know where
it is   she exclaimed in a startled tone

   not yet i said reassuringly
 but dont worry about that well
find it sure its somewhere not over
twenty minutes paddle from our camp
perhaps only ten

   it seems incredible she mur-
mured with a little shudder  tell
me about it

  then i gave her the details as well
as i could of that strange trip through
a strange place of which i had been
denied even a glimpse i did not blame
her for regarding me incredulously


the cavalier

   bat how could you let me do it 
she cried

   you ordered me i replied

   but it must have been maddening
 should have thought you would have
torn the bandage from your eyes

   i was tempted to i said truth-
fully  but i had promised

  little she knew about the ways of
jane boyce and i felt it would be no
kindness to explain but i saw that
the incident had started a line of
thought in her mind nevertheless and
she was pondering over it as she re-
sumed her paddle

  for two miles more we skirted the
shore going northward now but still
there was the same unbroken line of
cliff this brought us to the north end
of the lake and we followed that the
ruggedness of this shore was more
thickly covered with verdure and there
was a dip in the hills that suggested
another basin beyond

  there were low wooded points
separating from each other a series of
bays and into each of these we went
scanning every yard of the distance
narrowly there was not a break in
the boundary-line of solid land not
even a little brook coming down from
the hillsides i was disappointed and
somewhat worried the west shore
and the north had from their outward
aspect given the most promise of con-
taining the mysterious passage and
both were within the distance that jane
boyce might have covered from the
time we emerged into the daylight

  molly noticed the baffled expression
in my face for she said rather sadly
 i wish i could remember i wish i
could help you

   i dont i answered bluntly
but why the statement hail
surprised her

   because then youd be jane boyce
she regarded me silently for a mo-
ment and nodded her head slowly

   i think i understand she said
 i-i was awful wasnt i 

   oh no i declared hastily  i
didnt mean that

   yes but you did mean it i can
see it every time you have spoken of
me-when i was jane-i have felt it
you hated m

   nonsense   exclaimed but 
knew that she was unconvinced

   what sort of a creature was 
she asked persistently

   why-you were just businesslike
i said evasively

   no no shaking her head  there
was something more than that wont
you please tell me  

   some time id rather not now

   now please 

  well she was bound to have it and
i told her i made it as brief as possi-
ble and i softened it as much as i
could yet i knew that she read more
than my words expressed some of
the episodes in which jane and i had
been concerned i omitted entirely but
w ith all the delicacy i could command
i gave her an outline of the sort of
woman she had been her head was
bowed during most of the recital and
when at the close she lifted it i saw
that her eyes were tilled with tears

   im sorry i said  but you
would have it

   oh  she cried with a sob  to
think of it to think that  was like
that to think that there is something
in me like-that woman

   but there is not i told her
 thats where youre wrong absolute-
ly there is nothing in you like jane
you are utterly different there is no
resemblance whatever

   but deep in me somewhere theres
something like it she persisted miser-
ably  there must be else how
could it have come out

   there is nothing like it i de-
clared  jane was one woman you
another the only thing you have in
common is a body her mind was not
yours neither was her nature and
she is utterly gone

   yet you hated me i know that

   i didnt like you i admitted

   you loathed me

   oh no be fair to yourself-or to
two women or one



her and remember that while i
didnt like you i nevertheless admired
you and in some ways i was jealous
of you

   still i was a hated thing-and it
makes me ashamed she said stub-
bornly  i know you can never for-
get it but can you forgive me  

   theres nothing to forgive molly
all that belonged to jane and jane is
another person and i even forgave
her w hen she fell and struck her head
and became nothing but a helpless
woman

   and died she supplemented in a
whisper

   yes-died i echoed  let us
think of her that way

   will you  she cried with pathetic
eagerness

   we will never speak of jane as
you i said  we will speak of her

   and you wont blame me for what
she did

  i never blamed even jane she
couldnt help it she knew nothing
else and you havent yet done any-
thing for which i can blame you i
told her

  she considered that for a while and
seemed to be satisfied

   thank you ben she said as she
turned and dipped her paddle but i
know that what jane had been troubled
her for a long time for she spoke sel-
dom from that time until we returned
to camp and seemed to be in a deep
study

  now we were rounding along the
west shore that which had looked least
promising from our island and as we
followed it for a long distance it held
out no encouragement whatever it
was filled with indentations and
though we kept close to the rocky edge
all the way there was no sign of an
outlet

  at last we reached a point beyond
which it would have been impossible
for jane to have covered the distance
to camp within the time i allowed her
filled with the wonder of the thing
i reluctantly headed the canoe back to-

ward our island it was nearing noon
and it would not help matters to go
without lunch

  molly joined in the work of pre-
paring the meal and was not so much
of a culinary novice as she had modest-
ly declared herself to be but her ways
were those of the kitchen and not of
the woods and the primitive awkward-
ness of our appliances bothered her for
a while

  we talked but little as we ate and
my thoughts dwelt entirely upon the
curious situation in which we were
placed i had explored the three shores
wherein the passage must surely lie
allowing more than a sufficient radius
to cover the time occupied by jane after
we had emerged from the channel yet
without result

  it would be useless to go farther
south how far the lake stretched in
that direction i did not know nor did
it matter i had covered every bit of
shore that was within possibility of
consideration the only thing to do
was to go over the ground again if
i knew in which direction the other
lake lay my work would be narrowed
down but i had not the slightest no-
tion of it yet this speculation over
its compass direction put an idea into
my head

   im going over to that west shore
again i told molly  to climb that
hill from there i ought to be able to
locate the lake we are trying to find
and once i get it spotted it ought to
be easy to find the way into it even if
we have to carry overland will you
stay in camp or do you want to come  

   i want to come she answered
quickly  i dont want to be left
alone

  this feeling of hers was impressed
upon me in the days that followed she
was not afraid of the wilderness but
she did not like to be left alone with
it again she was the antithesis of
jane boyce

  after some search along the west
shore i found a likely looking place
for an ascent of the cliffs where the


the cavalier

hardy and courageous little evergreens
that grew in the crevices of the rocks

could be made of assisiance i drew
the canoe out at the foot oi the steep
climb and we started- upward for
molly insisted on accompanying me
even here

  it was not particularly dangerous
work but it was nothing but sheer
toil we scrambled over rough ledges
swung ourselves along with the aid of
the strongly rooted trees and crawled
up steep inclines where the hands as
well as the feet had to be employed
always working upward i estimated
that the top must be six or seven hun-
dred feet above the surface of the lake

  we were both hot breathless and
weary when we reached the summit
she stood the journey fully as well as
 however and with every fresh
demonstration of her strength and
hardiness i gave thanks that in the long
journey that lay ahead of us i had for
a companion one who was not a phys-
ical if perhaps a mental tenderfoot
i began to think alter all we might be
able to travel as rapidly as i had jour-
neyed with jane boyce

  there was a fine sweep of rolling
wooded country to be seen from the
eminence on which we stood-but 
lake east north and west i studied
the view we were high enough to
overlook the hills on the opposite side
of our own lake which lay glimmering
below us in the afternoon sun but
there was no water visible beyond the
lake we had left behind i knew was
a considerable body and its distance
from us was not great this made my
failure to get even a glimpse of it all
the more astonishing

  i went over the landscape again and
again with no better result there
were hollows among the hills but no
water that was visible to the north
where the ridge that girded our lake
was lower than at any other point it
was certain there was no water for
many miles the cliff on which we
stood was bare of trees at the top and
we could see far to the westward across

a rocky jagged and waterless expanse
the lake below us which contained our
island and our camp was like a beau-
tiful living map but  had no eyes for
it molly seemed to find something
attractive in it but  was looking for
the other water

   well  said at length  shall we
go down  

  have you found the way she
asked

   to be frank i havent i an-
swered  but we sha nt worry about
that ill find it

  her eyes looked troubled and i
think her mother was in her mind
again

   come i said  it will be nearly
supper-time when we get back to

camp

  she followed me as i began the de-
scent pausing just for an instant at
the edge of the steep rocks

  u oh i hate jane  she cried  i
hate her 

chapter xiii

the road home

mollys silence on the way back
to our island gave me time to
think about our unusual situation and
this speculation now began to breed
anxiety it was impossible of course
that i should not be able to locate our
route ultimately and if our supply of
provisions had not made time a highly
important factor i think the mystery
of the thing would have entertained
me for a few days

  but i was puzzled and uneasy over
the failure to find a solution of the
problem after the magnificent view of
the surrounding country which the
heights of the west shore afforded
there was something unnatural about
it something of the dark wizardry of
jane herself

  while i had not much hope that the
hills of the east shore would offer even
so favorable an opportunity to study
the landscape as those of the west i
two women or one



nevertheless determined to try them
the first thing in the morning i would
even climb the low land to the north
although i was ccrtain there was noth-
ing there

  then if things came to their worst
aspect there was still the alternative
of striking a new course of our own
back to the deep-water i knew the
direction in which it lay and i felt
certain that we would at some point
intersect the old route but i was like-
wise fully aware of the toil and delay
which such a last resort would involve
with subsequent developments that
might actually prove serious

  although i said nothing of my
alarms to the girl i am sure she di-
vined a hint of them from my
gloomy and perplexed face for while
we were preparing supper she made
an obvious effort to talk of other
things as much probably for the pur-
pose of taking her own mind off her
thoughts of home as to divert mine

   i am a little bit puzzled about
you she told me  you are a guide
you say and yet somehow you dont
seem anything like the idea i had
formed of guides

  how i asked-
 well you seem to be-educated
 oh i know some fairly well edu-
cated guides i laughed  bona-fide
guides too theyre a bit rough per-
haps but youd be surprised at some
of the things they know 

   still she said  somehow i dont
think you always did this or always in-
tend to do it

   because of this  i asked putting
my finger on a little fraternity pin that
wras fastened to my leather belt

   partly she nodded

   well to tell the truth this isnt my
ultimate career i suppose its more
of a whim or an indulgence just at
present the fact is im lazy also
im not uncomfortably inflicted with
ambition and manage to keep fairly
happy by following my fancies 

   tell me she said

  so i gave her some idea of my life

thinking as i did so how odd it was
that not until now had she asked me
a single question about myself it
might easily have been one of her first
anxieties to learn what sort of a
person she had been cast into asso-
ciation with in this wilderness but
her mind until now had been crowd-
ed to overflowing with wonderment at
her own past and yearning for the
home from which she had stolen forth
in the thick mists of her former mental
state

   arent you foolish she remarked
- to waste your good years when there
is real wrork that you have been trained
to do

   perhaps i answered  that is
if i am wasting the good years what
are a mans good years anyhow
they may not necessarily be his young
years

   oh but they are  she exclaimed
 you cannot understand as i do but
oh wrhat if you had lost five of those
years-utterly lost them beyond recall
without even a memory of them 

   that i suppose makes a differ-
ence

  a difference i never knew the
value of years until i found i had lost
them- and the young years too for
two days ive been trying to live them
over again in my mind but its use-
less theyre gone oh believe me
it is the young years that count i
never knew then but i know now
ive been cheated-robbed and it
seems all so useless and cruel

   but youre still very young i as-
sured her for i could see there was
real grief in her voice

   twenty-six 

   and thats not bad id like to
be twenty-six again myself but im
not losing sleep over it

   because you have the memory of
all that has passed she answered
 but think of having no memory 

   try to look at it another way i
suggested  had you never been
jane boyce you wrould have lived your
five years as you lived all the others


the cavalier

in all probability you would still be
the delicate girl you say you were then
but jane underwent all the hardship
for you took all the toil and struggle
on her own shoulders and now she
has gone leaving you health and
strength and a constitution that will
carry you far beyond the five poor
years that she claimed to make a real
woman of you

     suppose  ought to think of that
she said slowly her eyes involuntarily
scanning her own person and again
showing the wonder that she seemed
to find in it  but it seems hard to
have lost them just the same

   they were probably not all pleas-
ant ones either i added

   i want to talk about something
else she said with a little shudder

   then lets go fishing did you
ever fish molly

   never  she exclaimed rising to
her feet  id love to try

  i did not tell her of janes unsports-
manlike prowess with the rod because
just then we were trying to forget
jane there was still an hour of day-
light so i made the canoe ready got
the tackle out seated molly in the bow
facing me and began paddling slowly
around our island never shall i
forget her when that first bass rose
to the troll in an instant she was
aroused from pensiveness to anima-
tion her eyes sparkling and her
cheeks flushing with the excitement

   what shall i do with it  she
cried as the fish leaped clear of the
water fifty feet astern and dived back
with that splash which puts a thrill in
the heart of the true fisherman

   give him time careful  i ex-
claimed as she showed the haste of
every novice to get his first fish into
the boat in the shortest possible space
of time the bass gave us a fine fight
and he brought it to an abrupt close
by winning it for in one of his splen-
did thrashes he managed to cast loose
the hook

  the dismay and disappointment in
mollys face were pretty to watch

  how stupid of me she cried

frowning

   rather how wise of the bass i
said laughing  thats the fine thing
about those fellows they keep you
guessing  wouldnt give a cent to
fish if  landed every one i hooked
try again

  it was some fifteen minutes before
we had another strike and then it was
a big brawny fellow who took the bait
with a hungry rush molly was get-
ting into the spirit of the game and
her face was alight with sheer joy as
the battle fared on this time the
victory went to her but her rapid
breathing and little exclamations of
astonishment and apprehension were a
tribute to the valiant foe i landed
him with the net and lifted him drip-
ping and struggling into the canoe
w hile she clapped her hands in delight-
and then a moment later she turned
away her head while i mercifully put
an end to him with my knife i
learned then as i did frequently after-
ward that she hated to see things suffer
and die

  but to me in those first few days
the most wonderful thing about molly
hope was that she talked that
sounds like a small matter to wonder
about yet after two and a halt w-eeks
of almost utter silence it not only
came as a surprise but as a heaven-
sent blessing i could hardly realize
at first that the transformation had
been accomplished my own tongue
seemed to have been loosened from
captivity and the sound of my words
flowing now without restraint was
strange to me it was as if an ob-
session that i was never to be privi-
leged to talk to a human being again
had been suddenly lifted and my lib-
erty bew ildered me

  molly did not know and could not
have understood how strange her own
conversation sounded to my ears she
had leen to me the grim incarnation of
silence for so many days that her voice
came almost as a shock she never
understood the ordeal through which
two women or one



i had passed with jane just as she
could not understand the sudden boon
which her transformation into a wom-
an who could talk had conferred upon
me-

  conversation became a new kind of
dissipation with me i fairly chattered
at her i fear yet  am not naturally
garrulous it was merely the reflex
following long restraint

  we took another fish and as dark-
ness was approaching i headed back
toward the camp the breeze of the
day had fallen away to nothing and the
lake was glassy so that the somber
outlines of the islands and hills were
cut as shaqly on its surface as the im-
age on a photographic negative molly
leaned back against the thwart watch-
ing the panorama half dreamily

   the islands are so pretty by day
and so solemn and mysterious by
night she said as we drifted close to
our own

   its curious how there is some-
thing about an island that attracts us
as nothing on the mainland can i
commented

  u theyre beautiful here she nod-
ded  but down the lake they seem to
be even more beautiful

   in which direction  i asked idly
  she pointed toward the south

   while you were looking over the
hills this afternoon after we had
climbed to the top she explained  i
was watching the lake there are so
many more islands down belowt that
we cannot see from here and they
seem so strange

   how-strange 

   why there are so many of them
and they are all of a size and so regu-
larly placed they look just like the
dots on a piece of goods

  i stopped paddling and stared at her
 and theyre so beautifully green
and fresh looking she added  not
rocky or harsh like these

  you saw islands-like that - in
this lake  t asked slowly

  why yes is it unusual she
asked noticing my amazement

   	c

  you are sure it was in this lake
you didnt see another lake 

   no i am certain of it there was
water all the way to them oh it was
this lake beyond a doubt 

   no strip of land in between i
asked eagerly

  she shook her head positively the
wild hope that her first description had
raised in me began to lade again the
islands in the strange lake where jane
had blindfolded me she had described
to a nicety but she was sure that they
were in this lake

  the thing was impossible i had
been taken through a narrow dark
passageway i knew for a certainty-
from one water into another when
my eyes had been unbound they had
looked upon a scene utterly changed in
every detail and characteristic one
lake was as different from another as
black from white and yet-

  what molly had told me puzzled me
beyond measure she could not have
imagined the islands of that other lake
neither could she have seen their du-
plicate in this for i would have gam-
bled that nowhere else in the north
woods did their like exist they were
unique in the regularity of their ar-
rangement and the uniformity of their
size and contour yet it was evident
the girl had seen something to which
i had not given a glance i had paid
not the slightest attention to our own
sheet of water and its reaches to the
southward my eyes had been roving
eastward northward westward look-
ing for the lake that seemed to have
vanished

  now i wras vexed with myself that i
had thus limited my scrutiny from the
hilltop not that it was possible the
islands she described were really in our
own lake for where then was the cool
dark and narrow passage but it was
barely possible that she had actually
looked upon the water for which i was
searching and that the barrier which
lay between it and us had escaped her
notice

  over and over again i questioned


the cavalier

her on this point but she was uniform-
ly positive she had not made a mis-
take everything she had seen lay
within our own lake her certainty

discouraged me at first i thought
she had chanced upon a discovery of
the utmost importance now it seemed
that she had merely sighted a group of
islands which if not really like those
through which jane had piloted me at
least had some strong points of resem-
blance

   do you think i saw anything that

will help us  she asked

   i cant tell i answered musing
 its all very strange what you say
about the islands raises my hopes to
the highest notch but when you tell
me they are in our own lake my hopes
fall to the bottom again

   im sorry she said  but they
really are in this lake it was careless
of me not to call your attention to
them but i thought of course you had
noticed them

   at any rate i declared  ive got
to have a look at them if they are
really what im hoping for i may be
able to discover the barrier in be-
tween

   you wont find it she replied
rather sadly i wish you could but
you wont i am very positive that it
was just as i have told you

  nevertheless i cherished a secret
hope that molly was wrong in some of
her details i prayed that she was
wrong about her identification of the
lake yet right in her discovery of the
islands it was impossible to reconcile
both

  there was nothing to be done before
morning anyhow and this irked me
for i felt that perhaps time that was
valuable had slipped away from us
as soon as daylight came again i was
going over to the west shore and up
the cliff again for i had a wild desire
to solve the riddle of the islands

  the new camp-fire companionship
which had come with the disappear-
ance of jane boyce fulfilled such a
craving that i fear i kept molly out of

her tent that evening long after she
was sleepy and ready for rest we
talked much about ourselves and about
her family not often did we speak
of the strange creature she had been
at night it seemed to make her shudder
to think of jane

  we watched the stars grow more
numerous in the darkening sky chart-
ing themselves in the still water at our
feet we saw the moon rising slowly
through the tree-tops on the eastern
hills until it swung high and white and
brilliant over the lake and off in the
distance came the deep dusky notes of
a moose calling to his mate the sound
startled her and led us into a new
avenue of thought that kept us out of
our blankets until nearly midnight

   will you take me up the cliff again
in the morning  she asked as she rose
to go to her tent

   if youre awake at daylight i
promised  but im going to make
an early start

  the lake was half veiled in the morn-
ing mist when i crawled out of my tent
and felt a damp cool southerly breeze
on my cheeks molly had not arisen
and i thought it useless to awaken her
merely to take her on another toilsome
climb i slid the canoe quietly into
the water and set off for the west shore
with long swift strokes my mind ac-
tive and eager with speculation over
the islands of -which she had toldme
the night before

  so anxious was i to hurry up the
steep ascent that i came near losing
my life when about half-way to the
top an insecure stone turned under
my foot and but for a stout little tree
that was within the grasp of one hand
i should certainly have ricocheted
down the precipitous rocks clear to
the bottom i gave a gasp of fright a
i swung myself to safety i had no
desire to lose my own life more than
that i had a sudden vision of a girl
left helpless in a wilderness it re-
quired no effort after that for me to
put a curb upon my impatience and i
made the rest of the ascent cautiously
two women or one



  the morning sun and breeze had
banished much of the mist as  reached
the top of the cliff and i turned toward
the south where the lake stretched off
to its greatest length and there i saw
the islands of which molly had spoken

  they were the islands of jane boyce

  i would have known them anywhere
as far as i could have distinguished the
outlines of land and water with the
same singular almost unnatural regu-
larity they lay there in the rising mists

  slowly i studied them resolutely
forcing back an impulse to shout i
wanted to be utterly sure  wanted
my reason as well as my instinct to tell
me that  was looking upon the lost and
sought for place but there was no
mistake about it they were there
beautiful green and quiet in the early
sunlight as mysterious as the day i
had first seen them

  and they were in this lake

  the expanse of water was unbroken
save by scattered islands that lay be-
tween me and the tiny archipelago be-
rond molly was right again where
then was the narrow passage through
which jane had driven the canoe
there was not the slightest sign of it
no visible spot in the landscape that
could possibly contain it i began to
wonder if i had fallen- asleep as i lay
blindfolded that day and dreamed an
experience that was a mere fiction of
the brain but no i was sure of the
passage sure of my own wakefulness

  for some time i stood there trying
to reconcile the situation in my mind
the effort was futile once more be-
fore i descended i carefully surveyed
the islands making a map of them in
my brain to reach them was so easy
that it seemed almost untrue and be-
yond them lay the trail home

  with feverish strokes i drove the
canoe back to our camp after a cau-
tious descent of the cliff i cared noth-
ing about the discovery of the passage
now it was non-essential the road
was open at last i could take molly
home

  she was standing close to the water

as i swung into the little cove at the
foot of our camp

   you went without me she said
reproachfully  i was afraid when i
found i was alone

   you neednt be afraid any more 

i shouted as  leaped out of the canoe
   you mean that-

  those are the islands i cried
 you found them they are in this
lake 

   and the passage 

   hang the passage it s disap-
peared but we dont need it now
molly youve found the road 

   the road-

   the road home 

  her eyes filled with tears and there
was an eager tremulous smile on her
lips

   i shall see my mother again she
murmured  oh ben  

  she gave me her hands for an in-
stant then shook her head as if to
throw aside the weakness of tears and
turned quickly toward the camp

   lets hurry she said

chapter xiv

the islands of jane

uch was her anxiety to begin the
long journey back to the deep-
water that without protest i allowed
molly to perform what i would have
considered to be janes share of the
camp work but not hers it was she
who got the breakfast while i busied
myself rolling our blankets into packs
taking down the tents and hunting
around for the articles that invariably
get to lying loose even in the most
methodical camp it was not a bad
breakfast either i have eaten both bet-
ter and worse in the woods of my own
cooking she worked without the fa-
cility or the speed of jane and i could
see that things came unhandy to her
yet it saved me a lot of time that she
should even be able to do that much

  i was no less impatient to start than
she we were now out three weeks


the cavalier

from our starting-point and we were
provisioned for only six it was not
to be expected that molly would travel
as rapidly as jane i was allowing a
difference of at least four days which
meant we would be exceedingly short
if not actually out of grub by the time
we reached the deep-water another
reason for my impatience was a desire
to solve the mystery of the dark cool
passage which despite the surprising
discoveries of the early morning i was
not yet willing to concede was merely a
thing of the imagination

  molly washed up the dishes and put
the tins and cooking utensils into their
bag while  loaded the canoe with the
heavier duffel after that i collected
the litter that had resulted from three
or four days of camping and burned it
this was a useless procedure off in
that lonely wild i admit yet it grew
out of habit no man who has con-
sideration either for nature or for the
camper who may follow him will leave
behind him a trashy camp i hate to
walk into one and i dont want any-
body to be inflicted with one of my own
making and then when we were
ready to set out i poured a few pail-
fuls of wrater over the smoking ashes
in our fireplace which is the last and
never-to-be-neglected ceremony in any
camp and joined molly in the canoe

  it was her first voyage when we were
fully laden and for a time she was
plainly nervous over the fact that our
gunwale was several inches nearer to
the water than when she made her trial
trips in the canoe but when she
grasped the fact that we had greater
stability even if less freeboard and
speed her timidity subsided and she
began to give an eye to things about
her

  here of course she was utterly dif-
ferent from jane boyce who saw noth-
ing but the road ahead and who cared
nothing for some beauty that might
be almost at her elbow mollys inter-
est in the things that bordered our path
was one factor that cost us time it
was all a wonderland to her she was

like a little child wandering through a
dream - garden added was the fact
that she could not ply a paddle as had
jane this was the thing that attracted
my notice more strongly she crouched
on her knees as did jane and-in fig-
ure at least-she was the same splen-
did athlete but she neither possessed
the unconscious skill nor the dogged
perseverance of the woman who had
disappeared her paddle would falter
as her eyes wandered to some new vista
abeam and sometimes it would cease
altogether i made no attempt to urge
her to steady effort but merely in-
creased my own exertions to overcome
the difference

   i lay our course southward in the di-
rection of the magic islands those
among which we were passing now
were typical of the ordinary lake in
the north country and it was still al-
most impossible to believe they lay
within the same sheet of water that
contained the curious little archipelago
at which i had marveled several days
before in fact although with my own
eyes i had seen it from the hilltop i
was still reluctant to admit the absence
of a hidden channel through which we
must pass i had a vague sensation
that after all we might be pursuing a
mere mirage

  our route i kept near the middle of
the lake and in a few minutes we
cleared the island group that lay at the
north end two miles or more beyond
us was now visible the green allurement
of the islands of jane between them
and our canoe lay a solitary island
which we would pass close on the left
hand if we held our course it was ap-
parently small when i first sighted it
somewhat rugged and not well favored
with shrubbery or trees but as we drew
nearer i perceived that it lay pointed
toward us like a needle and possessed
considerable length we were giving
it a berth of a couple of hundred yards
as we reached a point abreast of it
when some idle curiosity impelled me
to swing the canoe almost at a right
angle and head toward it
two women or one

  molly stopped paddling and watched
the nearing rocks

   are we to stop here  she asked

   no indeed i answered  we re
only beginning the days work but i
just wanted to have a look at the place

  we were now within a few yards of
the northern point and i started to
swing the canoe along the western
shore when she asked 

   can we go down the other side in-
stead of this 

   yes if you wish to why 

   the sun feels so comfortable on
my shoulders she replied  and were
getting into the shadow here

   right i said turning the canoe
and clearing the point so that we could
follow the eastern shore as we were
crossing to the other side her paddle
paused again

   what a queer looking place she
commented

  what i asked busy with the
task of keeping us moving onward

  she pointed with her paddle toward
the end of the island and i looked
there was a narrow cove between the
two points that jutted into the lake and
its furthermost recess apparently be-
came lost in a cavelike aperture that re-
treated into the face of the high rocks
mechanically i stopped the canoe to
study the place

    it looks just like a cave she said

  for answer i swung the canoe into
the cove and approached the dark open-
ing slowly as we drew nearly oppo-
site to it it became evident that it was
not a cave but rather- a crevice for the
rocks were open at the top although
they hung closer to each other than at
the waters edge again i stopped the
canoe avhen we were within a few
yards of the opening a premonition
that speedily developed into a convic-
tion seized me

  molly looked around with a little
shiver

    it looks spooky she said

    it looks like an explanation i an-
swered sending the canoe forward
again

  of what 

   of the passage

  molly was wide-eyed as she turned
from me and again examined the rag-
ged gray rocks

   you mean-

   that i believe jane played a trick
on me i finished for her  its ex-
traordinary but it wont take long to
find out whether im right about it

  the canoe had reached the jaws of
the cleft and as i looked upward i
could see a strip of sky stretching in
front of us like a bright blue ribbon
the passage as far as  could pene-
trate the gloom with my eyes seemed
to be straight although its rocky walls
were irregular in contour the chan-
nel was perhaps a dozen feet wide at its
greatest breadth narrowing gradually
as it receded from us

  here was the explanation of the
mystery of the passage i had not been
wrong after all but who would have
dreamed of such a channel through an
island never before had i seen such
a curious phenomenon in the north
country the island itself i remem-
bered having viewed from the summit
of the west cliff but from that distance
there was nothing that suggested the
existence of a passageway even had i
thought of looking for it there the
grain of the rock ran almost perpen-
dicularly as if the original deposit had
been upended by some convulsion so
purely local in its character as not to
affect the surrounding islands which
revealed no characteristics of this kind

  the island was apparently split from
end to end through its greatest length
as though a monster wedge had been
used to make the clearage to what
depth it was split i had no way of judg-
ing nor ain- apparatus for sounding the
channel that the rocks had not di-
vided in an absolutely straight line wras
obvious else there would have been a
vista of open water at the farther end
some scant shrubbery overhung the
top of the cleft

  i urged the canoe slowly forward
for a length or two into the passage


the cavalier

and then paused again to puzzle over

this geologic oddity it was very cool
and still between those walls of solid
stone which ran to a height of perhaps
thirty feet from the waters edge at
the entrance and were evidently still
higher toward the center of the island

  but it was not the island itself at
which i marveled most it was at the
cunning of jane nothing could have
more completely deceived me into the
belief that i had been taken from one
lake into another than the method she
employed she knew of course better
than  the utterly different characteris-
tics presented by the north and south
ends of the lake and this dark cleft in
an island that lay midway furnished
her the means of bewildering me once
at our camp she had planned to leave
me a prisoner each day so i would have
no opportunity to solve the riddle

  i had no doubt whatever that jane
intended to take me back under the
same conditions so that i would never
have known or suspected the ruse to
which she had resorted even now i
believe she intentionally neglected to
place a gag in my mouth so i would
speak aloud and confirm in my own
mind the impression that i was being
conducted through a dark narrow pas-
sage her remark when we reached
camp that she should have gagged me
was merely another step in the decep-
tion

  constantly since the transformation
i had been watching molly for some
sign of memory even though it might
be subconscious of the days when she
had been the woman prospector little
incidents of the days routine the do-
ing of things which were a second na-
ture to jane i thought might arouse in
her a recollection but i had watched
in vain

  now i was observing her closely
again for it seemed that if anything
would awaken memory it would be
some grim fantastic thing like this cleft
in the island it was always with a cer-
tain apprehension that i looked for such
manifestations so too i always felt a

sense of satisfaction at each confirma-
tion of the fact that jane was wholly
gone from her i wanted molly to for-
get  wanted no more of the strange
creature who had made such an un-
canny impression upon me that she had
almost succeeded in changing me from
a normal being into one as abnormal as
herself which i believe she verily would
have done had she not so suddenly van-
ished

  molly turned to me with a shudder
as we lay motionless just inside the en-
trance

    must we go this way  she whis-
pered even the whisper sounded hol-
low and there was a faint echo that
startled her

   im curious to see the thing
through i answered  unless you
really object well go ahead

   suppose she said with a glance
upward at the strip of sky  the rocks
should close in on us

   i believe theres no fear of it but
if it alarms you well back out and go
around the island

   no never mind she said  only
dont lets talk while were in here it
sounds so unearthly

  she placed her paddle in the canoe
drew her sweater over her shoulders
and crouched down in her place while
i began the trip through blindfold pas-
sage as we afterward named it there
was something awe inspiring about this
waterway through the cleft and al-
though i felt it to be quite without dan-
ger i shared something of her feelings

  as we penetrated nearer to the heart
of the island the channel turned slight-
ly to the left and became narrower
while a glance upward showed me that
the height of the walls had nearly
doubled for a few minutes each day
there was probably a little sunlight in
here but the orb was not yet high
enough to afford that as we slowly went
forward there was a sort of half-
light in the place that seemed to throw
no shadows

  i remembered that at one point on
the voyage with jane the canoe had
two women or one



scraped slightly and i was watching
for this evidently very narrow spot
the explanation of the incident came
in a moment we turned again to the
right and i beheld a few feet ahead of
us an immense boulder which seemed
at first glance to completely block the
passage it was a rock that had fallen
from above wedging itself between the
cliffs before it touched the water as i
examined the obstruction i perceived
that at one side there was about three
feet of head room with even less than
that of width between boulder and cliff
molly crouched lower as i gently urged
the canoe forward and i myself had
to stoop in order to clear the overhang-
ing rock it was not a pleasant experi-
ence while we were underneath this
great stone i could not help wondering
what would happen if the cliffs should
open but a few inches more instead of
closing as molly had seemed to fear

  there was only about twenty feet of
this overhung passage a chill dark
place where there was no room to han-
dle a paddle and where i kept the ca-
noe moving by placing my hands
against the damp rocks and pushing us
forward once or twice we scraped
just as we had done when jane was the
pilot and i the blindfolded passenger
i think molly breathed a sigh of relief
as -sve got out from under the boulder
i know that i did

  another slight turn in the channel
and the farther end was visible the
walls began to spread away from each
other and in the roomier space i picked
up my paddle again and drove us for-
ward quickly to tell the truth i want-
ed to get out of the place some fool-
ish apprehension even caused me to
glance over my shoulder as if i ex-
pected to see the passage closing after
us like the dark and fearsome paths
we sometimes tread in nightmares al-
ways with the leaden feet which cannot
carry us away from a danger that
threatens a moment more and we
emerged into the sunlight beyond an
unbroken stretch of calm shining wa-
ter lay the islands of jaue boyce

  molly threw off her sweater and
stretched her arms wide as il to throw
off some burden

   did i-did jane actually take you
through that place   she asked with an
involuntary shudder as she turned to
look back at the entranee

   jane did i nodded  but i dont
hanker after it much

   it frightens me just to think of it 
she exclaimed  but it frightens me
more to think of her

   there are your islands- i said
pointing  they look pleasanter
shall we go on  

  for answer she took her paddle and
buried the blade with a deep strong
stroke there was more than half an
hour of traveling before we reached
the nearest of the islands and i head-
ed directly for the center of the group
had i possessed an- serious doubt of
my ability to follow a fairly straight
course among them i should have skirt-
ed either the west or the east shore
which would inevitably bring us to the
stream through which jane and i had
entered the lake but i felt certain
from the conformation of the hills that
i could see beyond that the inlet was
almost due south of us and that the
islands lay directly in our path

  as we swept into the first of the nar-
row channels that separated one from
another molly paused in her paddling
again and uttered an exclamation of
delight

   its like something in a fairv-
story she said  we have left the
ogre and his den behind us

  truly those islands are one of the
pleasant places of earth the sun was
getting hot now and we ran close to
shady shores where the trees sheltered
us from its ravs the green gentleness
of these curiously regular bits oi land
invited us to linger aud almost caused
moll- and i to falter in our resolution
to push the return journey swiftly but
i shook off the spell and kept the prow
steadily southward as nearly as the
winding channels would permit

  as we finally emerged from the last


the cavalier

placid channel molly looked back with
a sigh of regret at the scene we were
leaving behind us i put the canoe
about and headed for the nearest island

   were at least justified in stopping
for lunch i said

   thank you for that she an-
swered  i hate to see them go-and
yet i want to get home too

  while we ate a hasty meal we began
the business of naming things in this
virgin country very likely the indi-
ans had named these places centuries
before it may even have been that jane
boyce had christened them anew
though if she did she kept her nomen-
clature to herself but by right of re-
discovery molly and i made free to
disregard all names that may have been
given in the days past

  she demurred when i insisted that
the curious water we were about to
quit should be called molly lake but
she was willing that the place where our
camp had been should be named wa-
king island it was there she had
awakened from the long years when her
mind slumbered and when jane had
been in possession of her body as i
have already told we called the nar-
row cleft through which we had come
blindfold passage the island itself we
christened the barrier this was in
memory of the idea which jane had in-
stilled in my mind by her subtle strat-
egy the green islands  associated
so vividly with jane that she finally let
me have my way i told her that the
woman prospector at least should pos-
sess the privilege of having her name
buried with her in the wilderness

  so we called them the islands of
jane incongruous it was perhaps tor
in all things they were different from
jane yet they were what we hoped
jane might become in whatever strange
place to which her disembodied spirit
may have journeyed the cliff wre had
scaled became discovery hill in honor
of its service in pointing the road

  from the island where we halted i
could see the mouth of the little river
down which jane and i had come on

our last days journey together the
current was sluggish and i knew that
we could follow the stream for many
miles even against it before the hard
toil of portaging would come as we
entered its channel-mitchell river it
is on my own crude map so christened
by molly-both of us turned by a com-
mon impulse to take a last look at the
lake and the islands of jane

  to molly this was the setting of one
of the strangest scenes of her life and
 think despite her longing to return
to her people she had a vague feeling
of regret as we left it behind i know
that i did the lake with all the cu-
rious things it contained had cast a
spell of fascination upon me i felt
that i was leaving buried there a being
who had played a brief but extraor-
dinary part in my own life where her
strange spirit would sleep forever
somewhere among the stalwart hills
the gentle islands the still shining wa-
ters and the waving pines

  good-by jane i called softly
as we swung around a bend in the river
and the lake was shut from our sight

  molly turned and looked at me then
bowed her head for an instant and
passed her hand across her forehead

   good-by jane she murmured as
she resumed her paddle

  i did not care to urge the girl too
far on her first day of travel and we
camped before sundown on the river-
bank a few miles below a rapid where
i feared we would have to portage the
following forenoon she was eager to
do her share of the camp work and
i showed her how to pitch her tent and
gather balsam-boughs for a bed pur-
posely i had avoided a camping spot
where jane and i had remained for a
night as i did not wish to halt in an
environment which would awaken
memories in me or a period of brood-
ing in molly

  we sat talking for a while after
supper was over and from my rough
chart i showed her the course we would
follow on the way to the deep-water
i gave her some idea of the hardships
two women or one



of the journey too for i did not wish
her to think that it would be all so
speedy and pleasant as the first day

  she was not dismayed by the pros-
pect but on the contrary anxious to
come to grips with the real work the
bulk of it of course i intended should
fall upon my own shoulders for she
was not only unfamiliar with it but
the wound over her temple was not yet
sufficiently healed to permit of her
placing the head-strap of a tumpline
across it part of the time we talked
about her home and herself and i told
her stories about mining and some of
the frontier places where  had been

  not once did we talk of janes bag
of gold it lay in my tent tossed into
a corner where it would be out of the
way it seemed to hold no interest for
either of us

       chapter xv
       on the back trail

 amp-fire talks were giving me a
glimpse into the mind of molly
hope into the mind of jane neither
 nor any other person i believe had
ever looked it was a dungeon barred
against intrusion or egress but into
mollys mind the sunlight shone the
doors and windows were thrown wide
and there was no dark or hidden thing
there that feared the eye or shrank
from the voice

  sadness dwelt there now and wist-
fulness but they did not shun the vis-
itor they were merely wayfarers
abiding until the message from home
bid them to resume heir journey they
breathed an air of sweetness that
robbed their presence of unwelcome or
gloom they represented the home
ties that had not been severed but
merely tangled during the lost yeirs

  there was optimism in molly that
was deep-rooted and inherent for even
now it triumphed over her fears she
began to look forward to the meeting
with her people confidently she pic-
tured her mother her father and her

brother waiting for her as she had
lived she expected to find them alive
i encouraged her in this simply for her
own sake there was no way of reason-
ing to a conclusion for it was purely
a matter of faith

  i found the girl to be a mixture of
grave and gay sometimes there were
quick flashes of humor in her that as-
tonished me when i remembered the
burden of anxiety she was bearing
often she would look at me swiftly
after one of these revelations her face
again serious and her mind apparently
wondering if i judged her to be heart-
less because of a sudden flood of
merriment i think that i never misun-
derstood her it was but human na-
ture that sometimes there should be a
breaking of the clouds always i
laughed with her for my own nature
is buoyant and it had long been in
bondage under the black magic of jane

  from things she told me from her
speech and from the whole trend of
her thoughts i found molly to possess
a breadth of view and a sympathy so
utterly unlike the woman who had dis-
appeared that for a time it seemed im-
possible to realize the fact her par-
ents had given her the opportunities
for education rather than educated
her she had followed the bent of an
independent and receptive mind she
was ever willing to learn even the sim-
plest things the life into which she
had awakened was all new and a virgin
field for her study at every turn she
found wonders in it that fascinated her
eager brain she brought a freshness
of vision to bear upon things which
had become commonplace to me and
that i envied her it was like walking
through a new childhood for molly

  often we wondered together whether
the missing years would ever be recon-
structed  but jane in her secrecy had
left scarcely a clue the first year we
puzzled over most it must have been
the period of preparation for her new
life but it had not been spent in the
deep-water country where then 
evidently somewhere on the frontier


the cavalier

of mans conquest of the land but
where she had come to the deep-
water not a tenderfoot but a woman
already half broken to the life

   our attempts to make a history lor
her were o i ten fantastic always with-
out basis we were as unhampered w ith
the consideration oi facts as the teller
of a fairy story or the painter of an
ideal picture but in the camp hours
the plotting out of a past fur jane
boyce frequently occupied us her
winters away from the deep-water
were a series of mysteries molly
liked to think that she had gone back
to the states perhaps hovering some-
where near the beloved family she
even speculated as to whether jane had
ever seen her mother as she wandered
along her solitary path my own be-
lief was that jane probably did not go
beyond the borders of the nearest cana-
dian city i pictured her as a creature
unwilling to stray farther from the
place of her ambitions than necessity
decreed yet here i realized my rea-
soning to be faulty for jane had she
chosen could as easily have spent her
winters in the deep-water country as
in the more luxurious surroundings ot
a town

   the thing that battled us beyond all
attempts at progress however was the
trend of janes mind time and again
i questioned molly to learn if even in
fleeting moments she ever had impulses
which in any manner suggested the
career the woman prospector had
carved for herself she could recall
none she had neither experience ol
the woods nor an interest in them she
had no thirst for riches and she need-
ed none her family  learned while
not wealthy according to the modern
standards coukl give her every luxury
and pleasure that a gently bred and
normal-minded girl craves

   there seemed to be absolutely noth-
 ing in her life to serve as a basis for
 the narrow but highly concentrated am-
 bitions of jane most dreams have
 their suggestion in some thought that
 lias come into the waking mind janes

life was a dream that had  origin in
the mind of molly had jane in be-
coming another woman chosen some
pursuit within the experience or knowl-
edge of her past the thing would not
have been so amazing even though she
had remembered nothing of the years
gone before but to turn abruptly into
a path of which molly had never so
much as thought was as inexplicable to
us as the amazing effect of the two
accidents to her head

   i have said that molly viewed the
physical changes which had been
wrought in her with astonishment but
she also discovered a delight in them
she could not conceal i know that she
longed for a large mirror for i sur-
prised her one day studying an image
of herself in a glassy pool of water
near our camp she was leaning for-
ward turning from side to side to get
new glimpses of the strong but charm-
ing figure that was her heritage from
jane she turned quickly when she
became aware of my scrutiny with a
laugh and a blush

    im just a woman after all she
said  i want to look at myself

    by no means an idle occupation
i observed studying her in admiration

   the remark was perfectly harmless
but somehow i was sorry after i made
it i did not want molly to think i was
addicted to cheap flattery nor to in-
flict on her the embarrassment of it
for i was satisfied she had no love of
it but if she fell i had struck a false
note she turned the conversation easily
and without apparent notice

    tliese clothes still astonish me
she said frankly  i think im losing
inv sel f-causcioiisness and really
theyre awfully comfortable but
wk-u i happen to catch a glimpse of
them it brings me up with a sort of
start and i wonder if im really awake
oh how i shall love to have a dress
again what sort of dresses did jane
have  

   i was obliged to confess an igno-
rance of janes wardrobe beyond her
possession of a heavy corduroy skirt
two women or one



which i had seen her wear at the moose
island post

   dreadful  she exclaimed  do
you think i shall be able to find any-
thing to wear-before i reach a city 

   they keep a very gaudy stock
of calicoes at the post i answered
smiling

  calico she said with a little
shudder  ill have to have a travel -
ing-suit dont laugh at me ben you
know i cant go home this way

 why not i asked i went
from the deep-water to buffalo once
in a rig like this with no hat and not
even a coat and walked into the swell-
est hotel i could find at the end of the
journey

   but youre a man and men can do
things like that im a woman

  howr different she was from jane
boyce jane i verily believe would
have gone to a kings coronation in her
flannel shirt and breeches and thought
nothing of it had the notion entered
her head but molly was purely femi-
nine with all the instinct of adornment
it pleased me to see her that way i
had had my fill of woman freaks

  another day i caught her singing
the notes were deep and rich and
rounded unspoiled by the training that
teaches technique above all other
things she finished the verse and
looked up at me from her seat by the
fireplace

   do i sing well  she asked

   you sing very well i answered
with a nod

   is my voice good 

   its one of the purest and most
natural i ever heard i replied truth-
fully

   its so queer she said after a
pause  i didnt ask because i wanted
you to praise it i really wanted to
know before the accident happened
-before jane came-i used to sing
but it was with a very small sort of a
voice that had no power or volume and
really not any sweetness in it i sang
correctly enough i imagine but it was
just a commonplace parlor voice with-

out any individuality but now when
 sing some of the old songs i cannot
help realizing that my voice is utterly
new its bigger for one thing and i
can use it so easily that it astonishes
me the noise of it almost frightened
me at first it seemed as if somebody
else were singing

   youre just beginning to appre-
ciate how much jane did for you i
told her

   i suppose so she answered
thoughtfully  how strange-to in-
herit a new voice did jane sing 

   jane had no music in her i said
shaking my head  she merely had
the voice she never sang

   poor thing  exclaimed molly im-
pulsively  i am beginning to be
sorry for jane

  when we came to the first of the
portages  the trail back to the height
of land my opinion that our progress
would be slower than upon the outward
journey was confirmed nearly all of
the heavy carrying fell upon me molly
was willing but she was hampered
with her head from which i had not
yet removed the stitches and she was
also unfamiliar with the work

  neither did she possess the stoicism
of jane who i doubted not was often
muscle-weary yet who never gave a
sign that the heavy labor annoyed her
our mental attitude toward difficult
physical tasks goes a long way toward
making them a plague or a pleasure
while i think jane never found pleas-
ure in them she was at least quite in-
different to them mollys attitude
was unlike she did not shirk but the
toil was of the mind as well as of the
body

  i rigged up some light packs for
her that she could carry with shoulder-
straps and with these on her back she
would trudge over the portages while
i sweated under the heavy loads the
overland transportation of the canoe
astonished her she told me that until
she saw how the trick was done by
balancing it on my shoulders she had
wondered how in the world she would


the cavalier-

ever be able to carry one end oi it over
a rough trail on one short portage
she begged me to let her try it  and
inasmuch as it brought no strain upon
her head i consented but i followed
her closely and somewhat anxiously 
have seen a competent guide through
stumbling over a rough trail damage
a stout canoe seriously and i had no
desire that any such mishap should be-
fall our only craft she made the
journey in safety but it was only on
the comparatively smooth paths that 
ever trusted her to handle the canoe i
think she felt that i regarded her as
less a woodsman than jane although i
never would admit it when she ques-
tioned me

  the day we reached the rapid from
which jane had dragged me uncon-
scious made a deep impression upon
her jt was a long weary portage
around this stretch of swift white wa-
ter and opposite the black rock where
the canoe had come to grief we halted
for lunch i had told her something of
the story before but not until she
viewed that angry rapid had she been
able to visualize the scene with vivid-
ness now she made me go over it in
infinite detail and several times during
the recital she shook her head as if it
were impossible to believe

   but where were you exactly when
i-when jane dragged you out she
asked as she stood at the edge of the
hurrying stream

   somewhere down there i an-
swered pointing  i was unconscious
 knew nothing until she had me
ashore

   but how deep is it 

   i dont know perhaps a couple of
feet jane never told me

   its inconceivable she murmured
i dont see how anybody could stand
for an instant in that water

   well i wouldnt care to try it i
admitted  but you must remember
that jane was an exception she seemed
to defy all laws

   never could do it exclaimed
molly with an involuntary shiver

    perhaps you could if you thought

 you were losing an essential piece of
 baggage i said

   is that the way jane regarded you

 -as baggage 

    sometimes as baggage sometimes
 as a pack-mule never in any other
 way i think

   molly pondered over that for a few
 seconds and then gave me one of her
 frank glances

   nevertheless i believe you ad-
 mired tane she said

   why

    because so many things you tell
 of her compel admiration you could
 not have been insensible of it

    well  did admire her i admit-
 ted  she was a better man tlian i
 in many ways

   i watched her as she mused over the
 admirable qualities of jane and tlien
 burst out laughing at her

    nevertheless  said paraphrasing
 her remark  i believe ybu are jealous
 of janes prowess

    thats true she said seriously
 with a slight color in her cheeks  i
 am she must have been very wonder-
 ful

   she was indeed molly-wonder-
 ful

    was she attractive

    no absolutely no

  and you hated her didnt you

    oh i wouldnt put it that way i
 began  you see jane-

    but you did hate her

    i didnt like her of course she
 was tmlikable she-

    you hated her persisted molly ii
  didnt you ben  

    oh all right i said with a shrug

  i suppose i did

    say it

    yes-i hated her

   molly gave a quick nod of her head
 in recognition of the statement she had
 been bound to force from me

  good she said i-ito glad
you hated her

   and why should you be glad of
 that   i exclaimed astonished
two women or one	

   t dont know responded molly
with prompt feminine logic  i just
am she ought to have been hated

    poor jane  i commented

    pitied and hated added molly as
she turned back to where our duffel lay
and began gathering up her burdens
for the resumption of our journey

   it was not hard to realize that i was
dealing with a woman now not with a
traveling machine it seemed that
molly had her whims well i was
glad of it she was very human more
than that she was what jane never had
been nor never could have been-she
was very charming i used to think
that clothes went a long way toward
making a woman now i knew better
jane booted and trousered like a lum-
berman was repellant molly in the
same rough garb was attractive but
jane had no soul while molly had it
was a difference more than physical i
have been cured of my illusions about
clothes

  i had been wondering how long our
fair weather would last and the follow-
ing day put a prompt and unpleasant
end to my speculations a drenching
storm came out of the east to add to
the difficulties of the steady climb
which now confronted us for two
days it poured almost without cessa-
tion and the nights were chill and
cheerless i dared not linger on the
trail although i pitied molly every
time i saw her toiling onward in her
soaking clothing we wrere too short
of provisions to warrant a halt until
the return of fair weather there was
nothing to do but drive onward through
the wet when it seemed as if clear
skies were coming again a new storm
piled in upon the heels of the other
our water-proof tents kept dry inside
and we managed to keep dry blankets
but it was rarely that either of us had
a dry thing to wear

  there were no comfortable camp-
fires at night we crawled miserably
into our tents after each evening meal
and lay there listening to the rain spat-
tering noisily on the taut balloon silk

breakfasts were damp and without
cheer and then would come the task of
breaking camp in the downpour and
taking up the days struggle

  molly bore it without a word of com-
plaint for she knew the necessity of
making quick progress but  could see
that her spirit was affected by the hard-
ship the rain bothered her worried
her to prevent her from acquiring
too unfavorable an idea of a wet wil-
derness i would tell her that rain was
not so bad provided you did not have
to move camp and travel and that i
had often been quite comfortable in
similar storms she would smile and
assure me that it was all right and that
she really did not mind it but i knew
better for her own sake i could have
wished for her a few days of the stony
indifference of jane

  we were close to the top of the big
ridge when our week of bad weather
finally came to an end and as i look
back upon that period of travel i am
convinced that it was the worst i ever
knew molly was wan and haggard
but always straightening herself brave-
ly whenever i looked at her and evi-
dently fearful that i would notice the
signs of strain in her face and in the
droop of her shoulders

  i thought this was sheer weariness
of body and spirit at first but when the
skies cleared and the woods dried and
molly still seemed under the same spell
of languor i began to realize that some-
thing else was the matter she had
taken a cold some days back and de-
veloped a cough which she had been
unable to shake off it seemed that
with all her physique she had lost some-
thing of the resistance of jane she had
become more sensitive to her environ-
ment i gave her some medicine for
the cough but it did not seem to take
hold or to give her much relief even
now however she never uttered a syl-
lable of protest against our rigorous
routine of travel but less and less was
she able to do her share of the work

  one night her coughing in the ad-
joining tent awakened me and i called


the cavauer

to her to learn if there was anything i
coiil  do for her but she assured me

that it was of no consequence although
for an hour after that i could hear her
trying to control the paroxysms

  it was about noon of the following
day that the climax came molly had
scarcely touched a mouthful of break-
fast and had been faltering at her pad-
dle all forenoon finally i saw her
place her hand to her side and gasp
without a word i put ashore at the
nearest favorable spot and helped her
out of the canoe

    you re ill molly i said

   i dont think its anything she
answered smiling weakly at me

  her face was flushed and i placed
my hand  her forehead which 
found to be burning

   is there a pain in your side where
you put your hand   i asked

  she nodded and compressed her lips
and then another fit of coughing racked
her

  i got the blankets out of the canoe
quickly made a temporary couch for
her and began pitching a hasty camp
my heart was heavy and anxious the
symptoms of the girl left me no room
for doubt

  molly had pneumonia

chapter xvi
the love cure

qnce i had nursed a fellow camper
through an attack of pneumonia
a few years before and i had seen it
in mining camps where there was no
physician to be had i had seen men re-
cover from it and some die but never
had i been entrusted with the sole re-
sponsibility for a sufferer who was
hopelessly cut off from medical aid
and who would have to make the fight
with no other reliance than the weapons
of nature there was not even a com-
fort or a luxury i could offer molly we
were a hundred miles from the nearest
outpost of civilization her life was
in the hands of her creator

   the first thing i did was to fix a
place for her  wanted her to have
air all the air she could breathe the
weather seemed to have settled fair
and there was  need to shut her with-
in the walls of a tent so i took her
tent and mine and made a isort of
canopy of them with the four sides
open to the winds and then  laid a
deep pile of balsam boughs under it so
she could rest as easily as the rough
jacilities of the woods would permit

   alter i had this rude open-air hos-
pital ready for her i carried her to it
wrapped her well in the blankets and
hastened to see what i could do with
rough and ready remedies i did not
put much faith in what medicine i car-
ried in my kit although there was a
stimulant there in case it should become
necessary she had the customary chill
while i was preparing her bed and it
aas quickly followed by a heightening
of the fever

   as soon as i had settled her as com-
fortably as the conditions would per-
mit i started a fire mixed a batch of
dough got out the frying-pan and be-
gan making a quantity of soggy flap-
jacks i had picked up the trick from
a guide who was a sort of backwoods
doctor and had utilized it once with
success in the absence of other appli-
ances the hot cakes are applied to the
patients side over the spot where the
pain thrusts like a knife also i
heated flat stones in the fireplace i had
hastily constructed wrapped them in
our sweaters and made them do service
as water-bottles

  i tried not to show any anxiety in
the presence of molly who thanked me
with her eyes more than with her lips
for everything  sought to do for her
but in my heart i was frightened

  she was very ill her struggle to
keep up the pace at which i had been
driving her during the past few days
had plainly weakened her she was not
at her best to combat a disease that at-
tacks swiftly and mercilessly

  after a few hours she whispered to
me that the pain was less but her short
two women or one



dry cough was shaking her in pitiless
fashion and the fever was mounting
the little clinical thermometer i car-
ried had been broken the day of our
upset in the rapid and i had no means
of measuring her temperature al-
though this did not matter much now
for the mere record of the mercury
would not have enabled me to do any-
thing more for her her pulse had be-
come swift and tumultuous and the
lungs were fighting for air

  in intervals of attendance upon her
i set the camp to some sort of rights for
i realized that we were in for nothing
short of a weeks siege and perhaps
more unless she made a quick conva-
lescence it seemed like selfishness to
waste time in getting meals for myself
but i knew the absolute need of keep-
ing my own strength up in this crisis
and could not neglect this irksome
part of the camp routine

  molly knew fully as well as i how
seriously she was stricken but her cour-
age was splendid

   pneumonia   she asked faintly
as i bent over her to change the hot
stones that seemed to be giving her
some relief from the pain

   perhaps i answered  but
dont worry its nothing bad

   i shant worry she whispered
her dark eyes were bright with the
fever and whenever i was near her
they followed every movement i made
i prayed that the weather would stay
fine i did not care how cold the nights
became but i wanted no more rain
while we were in our present plight

  now indeed was the time for the
magnificent constitution of jane boyce
to do its work there was so little i
could do that most of the time i simply
sat by mollys side and watched the
battle occasionally she dozed off into
restless sleep but the cough gae her
little surcease from consciousness
night came the air began to cool and
the breeze was stilled i lighted a can-
dle placed it where the light would
fall so that i could watch her face and
settled myself for a long vigil

  our situation was not one calculated
to inspire either hope or confidence no
travelers would come through this
lonely track in the wild and there was
absolutely no method by which i could
summon help for her a hundred
miles away were doctors aplenty it is
a saying around the deep-water that
every third man you meet in the
woods is a physician but they were
as remote from us as if they had been
beyond the great seas it was out of
the question to move the girl had
the remainder of our journey been
along an uninterrupted watercourse i
might have considered the attempt i
could have made her comfortable in
the bottom of the canoe and she would
have been little the worse for traveling
but with portages to cross and rapids
to shoot the thing was impossible the
fight must be made where we were
with no help unless it should come al-
most as a miracle

  one of her hot dry hands found its
way from underneath the blankets and
i took it and held it when the fits of
coughing seized her her fingers clung
convulsively to mine she seldom
spoke to me but often her great dark
eyes watched me it seemed as though
she were quieter and more content
when her hand was lying in mine so i
sat there never leaving her save when
she whispered for a drink of water or
when i found it necessary to renew the
hot applications

  it is curious how sympathy discov-
ers in us emotions of which we may
have been totally ignorant my mind
was filled with anxiety and pity for
molly at first to the exclusion of every-
thing else now i began to think of
what molly meant to me it was diffi-
cult to analyze this sentiment for a
woman i hated but a few short days
ago jane boyce never awakened any-
thing but hot resentment or cold brood-
ing in me molly hope stirred my na-
ture in a different way

  as i sat watching her came a reali-
zation that somehow molly unknown
to myself had become a part of all my


the cavalier

thoughts and plans she had taken a
place in my life as naturally and quietly
as if the arrangement had been or-
dained long before everything i did
nr contemplated took into considera-
tion the relation of molly to it her
existence had become a part of mine
before  was aware of it

  i wanted her to live there was an
element of selfishness in the desire of
w hich  was fully aware  wanted
molly to live not merely for her own
sake or for that of her people who
doubtless had lung believed her dead
but i wanted her to live for my sake
too it seemed as though i had some
right in her i had been the means of
bringing her back into the flesh she
had no right to depart from me the
responsibility for her restoration had
bred in me the notion that i was also
responsible for her life thereafter

  all this vague desultory thinking
carried me through the first hours of
the night as i huddled at her bedside
shivering now and then from the sharp
chill of the air but not daring to take
from her so much as the single thick-
ness of a blanket to throw over my
shoulders

  to the next point in my discoveries
of unsuspected desires i was carried
swiftly by a simple incident she indi-
cated that she was thirsty again and i
brought her a cup of water raising her
by passing my arm under her shoulders
so that she might drink she swal-
lowed a little and then her head fell
wearily back against my breast her
eyes looked up at me slowly her lips
smiled faintly and she murmured
something in which i caught my name
but did not understand her burning
hand groped for mine and held it as i
placed her back among the blankets

  and then just as plainly and calmly
as though i had known it for days i
realized that i loved molly hope it
was the explanation of all the rest
and as she lay there fighting for
breath i seemed stabbed with the same
pain that had stricken her her suffer-
ing was now my suffering her peril

was mine also whether molly loved
me was a matter to which i gave not
the slightest thought it was quite be-
side the question then it was enough
to know that i loved her it accounted
for the desire to possess for all the pity
and anxiety and fear

  sometimes i dozed from sheer weari-
ness although i tried to fight off sleep

my eyes were closed and my head bent
upon my breast when the first touch of
sunlight awakened me i bent quickly
over and saw that molly slept not
peacefully and normally but apparent-
ly in utter exhaustion our hands were
still clasped and i disengaged mine
gently so as not to awaken her

  it was with difficulty that i arose
and moved my cramped limbs to start
the blood and then a baffling sense of
impotence and helplessness came over
me as i looked down upon the sweet
feverish face of the woman who had
taught me first to hate aud then to love
her i could only watch and wait and
pray

  all that day and the night that fol-
lowed molly fought her fight bravely
never flinching when the pain racked
her never complaining when the fever
burned fiercely it was with a sinking
heart that i watched the disease make
inroads upon her strength and as she
became weaker there were periods
when her mind wandered and she
talked without knowing what she said

  i would kneel close to her bending
my ear to catch the words and some-
times it wrung my heart when she
looked up at me with eyes that gave no
sign of recognition a newr fear seized
me and tortured me what if mollys
mind should go upon another long
strange journey perhaps never to re-
turn what if jane should steal back
into her body the body might live
but it would mean nothing to me with-
out molly rather it would be a
mockery

  hour by hour i listened to her mut- 
tered phrases she was talking of her
mother and her home  she was speak-
ing to her brother frank she was
where thieves break in



writing a letter to her father jane had
not come she laughed and chatted
with some girl whose name i could not
learn they were going to a theater
they were going to drive they were
talking about dresses still jane had
not come then she was a little girl
again going to school and i breathed
a sigh of comfort for jane was very
remote now

  and then in broken sentences she
began to talk about the woods and my
heart almost stopped beating as i bent
to catch the words she was learning
to use a paddle she was toiling over a
rough trail she was climbing the steep
face of discovery hill then she
spoke of the green islands and finally
she was talking about our camp in
molly lake i longed to take her by
the shoulders and awaken her but i
dared not some horrible fascination
held me as i knelt there and heard her
step by step going backward to the

turning point in her life as remorse-
lessly as though she were being drawn
toward it by an unseen force w ould
she pass again into the dark personality
of jane when she reached the meeting
of the ways i listened in an agony of
suspense i felt myself face to face
with a mystery of some other world

  she called my name and began talk-
ing to me first about the fish she had
caught and then about little trifles that
i had forgotten

   what a queer place it frightens
me must we go through there ben 

-	she was in blindfold passage now
and i shuddered

   i dont like it its cold and damp
and there is no sun must we go
through then hurry

  i gritted my teeth and cursed myself
for having taken her into the horrible
place

  and-i-i- oh ben shes
coming its jane

where thieves break in

a short story

by scammon lockwood

    arsons as usual was
   m	spending his sunday eve-

   i  nns	lloyds rather

                poor little flat

                 at the tea-table a dis-
cussion had arisen this had been the
question supposing a man had a
chance to steal a million dollars but
knew that he would be caught within
thirty-six hours where could he hide
the money so that he w-ould be abso-
lutely sure of finding it after he had
served his prison sentence of say ten
years

   	c

  at first they had approached the
problem in a joking way as a matter
too simple to be taken seriously then
they had seen that it wasnt so simple as
it looked banks and safety - deposit
vaults were of course out of the
question

  a man would surely be traced to
such places in fact a hiding-place in
any sort of a building was out of the
question for what building is fire-
proof so finally they came to the
unanimous agreement that the money
would have to be buried somewhere


the cavalier

  but they couldnt agree that there
was a place within a hunderd miles of
new york where a million dollars
could be buried with the absolute cer-
tainty that that particular spot would
remain undisturbed for ten years
railroads agriculture canals new
towns all seemed to suggest possibili-
ties for upheavals on the face of nature

  true they were remote chances but
all agreed that a man serving ten years
in jail doesnt want to take any chances
whatsoever of not getting his pay when
he comes out

  they carried the idle discussion
from the tea-table to the cramped liv-
ing-room and finally dropped it out of
the window or into the waste-basket
without any definite conclusions as
people do with most purposeless argu-
ments

  presently marjorie lloyd rose

  well she said to-morrows
blue monday morning and ill have to
be up to get harrys breakfast youll
excuse me mr parsons wont you 

   of course said parsons rising

  he never forgot any of the small
amenities in marjorie lloyds presence
even the fact that she had to rise at
six-thirty in the morning to prepare
breakfast for a small - salaried bank-
clerk did not detract from her charm
for him

   ill be running along myself in a
moment he added

   dont keep harry up too late you
know hes not exactly robust i guess
indoor works bad for him good
night she went into her room and
closed the door

  parsons addressed himself to lloyd

   harry ive been waiting for the
missis to vamose because ive got
something mighty important to say to
you

   another get - rich - quick scheme
 suppose said lloyd

   yes another one

   i never knew you to talk of any-
thing else after ten oclock on a sunday
evening i think the close prospect of
monday morning brings it on

  parsons rose and began speaking at
first quietly his voice gradually gaining
intensity and earnestness

   yes the prospect of a thousand
monday mornings brings it on and a
thousand tuesdays and a-thousand
wednesdays and a thousand thurs-
days and a thousand fridays and a
thousand saturdays when youre sup-
posed to get off at twelve but always
have to stay for some reason or an-
other

   in the next twenty years there are
just about a thousand weeks when
theyre over youll be fifty and ill be
fifty-three and well be just as poor as
we are now and to make our case
worse well have every particle of sand
pounded out of us well be all worked
out and good for nothing

   ill never last twenty years at this
work said lloyd  the doctor told
me i must get out of it

   yes thats another pleasant fea-
ture continued parsons  and have
you ever figured out how much well
earn by all that toil even supposing we
do last just forty thousand dollars
apiece less than old grassard makes in
one flier on wall street with other
peoples money the president of our
bank gambles with his depositors ma-
zuma and makes more in a day than
we can earn in twenty years thats
a strong incentive to honesty isnt it 
parsons paused and planted himself
squarely in front of the other man to
make sure of his attention

   harry would you take this kind
of a chance-three chances of getting
rich against one chance of going to jail
for seven or eight or perhaps ten
years with the absolute certainty that
even if you do go to jail youll be rich
when you come out 

   how rich   said lloyd more
curious than with the faintest idea of
making himself liable to a prison term
 half a million said parsons
lloyd laughed  when it comes to
resisting temptations ive got st an-
thony lashed to the lamp-post

   you mean that you wouldnt do a
where thieves break in



dishonest thing no matter what there
was in it asked parsons

    id try not to

   of course you wouldnt take
bread from orphans or pennies from
widows though some of our most hon-
ored citizens and church members do
so continued parsons  but would
you object to taking a million or so
from people who would never feel its
loss  

    yes i think i would

   why

    because its wrong

  there exclaimed parsons i
was hoping youd say that why is it
wrong 

   rats  said lloyd  you know
 i know what youre thinking you
think its wrong because that is what
you were taught when you were a kid
well if i show you that your teachers
were all liars perhaps you wont be so
sure that they taught the truth when
we were kids we were told that hon-
esty w-as the best policy well now
that weve grown up we see that was
a lie it isnt the best policy its just
hobsons choice for the pikers but
for the man who can be dishonest and
get away with it honesty is just plain
foolishness at school we were told
that if we wxre virtuous we would be
happy now we see plainly that that
also was a lie the world is just plumb
full of honest and virtuous people who
are poor and unhappy and crooks and
moral lepers who are rich and having-
one grand time of it well the answer
is that everythings going to be squared
in the hereafter but what do we know
about a hereafter they told us two
lies when we were kids why isnt
this hereafter business another one
i tell you harry you can say what
you like about morality or honesty or
whatever you want to call it but im
pretty near ready for anything 

  lloyd sat silent a moment he was
seeking an answer to parsonss sophis-
try but he could find none he knew
in his heart that parsons was wrong
but he didnt know how to make him

see it then his curiosity came to the

top

   whats the scheme  he asked
well just steal the money thats
all

   its easy enough to steal it any
amount the wrav they run things at the
bank said lloyd  but were sure
to be caught theres no three-to-one
chance about that

  well make the three-to-one
chance replied parsons  there are
times when we could walk away with
a million dollars arent there 

   yes but we couldnt walk far
well we wont need to we will
take half a million first and speculate
with it we could cover that up for a
few days its an even chance that we
win or lose if we win all right we
put the original money back and keep
our winnings if we lose we take all
we can put our hands on then we
toss up to see which one of us takes
the blame and goes to jail thats an-
other even chance see each one of
us has two even chances of escaping
that makes a three-to-one chance
doesnt it 

   yes i guess so said lloyd  but
howll the man who goes to jail be sure
of his share when he comes out 

   easy answered parsons  the
man who goes to jail takes the money
and hides it until his term is over

   oh i see  said lloyd

   then continued parsons  when
his seven or eight or ten years are up
he comes out and we divide the money
and each one has a million is it worth
while

   how would you speculate with the
first half million you take

  id buy consolidated wire theres
a corner in it if the corner holds
well double our money in a week if
it breaks well be wiped out its an
even chance

  half a millions a lot to speculate
with itll attract notice

   divided among twenty brokers it
wouldnt  especially with a corner be-
ing run theyd think some insider


the cavalier

was putting up the cash because he
wanted to conceal his identity

  thats true said lloyd well
when would we draw lots to see whod
be the goat 

   when the money is in the hands
of the brokers then it would be too
late for the fellow who lost to back
out

   we wouldnt trust each other any
would we smiled lkyd

   not ten cents worth said par-
sons grimly

   youve certainly got it all figured
out havent you 

   ive been figuring on it for a long
time

  lloyd pondered a moment

   ha  he finally laughed  when
you stop to think of it it does seem
foolish the way big banks leave mil-
lions lying around loose for almost any
of the higher employees to walk off
with

   harry will you come in on this
with me  said parsons suddenly

  lloyd looked astonished almost
thunderstruck he felt like a boy who
has been talking about being a pirate
suddenly confronted with the oppor-
tunity

   go on youre kidding he said as
a sort of a parry to gain time

   no im not kidding answered
parsons emphatically  im in dead
earnest and i want you to feel the same
way remember its only one chance
in three of having to go to jail and
absolute certainty of riches whether
you go or not

   but its crooked said lloyd

  oh hell harry returned par-
sons  drop that sunday-school stuff
 suppose it is crooked but it isnt so
crooked as selling fake mining stock to
poor people is it 

  lloyd stroked his chin and in so
doing made the sign by which the weak
the irresolute the vase ilia ting man is at
once known to his stronger more pur-
poseful brother

  the gesture encouraged parsons
more than an expression of determina-

tion would have done it encourage 
him as a clever prize-fighter is encour-
aged when he sees his opponent gasp-
ing for wind he rose came over to
lloyd and put his hand upon his shoul-
der with almost a fatherly manner

   listen old man he said  all
you need is a little nerve it requires
nerve a gamblers nerve to take even
a three-to-one chance like this im
going to make it easy for you well
call the deal closed and agreed to until
you say its off if you dont call it
off by eleven oclock to-morrow 
take the coin and put it on consolidated
w ire among twenty brokers for our
first chance remember its only a
three-to-one chance youre taking re-
member youre not really injuring any
one remember that even if you lose
ten years in jail with riches at the end
is better than ten years in that jail of
a bank with nothing but the poorhouse
to look forward to

  he rose got his hat and went to the
door lloyd did not move he sat
with his head buried in his hands

   it stands that way then said
parsons if you dont call it off by
eleven to-morrow it goes good
night

  he quickly opened the door went
out and closed it gently after him as
if he was afraid that even a slamming
door would disturb lloyds resolution

  nearly two hours later lloyd rose
and went wearily to his room like a
man on whose shoulders some fearful
load has just been piled he slept
hardly at all that night

  parsons went to his own room
smoked a cigar undressed clambered
into bed and slept the calm and peace-
ful sleep of the just

  the colonial national bank was one
of new yorks newer financial institu-
tions its creation had been sudden
and its rise a bit spectacular its pres-
ident j r grassard was known for a
plunger who always won and hence he
was supposed to have some under-
ground connections with the countrys
masters of capital
where thieves break in



  on this particular monday morning-
the bank was only seven years old yet
it had deposits aggregating more than
half a billion dollars

  lloyd was the f  to j  paying-
teller and parsons had the cage next
to him and paid to depositors whose
names began with the letters from
 k  to  o both had access to the
vaults though neither knew the com-
bination any money taken would
have to be taken during business hours
but parsons had his plans carefully
worked out 

  he knew of packages of high - de-
nomination treasury notes whose wrap-
pings he could easily imitate and of
whose serial numbers the bank had
no record the first thing he did when
he reached his desk was to prepare
duplicates of these packages and assure
himself that the real money was still
undisturbed in the vaults

  how long it would remain undis-
turbed was a matter of doubt and real-
ly the only weak place in his plans a
call for some large sum in currency
might come at any time but it was
highly probable that it would not the
discovery of the dummy packages
might not be made for a week

  all morning lloyd was in an agony
of nervous uncertainty he was deter-
mined to tell parsons to call the deal
off but he kept delaying action he
told himself that he wanted to consider
every side of the question in reality
he was only in the grasp of his native
inhibition the very quality which would
have protected him had not parsons so
adroitly turned it to his own purposes

  during the night he had been over
and over and over the reasons pro and
con and he knew that he did not want
to do this thing the hands of the
clock loafed around to ten and the
stream of customers began at his
window

  the hands of the clock fairly gal-
loped to ten forty-five he had fifteen
minues he would tell parsons at
once for he knew that if he didnt
parsons might walk out of the bank

that very morning with the money with
which they were to speculate

  at ten-fifty he turned to go to par-
sonss cage when one of the office boys
came to him and said that mr an-
drews the first vice-president wished
to see him in his office

  lloyd actually shuddered his mo-
mentary panic was as great as though
he had already stolen the money and
was about to be accused and arrested
then he recovered himself and with a
smile at the absurdity of his fears
stepped into mr andrewss office he
knew it would only be a word that the
first vice-president would want to say
and then he could tell parsons to call
the deal off

  but mr andrews for once at least
had considerable to say and most of it
concerned lloyd and the fact that his
work for some time past had not been
at all satisfactory

  lloyd excused himself with the plea
that his health had been bad

   take a vacation sid mr an-
drews  well gladly arrange to let
you off for a couple of months and
hold your position open for you

  lloyd knew it was useless to reply
that he couldnt afford that so he said
hed try to brace up for a week or so
and that if there wasnt any improve-
ment hed ask to be relieved for two or
three months mr andrews said that
that would be satisfactory and indi-
cated that the interview was at an end

  lloyd walked out and looked at the
clock it was five minutes past eleven
parsonss assistant was in his cage and
parsons himself had gone

   oh what in hells the difference 
lloyd half muttered to himself as he
went to his own cage on his desk he
found a note from parsons appointing
a rendezvous for one oclock he went
through his work mechanically and
met parsons at a small lunch-room
which they both frequented they got
a table to themselves in a secluded
corner

    its all right said parsons as they
sat down  twenty brokers each have


the cavalier

twenty-five thousand deposited under

the name of amos r cummings with
orders to buy consolidated wire at the
market we re playing on a twenty-
dollar margin if the stock jumps
twenty points we double our money
if it drops twenty points well be wiped
out itll go one way or the other in-
side of two days

   youll be recognized said lloyd

   not in these answered parsons
showing the end of a false mustache
and goatee which he had put in his
pocket

  whats to be done now asked

lloyd

   nothing much said parsons
 only i wanted you to prepare a letter
then to-night well meet and toss up
to see whos to be the goat if consoli-
dated wire goes down

   what do you mean by a letter 
said lloyd

   ill show you said parsons ta-
king a folded paper from his pocket
and handing it over to lloyd

   why this is a complete and de-
tailed confession of the whole busi-
ness said lloyd after reading

   sure it is replied parsons
 thats what we draw for do you
get me 

    i guess so

  you see continued parsons if
the money was missed and there was
nothing to show who took it you and i
as well as the other tellers would all
be under suspicion and theyd even-
tually trace the business to us but if
theres a definite confession from one
man therell be no danger of any one
else getting involved do you get that
also 

  lloyd nodded and parsons con-
tinued 

   write your letter on the sort of
stationery you usually use at home and
date it-lets see this is the sixth well
know about consolidated wire in three
days if we lose one of us will take the
money saturday so as to have until
monday to hide it - date your letter
monday the thirteenth

  lloyd leaned over to parsons as he
helped himself to a piece of omelet

    theres one little detail you havent
worked out yet where is the money
to be hidden in case that becomes nec-
essary  

    ill tell you that this evening par-
sons replied  after we draw for the
letters that is if you lose

   have you figured out how big a
package a million will make

   i have parsons answered taking
out a memorandum-book in thou-
sand-dollar bills it will need a box six
and one-quarter by seven and one-half
by three inches in mixed denomina-
tions as well probably have to take it
it will require a little more space but
dont worry about that ive got sev-
eral boxes of different sizes

  tin inquired lloyd

   nix said parsons  see what a
valuable partner in crime i am tin
rusts we want nothing that moth or
rust can consume ive had copper
boxes made and ive had em all made
at different places and different times
and ive paid a plumber to teach me
how to solder and ive got a complete
soldering outfit in my room right now
oh no my boy youll find that your
guardian angel hasnt overlooked one
single little thing

    well said llovd as they rose and
reached for their hats  consolidated
wire may go up

   an even chance said parsons as
they went out neither one having eaten
more than a mouthful  you go
ahead we must not be seen returning
together

  though parsons had not actually
planned any crookedness in the draw-
ing of lots he was not in the least
above it he decided that he couldn t
be sure of causing lloyd to draw the
jail sentence but that he must keep on
the alert and if he saw an opportunity
make the most of it

  the whole business must be free
from every taint of suspicion in
lloyds mind at least because if he lost
and then backed out of doing his part
where thieves break in



it would simply mean that two would
go to jail instead of one and that
would be foolish

  that evening he treated himself to
a fine dinner at an expensive hotel go-
ing even to the extravagance of a pint
of champagne if matters went well
with him the good things of life would
henceforth be his portion this hotel
overlooking the rialto would become
a frequent recipient of his patronage
it would be just as well to get acquaint-
ed at once if things went ill there
was no harm in having an evenings
enjoyment avhile he could

  the dinner the champagne the fine
music the air of wealth the obsequious
behavior of the waiter to whom he
gave a dollar tip all combined to make
him feel more prosperous more sure
of success than he had ever felt be-
fore

  when he made the appointment with
lloyd for that evening he knew that
marjorie lloyd would not be at home
for on sunday she had mentioned that
she was to play cards with some
friends

  so as he rang lloyds bell he was
turning over in his mind just how they
would decide the momentous question
as to which one must take on his shoul-
ders the onus and the punishment for
what they were doing

  lloyd opened the door he was
nervous and worried-looking clearly
he had none of parsonss natural cool-
ness the thought of what he was do-
ing sharing in of the risk he ran was
taking possession of him and rapidly
throwing him into a condition border-
ing on nervous prostration his run-
down physical condition of course re-
acted on his nerves

  owing to his scanty lunch he had
been hungry at dinner and had eaten
enormously now he felt a sort of a
nervous nausea this added o his
nervous apprehension rendered him a
really pitiable sight

    have  got your letter ready 
said parsons

  lloyd nodded and produced a square

  envelope they walked into the living-
room and parsons continued 

   well thought of the best way to
settle things 

   cut the cards said lloyd timid-
ly fearing that parsons might not ap-
prove an hour before he had bent
and torn off a corner of the ace of dia-
monds in the only pack of cards he
owned he knew in his own heart that
it was a clumsy device and he won-
dered if the clever parsons would not
see through it at once but parsons
was feeling particularly unsuspicious

    all right he said  put the letters
together heres mine read it and
see that its all right while i read
yours

    its all right said lloyd

   now the fellow who wins the cut
keeps both letters see  said parsons
lloyd nodded

  the two men sat at the ungainly
mission center-table lloyd opened a
drawer and pulled out the cards they
felt familiar in his hands he had
been practising to cut the ace of dia-
monds for nearly an hour he real-
ized that he could not be certain of do-
ing it but he knew the chances were
very much in his favor

   shall we make it one cut  said
parsons figuring to himself that one
cut would give him a better chance to
cheat than if several were required to
win

   all right answered lloyd

   -ace high   asked parsons

   of course replied lloyd feeling
astonished that parsons should happen
to propose exactly the things he
wished  do you want to riffle them  
he handed the pack to parsons who
shuffled and cut them in all ways known
to card - players lloyd watched his
every move

parsons saw aces and kings and
queens flit by as the cards slipped
through his hands but he could think
of no way of making it certain that he
would cut one finally he handed the
cards back to lloyd who gave them
a perfunctory shuffle and laid them on
g

the cavalier

the table as he faced them the broken

corner of the ace of diamonds was at
his left the thumb of his right hand
would cover it perfectly

  parsons cut the cards once and
straightened them out still lloyds
ace was in the proper position but
parsons had nicked a queen with his
finger-nail and now he saw the nick
tiear the bottom of the pack he spoke

   go ahead

  lloyd reached out in an apparently
careless manner and picked up perhaps
twenty cards

  parsons picked up the same number
they both held the cards face down

  all right said lloyd feeling
certain that he had his ace

   sure said parsons happy in the
thought that he had been able to cut
the queen

  both men turned up their cards

   well said parsons tossing his on
the table i lose heres the letters
and he pushed them toward lloyd
who threw down his cards and put the
two envelopes into his pocket then
he opened the drawer of the table and
raked the cards into it pell-mell he
wanted to get his ace with the broken
corner out of sight as quickly as pos-
sible

   well harry said parsons try-
ing to be game  i congratulate you
theres nothing for me now but to
hope that consolidated wire will go

up

   i hope so too lloyd replied  it
would certainly be the easiest way out
of things for both of us is there any-
thing more to be done 

  not for you harry but ive got
a lot of things to plan so i must hurry
along

   i have to call for marjorie in half
an hour answered lloyd  ill go
out with you

   well exclaimed parsons as they
reached the street  its raining

   ill lend you an umbrella lloyd
quickly answered and ran up - stairs
before parsons could interpose an ob-
jection

it gave him a feeling of relief to do

something for parsons even so small
a thing as lend an umbrella

wheres yours asked parsons
seeing that lloyd had brought down

only one

   oh ive only got a step or two

  parsons thanked him took the um-
brella and wrent his way that night
he took his turn at lying awake

  lloyd felt as if he must walk for
leagues and leagues before he met his
wife he had lied in telling parsons
that he had to call for her in half an
hour he was really not due for near-
ly two hours and he spent the entire
time in walking aimlessly in every di-
rection he had no umbrella but he
forgot that it rained

  his clothing became soaked to his
very skin and he was chilled to the
marrow yet he walked on and on he
was nearly an hour late in calling for
his wife and when she saw his damp
condition she hurried him home with-
out asking any questions and urged
him to get out of his wet clothing and
into his bed

  lloyd slept well but woke in the
morning with a heavy cold he worked
all day in alternating chills and fever
and went home a very sick man

  consolidated wire had opened a
point under the price at which parsons
had bought it so there was nothing to
do but wait during the day it dropped
another point the activity in this
stock which parsons had expected and
which had been predicted by most of
the financial writers seemed to be hold-
ing off

  on wednesday morning about five
oclock lloyd awroke in the semi-
consciousness of sleeps borderland he
wondered why he had so much diffi-
culty in breathing as more of his
faculties resumed their functions he
became convinced that some practical
joking cooper had drawn a steel barrel
hoop tightly about his chest he could
only take in a mere pinch of air before
something that at least felt like a steel
hoop stopped him
where thieves break in



   he tried to call his wife who slept
in the next room but he found that he
could barely whisper so he lay gasp-
ing for nearly two hours until mar-
jorie came in to wake him as she al-
ways did about seven oclock

   she saw at once that he was serious-
ly ill and immediately telephoned for
their doctor he came heard about
lloyds run-down condition his upset
stomach the wetting and chill of mon-
day evening and told mrs lloyd that
her husband had a dangerous attack of
pneumonia that she must order a
trained nurse and a tank of oxygen and
begin a vigorous attack on the disease
before it was too late

  that morning parsons noticed that
lloyd did not appear and wrondered
at it all day consolidated wire was
steady with little trading though the
stock-wise gossips in the cafes and on
the street corners said that it was the
quiet before the storm but no one
was agreed on what the storm would
do some said consolidated wire
would collapse others that before the
inevitable crash came it would go up
one hundred points in which event
lloyd and parsons would win exactly
two and one-half million dollars

  parsons made a mental memoran-
dum to call lloyd up in the evening to
see what the trouble was though he
supposed it to be merely an aggrava-
tion of the cold he had on tuesday

  but some friends asked him to din-
ner and after dinner they went to a
musical show and after the show
they had something more to eat and
drink parsons forgot all about call-
ing- lloyd up

  thursday morning he heard from
one of the other tellers that lloyd was
not expected to live half an hour
later the news circulated through the
bank that lloyd was dead at almost
the same hour the crash came in con-
solidated wire the stock dropped for-
ty points in about as many minutes
and the holdings of parsons and llovd
under the name of amos r cummings
were wiped out

  parsonss first thought was that
lloyds death solved one problem for
him very nicely it provided an easy
means for hiding the money until his
jail term was over his plan had al-
ways been to bury the money in some
cemetery because a cemetery is almost
the only place not subject to condemna-
tion proceedings and therefore prac-
tically certain to remain undisturbed
for an indefinite length of time lloyds
death would save him the trouble of
even digging a hole in the ground he
would merely sneak the money into
lloyds coffin and let them bury it with
him

  but then suddenly like a flash par-
sons saw that it was not going to be
necessary to hide the money anywhere
lloyd was dead why not take what
money he could and fasten the whole
business upon the dead man and
then there was marjorie lloyd the
suddenness of his good fortune almost
stunned him he was a man of des-
tiny men even died when necessary
that his pathway might be clear

  then he saw that he must get the
two letters for which he and lloyd
had cut the cards on monday evening
where were they beyond a shadow
of doubt in lloyds pocket there was
small possibility that they had been
disturbed still the time to see was
right now and the time to take what
money he could was right now so that
the belief that lloyd had taken it would
be more plausible

  parsons left the bank that afternoon
with packages of money amounting to
nearly a million dollars distributed
about his person he went straight to
his room and locked himself in then
he got out his copper boxes and select-
ed the one which the money fitted ex-
actly it was about the size of a three-
pound box of candy only a trifle wider
and shorter

  he packed the money in tightly
keeping out only a few bills of small
denomination and got out his solder-
ing kit he had a small bunsen burner
with a rubber hose which he attached


the cavauer

to his gas fixture he scraped the
edges of ilie box applied the acid and
then drew a gleaming line of hot solder
along the joints he had practised this
many times and he made a perfect job
of it

  he did up his box of money in ordi-
nary wrapping-paper and took the
subway for the lloyds flat

  the undertaker had been there and
clone his work lloyd reposed in a
simple casket in the bedroom in which
he had died

  airs lloyd her mother and one or
two near relatives were in the front
room mrs lloyd greeted parsons
naturally and after a word or two of
thanks for his conventional expressions
of condolence suggested that he might
like to step in and look at his dead
friend

  he went in and stood over the coffin
a moment his hat and his precious
package in one hand

  his eye calculated the space under
the coffin lid yes there was  doubt
but what he could slip the box of cur-
rency under there easily and probably
push it back as far as the dead mans
knees where there would be not the
slightest danger of discovery

  he turned to make some ordinary
remark to mrs lloyd but found that
she had not followed him into the
room she had gone back to the front
room and left him alone

  it was too easy lie had not ex-
pected such luck as this again he
saluted the star which ruled his destiny
he looked about  yes there just in-
side the clusct door was the very coat
that lloyd had worn all day tuesday
at the bank iarsons recognized it at
once because he had been present when
lloyd ordered the suit

  he glided over to the closet door
and put his hand in the coat-pocket
he felt some papers he drew them out
yes there were the letters lie put
them quietly in his own pocket and re-
sumed his place at the head of the
coffin he waited a moment and then
went into the living-room

  mrs lloyd asked him if he would
act as one of the pall-bearers and he
answered that he would gladly do so

  he went to his room changed the
date on lloyds letter from the thir-
teenth to the seventh then went out to
dinner returned and went to bed

  he found a box containing a million
stolen dollars an uneasy roommate
as the night advanced he heard num-
bers of mysterious noises a dozen
times he got up and put the box in a
different hiding-place

  he told himself a hundred times that
there was no sense in feeling nervous
or worried he convinced his own
reason that the noises he heard were
the same noises that had passed un-
noticed night after night ever since he
had occupied this room

  he tried to read but he could not
fasten his mind on anything he
smoked imiumerable cigarettes final-
ly he shaved bathed dressed and sat
up waiting lor morning it came on
leaden feet he went to breakfast and
to the bank arriving there as he in-
tended considerably before any of the
others

  lloyds desk was undisturbed par-
sons put the letter in a wire basket con-
taining a lot of miscellaneous papers
it was addressed to mr andrews the
first vice-president and would undoubt-
edly be seen and delivered as soon as
the inevitable clean-up of lloyds dek
took place probably that very day

  at one oclock parsons went out to
lunch but could eat nothing on the
street while returning to the bank the
idea came to him that he was being
shadowed at first he scoffed at the
notion and tried to tell himself that
this was only another part of his fool-
ish nervousness

  but the belief kept recurring and
finally he decided that the only thing
to do was to prove absolutely that he
was mistaken so he walked deliber-
ately to broadway and wall street and
stood there a moment as if waiting for
a car a columbus avenue rattler

where thieves break in



  he waited until every one who ap-
peared to want that car got aboard and
then he jumped on the car started
and a man broke out of the crowd on
the corner and boarded it parsons
took a detailed mental photograph of
him if any one was following him
that was the man he rode to lis-
penard street and got off the man
got off at canal or at least parsons
thought he saw him get off there and
he became panic-stricken at once he
hurried east to the subway and took
a train going north making sure that
no one got on after him he went to
his room took his troublesome treasure
and started for lloyds flat he de-
cided that if he was being shadowed
it proved that they had discovered the
loss of the money and suspected him
he would put the money where it
would be safe until he wanted it and
then come what might he could al-
ways have ultimate riches to look for-
ward to

  before he reached lloyds flat he
bought some flowers and put his own
precious parcel in the box with them

  when mrs lloyd opened the door
he said  i came back with some
flowers i just thought id like to ar-
range them myself may i  

   oh thank you mr parsons she
replied quietly  of course go in

  he went into the room unwrapped
the flowers and arranged them over the
foot of the coffin while doing this
he also managed to slip the box of
money under the coffin- id and to push
it back about eighteen or twenty inches
he fussed with the flowers for a mo-
ment longer and then came out mrs
lloyd met him

   im glad you brought those she
said  i know harry would be pleased
to think that you remembered him

   its not very much we can do he
said rather flatly

  he bowed and went out feeling
tremendously relieved he now felt
sure that the idea he had been shadowed
was pure imagination he hurried to
the subway and got back to the bank

without having been gone more than
forty minutes over his allotted time

  at about five oclock mr andrews
the first vice-president came out of his
office went to lloyds cage and began
fumbling with some of the papers on
the deserted desk parsonss heart
raced like an auto-engine opened wide
and running free

  he felt for a moment as if lie must
yell tear his hair throw ink-wells and
sponge-cups and money in every di-
rection run amuck like a crazy negro
or indian he felt the blood being
forced by the violent action of his
heart into every vein and artery and
gland of his body

  but by a tremendous effort he com-
pelled himself to remain quiet to ap-
pear as though he was going on with
his work in the regular way

  after a moment or two mr an-
drews came to lloyds letter he
glanced curiously at the superscription
picked up a paper-cutter slit the en-
velope open pulled out its contents
and began to read parsons saw his
face set saw him hurrv through to the
end fold up the letter hold it in one
hand and appear to fumble through
some papers

  presently he went back to his office
and closed the door nothing more
happened parsons waited as long as
he felt that he could without exciting
comment and left the bank again he
was in a condition bordering  nerv-
ous collapse

  he had eaten practically no lunch
and now he could eat no dinner he
went to his room worn out and tried
to sleep but though he was physically
exhausted his mind was a maelstrom
he could not lie still for two minutes
as he had done on the previous night
he rose bathed dressed and tried to
sit out the long hours but even this
he could not do

  he finally took his hat and left the
house he walked rode in cars sat
on park benches drank innumerable
cups of coffee and so passed the time
until morning


the cavalier

  he bought the early newspaper edi-
tions on the front page under na-
ming head-lines was the announcement
of tiie banks loss he hardly dared to
read it for fear some one would see
him and suspect his secret he put the
paper in his pocket bought all the other
papers and went back to his room
then lie devoured every word of the
story

  he was astonished that the bank had
permitted the thing to get into the
newspapers at all he had felt sure
that they would exhaust every device
to keep the theft a secret for a loss like
this might even have the effect of start-
ing a run but here was lloyds letter
published in full here were inter-
views with some of the brokers who
had taken the money to be put on con-
solidated wire

  they all said that there was much
secret trading in stock of this sort es-
pecially when a corner was being engi-
neered and that they had taken the
money in perfectly good faith they
had supposed some one in the corner
was dealing in the stock and wanted to
hide his identity

  the article said that the bank offi-
cials had so far accounted for only
part of the missing money but that
doubtless lloyd had distributed it
among a great number of brokers
under several names and that mary of
them would never know just how much
of his money they actually had handled

  there were interviews with other
bankers and financiers the trend of
which was that the theft would be im-
possible in any properly managed bank
and there was an editorial to the effect
that these extraordinary things were al-
ways said to be impossible-until after
they had happened the loss of
the titanic was referred to as a case in
point

  some criticized the colonial na-
tional bank for lax system and others
excused it on the plea that it had grown
so rapidly that its methods of handling
money had not been able to keep pace
with the increase of its deposits

  although parsons could not under-
stand why the bank had not kept the
thing out of the papers the fact that
lloyds letter was clearly accepted as
the one explanation of where the
money had gone partly restored his
composure where an hour before he
had felt that it would be easier to walk
into a police station and confess than
to go to the bank lie now felt that he
could put on a fair enough face to meet
any one

  when he reached the bank there was
a big crowd standing in the street and
on the sidewalk the doors were
closed and a policeman was preventing
any one but employees from entering
parsons gave his name and was im-
mediately admitted

  he went to his desk and had hardly
opened it before a boy told him that
mr andrews wanted to see him in the
directors room he shuddered then
braced himself after all probably
every teller was being questioned
that would be no more than natural
and besides come what might the
money was safe and he would at least
be rich in ten or twelve years

  the president and several of the di-
rectors were in the room and one
stranger a short rather thick-set gray-
haired individual whom parsons sup-
posed was a detective or a lawyer

  good morning parsons youve
seen the papers  was mr andrewss
greeting

   yes of course said parsons

   what do you think of it 

   why i was amazed

   yes of course but do you think
that lloyd speculated with all of that
money 

   why i cant possibly say-why i
have no idea

   you knew him fairly well didnt
you 

   intimately

   do you think his wife knew what
he was doing  

   no i think probably not

   he wasnt dissipated in any way
was he  
where thieves break in



    not that i know of

    theres nothing else you can think
of that would throw any light on the
matter is there 

    not a thing it was simply stun-
ning to me

    i suppose youd like to go to the
funeral 

   why-er-yes i was intending to
do so ive promised to be one of the
pall-bearers

    thats all right youre excused for
the morning come back this after-
noon we may work late to-night

  all right thank you said par-
sons feeling much relieved and left
the room

   it was only about nine oclock so he
fussed around a few minutes ex-
changed expressions of astonishment
with other employees and started up-
town at about ten he rode a station
beyond the lloyds and walked back so
as not to be too early

  he kept reviewing in his mind the
interview with mr andrews in the di-
rectors room it seemed to him the
most aimless purposeless performance
imaginable it was only further evi-
dence of the stupidity and bad manage-
ment that had made the enormous theft
possible

  at first he also wondered why they
permitted the funeral to proceed with-
out interruption but then he reflected
that nothing could be gained by keeping
a dead man unburied there was not
the slightest question about lloyd hav-
ing died a perfectly natural death

  on the whole despite his fearful
fatigue and growing nervousness he
felt easier in his mind than he had felt
since the previous monday evening
when he and lloyd had cut the cards

  the door of the lloyds flat was
opened by the short rather thick-set
gray-haired man whom parsons had
seen in the directors room and sup-
posed a detective or lawyer this lat-
ter surmise now appeared to be currect
for marjorie lloyd came forward and
introduced him as mr decker her law-
yer and explained that he had been at

the bank that morning on her husbands
behalf

   the whole business is perfectly
amazing to me said parsons  
cant believe it there must be some
horrible mistake somewhere dont
you feel that way 

   you must excuse me mr parsons
i cant talk about it at all replied mrs
lloyd parsons thought her manner
queer but he attributed it to the ex-
posure of her husbands enormous
theft

   oh of course i understand per-
fectly said parsons glad to be re-
lieved of the necessity for making up
banalities  oh i forgot to ask where
is the burial to be 

  burial said mrs lloyd i
thought you understood

  understood what stammered
parsons completely mystified

   theres to be no burial

   no burial wrhat do you mean  

   why harry is to be cremated

  cremated parsons almost
shrieked

   yes it was his dying request

  but you mustnt do that ex-
claimed parsons forgetting himself
utterlv in his terror

   why not 

   why because-because-because
its not christian parsons had a dim
recollection of having heard that cre-
mation was a pagan practise and he
jumped desperately at the converse of
that fact

   im afraid none of us have been
very good christians answered mrs
lloyd sadly

   well now is the very best time to
turn over a new leaf said parsons
with hypocritical piety

   bv disregarding a death-bed re-
quest  

   such a request as that by all
means

   oh but he was out of his mind
mr decker parsons included the
lawyer in his plea  surely you will
join your voice with mine in an ap-
peal to mrs lloyd not to allow this


the cavalier

    cant agree with you was the

imperturbable reply  to me it seems
an excellent sanitary measure

   ever since harry saw his mother
buried he has had a horror of gravesw
airs lloyd added

   and so you substitute a worse hor-
ror oh  wont be able to bear it 
parsons almost raved  why i cant
see the body of my friend put in a
furnace and consumed like a piece of
garbaget 

  he had gone too far both marjorie
and mr decker were beginning to look
at him queerly parsons thought and
for a moment this checked his tirade
then others came in among them the
minister at whose church the lloyds
had nominally worshiped

  parsons looked into the room where
lloyds body lay the panel over the
head was still open was there yet
chance for him to extract his treasure
there was absolutely none several
people were in the room and the minis-
ter was even then preparing to begin
the short services

  presently there was a hush and then
came the familiar opening words of
the burial ritual  i am the resur-
rection and the life

  parsons heard nothing beyond this
but the hum of the ministers voice he
cursed his folly in putting the money
in lloyds coffin he cursed lloyd for
suddenly taking this odd notion he
raged at the idea that all his mental
sufferings were to go for naught that
all his plans so perfect and until now
working so smoothly were to be upset
by this one unforeseen contingency it
must be stopped

  he would stop it he couldnt stand
by supine and see a million dollars his
million dollars reduced to ashes but
no perhaps they would take the body
out of the coffin they would find the
box and of course give it to mrs
lloyd then he would quietly explain
things to her and offer to share the
spoils this hope restored him mo-
mentarily

  the ministers voice died out the

undertaker stepped forward and closed
the slide of the coffin

  parsons was one of the pall-bearers

there were five others two men from
the bank and three relatives of lloyds
whom parsons knew slightly

  the undertaker touched him on the
shoulder to indicate that all was ready
he rose mechanically and grasped one
of the handles the actual physical
labor of carrying the casket down-
stairs seemed to steady him momen-
tarily

  four of the pall-bearers got into one
carriage parsons and one of the men
from the bank into another mrs
lloyds lawyer mr decker and one of
lloyds cousins filled the other two
seats

  during the ride to the cemetery in
which the crematory was located par-
sons again burst out in a tirade against
what was to be done he knew that
he should not that it was to no pur-
pose but he simply couldnt keep still
mr decker it developed had quite an
extensive knowledge of cremation and
parsons learned to his further agony
that the body was not to be removed
from the casket that they merely un-
screwed the metal plate and handles
and put casket and all into the retort
and that the heat was supposed to reach
about twenty-five hundred degrees
fahrenheit

  at the cemetery there was no further
formality the incinerator was heated
and ready the casket was taken out
placed on iron wheels which rested on
rails running into the retort the
metal parts were unscrewed the doors
of the retort opened a volcanic blast
for an instant burst forth the casket
was pushed in and the doors closed

  then every one turned and went
back to the carriages-every one ex-
cept parsons he seemed unable to
tear himself away and no one paid
any attention to him

   how long does it take  he asked
an attendant

   between three and four hours but
we usually allow four


trousers and the man



  a dozen times parsons started away
and a dozen times was drawn back
fascinated

  after perhaps half an hour he saw
mr decker returning he wondered
what brought him back

  as decker approached parsons saw
him take a package from a man who
accompanied him and tear off the
wrapping

  for the last time hope bounded in
parsonss breast decker had his box
of money his reason had no time to
go further

  that what worried you said
decker holding up the box

   yes  shouted parsons  where
did you get it 

   in your room said decker and
then parsons saw that it was not the
box of money but one of the others
he had had made and neglected to dis-
pose of

   put the nippers on him myers
added decker showing a detectives
star

   what for  demanded parsons

   no use bluffing parsons said
decker as together they handcuffed
him and led him toward a patrol-wagon
which stood a little distance off
 weve got a clear case we were
not sure that lloyds letter was genu-
ine so we let the story go into the
papers to put the guilty man at ease
we of course searched lloyds house
the casket was an obvious hiding-place
for the money if mrs lloyd was im-
plicated when we found it we were
not sure that she had put it there so
we let things take their course in the
mean time sending men to search your
room but your behavior and the stuff
we found gave you dead away and
cleared her completely

  parsons sank back on the seat of the
wagon deckers voice became dim
and droning in his ear a feeling of
joy surged through him wherever
they were taking him he would get
rest and food at least and the agoniz-
ing suspense of the past hours was over

trousers and the man

                a short story

      by mary rider mechtold

he front door opened nois-
ily then slammed with a
bang they all knew it
was george entering

	hello mom he

 called out in his exuberant boyish way

 hello son i was beginning to
wonder- before his mother had fin-
ished he had tossed a box on the front
stair plunged into the library and
made straight for the pop-corn bowl

 george what do you mean by
being out so late 

  for reply george gave his sister
elizabeth a look of pitying contempt
since her return from college she had
altogether too many fancy notions as
to what he should or shouldnt do and
being thirteen and a half he considered
himself capable of attending to his own
affairs

  nine oclock isnt late is it mom

  he bent over the back of the big easy
chair and kissed his mother

  marcy at the opposite side of the
big round library table looked up from


the cavalier

her book- softie she said u you
girls must stop teasing your brother
the mother patted his cheek and
gave him a look that only came into her
eyes when lie was near not that she
did not love her three girls or was not
proud of them as she bad every reason
to be but her life seemed to center in
this only boy who happened along
eight years after the rest of the group
and of late she had had a peculiar
choking feeling whenever he came
bursting into the room for she began
to realize that he was no longer a baby

  from a handsome well - propor-
tioned light-haired blue-eyed boy he
had become an uncouth cub his hair
had grown tawny and stubborn his
hands feet nose and ears were large
enough for a six-foot-two man and
the slender slightly stooped body was
trying hard to grow lip to the extremi-
ties he was almost as tall as his
father

   i suppose that you have been to
virginias elizabeths critical look
was promptly returned

   sure i went down to the train to
meet mrs scott and virginia and
walked up to their house with them
virginias prettier than ever mama
and she has some beautiful new furs
they had a fine time at her grand-
mothers mrs scott looks lots bet-
ter he added in the little old-fashioned
way he had gained from listening to his
mother and aunt nell talk

    i hope you didnt go in wlnle they
ate their supper

   i did marcy for mrs scott asked
me to -he gave a tantalizing pull at
one of marcys carefully arranged
puffs- false hair-ugh 

   mother-make him stop 

   george dont be rough with your
sisters

   gee-they make me tired then
he purposely tripped over elizabeths
feet as he passed her- but i love
betty angel-face just the same the
gorillalike arms were about her neck

   let go of me at once george
commanded the dignified freshman

  all right betty his voice
cracked more than usual so elizabeth
contented herself with exclaiming
 such a voice 

    down at scott s no one ever says
anything mean to me  he was fishing
fur a rise and he got it from marcy

     oil d better move down there-
might as well really george its dis-
graceful rht- way you hang around with
the girls

    he mother looked at marcy reprov-
ingly then turned to the boy  its
all right george you go to see vir-
ginia whenever her mother says that
you may she is a nice little girl

    ou bet she is-and she can do
things and talk about things that are
interesting she isnt silly like most
girls his sisters to his disappoint-
ment disregarded the thrust

    but say honestly mr scott is an
awful grouch dont see why mrs
scott ever married him why to-
night when virginia said to bring cliff
in because it was so cold out and
theyd feed him in the kitchen mr
scott made an awful row said he
wouldnt have any dog in his house
didnt have no chickens or dogs of his
own because he hated them and was
getting tired of chasing the neighbors
animals out of his yard going to put
a stop to it mrs scott felt awful bad
at his talk-you could tell and virginia
kind of cried when she went to the
door with me to put cliff out shes
awful fond of cliff hes a cute dog
all right and hes smart too

   did you put him in the barn
asked marcy she had been ill and
unable to go to college as the two other
sisters had so she had expended her
force in loving the birds and beasts as
well as all of the neighbors in this in-
terior town of twenty thousand

  no why isnt cliff home i
sent him when virginia and i put him
out i didnt expect him to really go-
he always waits for me-but he wasnt
there when i came out

  george dashed to one of the win-
dows that looked out on the front
trousers and the man



porch the windows reached to the
floor and were of the same generous
proportion as the rest of the house
with its huge double parlors on one
side and library and lounging-room on
the other and a big wide hall between
reaching back to the dining-room that
ran crosswise through the house and
welcomed the morning and afternoon
sun through opposing conservatories

   its funny cliff isnt here the
boy was plainly worried  he gen-
erally puts his nose up against the win-
dow and cries to get in

   yes and in consequence the win-
dows and porch are a disgrace i agree
with mr scott added mrs peaslee
 dogs are a nuisance in town i wish
your father would send him to one of
the farms

   why mother  six pairs of in-
dignant eyes were turned upon her and
the mother had to meet the united dis-
approval of her offspring

   of course cliff is a nice dog
she added to conciliate them

   you bet and yon like him as much
as any of us doesnt she girls why
w hen pop told me to feed him bread
and milk during the hunting season i
used to see you pour cream into his
milk the mother laughingly re-
sumed her sewing  ill whistle for
cliff

  before he reached the door the
voices in the parlor across the hall at-
tracted his attention and he returned
for information

   whos buns beau to-night 
hush george - he might hear
elizabeth had a feeling of sympathy
for the older sister across the hall

   its mr minor say good evening
to him if you wish then go to bed
now mind mother

   is bun going to marry him 
there was a dead silence-but it
didnt abash george slug wilson said
he heard his mother tell his father that
it looked like the peaslees would finally
have a wedding in the family

  george admonished the mother
 well i wish one of the girls would
ii c

marry and live in some oilier town so

i d have some place to visit say betsy
if bun marries grant minor will i
have to give back the knife howard
kellog her other beau gave me i
dont see why she dont marry howard
-i like him grant minors a stiff
why hes never given me a thing

  boys of thirteen arent psychic but
they know when the atmosphere is too
ladened with deadly waves of disap-
proval george made for the door and
whistled for his dog before attempting
to further express his views

   i dont want any one coming to my
room not till i call mom after im in
bed oh mom he came ljack and
whispered in her ear  virginia
brought me a lovely present ill show
it to you when you come up-but dont
tell the girls

   tootsie wootsie teased marcy
 honestly george youre a regular
girl  and yet youre always pretending
youre grown up want long trousers
 im going to have them pop says
im big enough

   you certainly would look better
with a little draping over that long
expanse of stockinged bone mur-
mured elizabeth

   come to mother george and all
of you stop this talk about long
trousers-its absurd why george
is nothing but a baby she tried to
hold him in her lap the extra lengths
of arms and legs doubled about her and
the chair and the boy joined his sisters
in peals of laughter at the picture he
made-as an infant

   you are nothing but a baby the
mother reasserted  and if you put on
long trousers every one will expect as
much of you as of a man they all
expect too nruch now

  he returned his mothers caress by
rubbing his cheek against hers-then
boimded to the door

   you make me laugh mom marcy
call me when cliff comes

   ill put him to bed marcy an-
swered good-naturedly  george
theres a piece of chocolate-cake left-


the cavalier

what have you in that box  she had
glanced in the hall on the way to the
book-case and saw him pick up the
long box from the stair

   it isnt anything for you-though

i	may show you if youre good he
was half up the stairs when bun struck
a chord on the piano-it seemed to
awaken a flood of mischief in him he
stole down the stairs quietly and
stepped in the doorway of the front
parlor

   good evening bun was at the
piano in the further room grant un-
necessarily near turning some music

  he seemed to startle them - they
turned toward him with anything but
a welcoming look but he didnt
notice he was too busy looking to see
if there was a box of candy within
reach he located it far away on the
piano so to get even for this piece of
bad luck he put his hand upon the
electric switch and turned out the
lights  nows your chance grant 
he called then made for his own room
and locked the door

  of course bun would tell on him
and hed get an awful scolding in the
morning but for the next few minutes
he was too busy to borrow trouble

  after removing his blouse and
knickerbockers he disdainfully threw
them in a corner and dressed himself
in the clothes from the flat box when
the new suit was on he started toward
the mirror then stopped and returned
to the old clothes in the corner

  from the pockets he took the knife
howard kellog had given him and a
small package done up in tissue-paper
and tied with blue ribbon

   thats just like a girl to lie it all
up fussy in most things virginia has
good sense he thought and a look
of disgust swept over his face as lie
looked at her gift  well she must
think im a kid-thats a bow-tie for
a boy 

  then he strode to the glass to be-
hold himself for the first time in long
trousers his face was smiling and
triumphant when he first looked in but

as he took himself in he suddenly
blushed flew over to his bed and buried
his face in a pillow

  when steps sounded in the hall he
started up guiltily and began tearing
off his new clothes when they sounded
 the stairway again he rebuttoned
his vest and stole toward the mirror
this time his reflection seemed more
pleasing so he took some long steps
and watched the effect it felt as if
his lower legs were tied to his knees by
strings but they looked stable

  then he got out his best hat and
practised tipping it this proving
satisfactory he gingerly attempted to
sit down after he had practised pull-
ing his trousers legs up and down so
they wouldnt bag at the knees he felt
quite brave and determined to walk
into the library and give them all a
surprise at the top step marcys voice
threw him into a panic

   george-

   yes -he managed to reply

   can you come down 

   no  he screamed and dived for
his door

  cliffs home - but acts very
strange he moans and will not come
when i call him

    hes cut his foot again ill bet
the boy forgot his trousers and with a
bound was down the steps and out the
door the dog was crouched on the
first step of the porch

  cliff cliff the dog crept
toward him and tried to wag his tail

    why cliffie whats the matter 
his cry brought the entire family and
young minor with them  he doesnt
seem to be cut

  young minor gave the dog one look
hes poisoned get some milk-
quick-coax your dog to the barn
george and well see if we can save
him bun gave grants hand a grate-
ful squeeze and ran for the milk

  george disappeared around the cor-
ner of the house half carrying his dog
and whispering endearing terms the
rest of the family went through the
house and out the back way to the
trousers and the man



barn taking with them hot-water bags
mustard milk and blankets at the
door of the barn grant asked them to
go back  george and i can do better
alone marcy burst into tears as she
heard george repeating from within

    now youre going to be all right
cliffie we wont let you die

  bun loitered behind the others
cant i do anything grant youll
help george 

  help him-it was through him-i
got that kiss in the dark-you forgive
me now 

   why of course -and in the ex-
citement held up her face as if always
used to his kisses-and he vaguely
wondered why she had kept him in
despair for two long years  ill get
father on the phone and tell him about
cliff she called as she ran back to the
house

  grant and george had worked un-
ceasingly for an hour when the judge
joined them

    its no use boys-cliffs done for
george burst into tears and turned
away

   a little later when the three returned
to the library marcy met them at the
door  is he dead  he asked

   dont talk about it sobbed the
boy  i cant bear it-i want cliff
back-i could kill the person wtho
poisoned him i will too

   this will never do -the father
kindly but firmly put his hand on the
boys shoulder  you must act like a
man to live up to those long trousers
for the first time the family noticed
them he seemed to loom above his
father and grant

   oh george  gasped his mother
 i dont want ever to be a man 
he cried and buried his face in his
mothers lap

  when george came to the breakfast-
table the next morning his face was
swollen and his eyes red he wore his
knickerbockers

   t tell you he exclaimed  im
going to find the murderer of cliff

   i wouldnt advised the father

 stirring up things in a neighborhood
only leads to unhappiness weve all
had enough

   but i know who did it  it was
doc-

  no you dont know it was the
judge rather than the father who spoke
now never act on impulse or allow
yourself to be carried away by sus-
picion and george i dont want to
hear you say so and so did it unless
you have absolute evidence to prove it

   well if i go about it quietly and
dont talk about my suspicions cant i
find out who did it mayor barrett
will let the police help me i know lor
his boys have a dog and they wouldnt
want it poisoned they thought a lot
of cliff and hank stanmetz wont
want his dog poisoned his dog was
cliffs best friend i tell you pop i
owe it to all the other boys whove
got dogs to find out the sneak in this
neighborhood

   all right my boy but youll be 
sorry where are the long trousers
you begged me to get for you 

  if i wore them the boys would
guy me and i dont feel like fighting
just now he suddenly choked out an
 excuse me mom and left the table

   the child only ate one cake ex-
claimed his mother he usually ate
twelve

  and so george went to work to find
out who poisoned his dog grant had
the stomach analyzed and found that
cyan id of potassium had been used
mayor barrett agreed to have the police
get a record of all poisons sold at the
drug-stores within the past month an-
other friend who comforted him great-
ly was the policeman on his beat he
filled his head with detective stories
arid their methods of procedure but
virginia was his mainstay

   we must trace every movement
cliff made from the moment we put
him out of our door until he came
home she advised it wasnt so sim-
ple to do


the cavalier

  the roses had seen him on scotts
porch about seven-thirty then the
warrens remembered that as they
were passing a little later than that

they had seen mr scott come out of
his front door stumble over a dog and
heard him swear but they couldnt
say the dog was cliff but scotts
maid dropped a piece of information
toward the end of the week that gave
george a start

  that night before eight mr scott
with his hat and coat on had come into
the kitchen and taken something from
the ice-box sofie wasnt sure but
thought it was meat george didnt tell
virginia that he was sure it had no
connection with his case and didnt
want to worry her each clue was
sifted down guilt pointed strongly
toward doc bates who lived just back
of them for he had been loudest in de-
nouncing the dogs of the neighborhood
besides he was naturally mean
george was only waiting now to get a
list from the drug-stores to end his
suspicion

  a week passed before mike brass
the police detective sent him word that
hed be up with the list of poisoners
and new evidence in his excitement
george confided to virginia who im-
mediately made her mother promise to
take her up to the peaslees for a while
after supper that night virginia ar-
rived just as mike rounded the corner
george was waiting on the steps

   hello virginia im awfully glad
you came up ill see you when i get
through with mike go right in mrs
scott mothers in the library said the
boy opening the front door for his
guests

   youve promised to tell me first
george whispered virginia

   i will he answered quickly
 and if it is doc bates ill have him
arrested and put in jail i certainly
will well stop the killing of dogs in
this town

  george joined the policeman and
virginia followed her mother into the
library she chose a chair near the

door leading into the hall where she
could watch for georges return

    im very glad to see you vir-
ginia said mrs peaslee cordially
 youre getting so big youll soon be
a young lady

    oh mrs peaslee dont suggest
her growing up i feel -and mrs
scott stopped to control the twitching
of her mouth- as if she was all i
had in the world and i want to keep
her a while longer

   i understand responded the other
mother

    have some candy virginia no
well- bun had entered the room

   i want you to come into the parlor
with me and meet mr minor she
went on  hes too shy to come in
here where there are so many people
but he wants to see georges girl 

   oh im not georges girl am 
mother   her hands flew to the res-
cue of her flushed face she and george
had played together as children and
she had never thought of feeling shy
where he was concerned  i just came
up to hear about the dog poisoner
george is gone a long time

  just then georges voice sounded
from over the banister

   grant

   george must have come in the back
way said his mother

   what do you want george   asked
his prospective brother-in-law as he
joined him at the top of the stairs
 whats the matter kid are you
sick   the boy was standing perfectly
rigid and was as white as the paper
which he clenched in his hand

   no-im not sick he replied with
an effort  i slipped in because -his
mouth was so dry and his lips so
parched he couldnt go on till he had
swallowed hard and moistened them-
 well because i couldnt stand it

  no tears came to relieve his pent-up
feelings as upon the night of his dogs
death-the quivering lip the twitching
face the quickening breath were the
only signs of his consuming rage

   the sneak the hound-hes not fit
trousers and the man



to shoot-but ill do it ill get even
with him for killing cliff if i-

   steady old man-buck up-youre
hit hard grant put his arm about the
youngsters shoulder

   yes and some one else will be
hit he answered throwing off the
restraining arm

   george it was virginia calling
from below at the sound of her voice
he stopped as if suddenly turned into
stone-the convulsive breathing ceased
when she called the second time the
perspiration broke out on his forehead
and he groped for the support of the
banister

   it was grant who finally called out
 well be down in a minute then in
a low tone  is that the list of poison-
purchasers that the policeman gave
you  

  he indicated the folded paper that
george still clutched in his hand
 yes -george gulped hard- and
mike told me some other things w-hen
lie gave me this he handed the paper
to grant then looked steadily in the
distance as if dazed

  grant took the list and ran hastily
down the column after the name
scott was the word  cyanid he
dropped the paper with a gasp  you
dont mean that he poisoned cliff-not
mr scott-virginias father

   dont was all george could say
the older boy turned away he couldnt

bear to see such grim despair in a
youngster  she isnt to blame

  george unsteadily reached out his
hand took the paper and tore it into
tiny pieces as he started to put them
in his pocket he became conscious that
he had on his new suit of clothes

   i put them on right after supper-
to surprise virg- he stopped un-
able to finish her name then he looked
at his long trousers without either in-
terest or embarrassment and followed
grant down the stair

  the silence was unbroken until they
had almost reached the bottom step

   grant im sorry i ever called you
a stiff and im glad youre going to be
my brother he said

  	so am i old fellow the other
replied and he patted him encour-
agingly	 

  virginia spied him first she rushed
over to her mother and grasped her
hand excitedly

   oh mother see george in long
trousers he looks just like a man 

  then remembering her mission she
asked eagerly

   george did you find out who was
mean enough to kill cliff 

  the boy leaned against grant heavily
for just an instant then he caught his
breath and drew himself up in the door-
way

   no-that is im not sure-so i
cant tell 

for your three best friends

here is an idea

   send me the names and addresses of three of your friends whom
you think will be interested in the stories in the cavalier and i will
send them sample copies direct from this office you might if you wish
to prepare them for the coming of the magazine write to them as well
and say that sample copies of the cavalier are being sent them at
your request

    this is just a suggestion if it is too much trouble dont do it but
i will appreciate it if you do and you will have the satisfaction of know-
ing that you have let your friends in on a good thing

getting billys goat

 a short story

by jack brant

ootball at buckeye col-
lege was no afternoon
pink tea if you apolo-
gized for putting a hob-
nailed shoe in the face
of your best friend the coach was like-
ly to light on your neck the next min-
ute because of your ladylike manners
temper played a big part in picking
the team and those of us who didnt
have any originally had had it de-
veloped the one exception was billy
gordon the big guard

  billy was so good-natured that it
oozed out all over him no one not
even the coaches could even ruffle him
even if one did pick a scrap he was
so big that it didnt do any good he
would put out his right hand which
was about as heavy and greatly resem-
bled a full-sized ham and if any one
got in front of it he would be brushed
away like a fly leaving billy as serene
and good-natured as ever

  as for hurting him into a fit of tem-
per you could run races up and down
the back of his spine and he wouldnt
know you were there he weighed two
fifty stripped and all vulnerable parts
were protected by the latest six - inch
kick-proof flesh armor-plating

  a man like that can get a place in
the line on any football team in the
country but tom burns head coach
of buckeye wanted more than an
automaton of defense he wanted a
whirlwind of attack and destruction
he used to sit up whole nights trying
to think of schemes to make billy mad

  his theory was that every man had
a temper stored away somewhere and
it only needed a touch on the hidden

spring to start it off i guess he was
right for hed found it on everybody
else on the team ive gone into a game
so mad that ive tried to shake men in
my teeth and growl

  but toni was pretty well stumped
trying to discover the combination that
fitted billy

  two weeks before the big final game
with kenyon college our main rival
the situation began to get desperate
tom burns called a meeting of the
whole team minus billy and explained
that no matter how furious the rest of
us got if we didnt get a good mad out
of billy we stood as much chance of
winning that game as of growing wings
on earth he admitted that he was up
against it or he wouldnt have called
on a lot of sapheads like us to do a
mans thinking

  what he wanted was to get billy
angry just before the game and have
the cause of his anger so far out of his
reach that he couldnt get at it and
would take his wrath out on the ken-
yon team

  the reason that his previous experi-
ments had failed was because billy had
always succeeded in coming down solid
with his two hundred and fifty pounds
on the object that was supposed to work
the charm and the instant and com-
plete crushing of that object always had
the effect of immediately restoring any
particles that might have started to
stray from billys good nature

  this set us all thinking and that
night as i jumped into bed i found
the solution that solution was miss
pink

  miss pink was the queen of the
getting billys goat



co-eds and the prettiest girl in two
states it was secretly surmised among
a choice few who were in on the game
that she was as good as engaged to
head-coach tom burns billy who
didnt dance and therefore didnt think
much of girls was not one of the few
who were in on the game

  considering toms feelings in that
direction i didnt have any trouble in
convincing him that all miss pink had
to do was to smile once or twice on a
man and his peace of mind would begin
jumping around like a squirrel in a
rat-trap

  my plan was to get her to cast a few
of those smiles on billy its a well-
known axiom that a fellow in love is
particularly susceptible to the grouch
germ and its just a step from a good
blue grouch to a tearing rage

  i predicted that in two weeks we
could get the thing so well under way
that on the day of the final game all
we would have to do would be to light
the fusee and then run like the mis-
chief to get far enough away before the
explosion

  the end that i outlined to tom was
to have miss pink come up to billy just
as he was leaving the locker-building in
his football clothes and reach out and
slap him on the face preferably on each
side of his face

  she could throw in some words at
the same time like  liar  and  cheat
or whatever the ladylike phrases were
that would convey the same meaning
this i reasoned would rouse the tem-
per of a mummy and of course as
billy couldnt hit a girl he would go
into the game and begin tearing the
clothes off of the kenyon team

  tom agreed that the basis of the plot
wasnt bad but he didnt think that
quite so much action in the final play
would suit miss pink he said i had
the right idea but that if id ever been
in love i would realize that it wouldnt
take as much as that to make a man eat
granite

  according to his views the best way
to get billys goat would be to have the

lady of his choice suddenly announce
on the day of the game that she was
engaged to another man

   wasnt born yesterday and i saw
right away that tom thought this
might be a good method to clear up his
own difficulties and at the same time
rouse the sleeping lion in billy so i
played into his hand

    guess youre right i said  it
sure would give billy a jolt if miss
pink should tell him that she was en-
gaged to you when he was thinking
that he was the king-pin do you think
you stand in strong enough to pull the
trick off at the proper moment 

  it was a fool question for me to ask
if there was one line where tom con-
sidered that he was strong it was with
the ladies he wasnt far wrongeither
for he was no end of a hero and girls
like that kind but i had an idea that
he was having harder work bringing
miss- pink to terms than he liked to
admit

  this seemed tough on tom for it
was plain as day that she was the one
girl he had ever met whom he was head
over heels in love with i dont under-
stand girls because i have red hair
but i shouldnt have been surprised if
it was just because she didnt fall down
in front of him that made him so keen
about her

   well said tom looking a little
fussed  you certainly have got a lot
of nerve but if you can keep a secret
ill tell you something im not en-
gaged to miss pink yet but i hope to
be and i think that for the good of
the college i can get her to play her
part and well let billy know of our
engagement at the right moment tu win
that game

  the next day tom was beaming so
after practise i asked him how things
were progressing and because he
wanted to talk to somebody and because
he had started in to make a confidant of
me he told me all about it

  it seems that when he had first sug-
gested the plan she had refused abso-
lutely to have anything to do with it


the cavalier

but after he had made a strong appeal
to her college spirit and explained how
necessary temper was to football and
that unless she helped we would lose
the big game she came aiound condi-
tionally

  the conditions were that she re-
served the right to drop out at any mo-
ment and that if any engagement was
announced she was to be the one to do
the announcing and tom assured me
that she wasnt the kind of a girl that
would back out and that she would do
her best for buckeye he was going
to take billy to walk that night and
meet her accidentally and had an ex-
cuse all fixed up to leave them together

  now that everything was arranged
i began to feel a little uneasy in my
conscience i liked billy as did every-
body else and it seemed to me that we
were playing him a pretty low-down
trick

  id never been in love and had no
idea how easy a thing it was to get over
but i reasoned that miss pink and
tom knew what they were doing and
that if they considered it harmless why
they ought to know and tried to think
no more about it

  things began to turn out beautifully
just as we had planned i guess a mere
man doesnt stand much chance when a
girl really sets her cap for him billy
fell like a lamb and even took to
writing poetry his whole manner
changed and he carried around his two
hundred and fifty pounds as if they
were barely enough ballast to keep him
connected with the earth

  tom gave him a clear field for the
good of the team and when he wasnt
at practise or attending lectures you
could be pretty sure he was with miss
pink or waiting for her somewhere
everybody noticed it and smiled at it
and liked billy and miss pink all the
better for it

  this went on for two weeks right
up to the afternoon of the final game
then came the explosion it was big-
ger than we had expected-so big that
tom got caught in it

  a few of us were walking down to
the field with tom he was very
nervous not listening to anything we
said and i knew it wasnt all caused
by the game right in front of us were
miss pink and billy waiting on the
corner as we passed billy called to
tom and he joined them we went on

   heard later that tom tried to get
away but she wouldnt let him

   please stay mr bums she said

  you have both been such good friends
to me that i want you to be the first to
hear a secret im engaged-but dont
tell because it isnt out yet richard
randolph is a distant cousin and i am
so anxious to have you meet him

  she smiled up at them with those
big round trusting eyes of hers she
was so confidant they would be delight-
ed and so absolutely unconscious that
she was causing the slightest uneasi-
ness to either of them

  they tried to say the right thing
and left her to wait for her girl friends
who were going with her to the game
and when they joined us at the locker-
room they were like two full-sized hur-
ricanes done up in quart bottles

  nobody but i knew what the trouble
was and i didnt guess but half of it
tom sailed into us in true football
style and the talk he gave us was a
lyric ive never heard nor read of
a speech before a battle that could touch
it it put fire into us as if he was pour-
ing it in with a dipper and we ran out
on that field ready to consume all that
we touched

  that game will live forever in the
history of buckeye college kenyon
came on the field with a heavier team
and the idea that they were going to
have a cinch they found ten furies
and one demon and there was as much
chance of stopping buckeye as stop-
ping the north wind

  billy was the demon from a quiet
peace-loving hercules of an hour be-
fore he had changed into an avenging
torrent of wrath four men couldnt
hold him and his path when he ran
down the field was lined with cripples
getting billys goat



with one or two of the bravest who
courted death clinging to him

  the odds turned right around in the
first ten minutes and the college in the
bleachers went wild with delight as we
dashed on to victory the score at the
end was twenty-nine to nothing and
there was lots of fight still left in us
two men fought even as the cheering
under-grads carried them twice around
the field on their shoulders these two
were tom burns and billy

  there was a big bonfire on the
campus that night and everybody
co-eds and all attended at about the
middle of it there was a cry for an ax
and as i vaguely remembered having
seen one around the corner of the grand
stand where the carpenters had been
working i went for it

  i made plenty of noise coming but
there were two people around there in
the dark that didnt hear me they

were miss pink and billy i was near
enough to hear what they were saying
when i stopped and i couldnt help lis-
tening miss pink was talking

   i-i said it for a joke she was
saying  there isnt any richard
randolph im sorry i did it i would
never have done it if-if i had thought
you would get so angry with me

   i wasnt angry with you-or any
one - said billy stubborn as a bam
full of mules

   oh but you were you were very
very angry indeed and it was splen-
did and-and-i love you for it 

  it always pays not to argue with a
woman and there are some times when
it pays better than others

  i hurried away as fast as i could
but i couldnt get away fast enough not
to notice that billy realized this was one
of the times that called for action not
words

fall

by keith

theres sighing in the spruces
 a smell of early rain

a patch of sky

an eagle high

the fall has come again

the maple ridge is yellow

the leaves drop zigzag down

    a chipmunk hurries

stops scurries
rustling in the brown

the muskrats work is finished
from out the lake his lome

just appearing

freshets clearing

shows its reedy dome

 toiling is the beaver

 the squirrels store is told

     a partridge drums

      a rabbit runs

 the early nights are cold

 over the quiet marshes
 the wild geese homeward fly
 a feather falls

       fainter their calls

 lonely the empty sky

 theres sighing in the spruces
 a smell of early rain

     the morning frost
     at noon is lost

 the fall has come again

urely the cavalier made
tfgaq hay this summer and
now we are about to
w jnr gather a banner crop
 from far and near
from every clime by
land and sea we are now receiving ad-
vance information of a great harvest
every mail brings us new subscriptions
new friends and splendid applause

  in less than one year the cavalier
the first all-fiction weekly to be printed
in any language has jumped into the
front ranks

   give the people what the people
want and give it to them at a right
price

  that is the slogan under which the
cavalier has been put forth

  ye have made our readers and we
have held them and we shall make more
and hold them and by the beginning of
the year we will have a battery of
presses hurling cavaliers from our
press room out over the broad land

  the cavalier has been run not by a
single narrow-minded editor but by
cavalier readers themselves your
opinions have been solicited and thank
heaven the communications that have
come to this desk have been frank and
honest in every sense of the word and
because of them the magazine is better
in even respect

  when the cavalier was first in-
augurated we ran six or seven serials
sometimes eight in a number the sub-
scribers and readers of the magazine told
us very plainly that we were running too
many serials that the instalments were
too short and that instead of giving
them great variety we were simply offer-
ing great confusion well it did not
take us long to change this order of
things the response in the shape of
subscriptions and applause was instan-
taneous the demand for longer instal-
ments and less serials had the weight of
a doctrine and we accepted it as final

  there were certain kinds of stories
that were universally disapproved

editor

   how do you like these particular
things  asked

   we dont like them at all was the
reply

   very well you have seen the last of

them

  and so with the help of our readers
we have finally gotten the cavalier
about where it pleases the majority of
them and now you can look forward to
the greatest harvest of good story wri-
ting and feast of fiction that has ever
been known

  jn the next issue you shall have an-
other story in the semi dual series
entitled

 the purple light

by j u giesy and j b smith

  that giesy and smith are popular
with the readers of the cavalier there
is no longer any doubt and the announce-
ment of their next story will exhilarate
everybody

  like all of the semi dual stories
 the purple light is a mys-
tery-a mystery that surrounds the death
of a mrs greenig a woman of means
who resided in a fashionable metropoli-
tan apartment her body was found
under unusual circumstances a vein
had been torn open in her left forearm
presumably with her own penknife
which was found near at hand how-
ever suspicion which is the backbone of
most good mysteries falls upon a trained
nurse because the deceased had recently
disinherited a spendthrift nephew and
named this particular nurse as a legatee
incidentally suspicion falls upon the
nephew and this suspicion is accentuated
by the fact that a latch-key to his aunts
apartment is found in his possession
furthermore the aunt contemplated a
third will reinstating the nephew

  you will gather from this that messrs
giesy and smith have braided a plot to-
gether that only semi dual himself can
unravel he succeeds in a most magnifi-
heart to heart talks



  cent manner in three instalments in
  setting the truth the whole truth and
  nothing but the truth before you

  and now we will proceed to the next
big feature-a novelette entitled

 galatea the second

         by fred jackson

  those of you who have not forgotten
your classics will recall the story of the
sculptor pygmalion who fashioned a
beautiful statue fell in love with his own
handiwork and through the depth of
that love gave her life many a marble
heart has been assaulted nowadays with
the same intention but not with the same
results

  fred jackson in his story has im-
proved upon the ancient galatea and
practically set pygmalion back a couple
of centuries

  when it comes to a really high-class
sympathetic love-story the old-timers
have got nothing on fred

writer having established this fact i
call your attention to  lady impos-
sible a very charming story about
a conventional male aristocrat and a poor
little girl who is frightfully rich and who
dresses in the most deplorable taste
the scene is at a fashionable hotel where
the other guests snub the pathetic little
western girl until she is about distracted
then the man comes to the rescue just
how you must read and learn

  do not make the mistake of snubbing
clothes there might be something in
them after all

  frank condon will be found at his
best in  the grand street
passion i do not dare even hint
what it is about except that an east side
girl spotted a swell cloak in a grand
street show-window which her very soul
craved therefore she went in and
bought it the clerk happened to be a
sweetheart of hers what she paid for
it is one thing and what the cloak was
worth is another anyhow somebody
discovered that the cloak was worth a
nice bunch of money and went out and
hocked it after which an effort was made
to buy another one just like it and-

  well go and see the newsdealer and
find out what happened it is worth ioc
of anybodys money to have a look-in on
this finish its a corker

  in this particular instance the melody
was hypnotic overpowering irresistible
nobody could escape the charm of its
mellow chord it was the limit and its
soothing power far-reaching when

zie by johnston mcculley it is a
love-story pure and simple dividing its

  there are other short stories in this
same issue but the few  have touched
upon are sufficient for the present

  the issue for october  is a splendid
number rich in plot power and per-
formance

the department of letters

covers in colors

  some of the readers of the cavalier
are of the opinion that our covers are a
little too melodramatic other readers
are attracted by the covers

   beg to take extracts from a letter
received from the lambs club new
york city

  in reference to the cover question it
strikes me that any one who hasnt the cour-
age of his convictions is not worth considera-
tion from normal people why then be
ashamed to be discovered reading something
one really likes people misjudging ones
choice of literature from outside appearances
are only showing their own consummate
ignorance and smallness why join such a
class

  in the six months i have known your maga-
zine the covers have always caught my eye
they ore well drawn well executed and mean
something

  my hat off to you sir if you stick to your
colors-no matter how daring they are so
long as they are real my hat off to you in
any ease for your responsibility in a magazine
of such worth and stimulus

  frankly i have never subscribed-because
i am too impatient to wait for delivery i
couldnt get by the first news-stand empty-
handed

sincerely

effington pinto

  mr pinto is rather emphatic about his con-
clusions

  here is another letter from german-
town pa in which the subject of covers
is touched upon

  t noticed in this weeks issue of the cava-
lier september a letter in which the writer
say  the covers arc too loud well only this
evening when i bought it  made the remark
that some of the drawings are as good as the
stories i think your judgment is just about
right

  i could not wait to get home to finish  the
cradli- of thi dep but sat down in the store
and read it through

   his praise is not hot air as i never was
better pleased for so little money in all my

life

robert g dole

  a lady writing from rochester x y
with the request that her signature be

withheld says

  the covers are sensational and careless
onlookers in the home or traveling note the
picture and judge the contents by the cover

then judge you by what they think is vour
literary trend  give a dog a bad name etc
now could not flowers fruits landscapes
animals childrens faces and the like be used

  i do not quite agree with the lady and i
am not prepared to admit that the covers on
the cavalier are sensational these pictures
are taken from actual scenes in the stories
themselves the fact that they are vital and
full of animation and life to say nothing of
an occasional tragic pose should not in any
measure diminish their worth the people of
the united states are asking for a red-blooded
magazine they want life as it is and from
all accounts the fiction in the cavalier
pleases a larger majority of people than the
fiction in any other magazine

  this cover issue is a big one with us we
do not want to disturb any individual sense
of delicacy or proportion we want to please
the majority without offending the minority

  mr orr who made the first objection to
our covers is entitled to his honest convic-
tions and we will go a long way before we
will wantonly offend him perhaps in the
forthcoming issues of the cavalieh he will
find a compromise that while not weakening
the pictorial end of our covers will be more
agreeable to him

the cradle of the deep

  jacob fishers storv  the cradle
of the deep which ran from
august r to september  made a pro-
heart to heart talks	

found impression upon the readers of
this magazine i beg to offer some
letters on the subject

  will you permit me to express my senti-
ments in favor of the cavalier i have
bought it regularly since its transformation
into a weekly i take several other magazines
and if i had to give any up the cavalier
would be the last one to go

  the serial just concluded the cradle of
the deep  consider next to  darkness and
dawn the best you have yet published

  by the way where is that long-promised
sequel to darkness and dawn you
promised it to us some time ago and it has
not yet appeared

wm w washburn

  in answer to mr washburns query con-
cerning the sequel to  darkness and
dawn  it is now complete and under
the title of beyond the great ob-
livion will shortly be put to press

  the following succinct summing up of
the whole situation appeared on a post-
card posted at sea gate

  i am reading with breathless interest the
story  the cradle of the deep and before
i have finished it i must write you just a
word to say that that story is a marvel stories
like that will be the making of the cavalier
it is already a wonderful magazine although
in its infancy

a mother

  for a certainty this mother possesses
enough discrimination and intelligence to in-
oculate her children with a taste for good
literature

likes tom gallon

  a wall street reader who modestly
requests that his name be withheld
makes some pertinent suggestions with
reference to tom gallons  as he
was born for his information
we have been trying for some time to
get a sequel to this story but according
to tom gallon there does not appear to
be any sequel perhaps later he will see
the whole thing in a different light-who
knows we shall do the best we can to
rouse him

  i	have read many thousand storie and take
six magazines each month foremost of which i
deem the cavalier but never in my twenty-
five years of reading have i read a story that
pleased me more than  as he was born by
tom gallon if possible let us hear more of
felix and ninetta and the alderman and his
wife they were characters as good as any in

	dickens  and far more realistic and lifelike
i relished this story like a starving man sur-
rounded by doughnuts galore would relish a
series of roast fowl nicely done to a turn
the cavalier really seems dull these last few
weeks without a portion of that story to look
forward to cant mr gallon start a bit more
trouble to separate them for a short time just
to give us a few more laughs and heart-throbs
for dessert say a flaw in the will or some
legal tangle or something to bring them back
to us i guess i am not alone in this desire
you might bring uncle mapletoft back to life
to enjoy the pairs happiness

  wishing you many future successes and
much prosperity i am

very respectfully yours

professional selection

  up in springfield massachusetts the
population is very discriminating par-
ticularly in the office of the springfield
union you must excuse me for quot-
ing the following letter it is praise from
sir herbert so to speak

  a dozen copies of the cavalier are bought
by members of the springfield union staff
each week although copies of the so-called
standard magazines may be had from the ex-
change editor for the asking it takes a
mighty good magazine to interest a news-
paperman and among the few that succeed
the cavalier holds first place

couldnt improve it

  i have been reading the cavalier since
december  and i must say that it is better
than any other magazine i have ever read
one thing you never have any stories that are
all impossible and that are so foolish that one
has to laugh at the writer and wonder why
any magazine will publish them and during
all the time that i have read the cavalier i
have never read a punk short story serial
novel or novelette the poetry by faith bald-
win is fine and the last novelette  hermo the
handsome is delightful it makes a fellow
feel good to read that kind of a story i am
sure i dont know where you could improve
the cavalier as it is good enough now

raymond g hall

coming-louis joseph vance

  at last it is finished-his new novel
the day of days which will
positively appear in the cavalier be-
ginning november  it is a new york
adventure story and considered by
vance himself as his best and finest
romance-adventure
love that passes
understanding

a short story

by adriana spadoni

yuh sure mirah ruth
aint never been light
not even giddy like other
girls there aint never
been no shaller women
in our family

   i seen her they was standiiv
there together - lookin out into the
blackness there werent nothin to
see just the blackness an the stream
was roarin i was settin in the rocker
after id finished fixan fur the momin
an i guess i fell asleep i woke with
the cold on my legs i thought the
wind must have blowed the door open
it was blow in hard like it had blowed
everything out of the world and was
the only thing in it  was gettin up
to shut the door when-i-seen em
j set down again like some one knocked
me they was stand in there lookin
out into the wind lie-lie- a
dull brickish red crept up under the
womans smooth sallow skin  he
had his arms round her and her head
was against him

   t-want-to-know

  the thin hands of the ancient man
in the dim corner beside the stove flut-
tered helplessly they fell on his thin
cinnamon-colored knees like dead
whitish leaves

  the color in the womans face deep-
ened i ter eyes were ashamed but she
forced herself to go on she did it as
if she were used t forcing herself to
do things

   then he kissed her she bent

down and shot the big white pie into
the black cavern of the oven  i
thought she was goin to faint she was
so still and white there against him 

guess i made some noise anyhow
they turned ruth looked at me as if
i was a ghost

  i-want-to-know the an-
cients gentle dim eyes peered from the
shadows  she must have been power-
ful feared and shamed mirah

  the woman hunched down on her
knees before the oven

   she werent father she jes stood
there-they both did-lookin at me
then she started to say something but
lie stopped her  go ruth he says
awful quiet an ill explain it

   i-want-to know it was like
the faint inizz of some weakened in-
sect

    knew then it werent the first
time he had kissed her-the way she
went then he began to talk the
woman got up heavily and sat down in
the chair by the table  he didnt look
no more shamed than her he ies
talked like he was talkin about the
weather-like there was no two ways
of thinkin about it

  the ancient drew farther into the
warmth of the stove corner as if the
womans words chilled him

    i guess you see how it is with me
and ruth mrs sanders he says like
he was say in the potatoes showed good

 we love each other and we want to be
together always like other married peo-
 s  t 

love that passes understanding



pie but- then i got my voice it
came up agin from my toes like water
in a pipe  you know-you cant marry
ruth i says you know you cant mar-
ry a woman thats married already i
said it straight up into his eyes his
face went red like the words had
slapped him and i seen the veins in his
neck jumpin

    there aint a court in the country
wouldnt free her from that brute he
begun but i stopped him  there aint
no court in the country can separate
what god has joined i says  and
there aint no man - no man in the
world that can stand up and say them
wicked things to me 

  the ancient unclasped his knees he
straightened them slowly like the blades
of a knife when they were straight-
ened he stood up his leaflike hands
trembled

   them wrere godless words he spoke
mirah and god will jedge him i
dont stand fur nothin like that its
in the good book plain-a child can
understand

   i told him so i told him no matter
what abner done he was ruths hus-
band and she couldnt be no other
mans

   then i told him to get out of the
house and never come in it no more
hes paid up till the end of the week
an ill give him back his money
but-

  the ancient nodded  you done
right mirah he said

  u he didnt say nothin for a minute
then he jes looked at me and says he
guessed the rest was something for him
and ruth to settle and he walked right
passed me then i went up to ruths
room but she wouldnt let me in she
was cryin under-the bedclothes i pre-
tended to go away but i come back
and listened and i heard her put an-
other piece of wood in the fire father-
the piell be soggy

  the ancient lifted the lid and tlmfct
a thick stick in the flames shot up
lighting his wrinkled face his gentle
blue eyes blinked when he had re-

placed the lid he held his thin hands
over the red-hot iron

   there aint never been nothin like
this in our family mirah i wonder
where she took it  

  for a moment the womans eyes
wandered to the rocker in the corner
her motherly shoulders hunched
something seemed to go out of her

   i never seen nothin in her like
him she answered  i tried to bring
her up right i stayed on till the end
no one ever knew i never went round
lettin folks see-

   you was a good dutiful wife mi-
rah like you been a daughter you
done your duty by peter like you done
by me youll git your reward the
lord dont furgit

  the woman got up wearily and went
over to the oven

   there werent no joy in it like
they talk about bein their right the
only joy wras the children ive took a
powerful comfort out of ruth and
then when her marriage turned out bad
like mine i wras glad that i could help
her bear it it seemed to me like i see
for the first time the lords reason in
givin me my cross-jes so i could help
her

   she ought to be awful grateful
mirah you didnt have no one all
them years she ought to be grateful
 she says i was foolish the
woman drew the golden pie from the
oven  i shouldnt hev stood it it
werent right

  the ancient blinked

  it werent right wliat werent
to stay and do the duty the lord had
laid on yuh aint the good book got
it plain enough-love them that de-
spitefully use you forgive seventy
times seven  

  the woman looked up from wiping
the bottom of the pie-plate

   some folks she began and then
stopped suddenly  theres ruth
cornin now dont say nothin-not
yit maybe shes been over to mar-
thas i kinder hoped she would when
she started marthall see somethin


the cavalier

was wrong and git it out of her in a

minute shell know what to tell her-
there aint anybodyshad more trouble
to stand by than martha

  the next moment a tall slim figure
blocked the fading light for a moment
as it passed the window then the
door opened and ruth came in she
took off her sweater and threw it into
a chair

   most supper-time isnt it w hat
shall i do 

  without waiting for an answer she
went straight to the pantry and brought
out a platter of cold meat and potatoes
she began hashing them standing at
the tar end of the sink-board at all
times she was strangely like a young
pine something strong and slender and
apart now she seemed distinctly sep-
arate encased in an almost palpable at-
mosphere of defiant pride and reserve
in her short skirt and white middy
blouse she looked many years younger
than thirty her six years of marriage
had left no mark in her eyes only
when she was tired the lines about her
mouth showed

   hows martha 

  the forced assurance in her mothers
voice annoyed her

   i dont know i didnt get over
she answered shortly the dead silence
waited like a cavern for her to fill it

  we went down to the crossroads and
back

   thats a tolerable walk the
ancient spoke kindly  did you give
captain fresh water

   oh i forgot ill-

   no no ill go

  the ancient got up stiffly and wrap-
ping a gray woolen muffler about him
went out the dull little taps of her
choppingf-knife were the only sounds
that broke the stillness the girl
looked at her mother she was stand-
ing with her back to the sink the girl
saw the bent patient back the half-
dozen golden pies the big batch of
bread the kettle of preserves waiting
to be bottled her eyes filled but she
forced the tears back

   aint abner back yet

   no he went down to the station
right after dinner

   did he say when he was cornin 
he said hed be back by supper
the girl glanced at the clock then
she put down the knife ami patted the
meat into little cakes when the last
cake w as patted she went into the pan-
try from the shelf under the small
window she brought two geraniums
and a wax-plant with delicate pink
blossoms she tended them silently
carefully clipping the dead leaves light-
ly turning up the mold as she pot-
tered with the plants the hard line
about her lips softened

   the locusts are all in bloom back
of the campbell place she said and
then closed her lips tightly as if she
would have shut the words back in
again

  her mother turned quickly

   y ouve-been-over to the camp-
bell place  

   yes

    aint yuh got  pride at all 

  a deep red crept under the girls
tanned skin but she did not answer

    i suppose they all seen yuh

    i dont care if they did 

   but i do and i tell you once fur
all i wont stand fur it do yuh hear
if vuh aint got no pride the rest of us
hev ive turned him out of this house
and i aint goin to hev you makin
yourself cheap runnin after him

  ruth breathed quickly but went on
wiping the outside of the pots

    i aint goin to stand fur no such
wickedness-

   wicked   the girl flared  it
aint wicked it cant be wicked to love
a good man like i love-

   watch out youre a married
woman ruth you-

   dont i know it do you think i
ever forget it for a minute day or
night do you think i can now i-
know-what-life might be now-
 youre crazy youre talkin like
a mad woman

    now i know that it aint all there
love that passes understanding



is in life to smother and starve and go
without things we was meant to be
happy if it aint that way why does
the sun shine and the birds sing and
the flowers grow  why does the moon
shine and the wind make you think
things you cant find the words fur
why-

youre tnad the sun and trees
and the wind a talkin if youd listen
to the still small voice inside yuh youd
have no time to hear the trees talkin
the girl stood sullenly

   he wont even let me keep these
where i can git the joy of em whats
wicked about a flower i didnt even
take his money to buy em they was
slips martha threw out

  the older woman sighed

   i know i guess he was made that
way hes always been closer than the
bark on a tree and the drinks made
him worse theyre hard things to
stand i know for-thirty years-
 hes a devil  the girl burst out
 he hates any one to be happy he
wants to hurt-hurt 

  mirah sanders opened her mouth
and then closed it glancing out of the
window she turned quickly

 youd better put em away ruth
hes cornin an his-hats on crooked
for a moment the girl hesitated
then she picked up the plants and car-
ried them back to the pantry

  as soon as the supper things were
cleared away ruth took the lamp and
went to her own room she locked the
door quietly and turned out the light
close by the window she sat looking
out into the night

  under the rising moon she could just
see the top of the white flag-pole on
the new campbell place down-stairs
the men were laughing and talking
from time to time some one played an
air on the graphophone in three weeks
it would all be over the men would
have gone tom would have gone
she would be alone with her mother
and the old man and abner ruth
shivered

  at last the noise down-stairs stopped
       c

the men went off in groups she
heard her mothers tired shuffling step
setting the table for the early break-
fast then the whole house rattled
it was the dining-room door shutting
it was perfectly still the girl sat
where shewas listening

  in a few moments a heavy uncer-
tain tread came up the stairs her hus-
band stopped outside the door and tried
the handle mumbling trembling she
scarcely breathed he stood there
mumbling for several moments then
lurched across the hall to the spare
room ruth heard him tumble heavily
onto the spare bed very soon he
snored loudly

  ruth opened the door and crept soft-
ly down the stairs the wind had come
up again and its moaning voice cov-
ered the creaking of the old door as she
slipped out into the night

  she walked rapidly through the
thick warm dust until she came to the
deserted farmhouse a quarter of a mile
up the road she turned quickly in
through the broken gate and cut across
the neglected orchard toward the red
farmhouse that was slowly tumbling to
pieces like some old person who has
lost all energy and self-respect even
the memory of better days

  from the tangled hop-vine over the
back porch tom dillon stepped for-
ward ruth went straight to him and
his arms closed about her he held
her close stroking her hair his big
hand trembled and the girl felt his
heart beating heavily

  she looked up running her fingers
lightly over his face

   i was afraid perhaps you couldnt
git out his voice shook

   i said id come

  the mans arms closed more tightly

   i know but i was afraid he-

  oh ruth shuddered hes
drunk dead asleep-in the front
room

  the man led her to the shelter of the
porch and they sat down the girl on
the lower step with her head against
him they sat silent


the cavalier

  in the shelter the wind came as a
soft breeze lightly moving the leaves
the silence the darkness the cool still-
ness shut them into a world of their
own the peace like a soft touch
soothed ruth the tangle of her life
straightened to primitive simplicity a
sensuous physical content crept over
her close to him with his hand pass-
ing lightly over her face and neck as if
to assure himself of her reality nothing
mattered

   ruth what are we going to do 
with an effort the girl drew her
mind away from the darkness beyond
where it was drifting lazily back and
forth with the moving leaves  do
-dont know-dear what can we
do

  the man stopped stroking her hair

   we-we-cant go-on like this
ruth we cant go sneaking round-
to meet each other we aint goin to
live like rats in a hole-afraid of the
daylight

  the girl -shifted her head a little on
his breast hear the leaves tom
aint they happy they sound like
babies laughin

   ruth-i love you so

  he buried his face in her hair her
mood made him clumsy inarticulate
filled him with a tenderness that hurt

   no-we cant go-on-but i cant
seem to think of nothin tom i been
tryin to all day she came slowlyback
 ruth-you do love me 

  she reached up and drew his face to
her and kissed him

   and you believe i love you 

  she laughed softly  i aint-so-
sure

  he bent her head back into the hol-
low of his arm and kissed her  now
do you believe it  

  they laughed irresponsibly child-
ishly

   theres only one thing we kin do
he looked away from the girl into the
blackness with set face  you must
come with me well go away any-
where you like somewhere where
theres lots of sun and flowrers all you

want and you can forget i kin make
you fergit dear

  she did not move

   ruth-will you come  his voice
shook beyond his control  we aint
called to kill the best thing in the world
dear-

   go away-and live-together-
without being married

   yes in the long silence a ground
toad plumped heavily  hell free you
then-hell have to

  the girl shook her head

  no-he wont hell never free
me i asked him once-a long time
ago-when he first began drinkin-
they dont know it-and he-he-

   what-did-he-

  the girl looked away

   it was a long time ago i fergit
wdiat he said exactly

 will-you-come the man
moved a little away as if instinctively
leaving her quite alone to make her
decision

  she did not answer she sat half-
turned looking into the night her
face was white and he could see her
whole body trembling lightly

   it aint wicked it aint id kill
any one that says it is we love each
other if there was any other way
god knows- if you didnt love me
id go away

  she bent slightly to him as if drawn
unconsciously

   you do i know it you dont be-
long to him you never did he
seized her suddenly by the shoulders
and turned her round  did you ever
kiss him-like you kissed me just now
-did you  

  the girls eyes dropped and even in
the darkness a faint red spread over her
face and neck

   its him that its wicked to live
with-not me

  she was looking back into the dark-
ness again

    i aint goin to live with him agin
-never-

   sweetheart the man caught her
to him  you will come well go
love that passes understanding



anywhere-somewhere where its big
and wide and clean well go out west
where the land aint all shut in with
these damned little fences-and the
people dont care as long as youre
honest well go out and live with the
god theyre all so afraid of i aint
afraid he wont understand

  the girl stared silent into the dark-
ness

   ruth-you aint ever been happy
you dont know what it is to be glad
and happy every minute youre alive
you-

  she turned swiftly  i-do-now
she said

  this this isnt happiness its
-hell  before the sudden fierce
passion the girl shrank back the man
stood up  i cant stand it ruth-i
cant i cant go on livin near you
sneakin out to meet you i want you
all the time i want to make you
happy i cant live and see that brute
go by and not want to kill him if i
stayed i believe id do it

   aint-i-told-you i dont love
-him 

   my god dont he live in the same
house with you cant he see you
whenever he wants whats to keep
you apart nothin but your will
and if that aint strong enough to bring
you to me-how do i know- his
face was white

   tom- the trembling hands
went out beseechingly

   ruth it was a sob  i dont
want to hurt i dont dear but there
aint no other way ill come over and
tell them-ill tell him-well have it
square and above board we-

  a light passed behind her eyes and
went out

   they-wouldnt-understand you
-aint-afraid of god-and other
folks-

   no he made no effort to take
her groping hands  i aint afraid of
nothing but myself but you-

  im not-im not-im not afraid
before the unyielding hardness of his
throttled passion the girl shrank back

 but-but- she groped blindly for
the words  itd-kill-her

   and me 

  the girls arms dropped helplessly
her strength crumpled

  he stood looking out beyond her
then he came and took her hands
gently the hardness and courage had
gone from him  come little girl
he said softly  i guess wed better be
goin

  she clung to him

   tom she whispered  i do love
you i do

  her yielding body invited his ca-
resses but he only patted her shoulder
comfortingly

   sure honey-i know it i guess
its were made different there aint
nothin in heaven or earth could keep
me away from you as he looked
down at the head against him his face
aged  come he repeated

  they went out through the gnarled
trees and down the road in silence at
the gate he bent and kissed her quietly

   good night ruth i wont come
-over-again-unless you send for
me ill stay on the job till the end of
the week and tim can finish

  before she could answer he had
gone she stood where she was until
he was lost in the blackness of the
road then she turned slow ly toward
the house she made no effort to walk
lightly the sagging porch creaked as
she crossed it the door rattled as she
forced it closed

  mirah sanders sat up in bed above
her pink flannel nightgown her white
face quivered

   she-couldnt hev done it-not-
ruth-gone-out to-meet him-at
night two big tears rolled down her
cheeks

  mirah sanders wiped the perspira-
tion from her face as she stood above
the hot stove stirring the bubbling fruit
ruth sat in the open doorway a dish-
pan in her lap peeling from a basket
of peaches

  outside in the warm stillness the


the cavalier

high thin voice of the old man piped
happily to the chickens from time to
time ruths hands dropped idle and
she sat looking out over the fields

  tom had her note he had had it
since early morning but he was going-
on with his work directing the men as
he did every day just as she was going
on with her work sitting there peeling
the peaches behind it was the knowl-
edge that she had never really peeled
peaches before

  she had never sat there in the hot
familiar kitchen she had never heard
the old man piping to the chickens
she had never seen her mother moving
heavily about wiping her face on her
sleeve testing the golding sirup with
the dripping granite spoon

  it was all new and strange but she
was not afraid she was not even
afraid now as she had been at first
she had stepped out of her old self as
if it had been a garment she could
almost see it lying on the floor where
she had left it

  in a few hours she would be under
the hop-vine with tom the last three
days stretched behind her like years
she went back along them as if she
were walking along an unknown road
into an unknown country her moth-
ers sharp call for more fruit brought
her back with a start she began
slicing quickly her mother watched
her for a moment and then pushed the
preserving kettle to a place where it
wouldnt burn and sat down looking
at ruth

   it aint any use pretendin she
said quietly  you aint got the least
notion what youre doin youre sli-
cin for marmalade an im puttin up
in halves

  ruth looked up and smiled there
was no answering smile the two
women sat looking at each other

    it aint no use ruth-we might
jes as well have it out 

  ruth dropped the peeling knife into
the peaches her hands shook but she
said nothing

   you aint had the least idea of

what youre doing she repeated it
slowly not since-two-nights ago
-when you-went chasm out-to
meet-that man

  the girl said nothing

   you aint got no pride i know-
that-now but aint-you got no
sense of wrong and right 

   it-aint-wrong i wouldnt have
done - it - if i thought - it was
wrong

   that aint true youd hev done
it anyhow i kin see it in your eyes
for the last three days youve been
goin about like a body asleep you
act like you didnt know what you was
a doin if the devil ever entered into
anybody hes in you ruth but i tell
you -for the first time the womans
voice rose in fierce conviction - i
wont stand fur it i-

  ruth stood up the pan of peaches
fell to the floor

   stop it  she said slowly  there
aint nobody or anything in heaven or
earth can stop a love like ours w icked
its wicked to live like youve lived all

taught me-all hungry and starved and
dead inside god didnt mean we was

bling hands seized her daughters arm
she shook her stop dont you
take the name of god in this wicked
business he-

  ruth drew back her eyes were
gentle

   mother-wasnt there never any
man-in all them long black years you
was tied to father-that made you feel
that you wanted-to thank god-that
he hadnt let you die

 stop before god strikes you there
with the w icked words in your throat

send some shame into you that youll
see whats right-

   i-do-see-it now the low
words ran into the simmering bubble
of the fruit  and im-goin to-

love that passes understanding



  mirah sanders leaned against the
table  you-you-

  ruths eyes answered her

   ive-got-to mother-there aint
no other way

  mirah sanderss face went gray
you-wont-never-do it-never
he-wont let-you before that-
the ancient came up the steps piping
gently to the sick hen under his arm
ruth turned and went quickly out of
the room the old man looked from
the scattered peaches to his daughters
face

  what is it mirah his dim
sweet eyes peered anxiously

  suddenly the woman began to cry
helplessly the old man put the
chicken on the table and came round
to her

   there there mirah youre a mite
tired with the heat been hevin it a bit
hard with ruth mebbe  he crooned
patting her shoulder

  the woman clung to him as if -she
were a child

   im afraid father im afraid she
-says-shes-going-with him

  the kindly look in the old face died
it grew stern

   mirah-there aint no need to be
feared he wont hold no sich cup to
your lips trust him daughter

  the woman choked back her sobs

   she-aint-like my own-some-
how- its like-as if i was-looking
at her a long-ways off i-cant-
touch her somehow

   but he can daughter hes got
her in the hollow of his hand

  he picked up the sick chicken and
carried it to his place by the stove
 youve been a faithful servant
daughter an his love passeth under-
standing

  as ruth left the house behind the
tumult in her grew madder for two
days she had lived in a frozen calm
outside herself thinking thinking all
her inherited traditions had risen up
and fought against her her longing
to see tom to be near him to make

him happy to be comforted-had beat-
en them down one by one

  the picture of her mother had been
the last to go again and again it had
come back through the night when she
lay trying to think calmly the stout
figure with the heavy rounded shoul-
ders going silently about the tasks that
had been hers w ith cutting sharpness
she saw her the pink calico blown about
her by the breeze catching the little
chickens for the night harnessing the
horse on village days taking in the
clean white clothes

  the pictures were gone now she
thought no more she could only feel
as she neared the deserted farm she
began to run she smiled at her own
eagerness she was half an hour earlier
than she had said in her note she
had a fierce joy in getting there first in
letting tom see her willingness

  as she walked quickly round to the
porch she was glad to see that it was
empty she sat down leaning against
the rail she took a deep breath of the
cool night and smiled the little breeze
played softly about her face it was as
gentle as the touch of toms fingers

  she blushed and knowing that she
blushed laughed aloud she felt young
and drunkenly happy while she wait-
ed she let her thoughts run on down the
future there were no clear pictures
in her she seemed to float on some-
thing that wrapped her softly warmly
about

  at last she heard him coming as
the steps neared the gate they broke
into a run with a sudden new shy-
ness ruth drew far back into the
shadow she waited both hands
clasped tightly she heard him breath-
ing quickly as he rounded the house
the next moment-tim carson stood
at the foot of the steps

   oh-i-was afraid you-wouldnt
be here-yet  the boy panted trying
to speak calmly

  ruth did not move she stood
staring at him

   i-say-dont look like that dont
get-frightened he-


the cavalier

  rutli bent and fastened her hands

like claws into his shoulders

   what-tell-me-

   there was an accident he had to
go to the village this afternoon and he
was on the trolley it was making time
and it smashed into the north-bound at
the station one man was killed and
t om-was-

  ruth passed him several yards be-
yond the house he caught up

   he-aint-so terrible - hurt - i
dont think- they were running
swiftly side by side

   havent-you-been-for the doc-
tor she spoke without slackened
speed

   he-wouldnt-let me he said-
i-wasnt to-if you wasnt there

  oh torn ruth spoke to her-
self forgetting the boy

  at the crossroads she stopped for a
moment  go-as fast as you can and
tell him to hurry bring him-soon

   toms in the coachmans room-in
the stable hes been living there-
since-since- ruth had passed be-
yond hearing

  tom was lying with his face to the
door as ruth dropped to her knees
beside him he tried to put his arms
about her but the pain made him cry
out as she felt him weak in her clasp
a great courage came to her she
stroked his face gently and whispered
softly she forced a smile into her
eyes tom tried to smile back

   i-guess - im pretty - badly-
hurt little girl-but-

  by a physical effort ruth kept the
fear out of her voice

   hush dear dont try to talk the
doctor will be here soon

  for a moment the man obeyed lying
heavily in her anus then he opened
his eyes  there-was one-poor
devil-killed ruth-he was on the
front-but-it might-have be-e-n-
me and then i-would never-have
known-

  the girl laid her cheek against his
i was there half an hour too soon
tommy

  the mans fingers closed on hers

  he did not speak again till the
crunching of the doctors buggy-wheels
broke the stillness

   maybe-youd-better wait-some
place else

    hush dear 

  she saw old dr phillips stop for a
moment in the door and she felt the
hot blood flame up under the surprise
in his eyes then his professional
manner masked his astonishment and
he came forward quickly when he
had finished his examination he nodded
to ruth and she followred himout

    hes pretty badly hurt but its not
fatal with good care-

  ruths shoulders that had been
braced as if for a physical blow
drooped

    ill send a nurse over as soon-

  no - doctor ruth looked
straight into his eyes  dont send
any one i shall stay

  the old man opened his lips and then
closed them they looked steadily at
each other then he took her hand
kindly  anything-i can do ruth 

  - yes

   she was silent such a long time that
the doctor asked again

   yes if you-wrould-just-go
up and tell mother-that im here and
that-im going-to stay i dont-
want her-to worry

   ill tell her ruthie the doctor
took both her hands in his

   as the old doctor drove slowly up the
road to the sanders farm he nodded
thoughtfully

    suppose mirah sanders will get
some kind of comfort out of tom
dillons being hurt in the same wreck
that smashed that drunken lout of a
son-in-law to bits but -dr phillips
sat up and jerked the reins with a
vicious pull-   be dog-goned if she
interferes with ruthie now

  the last faint scrape of the wheels
was dead in the stillness before mirah
sanders closed the door as she pushed
it heavily in its sunken frame the door
on the right of the hall opened the
the cloak of life



gentle face of the ancient peered out
his dim eyes dazed with sleep

   what is it mirah i thought i
heard something yuh aint sick are
vuh  

  no no she exclaimed it
warnt nothin father i thought i
heard captain loose go back dear
youll git cold

  the ancient man obeyed

  the woman went on to her own
room she did not get into bed but
sat huddled forward in a chair by the

the cloa

an all

a woman-child was born
into the world as the
rr f vj-g years passed she grew
up straight and fair
and the world loved
her and she loved it

   dear beautiful world she would
cry holding her arms out as if to em-
brace it  i love you 

  when the woman was young if the
winds blew roughly she would laugh
for joy - and why not-for they
tossed her long golden hair and she
was admired and admiration gives
warmth and warmth gives life

  besides she lived in a sunlit land
and her heart was glad just because
the birds sang the waves danced the
sun shone and the people looked at
her golden hair

  but the years passed and the woman
grew older

  her hair was not so thick nor so
golden now and many who had looked
passed by her path led away from
the sunlit land and she saw no more
the dancing waves

window staring into the blackness of
the apple-trees outside

  i might - hev known - he -
wouldnt desert me i ought to hev

trusted him better

  suddenly she began to cry softly
poor abner-he werent no way
ready-to face his lord-but the love
of god passeth all understanding it
ain t-fur-us-to jedge him now
and-it was hard-i stood it-fur
thirty years - and god knows-it
werent-easy

k of life

visscher

  now great mountain peaks frowned
upon her the birds sang not at all
or in solemn notes full of warning of
winter storms the mists on the
mountainsides were gray bleak
winds blew and the womans heart
grew cold

  she looked out  the world again
and it seemed so far from her she
was alone except for her dreams and
memories-of the sea the sunlit
dancing waves the happy singing
birds and the long days of golden
sunlight in a land so far away-and
even these treasured memories could
not fill the womans barren heart

  she was cold from the realities of
life and longed for the warm illu-
sions of beauty and happiness

  then it was that she cried to the
gods for a cloak-a warm long cloak
that its heavy folds might keep the chills
of disappointment from entering her
heart

  suddenly a shape stood before her
and said

   i come in answer to thy prayer for


the cavalier

the gods arc just thou shalt have
two cloaks to choose from look
well therefore and use wisdom in thy
choice for it is not given to mortals
to wear both

  the woman answered

   let me see them that i may con-
sider

  in one hand the shape held up a long
gray cape of the color of mists at sea
and in the other a gorgeous garment a
mantle that llashed changing colors of
every rainbow hue

  the womans fingers eagerly
plucked at this one and she clasped it
at her neck its ample folds draped
her tall form with elegance and grace

   oh let me wear this one  she
cried passionately  it is so beautiful
i shall always be happy now  then
she asked

   what is it called 

   it is the cloak of life answered
the shape  which is woven in many
different patterns

   but this one-tell me what does
its beautiful border of crimson roses
mean  

   they are the roses of romance
answered the shape smiling for the
woman was very innocent  the
brilliant thread with which they are
woven is dyed with the scarlet of cour-
age and passion no romance is real
without it closely interwoven in the
shadows is the purple of royal giv-
ing and at the heart of each flower is
a center made of a thread of pure gold
-the thread of imagination and hope
that runs through even the darkest
places in the web of the cloth of life
 then this is the cloak of ro-
mance said the woman dreamily
as she folded it closely about her her
eyes on the distant world

   yes again answered the shape
 oh i am so glad so happy for i
am hungry for romance how good
you are to give me such a beautiful
beautiful cloak i shall never be cold
again the woman said gratefully
her face aglow with joy and pride

   be careful of the cloak said the

shape warningly  it is beautiful

one of the most lovely of all the cloaks
life has to give but its gold is easily
tarnished and its threads are not
strong beware you will get cold
again if the fabric is torn

  then the shape vanished

  the woman wore the cloak and
the envious passers-by said

   look at the beautiful mantle that
woman wears its wonderful colors
are so skilfully interwoven that they
seem to soften as well as brighten the
pale beauty of her face see here
gleams a great golden butterfly and
there crimson roses with hearts of
flame and there-modest violets oh
the weaver of that lovely pattern wras
skilled yet it must have been the work
of years

  the woman journeyed on at first
her path led again into green valleys
she passed through meadows warm
with the sun and gardens so full of
flowers that their heavy perfume was
stifling and even the butterflies rested
in the drowsy air

  often the woman slept for sheer
weariness of so much warmth and fra-
grance in her sleep strange dreams
came some were happy some fright-
ful-all illusive as she sought to
grasp some beautiful flower more
beautiful than any she sawr in the gar-
den it faded before her eyes or a
stronger hand snatched it away some-
times she thought she heard jeering
laughter but she wasnt sure so much
of her life now was a dream

  once a black butterfly alighted on
the wronians shoulder at the same
time a cloud passed over the sun the
woman shivered for she thought it a
bad omen-although it was warm and
her cloak hung a heavy weight from
her tired shoulders

  then on she went through forest
glades and at last again into the
mountains her path was steep and
it grew rough and stony briars grew
at each side of it that tore at the long
folds of her cloak

  one day a storm came up it was
the cloak of life



dark lightning flashed  thunder rolled
and the wind blew in great gusts it
seemed a demon-possessed thing that
sought to tear the womans well-loved
treasure from her but she clung to the
cloak with cold-numbed fingers and
stumbling and bent struggled on

  at last she came upon a cave rent
in the mountains side and thought to
take refuge there the growl of a
mother panther drove her on again
she raised her clenched hands to the
dark hurrying clouds and suffering
wandered on

  the storm died away with distant
mutterings the sun shone again and a
rainbow spanned the sky-but the
womans strength was spent

  sadly she looked down at the cloak
she had worn so long-that neither the
warmth in the garden nor the tempest
on the mountains steep side had pre-
vailed on her to part with

  its beautiful colors were dimmed by
the sun and the rains and the winds
had whipped it to tatters even so
the burden of it was too heavy now for
her to bear

  slowly she unloosened the clasp-it
fell from her and lay a heap of faded
rags

  she sobbed and shivered and clasp-
ing her arms about her naked shoul-
ders bent her head in despair

  then she fell to her knees and prayed
again to the gods for a cloak-a warm
new cloak one that would protect her
from the storms of life and again
the shining shape stood before her

   i come once more o mortal in
answer to thy prayers thou art fav-
ored of the gods for i am sent to bring
thee another cloak wtiat wilt thou
choose this time 

   give to me i pray thee the wom-
an answered humbly without raising
her eyes  the cloak of the color of

mists at sea

  the shape shook out the soft gray
garment and gently folded it about the
kneeling womans form at her feet
lay a white lily with a golden heart

  what is this called asked the
woman

  and the shape answered

   this is the cloak of renunciation
it is woven in the neutral tints of lifes
commonplace duties but to brighten it
is the white thread of purity that
forms the pattern of a lily the golden
cup in the heart of each flower is filled
with loyalty and trust

    but what is it that shines like silver
and starlight 

   that is the dew of charity

   let me wear it prayed the wom-
an reverently then asked fearfully
 if i am worthy 

   yea thy desire has given it to thee
go in peace

  the woman walked her way and
the onlookers said

   that woman has a sad face but
her eyes speak of exaltation-and her
cloak is pretty at a distance it ismere-
ly the color of a fog at sea but when
she passes it seems radiant and flashes
like star-dust and see it is woven in
the pattern of a lily - the lily of
purity-and her feet do not touch the
ground strange woman 

  the woman walked among the tired
of life and everywhere some of the
silver star-dust fell-and it lighted the
paths of many

  she has passed out of sight but her
path now lies among the stars

                   a short story

        by eugene a vogt

  ahould your after-dinner
  cigar tail to please you
   will not be apt to miss
  the mark if you blame
  	water street new

york restricting yourself however in
justice to the rest of that thoroughfare
to the numbers ranging from eighty
to two hundred for it is on this
little stretch of street that most of the
tobacco used in the manufacture of
cigars in this country is distributed

   not only is this true to-day but this
has been the case for the past fifty
years for the most part too the same
old buildings still serve for the trans-
action of this trade and in that yellow-
front four-story veteran with the red-
dish-brown iron shutters and the brave
dark-green pillars in which to-day-
but never mind to-day for our story
deals with those who lived and labored
there fifty years ago

   into this building then stepped carl
dorn young and lusty with a face god
had made to look pleasant but which
now was so incongruously sad and
troubled that max piinsky the owner
of the establishment gasped involun-
tarily when he saw it but quickly re-
covering he greeted his visitor with
his usual heartiness

   hello carl yot brings you ofer
here 

   me  replied dorn lugubriously
 all vot i wish is i would of chumped
in der river on der way ofer max

   hoombook  retorted max with
a deprecating wave of his hairy hand
 sit down and tell me vot iss

  carl plumped down on a chair and

nervously twisted his hat out of shape
while max with the discretion of the
experienced business man waited qui-
etly until the voting man should be
ready to tell his story and at last it
came-a few broken spluttering cho-
king sounds

 max riegler  dorn is bursted 
the dealer still said nothing but his
face asked for details presently dorn
gained sufficient control of himself to
proceed

   riegler spent all der money mit
cards and womens ofer here in new
 ork while i sweated and worried ofer

there

  carl jerked his thumb toward eu-
rope but max knew he meant the little
town of williamsburg just across the
river the tobacco dealer placed his
hand on carls knee and his keen black
eyes bored into the young man s dis-
torted face but his expression was
kindly and sympathetic

   now dont get so excited right
away efery time you open der mouty
he said soothingly  tell me vot hap-
pened and how

  after carl had told him all he knew
about the causes that led to the disaster
and had summed up the meager assets
of the firm the merchant stared very
hard at a picture of abraham lincoln
hanging on the wall over his desk and
blew dense volumes of smoke at it

  carl scrutinized the others ab-
sorbed expression very much like a
convicted man regards the judge about
to sentence him and gave a sigh of re-
lief when max finally turned to him
with an air of positive settlement
trenton georges widow



   carl he said bruskly  you look
like der whole world collapsed inside
itself mit you in der middle when all
vot really did happen is a heldy hon-
est hard - working young man finds
himself six hundred dollars in debt

   aint that enough 

   no it aint enough  snapped
max  now aint no time to lay down
neither now is it the time to get up and
hustle lissen me now i tell you vot
you do you go back home and i send
you ofer a case of wrapper a case of
binder and five bales havana like you
had and you go to work and as you
get it so you pay it y understand 
 i understand max replied carl
with grateful tears in his voice  you
are a good friend from me but i cant
do it - i cant do it i haf no more
courage ill go to work for tom and
you get efery cent i owes you but-
max argued and raved and called
his young friend many bad names and
made uncomplimentary references to
the others mental capacity but carl
had the firmness of despair and noth-
ing could budge him

  that night carl went to his lieder-
kranz and tried to sing with them as
usual but they all noticed that he was
not the same old quietly jovial carl
dorn and after the rehearsal hermann
schulz dragged him into a quiet corner
for a serious talk

   der jews haf got you that is vot
is the matter declared the old man
violently

   no that is not vot is the matter
mr schulz

   well vot is the matter then you
are not yourself carl any one can see
that

    yes that is true i am not mcinself
my bartner schwindled me out of all i
had and left me with six hundred dol-
lars debts so i haf decided to go ofer
to new york and work at mein old
chob and save and pay the debt

   for why should you do that  in-
dignantly demanded schulz  aint all
your friends here aint hermann
schulz here yet now i tell you vot

you do to-morrow morning you
come by my blace and i will give you
one tousend dollars at six per cent for
as long as you want it you under-
stand 

   i understand but-

  hermann schulz fared no better
than had max and acted even worse
about it

  the very next day carl left his be-
loved williamsburg to live and labor
in the great city across the river then
his friends discovered the true reason
why the young man had declined all
offers of help richter the owner of
die deutsche heimath williamsburgs
most prosperous saloon and boarding-
house told every one who would listen
and every one told everybody else

  it was a matter of fatherly pride with
richter he wanted the community to
know what a sensible girl his tillie
was the little village had made up its
collective mind that carl and tillie
some day would marry each other a
conclusion fully justified by the openly
friendly relations of these two young
people

  but when carl advised tillie of his
business reverses and confidently asked
her to wait until he could mend his
shattered fortunes she rejected the
proposition with scorn she was a
wonderful girl proclaimed richter a
marvel of common sense which she
was she knew her fathers ideas as
to her marriage and simply avoided
trouble by settling the matter herself

  for two years carl worked steadily
in the big shop in new york lived fru-
gally and brought the bulk of his earn-
ings to max who accepted the money
with many disparaging and profane re-
marks carl grinned sheepishly while
max told him what an idiot he was to
be working for another when any man
of ability who started a cigar-shop at
this time would be rich in ten years

  max always wound up by insisting
that he would send over a case of wrap-
per and all that went with it but carl
still had the firmness of despair and


the cavalier

   quietly refused again to be lured into
   the fearsome maze of business

   at night alone in his room or on
sundays when the weather was fair
and balmy reclining on the grass amid
the solitudes of the inchoate central
iark the exile would hum a song he
knew a simple tender german ditty
that he and tillie used to sing together
so often in the dear old days the like
of which his yearning heart hoped soon
would come again and these were the
hrst two lines of that song of hope

        blan ist das blutnclcin

        das htisst v ergiss-nichi-mcin

  carl chuckled as he recalled how
tillie had laughed at his translation of
the sentiment of these two lines

        blue is the flower what

       has name forget-me-not

   the only dissipation carl allowed
himself was his single glass of beer
each night in dan mcgorrys saloon
to mcgorry this mild unobtrusive
young german was a curiosity his
quiet broken answers to questions his
gibraltarlike firmness in taking no
more than one drink and refusal to
treat or be treated and above all the
long-drawn-out manner he had of im-
bibing these few swallows of that inane
liquid simply caused dan and his
hibernian help to stand still and stare
in amazement

   before carls coming they had never
known that any one who drank at all
could linger so long over one glass of
insignificant beer and extract from its
insipid depths so much joy and satis-
faction

   at the end of these two years having
 finally liquidated his indebtedness to
 max carl began seriously to consider
 a visit to his beloved williamsburg
 but in his supersensitiveness he post-
 poned the visit from week to week
 realizing that each saturday found him
 better financially fortified to face the
 community-and tillies father and
 while he procrastinated the matter was
 settled for him

  for one monday night when dorn

 came into mcgorrys place as usual
 that bom leader of men grabbed his
 arm and hustled him into a little private
 office in the rear of the establishment
 when carl emerged from that room he
 knew that he had met his master and
 m a dazed way realized that the per-
 fection cigar company had been
 rushed into existence in those crisp ten
 minutes

   all that he remembered was that
 mcgorry had fired a string of brogue
 at him and occasionally stopping for
 jneath told carl to say yes and
 carl said it after the bewildered
 young german had repeated the mono-
 syllable four times mcgorry rose
 waved his huge hand and announced
 that it was all settled

   he instructed carl to meet him at
 nine the next morning and they would
 drive over to williamsburg and start
 things carl consumed two glasses of
 beer that night and every one who saw
 it knew that something very unusual
 had happened

    that next day carl never forgot as
 long as he lived mcgorry and he
 drove into williamsburg at ten and by
 eleven the whole town knew that the
 perfection cigar company had been
 precipitated into its midst

   by that time-among other things-
 the irishman had cursed the village for
 a living graveyard too man- times to
 keep account of almost started a row
 with badenser fritz who being sum-
 moned to fetch something to drink had
 suggested that despised german alom-
 ination beer absorbed seven drinks of
 whisky in a fruitless effort to find any
 in the forsaken village fit to drink
 rented a loft for the new shop ordered
 a sign painted almost burst a blood-
 vessel trying to make the editor of the
 local german paper understand what he
 wanted to say in a want advertisement
 for cigar-makers to be published in that
 journal and was back in his buggy
 flushed but smiling with his dazed part-
 ner at his side ready to drive over to
 max to buy tobacco for the new enter-
 prise
trenton georges widow



  that night carl who throughout
that whole strenuous day had longed
for a chance to tell tillie richter of his
great good luck went to her fathers
house and asked to see her mr rich-
ter became frigid at once tillie yes
he did recall the name but he had noth-
ing to do with the person bearing it

  from other sources carl learned
that one day tillie had disappeared
and that on the same day an itinerant
barber also had vanished and the com-
munity drew its own conclusions the
men were good-humored about it the
women indignant the girls curious
richter sullenly silent

  in two weeks the new factory was
in full swing mcgorry came over
ever sunday morning to look over and
stir things up on his fourth visit carl
timidly approached him in this fashion 
 mr mcgorry i-

   me names dan to me friends in-
terrupted mcgorry sharply  ive
tould ye that scicerial times

   sure i know stammered his part-
ner  well dan i would like to haf
a liddle money for meinself-about ten
dollars

   what for  growled dan

   well to bay mein board and so
mr-dan

  mcgorry pawed through the cash-
book for a few moments

   ye mean to tell me ye aint drawed
no salary  he demanded finally

 no i didnt know there was none
 well i must say ye are a regular
lamb fur inncence he drew a fat
wallet from his pocket and handed
carl eighty dollars

   theres four weeks salary now
ye draw twenty dollars a week d ye
hear  and im ready to come back to
life once more meaning that he
was ready to go back to new york

  after dinner john malby who had
been one of carls fellow workmen in
the big shop in new york came over
to see him john was out on a mission
of charity trenton george another
shopmate had died leaving his widow
and baby penniless and the cigar-

makers were taking up a collection for
her

  would carl contribute he would
he handed the collector two dollars
with many misgivings as to their ulti-
mate disposition he knew malby and
the general run of his kind and thought
ruefully of the number of saloons the
agent of charity would have to pass be-
fore he reached trenton georges des-
titute widow and child

  late that same sunday night carl
counted over his money in hand his
board was paid for the month his
wardrobe ample and he knew his daily
expenses would not aggregate over fif-
teen dollars a month he now had a
little over sixty dollars to these he
mentally added the twenty which mc-
gorry would pay him every week and
stood amazed before the net monthly
surplus his careful figures gave him

  besides there was his one-third of
the profits of the perfection cigar
company at the end of the year-mc-
gorry had said he would make him a
millionaire and now there was no
tillie and there never would be any
one else

  howt rich was he and how poor
trenton georges widow and her help-
less baby he looked out of his win-
dow at the great unsympathetic city
across the river and sighed for the for-
saken woman whom he did not know

  the next day carl opened a bank
account with his hoard and sent his
dead shopmates widow a check for ten
dollars three days later he was dazed
by the following acknowledgment

my dear friexd carl 

   i received the ten dollars and it feels like
a knife stuck in me but mrs huber the
lady across the landing says i must keep the
money for my sick baby i aint mad carl
and i hope you aint but one thing i cant
except any more money from you but
thank you for the ten dollars anyways oh
i hope my baby gets better soon

your friend

tillie warne

was tillie richter

  p s-blue is the flower what has name
forget-me-not remember how we used to
laugh 
sn

the cavalier

  carl dorn remembered how they

used to laugh

  and that day carl argued with him-
self as to the propriety and ojportuue-
ness of an immediate call oa trenton
georges widow she had not invited
him to do so had not as much as in-
timated a desire to see him she had
even written that she could accept no
more money from him but she had also
written that her baby was sick

   oh i hope my baby gets better
soon

  this cry of an anxious mothers
heart appealed to the young man who
read it for he w as worthy of his man-
hood not being sure of tillies ability
to read german and dreading to entrust
to his own weird conception of english
orthography so important a document
carl induced johnny the head stripper
of the perfection cigar company to
write a short english note for him in
which tillie was advised that the fifty
dollars enclosed were for the baby and
strongly intimating that  one of these
fine sundays  the sender would call
on her in person

  old father time went on his regu-
lar unrelenting way to some he
brought tragedy to others joy to most
of mankind nothing more than the
humdrum incidents of the average daily
life but to carl dorn lie brought the
worst he can bestow-suspense for
through all these anxious days and
weeks no answer from tillie came

  and at lat when dan mcgorrv
came over to the shop in williamsburg
on lhe fourth sunday after carl had
sent tillie the fifty dollars he found
carls cousin emil in charge emil
prided himself on his fine english ac-
cent but at that it took megorrjr three-
quarters of an hour to find out that his
partner had gone to new york that
morning the irishman was willing to
bet emil a new hat that carl was over
there gallivanting after some woman
but carls cousin refused to gamble

  dan would have won his bet had
emil been foolish enough to take him
up for at that very moment carl was

climbing four eights of stairs in one
of new forks earliest tenement-
honses his nostrils filled with the reek
of seven sunday dinners his legs
weary from walking his brain awhirl
from seeking and inquiring his neck
uncomfortable in a tight collar but his
heart beating time to a joyful song of
hope

  he knocked at the first door on the
right side of the uppermost landing
and the portly woman who opened it
gasped in astonishment at the well-
dressed apparition that politely in-
quired for trenton georges widow
no one by that name lived there
carl hung his head but recovered in
an instant and looked up with a bright
smile

   excoose me he said  but you
are mrs hoober  

  the lady sniffed and remarked kilv
no sir im mrs yoober me
husbands name is hoober but i aint
dutch ill have ye know

   excoose me repeated the be-
wildered young man  but and with
a hopeful smile pointed to the door
opposite  lives there tillie mit a
baby 

  mrs hubers eyes softened

   no tillies moved

   mooted  gasped carl
yes-right after the babys fu-
neral

  carl leaned heavily against the jamb
too stunned to speak

  yes poor girl proceeded the
woman  lost her husband first
though that was no great loss if the
truth was told and then her baby died
its a hard world for us women-these
tenements of new york

  carl still leaned heavily against the
jamb his light-brown eyes veiled with
the womanish tears his manhood was
trying to suppress mrs huber con-
tinued nervously

  tillie gavethe baby a grand fu-
neral she did said it was the last
tiling she coukl do for her and that
she needed no money for herself being
strong and able to work 
trenton georges widow



  the woman pausefl hoping the dazed
man before her would speak or groan
or cry out or curse his god or faint
or do some sane human thing to re-
lieve the tense agony that had made of
his face a mask of senseless stone but
he said nothing did nothing save
weakly nod his head and wreathe his
lips in the ghastly semblance of a smile
the woman shuddered and resumed
of course warne left her without
a cent and the cigar-makers associa-
tion paid for his funeral and gave her
fifteen dollars they had collected extra
then the baby took sick and tillie
spent the fifteen dollars when that was
gone somebody sent her ten dollars and
she spent that for doctors and drugs
but the baby died and that very morn-
ing she got fifty dollars from the same
party and she told me shed spend
the fifty dollars on the babys funeral
and then shed leave said she was
afraid the party thatd sent the
moneyd come over to see her and she
couldnt face him-you

   me  muttered the man stroking
his brow

   so we laid away the baby and
tillie left

  left repeated carl inanely
then he roused himself and asked en-
treatingly  but you know where she
is-you know where she is 

  mrs huber sadly shook her head

   no i dont know where she is
she gave me an address but when i
went there sunday before last shed
never been there at all they didnt even
know her

  carl reeled as he turned to go and
the woman steadied him with her
brawny motherly arms he grasped
her hand and wrung it

   tell her he stammered  if you
efer see her again she mustnt be frade
from carl-she mustnt be frade i
give you ntein address mrs hoo-
yoober tell her-tell her you seen
me and she mustnt hide from me
you know how i mean it mrs yoo-
ber  

  the woman nodded and gave his

hand a sympathetic understanding

squeeze

  the perfection cigar company pros-
pered prospered in three years to such
an extent that its principal owner de-
cided to move its factory to new york
besides he installed an office manager
a nephew of his tim oconnell and
this nephew had a sister nora bright-
eyed and care-free and the light of her
soul penetrated the gloom that sur-
rounded carl dorn worked its way
through it slowly but relentlessly

  a great saengerfest was to be held
in new york and nora had consented
to go with carl and he had made up his
mind to ask her the fateful question
that night and if nora consented he
would destroy tillies picture and try
to forget

  they sat side by side in that vast au-
dience and nora arrayed in dainty
white had never looked more entran-
cing which is saying a great deal for
the like of nora oconnell never look
less than entrancing at any time

  carl threw sidelong glances at the
beautiful face of the girl whom he
hoped to love as he loved tillie and
listened to the low rich tones of her
voice with a tender feeling in his heart
that he had never deemed it capable of
since he left mrs huber standing
on her landing three years ago

  at last he sighed hopefully the ghost
of tillie whom he had so diligently
sought was laid and then the band
struck up and the mass chorus of six
hundred male voices sang  my coun-
try tis of thee

  after the applause had subsided the
audience settled back in their chairs for
the second number of the program a
famous german soprano was to sing
 ave maria by schubert the house
grew still with fascination as the tender
notes of the song fell from the singers
lips and stayed still until the end
then the mass of humanity arose and
clapped and cheered the smiling
prima donna came out bowed and re-
tired a dozen times


the cavalier

  the thirteenth time however she

walked to the center of the stage and
stood erect while the tumult subsided
the leader of the orchestra raised his
baton and the orchestra played the
first strains of the song she had chosen
as an encore a shiver ran through the
stalwart frame of carl dorn as if
something which had been dead within
him was suddenly come lack to life
and then the soloist sang tillies song 

      binii ist dtis blumclcin

      das hrisst fergisk icht-meitt

  the next day nora said to her
brother with a well-simulated careless
laugh

   what do you think of a dummy
like that there he sat crying like a
baby all along of that little dutch song
the fat woman sung after they had
clapped her out and nary a word
did he speak to me all the rest of the
evening just sat there like a paralyzed
dummy

  from all of which may be inferred
that carl did not destroy tillies pic-
ture that night

  at the next meeting of the board of
trustees of the new yorker lieder-
kranz - the metropoliss leading ger-
man singing society-its members dis-
cussed the arrangements for that so-
cietys next grand concert and it was
unanimously agreed that the german
soprano of the saengerfest should be
asked to sing on that occasion

  the duty of seeing the diva devolved
on the chairman of the music commit-
tee mr carl dorn who was given
carte blanchc to secure the singers
services carl wrote the lady a letter
asking permission to call on her at her

hotel and promptly received a very

cordial invitation to do so that eve-
ning he sent up his card to the ladys
rooms and the bov returned and es-
corted him to the door behind which
the sacred presence lived

  carl knocked at the door his heart
palpitating with trepidation at the high
honor about to come to him

  a trim maid opened the door

  a few minutes later the prima donna
called impatiently from an adjoining
room

   tillie why do you not bring the
gentleman in 

  something in her maids agitated re-
ply made the diva rise and enter the
reception - hail the singer was no
longer young but still not too old to
understand the meaning of the scene
before her she smiled very pleasantly
at the confused and trembling maid

  u herr dorn she said and her tone
was exceedingly businesslike   re-
ceived your letter i am free on the
night of your concert my usual price
is five hundred dollars a night but on
that night i shall sing for nothing pro-
vided tillie has secured me another
maid

  tillie fell on her knees and hugged
the womans limbs

   you arc not angry at me then 
she cried  after all your kindness to
me but oh madam - he has been
true to me - unworthy as i am - all
these years and now he says he wants
me you will not be angry at me
madam m

   very angry said the elder woman
softly  unless you get up this instant
-and kiss me

why man of to-day
is only so per cent efficient

              by walter griffith

if one were to form an opinion from
the number of helpful inspiring and
informing articles one sees in the
public press and magazines the purpose
of which is to increase our efficiency he
must believe that the entire american
nation is striving for such an end-

  and this is so

  the american man because the race is
swifter every day  competition is keener
and the stronger the man the greater his
capacity to win the stronger the man
the stronger his will and brain and the
greater his ability to match wits and win
the greater his confidence in himself the
greater the confidence of other people 
him the keener his wit and the clearer
his brain

  the american woman because she
must be competent to rear and manage
the family and home and take all the
thought and responsibility from the
shoulders of the man whose present-dav
business burdens are all that he can carrv

  now what are we doing to secure that
efficiency much mentally some of us
much physically but what is the trouble

   e are not really efficient more than
half the time half the time blue and
worried-all the time nervous-some of
the time really incapacitated by illness

  there is a reason for this-a practical
reason one that has been known to
physicians for quite a period and will be
known to the entire world ere long

  rj hat reason is that the human system
does not and will not rid itself of all the
waste which it accumulates under our
present mode of living no matter how
regular we are the food we eat and the
sedentary lives we live even though we

do get some exercise make it impossible
just as impossible as it is for the grate of
a stove to rid itself of clinkers

  and the waste does to us exactly what
the clinkers do to the stove make the
fire burn low and inefficiently until
enough clinkers have accumulated and
then prevent its burning at all

   it has been our habit after this waste
has reduced our efficiency about  per
cent to drug ourselves  or after we have
become roo per cent inefficient through
illness to still further attempt to rid our-
selves of it in the same way-by drusr-

ging-

   if a clock is not cleaned once in a while
it clogs up and stops the same way with
an engine because of the residue which it
itself accumulates to clean the clock
you would not put acid on the parts
though you could probably find one that
would do the work nor to clean the
engine would you force a cleaner through
it that would injure its parts yet that is
the process you employ when you drug
the system to rid it of waste

  you would clean your clock and engine
with a harmless cleanser that nature
has provided and you can do exactly the
same for yourself as i will demonstrate
before i conclude

   the reason that a physicians first step
in illness is to purge the system is that no
medicine can take effect nor can the sys-
tem work properly while the colon  large
intestine is clogged up if the colon
were not clogged up the chances are 
to i that you would not have been ill
at all

  it may take some time for the clogging
process to reach the stage where it pro-
duces real illness but no matter how long

in anawcring thi adrcrfitu mmt il is dttlrailc thn gou mention the catalibb
the avalikk-advertising section

it takes while it is going on the functions
are not working so as to keep us up to
 concert pitch  ur livers are sluggish
we are dull and heavy-slight or severe
headaches come on-our sleep does not
rest us-in short we are about  per
cent efficient

  and if this condition progresses to
where real illness develops it is impos-
sible to tell what form that illness will

take because-

    he blood is constantly circulating
through the colon and taking up by ab-
sorption the poisons in the waste which
it contains it distributes them throughout
the system and weakens it so that we are
subject to whatever disease is most
prevalent

   i he nature of the illness depends on
our own little weaknesses and what we
are the least able to resist

   these facts are all scientifically correct
in every particular and it has often sur-
prised me that they are not more
generally known and appreciated all
we have to do is to consider the treat-
ment that we have received in illness to
realize fully how it developed and the
methods used to remove it

   so you see that not only is accumulated
waste directly and constantly pulling
down our efficiency by making our blood
poor and our intellect dull-our spirits
low and our ambitions weak but it is
responsible through its weakening and
infecting processes for a list of illnesses
that if catalogued here would seem
almost unbelievable

   it is the direct and immediate cause of
that very expensive and dangerous com-
plaint-appendicitis

  if we can successfully eliminate the
waste all our functions work properly
and in accord-there are no poisons be-
ing taken up by the blood so it is pure
and imparts strength to every part of the
body instead of weakness-there is noth-
ing to clog up the system and make us
bilious dull and nervously fearful

  with everything working in perfect
accord and without obstruction our
brains are clear our entire physical being
is competent to respond quickly to every
requirement and we are  per cent
efficient

   now tins waste that i speak of cannot
be thoroughly removed by drugs but
even if it could the effect of these drugs
on the functions is very unnatural and
if continued becomes a periodical neces-
sity

   note the opinions on drugging of two

most eminent physicians

   prof alonzo clark md of the new
york college of physicians and sur-
geons says  all of our curative agents
aie poisons and as a consequence every
dose diminishes the patients vitality

   prof joseph m smith m i of the
same school says  all medicines which
enter the circulation poison the blood in
the same manner as do the poisons that
produce disease

  now the internal organism can be
kept as sweet and pure and clean as the
external and by the same natural sane
method-bathing by the proper system
warm water can be introduced so that
the colon is perfectly cleansed and kept
pure

   there is no violence in this process-
it seems to be just as normal and natural
as washing ones hands

  physicians are taking it up more
widely and generally every day and it
seems as though every one should be
informed thoroughly on a practice which
though so rational and simple is revo-
lutionary in its accomplishments

   this is rather a delicate subject to
write of exhaustively in the public press
but chas a tyrrell md has prepared
an interesting treatise on  why man of
to-day is only  per cent efficient
which treats the subject very exhaus-
tively and which he will send without
cost to any one addressing him at 
west sixty-fifth street new york and
mentioning that they have read this arti-
cle in the cavalier

   personally i am enthusiastic on inter-
nal bathing because i have seen what it
has done in illness as well as in healthand
i believe that every person who wishes
to keep in as near a perfect condition as is
humanly possible should at least be in-
formed on this subject he will also
probably learn something about himself
which he has never known through read-
ing the little book to which i refer
