a short short story

by will garth

five of the men in the great room sat
quietly staring apprehensively at the
metal cylinder resting on the chromium
table the sixth man old harvey harris
stood by the window his eyes shut thought-
ful

  lean gray-haired dr samuels broke the
silence gentlemen he began his tones
crisp it has been two weeks since the dis-
appearance of our colleague hugo stone
stone is the worlds greatest expert on
atomics and it is a certainty that without
him we can never complete our machine for
delving to the center of the earth and
theyre asking a million dollars in radium
for his release-radium which we have but
which we need to drive our borer

  as dr samuels went on discussing the
kidnaping harvey harris scowled somber-
ly suppose it were he who had disap-
peared would his associates be as gravely
concerned  he wondered frowned he was
only a mathematician and could easily be
replaced he knew why he had been allowed
to work with the combine they were sorry
for him five years ago a laboratory ex-
plosion had almost killed him they had let
him stay on sympathetic but rarely had
they given him any work

  harris shrugged his frail frame yes if
he had disappeared the only one who would
miss him would he his faithful assistant
connors understanding connors who took
all his dictation even read aloud to him
about the wonders of the heavens for
astronomy was harris hobby

  samuels was still speaking this cyl-
inder landed on earth yesterday its con-
tents a strip of movie film which proves
that the efforts of the interplanetary po-
lice are in vain    that stone is captive
on a space ship past saturn how the kid-
napers were able to get out that fr in two
weeks i dont know pursuit is hopeless
for it would take our fastest ship about a
month to reach that vicinity its bad news
just when we had a tip that stone was be-
ing held captive on earths moon

  as dr samuels motioned to an attend-
ant the lights dimmed and a movie pro-
jector snapped on its image cast on the
great white walls first the men saw earth
receding in space then the familiar firma-
ment

  from the sound-track came the kid-
napers voice his tones disguised

  were nearing saturn    you can see
by the relative position of jupiter as seen
from titan one of saturns moons that
we have your man somewhere around
here then came a close-up of stone his
features imploring

  thats right cried samuels you can
see several of saturns moons sweeping
past to the right like metal balls to a mag-
net rhea tethys hyperion phoebe-did
you see them all scoot by stone is out
there all right and wed better pay up
but harvey harris interrupted i
wouldnt advise doing so samuels he said
quietly the police are probably right and
i wager theyll find stone on our own
moon examine that movie film closely and
youll discover its a clever fake manufac-
tured with miniature models those pictures
were never taken in space

  what  didnt we see the moons-
yes continued old harris but the
kidnapers made one mistake you said you
saw all the moons speeding in one direction
past titan but any astronomer will tell
you that nine of saturns moons revolve
one way-normally but the tenth-phoebe
-revolves in retrograde transit in the op-
posite direction from the others our kid-
napers forgot that simple little fact say-
ing so harris reached for the door he
smiled wistfully to himself old was he
useless thank god he knew his astron-
omy

  dr samuels turned to the other mem-
bers of his staff ironic men isnt it he
said slowly that we who have eyes didnt
see what harris-blind since that explosion
-realized in a moment maybe weve been
blind for five years

three husky and very choice stories fill
up the bulk of our annual anthology for

entire field of science fiction one of them-
our novel-twice in time by manly
wade wellman is as its title reveals a tale
of time-travel jack williamsons short novel
the alien intelligence is a lost-
world epic-while eando binders novelet
the chessmen of mars is a saga ol
space-travel

  time travel-lost world-space travel-these are the very
warp and woof of which science fiction is manufactured and
each is cut out of toploom fabric and woven cunningly and with
great style mr wellmans novel along with its fine science
fiction offering gives the reader a further bonus in the form of a
vivid and learned picture of one of the most exciting eras in the
human past-the italian renaissance

  mr williamson had his imagination turned on full blast when
he composed the alien intelligence-and the result
is a high-tension story whose color and clarity of description and
action make it horrifyingly real and the binders plotted their
novelet with all of the shrewdness and talent that kept them for
so many years up near the top of the science fiction totem pole

  rather than run a miscellany of shorter stories of varying
quality we have decided to publish these three longer stories
unabridged as they are just about the best in their particular
fields of science fiction wonder story annual we are

time travel stories
are probably as
old as science fic-
tion itself-which
means they go back
approximately to the
ark in their more
primitive forms the
protagonist or hero is
usually sent into the
future there to fore-
tell what lies ahead
both for himself and the reader

  the desire to know whether war will or 
will not come next week whether that
nag will cop the sixth at hialeah or what
amalgamated zinc is going to do on the
market is a human universal

  however in its more sophisticated pat-
tern the time-travel tale usually denies
such acquisitive yearnings by moving into
the far more intricate and exciting pattern
of the past here a number of questions
must be faced and answered which give
pause to all but the ablest of story
weavers

  for instance if the past has happened
how can its pattern be changed without
alteration of past and present alike what
occurs when a time-traveler encounters
his younger self or his parents and an-
cestors and lastly if any persons have
traveled from the future into our his-
torical past-why dont we know about
ii

 in one way or another-always cred-
ibly always with that apparent easy fluid-
ity which is the invariable sign of the fine
professional-mr wellman meets all the
above challenges in what is to us just
about the most stirring story of its type we
have ever read-twice in time this
is one story of time-travel that instead of
being limited by its gadgetry achieves
the full-bodied richness of the renaissance
itself	-the editor

hope of helping war sufferers if his
aid should be needed but since italy
remained neutral he sent back most
of his luggage to america by a
friend

  later he sent an urgent letter ask-
ing that this manuscript be exam-
ined and published if possible it
came father sutton said from the
strongroom of an immemorial theo-
logical library in florence and was
in the original casket that had ap-
parently contained it for a long
period of time

  the priests friend brought -us
both father suttons letter and the
casket with the manuscript this
casket is of tarnished silver elabo-
rately worked in the renaissance
manner a plate on the lid bears
this legend in italian french and
latin

  let no man oven or dispose of this
casket on peril of his soul before the
year 

  father suttons new york friends
insist that if he actually wrote the
letter and sent the casket they may
be taken at face value if it is a hoax
perpetrated in his name it is both
elaborate and senseless in any ease
it is worth the study of those who
love the curious

  therefore while neither affirming
nor denying the truth of what ap-
pears herewith is given in full the
purported statement of the vanished
leo thrasher

chapter i

tomasulos inn

this story as unvarnished as i
can make it must begin where my
twentieth-century life ends in the
sitting room of the suite taken by
george astley and myself at toma-
sulos inn on a hill above the arno
it is the clearest of all my clouded
memories of that time april was
the month still chilly for tuscany
and we had a charcoal fire in the
grate i knelt among my dismantled
machinery before the charcoal fire
testing the connections here and
there

  so thats your time-traveler
thrasher said astley like the
one h g wells wrote about

   not in the least like the one h g
wells wrote about i said spiritedly
and not pelhaps without a certain
resentful pride he described a
sort of century-hurdling mechanical
horse in its saddle you rode for-
ward into the judgment day or
back to the beginning this thing
of mine will work but as a reflector

t peered into the great cylindri-
cal housing that held my lens a
carefully polished crystal of alum
more than two feet in diameter i
smiled with satisfaction

  it wont carry me into time i
assured itll throw me

  george leaned back in the easy
chair that was too small for him
i dont understand leo he con-
fessed tell me about it

  all right-if i must i said i
had told him so often before it
was a bore to have to repeat what a
man seemed incapable of under-
standing the operation is com-
parable to that of a burning-glass
i explained patiently which in-
volves a point of light and transfers
its powers through space to another
position here-i waved toward
the mass of mechanism-is a de-
vice that will involve an object and
transfer or rather relate it to an-
other epoch in time

least enough to think of time as an

  extra dimension ventured astley
  but still i dont follow your rea-
  soning you cant exist in two places
  at once thats impossible on the
  face of it yet from what i gather
  you can exist you have existed
  in two separate and distinct times
  for instance youre a grown man
  now but when you were a baby-
  thats the fourth dimension of
  it i broke in the baby leo
  thrasher was in a way only the
  original tip of the fourth-di-
  mensional me at ten i was a cross-
  i section now im another six feet
  tall eighteen inches wide eight
  inches thick-and quite some more
  years deep i began to tinker with
  my lights do you see now

    a little astley had produced
  his oldest and most odorous pipe
  you mean that this present mani-
  festation of you is a single corridor-
  like object reaching in time from the
  place of your birth-chicago wasnt
  it-to here in florence

    thats something of the truth
  i granted my head deep in the great
  box-like container that housed the
  electrical part of the machine i
  exist therefore only once in time
  but suppose this me is taken com-
  pletely out of twentieth century
  existence-dematerialized recreated
  in another epoch that makes twice
  in time doesnt it

 as i had many times before i
 thrilled to the possibility it
 was my fathers fault all this labor
 and dream i had wanted to study
 art had wanted to be a painter
 and he had wanted me to be an engi-
 neer but he could not direct my
 imagination at the schools he se-
 lected i found the wheels and belts
 and motors all singing to me a song
 both weird and compelling the
 machine age was not enough of a
 barrier to me

    i demanded of it other wonders-
  miracles

    ive read dunnes theory of cor-
  ridors in time astley was musing

and once i saw a play about them
-by j b priestly wasnt it
whats your reaction to that stuff
thats one of the things i hope
to find out about i told him of
course i think that theres only the
one corridor and im going to travel
down it-or duck out at one point
i mean and re-enter farther along
what id like to do would be to re-
appear in florence of another age
florence of the renaissance
astley nodded he preferred the
french gothic period because of the
swords and the ballads but he un-
derstood my enthusiasm for renais-
sance italy-to me the age and
home of the greatest painters poets
philosophers of all times

  then what he encouraged me
gaiping interest

  ill paint a picture-a good one
i hope a picture that will properly
grace a chapel or church or gallery
a picture that will be kept for four
centuries or more preferably it
will be a mural that cannot be
plundered or destroyed without tear-
ing down a whole important build-
ing when its finished ill come
back to this time to this hour al-
most of course ill have to build
myself a new time-reflector where
i am because it will be impossible
to take this one with me

  and well go together to the
chapel or church or gallery and look
at your work of art asked astley
he lighted his pipe it will be your
footprint in the sands of another
time isnt that what you mean
exactly evidence that ive been
twice in time i sighed with a feel-
ing of rapture because for a
moment i fancied the adventure al-
ready accomplished if im not
able to do a picture i told him
ill make my mark-initials or a
cross cut it in the plinth of a
statue scratch it on the boards at
the back of the mona lisa or other
paintings that i know will survive
it will be almost as good a proof
i smiled however i daresay
twice in time



theyll let me paint i have a gift
that way

  perhaps because youre left-
handed astley smiled at me
through the blue smoke but one
thing-in renaissance italy wont
your height and buttery hair be out
of place

  not among fifteenth-century
tuscans i said confidently there
were many with yellow hair and
blue eyes look at the old floren-
tine portraits in any art gallery
look at the streets of florence to-
day not all of those big tawny
people are foreigners

  as i talked i was reassembling
my machinery that we had brought
with great care from my native
america to this spot that i had
long since chosen as the obvious
place for my experiment the ap-
paratus took shape under my hands
the open framework six feet high
as many feet long and a yard wide
was of metal rods painstakingly
milled to micrometric proportion in
germany

  at one end on a succession of
racks was arranged my ray-genera-
tor with its light bulbs specially
made with vanadium filaments in
america my camera-like device
which concentrated the time-reflec-
tion power had been assembled from
parts made by english german and
swiss experts and then there was
the lens of alum with its housing
as big and heavy as a piece of
water-main which i now lifted care-
fully and clamped into place at the
front of the camera

  astley stared and drew on his
pipe it was plain enough that he
looked tolerantly on all my labor as
well as my talk and that he be-
lieved the whole experiment was
something of which i would quickly
tire however he had been com-
plaisant enough about coming with
me and lending what aid he could
to my secret experiment

  that business youre setting up
there looks like the kind of thing

science fictionists write about he
said

  its exactly the kind of thing
they write about i assured him
as a matter of fact science fiction
has given me plenty of inspira-
tion and more than a little infor-
mation while ive been making it
but this is practical and material
astley not imaginary

  he had not long to wait to witness
the truth of that though his phleg-
matic nature could never have un-
derstood the tenseness that was mak-
ing my nerves taut as a spring trap
i knew however that nerve strain
was to be expected for i was near-
ing the actuality of the experiment
to which i had long given my heart
and soul i said nothing more be-
cause now within the tick of
seconds i would know whether my
dream could be reality or if in fact
that all i had toiled and anguished
for-was but a dream

t am not sure-how could i be cer-
tain-whether my hands were
steady when the great moment came
i know vaguely that my hands did
reach out-

  i pressed a switch at the other
end of the framework there sprang
into view a paper-thin sheet of
misty vapor like a piece of fabric
stretched between the rectangle of
rods i could be excused for the
theatricality of my gesture

  behold the curtain i said
when i concentrate my rays upon
it all is ready i need only walk
through i stepped back five
minutes for it to warm up and im
off into the past

  i began to take off my clothes
folding them carefully-the tweed
suit the necktie of wine-colored
silk i can be reflected through
time i said with a touch of whimsi-
cality but my new clothes must
stay here and more seriously i
cant count on molecules to approxi-
mate them at the other end of the
business

  you cant count on molecules to

approximate your body either
challenged astley

  i knew that he was not as stolid as
he was trying to appear for his
pipe had gone out and he was filling
it and i could see that his hands
shook a trifle he was beginning to
wonder whether to take me seriously
or not unimaginative astley

  all my diggings into old records
at the biblioteca nazionale over in
town have been to find those needed
molecules i told him look at
those notes on the table beside you
he turned in his big armchair-
it was none too big for him at that
-and picked up the jumble of
papers that lay there youve
written a date at the top of this
one he said as he shuffled them
 april thirtieth fourteen-seven-
ty and below it youve jotted
down something i dont follow-
mithraic ceremony-rain prayer-
ox on altar 

  which sums up everything i
said pulling off my shoes right
here-right at this inn which i
hunted up for the purpose of my ex-
periment-a group of cultists
gathered on april thirtieth four-
teen-seventy just four hundred and
sixty-eight years ago today i
leaned over to look at the time gauge
on my camera im set for that
exactly

  cultists repeated astley whom
i knew of old as apt to clamp men-
tally upon a single word that inter-
ests him what sort of cultists
contemporaries called them
sorcerers and satanists i told him
but probably they had some sort of
hand-me-down paganism from old
roman days something like the
worship of mithras at any rate
they were sacrificing an ox on that
day trying to bring rain down on
their vineyards

  	charles godfrey leland in his important
work aradia or the gospel of the witches
of italy trapes connections between witch-
craft and the elder pagan faiths of rome

  i have figured it out like this-

if they needed rain then that par-
ticular april thirtieth must have
been bright and sunny ideal for my
reflection apparatus they had an ox
on the altar and from its substance
i can reassemble my own tissues
to house my personality again the
original molecules must of course-
have been dissipated somewhere
along the route of the process in
time is that all clear

  astley nodded slowly and i stood
up without a stitch of clothing a
pier-glass gave me back a tall pink
image lank but well muscled
crowned with ruffled hair of tawny
gold

  well old man i said with what
nonchalance i could manage though
every nerve in me was tingling
the machinerys humming here i
step into the past

my companion clamped his
pipe between his teeth but did
not light it again i could still see
the disbelief in his eyes

  i hope you know what youre
about and wont do yourself much
damage with that thing he
grumbled putting yourself into
such a position isnt like experi-
menting with rats or guinea pigs
you know

  i havent experimented with rats
or guinea pigs i informed him and
stepped into the open framework

  i turned on another switch and
through the lens of alum flowed an
ice-blue light full of tiny flakes that
did not warm my naked skin

  as a matter of fact i said in
what i was sure was a parting mes-
sage ive never experimented with
anything astley old boy you are
about to see the first operation of
my time reflector upon any living
organism

  astley leaned forward concern at
last springing out all over his face
if anything happens he protested
quickly your family-

  i have no family all dead
flexing my bat-wings i sprang from
the eaves of the house
chap xii

 with lifted hand i forestalled what
 else he was going to say goodbye
 astley tomorrow at this time have
 a fresh veal carcass or a fat pig
 brought here thats for me to ma-
 terialize myself back

   and i stepped two paces forward
 -into and through the misty veil

    at once i felt a helpless lightness
 as though whisked off my feet by a
 great wave of the ocean glancing
 quickly behind me i momentarily
 saw the room and all in it but some-
 how vague and transparent-the
 fading image of the walls the win-
 dows my openwork reflector-ap- 
 paratus astley starting to his feet
 from the armchair then all
 vanished into white light

 that white light beat upon me
  with an intensity that was sick-
 ening i tasted pungency my fibers
 vibrated to a humming bruisjng
 rhythm

   there was a moment of hot pain
 deafening noise a glare of blinding
 radiance

   then peace lassitude something
 seemed to materialize as a support
 under my feet again i saw the
 transparent ghost of a scene this

time full of human figures that
too thickened and i heard many
voices chattering excitedly then all
was color life reality

  one voice dominated the others
speaking in resonant italian the
miracle has come

chapter ii
the first half hour

at those words all fell silent
and gazed at me in awe it
seemed unbelievable but all this was
happening to me in the back yard of
-yes of tomasulos tavern it was
a changed back yard though domi-
nated by a simpler newer building

  i seemed to have trouble with my
memory it lagged as though i had
been stunned and the differences
helped to confuse me here were no
flagstones no clutter of innkeepers
jetsam-only a level stretch of turf
hedged around with some tall close
bushes of greenery and my audi-
ence was grouped below rather than
before me i seemed to be standing
high on a platform or pedestal of
cut and mortared stone

  the altar of the ox-sacrificing
cult i had made the journey back
through time from a twentieth cen
tury that just now hung dim and
veiled in my mind like something i
had known in childhood instead of
brief seconds ago

  kneel intoned the same voice
that had hailed me as a miracle

  at once the group before me
dropped humbly down there were
a dozen or so of both sexes most
of them shabbily dressed the men
wore drab or faded blouses and
smocks with patched hose on their
legs the women were untidily
tricked out in full skirts bodices
and coifs or caps men and women
alike wore long hair and several
were as blond as myself

  i was quite evidently taken for
some strange manifestation of the
god or spirit they worshiped realiz-
ing this i felt that i had an ad-
vantage i sprang lightly down from
the altar

  do not be afraid i told them in
my best italian rise up which
is the chief among you

  they came to their feet in a shy
group around me and the tallest of
them moved forward i am master
of this coven he murmured re-
spectfully fixing me with shrewd
calculating eyes what is your
will

  first lend me that red cloak of

yours

  he quickly unclasped it from
about his throat i draped it over
my nakedness and felt more assured
before this mixed audience

  now i continued hark you
all did you worship here because
you sought a miraculous gift from
heaven

  not from heaven exactly said
the man who had given me his cloak

  he was the best clad of the entire
group wearing plum-colored hose
and a black velvet surcoat that fell
to his knees his narrow waist-he
was an inch taller than i and gaunt
as a rake-was clasped by a leather
belt with a round silver buckle

  his sharp face was decorated by
a pointed beard of foxy red and
above this jutted a fine-cut long
nose his eyes so intent upon me
were large and deep the wisest eyes
i had ever seen his broad brow
from which the hair receded as
though beginning to wear away was
high and domed

  there was something about him to
suggest shakespeare - shake-
speares face that is much more
alert and enigmatic than generally
pictured and set upon the body of
ichabod crane i describe him thus
carefully because of the impression
he made upon me then and because
of the importance of the role he has
since played in my life and career
twice in time



  not from heaven he said again
rather from our father in the
lowest he gestured downward
with a big but graceful hand why
do you ask have you not been
sent by him

  this was a definite challenge and i
made haste to simulate a grasp of
the situation with an effort i re-
membered the study i had made of
this very incident the prayer of a
sorcerers cult for rain on april
 

  i am sent as your friend i an-
nounced this ox which you have
offered-

  i gestured behind me toward the
altar then turned to look the stones
were bare save for a slight dark
moisture i paused thought quickly
and went on

  this ox which you have offered
has been transmuted into me so that
i may be your friend and guest
there was more truth in that than
my interrogator in the velvet sur-
coat thought i told myself
triumphantly but i did not know
him yet i also congratulated my-
self that there had been an entire
ox for my time reflector seemed
to have left little of it after the
process of reassembling

  as to the rain i finished that
will come doubt it not for i had
seen on the horizon beyond the
lowest stretch of hedge a lifting
bank of cloud

 thank you oh messenger
breathed an elderly cultist at my
side thank you thank you came
prayerfully from the others

  the lean spokesman bowed a little
but i could discern the hint of a
growing mockery in those deep
brilliant eyes

  your visit is far more than we
poor worshipers had the presump-
tion to hope for he said silkily
will you suffer these servants of
the true belief to depart and will
you come with me to my poor dwell-
ing yonder

  i nodded permission and he spoke

briefly in dismissal of the others
they retired through a gap in the
hedge respectfully but without the
awe a miracle might be thought to
call forth i was surprised even a
little piqued then the rationaliza-
tion came to me

  this was the fifteenth century
and the people were more naive
more credulous they had come to
this strange ceremony in expecta-
tion of a wonder and when it
came-even when there was more
than they had hoped for as my
volunteer host suggested-it did not
prostrate them with emotional
amazement i was strange but i was
understandable

hen the last had departed i
faced the gaunt man i have
compared his body to that of icha-
bod crane but he was surer of his
long limbs than the schoolmaster of
sleepy hollow indeed he seemed
almost elegant with his feet planted
wide apart and one big hand
bracketed upon a bony hip

  how are you called i asked
him

  my name is guaracco he said
readily the master i say of the
coven which has just done worship
here but if you are truly a mes-
senger from him we delight to serve
why do you know not these things
without my telling

  a sneer was in his voice and i
felt that i had best establish my
defenses

  ser guaracco i addressed him
bleakly you will do well to show
courtesy to me i did not come here
to be doubted

  assuredly you did not he
agreed with a sort of triumphant
good humor that yet made me un-
easy and now once more will
you come with me into my home
he made another of his graceful
gestures this time toward the back
door of the stone house that i knew
for tomasulos inn-at least for
what would one day be tomasulos


wonder story annual

inn i nodded agreement and we
walked together across the turf to
the door

  that thought of mine-for what
would one day be tomasulos inn
it behooved me to learn a new pro-
cession of thought one that came
two ways to the present i must
remember not only from the past
but from that future four centuries
off

  i clarified the puzzle by calling to
mind a fragment of conversation in
through the looking-glass it read
like this i remembered its a poor
sort of memory that only works
backwards the white queen had
said that and later sometimes
ive believed as many as six im-

fossible things before breakfast
had never before realized the deep
scientific philosophy of that delight-
ful story meanwhile it might help
clear the fog that hung so per-
sistently in some chambers of my
mind

 my new acquaintance tapped
softly on the door which opened at
once upon the threshold stood a
tiny male creature in a dark gown-
like garment he was no larger
than a child of nine and the bright
face upturned to us might have
seemed sweet if it had not reminded
me of guaraccos

  is this your son i asked my
host

  he laughed quietly

  yes ambassador of the powers
below in some degree this is my
son

  the little figure stood courteously
aside and let us step into a dark nar-
row corridor guaraccos hand
touched my arm through the folds
of the borrowed cloak and i allowed
myself to be guided down the pas-
sageway into a room beyond

  here were dark decent hangings
a thick carpet chairs a settee and a
table on which lay some bulky and
ancient-looking books a single fat
candle in a bronze sconce illuminated
the room for there was no window

-only a barred air-hole at the top
guaracco invited me to sit down
with a sweep of his hand toward
the settee

  i will offer you refreshment
he announced and clapped his hands

  from behind the hangings evi-
dently from a shadowed compart-
ment beyond darted a figure as
small as the one that had admitted
us to the house but this one was
hunched and misshapen with a
pinched and aged-looking face set in
the loose high collar of its gown

  in its long knob-knuckled hands
was held a tray with a silver flagon
and two goblets of blue glass this
tray was set upon the table then the
small figure made a quick exit with-
out looking back i had been unable
to judge sex or age in the brief
moment of the small ones presence

  guaracco carefully poured red
wine from the flagon you do not
ask he commented smoothly if
that was another of my sons

  i made no comment for i could
think of none instead of growing
clear my memory was becoming
more scrambled and it worried me
there was also a definite taste of
menace in the atmosphere guaracco
lifted one of the goblets and held
it toward me

  he was as much my son as the
other he said take this one am-
bassador i daresay you will never
drink another draught like it

  i took the goblet and he lifted
the other

  i give you a toast he said in a
voice that suddenly rang with fierce
mockery sir your immediate
transportation to the floor of hell-
the very place from which you ly-
ingly claim to be sent

  it was too much i rose quickly
and set down the goblet on the table
my left hand with which i am
quickest and handiest doubled into
a fist

  ser guaracco i said harshly
i have had enough of your dis-
courtesy you doubt my being of an-
twice in time



i constructed a really workable distillery in my prison celt chap xvi

goblet down beside mine again he
struck his palms together twice

  from the entrance to the passage
darted the pretty little keeper of the
doorway from the opening behind
the hangings sprang the withered-
looking bringer of wine each held
a long thin blade curved like a
scimitar and plainly as keen as a

he said you had best make con-
fession of your motives

  confession i echoed amazed

  exactly oh miracles have hap-
pened upon that altar before this-
but it was i guaraceo who taxed
my brain and my machine-shop to
prepare them now you come with-
out my knowledge or leave i do not

other world even though you saw
me appear from the very substance
of the ox upon the altar so-
enough of that falsehood he in-
terrupted

  quickly but delicately he set his

razor they closed quickly in upon
me their eyes glittering cruelly

  guaracco laughed calmly the
laugh of one who makes the final
move in a winning game before
my familiars cut you into ounces

where it concerns those few foolish
witch-worshipers out with your

chapter iii
the service of guaracco

i cannot but be ashamed of the
way i broke down i might have
faced out the surprise-i might have
defied the danger together they
overwhelmed me then and there
with guaracco leering at me through
his red beard with the two dwarfs
who no longer seemed like little
children standing with swords
ready to slash me to death i told
the truth as briefly and simply as
possible

  guaracco heard me out interrupt-
ing only to ask questions-most in-
telligent questions when i had
finished he nodded slowly and sagely

  i know that you will refuse to
believe- i began but he inter-
rupted

  but i do believe he assured me
in a tone surprisingly gentle i be-
lieve lad and in part i understand
my understanding will be made per-
fect as we discuss things more fully

  he snapped his big fingers at the
dwarfs they lowered their swords
and with a jerk of his head he dis-
missed them through their respec-
tive doors immediately there was
less menace in the atmosphere i
felt relieved and thirsty but when
i put out my hand for the goblet
guaracco moved more quickly than
i and spilled the wine out upon the
carpet

  that draught was poisoned he
informed me i meant to destroy
you as a spy or rival but fill again
and we shall drink to our better un-
derstanding

i poured wine and we touched
goblets and drank his eyes above

the brim were as knowing as satans
own and for the first time i was sure
of their color-deep violet-blue al-
most as dark as ripe grapes

  this is better i said and smiled
-but guaracco did not smile back

  do not think he returned in a
level tone of warning that i can-
not kill you later if such a course
recommends itself to me those
little entities you saw frail though
they appear are half-parcels of fate
they can handle their blades like
bravos they can scale the tallest
towers or wriggle between the
closest bars to deal death at my will
the skulls of their victims destroyed
in my service would pave all the
streets of florence yonder nor -
and his voice grew colder still-
are they my only weapons

  he stepped suddenly close so that
his proud lean nose was within an
inch of mine in fact your life
could have been taken in two dozen
ways between the yard and here to
say nothing of the poison and the
steel i have seen fit to show you sit
down lad and hear my plans for
you e

  i sat down with an unheroic show
of acquiescence he felt himself my
master for his teeth flashed in a
relished grin

  hark you i seek powrer he told
me much power i have already
i wield it through the coven of de-
luded witches you have seen and
others like them through my spies
and creatures in the guilds and com-
panies and councps through my in-
fluence on many individual persons
base and noble here and elsewiiere
but i want more power still one
day i shall not fear-his narrow
chest expanded a bit-to give my
orders to lorenzo himself

  lorenzo il magnifico i mur-
mured he rules in florence of
course

  yes he rules prince in all but
name-for the nonce his time i
dare predict will be short he
strode across the room hands be-
twice in time



hind his velvet back then turned
and stood over me hark you man
from the future your world what
you tell me of it is not so strange
nor so great as i would have ex-
pected yet you have many sciences
and devices to show me ma-
chines organization foreknowledge
of myriad kinds for them i spare
your life you will be yet another
of the chief agents in my service

  he told me that with flat assur-
ance and i did not have the resolu-
tion to question his decision all i
could manage was something about
my surprise that a sorcerer would
be so interested in honest science

  but sorcerers are scientists he
fairly snapped we offer our learn-
ing to the simple and they gape as
at a miracle of demons for effects
sake we mouth spells and flurry ges-
tures but the miracle is science sane
and practical if i am a sorcerer so
was albertus magnus so was roger
bacon the english monk who gave
us gunpowder well if i escape the
noose or the stake i may be as great
as they greater

as he spoke i pondered how his-
tory was showing him wise and
truthful magic always foreran
science from alchemys hokus-
pokus had risen the boons of
chemistry physics and medicine the
quibblings of astrologers had made
astronomy a great and exact field of
scientific study also could not
psychoanalysis look back to the an-

cient chaldean magicians who inter-
preted nebuchadnezzars dreams

  but now i was dealing with things
in the future from which i had
stepped things that had happened
in that future again i attempted
and almost achieved the feat of
rationalizing the memory of things
to come if i could do it i felt the
clouds would leave my mind

  this traveling in time that you
have accomplished is of deep inter-
est to me guaracco continued pac-
ing back and forth i feel that we
may attempt it again together i
would dearly love to see that world
of which you speak four centuries
and more ahead of us but these
things are not more wonderful than
others you mention tell me some-
thing about weapons of war

  slowly and vaguely i ventured a
description of the magazine rifle
then of the machinegun my ex-
planations were faulty and imper-
fect yet he was deeply interested
and brought forth tablets and a red-
leaded pencil with which to make
sketches

  he drew crudely and i took the
pencil from him to improve his
representations

  by mercurius the god of thieves
you depict things well he praised
me your left hand is surer than
my right perhaps you have studied
the arts yes i thought so he
squinted at me knowingly tweak-
ing the point of his foxy beard i

am inspired concerning you

  how is that i asked
tomorrow we go into the city of
florence he decreed i shall in-
troduce you there as a kinsman of
mine newly from the country who
seeks to enroll in the ancient and
honorable guild of florentine
painters i know a fitting teacher
-andrea del verrocchio i shall pay
his fee to enter you in his bottega
as a student

  i am to serve you there
serve me there or through there
in other places verrocchio is well
known and well liked lorenzo and
the other great nobles patronize him
i have not yet a proper agent among
the arts you will suit nicely in that
position

  again i agreed-because there
was nothing else to do he chuckled
in triumph and actually patted my
shoulder saying that we would
get along famously as adopted
cousins then he led me to another
room in which were a bed and a
cupboard

  you will rest here tonight he
informed me here-he opened
the cupboard-may be some cloth-
ing that will furnish you we are
of a height you and i and not too
dissimilar in girth

  but despite guaraccos confidence
in this last matter his hose stretched
drum-tight upon my more muscular
legs and his doublet proved too nar-
row in shoulder and hip

  we shall have that altered he
decided and going to the door raised
his voice lisa

  my lord replied a soft appre-
hensive voice from another room

  come here at once child and
bring your sewing tackle he
turned back to me you shall now
see my greatest treasure ser-leo
i think you called yourself that is
the name of the lion and it matches
well with that tawny mane of
yours

  into the doorway stepped a girl

  in her way she was nearly as

impressive as guaracco had been
not tall of a full but fine figure as
graceful as a dancer she paused on
the threshold as though timid at
sight of a stranger her face was
finely oval with large soft eyes of
midnight blue and a shy close-held
little mouth that was so darkly red
as to be purple these spots of
color glowed the more vividly be-
cause of the smooth ivory pallor of
her skin

  her hair was thick and sooty
black combed neatly straight under
a coif as snug as a helmet she wore
a chemise of sober brown with a
black bodice over it and a black
woolen skirt so full and long as to
hide her feet

  in her thin steady hands she held
a flat iron box the sewing kit
guaracco had commanded

  have i described a beautiful
woman she was that and nobly
modest as well and so i call her
impressive

  lisa i present to you ser leo
a new servant of my will said
guaracco to her he is to be of
value to me therefore be courteous
to him begin by altering this
doublet to his measure rip the
seams here and here and sew them
together again in a fuller manner

  he turned to address me ser
leo this girl lisa is for you a model
of obedience and single-hearted
helpfulness he raked her with
his eyes not contemptuously but
with a dispassionate pride as though
she were a fine piece of furniture

  i bought her my friend of her
beggarly parents eighteen years
gone she was no more than six
months old i have been father and
mother and teacher to her she has
known no other lord than myself
no other motive than mine

  the girl bowed her head as if to
hide her confusion at being thus
lectured upon and busied herself
with scissors and needle i pulled
guaraccos red cloak around my
naked shoulders my self-appointed
every defender bore mightily against the great log chap xvii

master smiled a trifle

  that flaming mantle becomes you
well take it as a present from me
but to return to lisa-i trust her
as i trust few she and the two
imps you have seen are the closest
to me of my unorthodox household
she cooks for me sews for me keeps
this house for me i in turn shelter
and instruct her

  some day if it will profit me
greatly i may let her go to a new
master-some great lord who will
thank me for a handsome submissive
present she will cherish that great
lord and learn his secrets for me
is that not so lisa

  she bowed her head the lower and
the ivory of her cheeks showed pink
like the sky at the first touch of
morning i shared her embarrass-
ment but guaracco chuckled quietly
and poured himself a half-goblet of
wine

  this he drank slowly without in-
viting me to join him

  in a surprisingly short time lisa
had finished broadening the doublet
for me and it fitted my torso like
wax guaracco was moved to another
of his suave compliments on the ap-
pearance i made

ith evening drawing near the
three of us took a meal it was
served in the hedge yard where
guaraccos dupes had prayed to in-
fernal powers for rain whether
by prayer or by coincidence the rain
did arrive not long after we had
finished the bread chicken and salad
that lisa set before us as the first
drops fell we went indoors and took
wine and fresh peaches and honey
by way of dessert in a great front
room that was luxuriously furnished
with gilded couches tables and
tapestries

  after the supper guaracco con-
ducted me to his workshop a great
flag-floored cellar here was a bench
with lamps retorts and labeled flasks
for experimentation in chemistry
and in this branch of science i was

to find my host-or captor-amaz-
ingly learned

  the greater part of the space
however was filled with tools and
odds and ends of machinery both
of wood and metal

  at guaraccos command i busied
myself among these but my strange
memory-fault-i was beginning to
think of it as partial amnesia-came
to muddle me again i could make
only the most slovenly demonstra-
tions and when i sought to explain
i found myself failing wretchedly

  you cannot be blamed for these
vaguenesses guaracco said almost
comfortingly a drop backward
through time four hundred years
and more must of necessity shock
ones sensibility the most delicate
tissues are naturally in the brain
i hope to recover my faculties
later i apologized just now i
progress in generalities only
even so you are better grounded
in these things than any man of this
present age he encouraged me
your talk of that astounding power
electricity amazed me perhaps
things can be harnessed with it
steam too i think i can see in my
minds eye how it can be put to
work like wind in a sail or water
flowing over a mill-wheel his eyes
brightened suddenly wait ser
leo i have an inspiration
inspiration i echoed

  i watched while he opened a small
casket on the bench and fetched out
a little purselike bag of dark velvet
from this tumbled a great rosy
pearl the size of a hazelnut and
glowing as with its own light upon
his palm he caught it and thrust it
under my nose

 look he commanded and i
looked

  to be sure it must be a valuable
jewel to be as full of rose-and-silver
radiance as a sunset sky it capti-
vated my soul with the sudden im-
pact of its beauty

  look repeated guaracco and i
gazed as though my eyes were bound
twice in time



in their focus the pearl grew big-
ger brighter

  look he said yet again as from
a distance and though i suspected at
last his motive i could not take my
eyes away

  the light faded consciousness
dropped slackly from me like a gar-
ment i knew a black silence as of
deep sleep then a return to blurred
awareness i shook myself and
yawned

  a chuckle sounded near by and i
opened my drowsy eves to find
guaraccos foxy face close to mine

  you are awake now he asked
with a false gentleness

  how long did i sleep i asked
but he did not reply

  he polished the pearl upon his
sleeve and slid it carefully into its
velvet bag

  i think that some if not all of
the forgotten things are buried in
your mind he observed with you
i tried a certain way that fools call
black magic

  hypnotism that was it guaracco
had hypnotized me had he in
reality found in my subconscious
mind those technical matters that i
seemed to have almost forgotten

  every minute of your company
he was continuing convinces me
that i did well to spare your life and
enlist you in my service now draw
for me again

  i obeyed and he watched once
again he praised me and swore that
i should be placed as a student with
andrea del verrocchio it had grown
late by now and he escorted me to
my bedchamber bidding me good-
night in most cordial terms

  but when the door closed behind
him i heard the key turn in the
heavy bronze lock

       apprenticeship

n the following day fell the
torrents of rain that had been
praved for in such occult fashion
and the trip to florence was post
ponrd to my chagrin my memories
of various details that had been so
clear during my twentieth century
existence were even cloudier so
much more so that i spent the morn-
ing making notes of what little i
remembered

  these notes guaracco appropri-
ated with as cordial a speech of
thanks as though i had done them
expressly for him i might have pro-
tested but near at hand loitered the
uglier of his two dwarfs-and there
might have been even a greater dan-
ger at the window behind me or
hidden among the tapestry folds at
my elbow

  so i gave over writing and went
to talk to lisa the sober but lovely
young girl to whom he had intro-
duced me the night before i found
her still shyly friendly possessed of
unfailing good manners and charm
she had needlework to do and i sat
talking and listening fascinated by
the play of her deft white fingers
while we were together i at least
felt less the sense of being a prisoner
and an underling

  but the rain had ceased by sunset
and early the next morning guaracco
knocked at my door to call out that
we would go to florence immediately
after breakfast we ate quickly and
went out into the fine early sunlight
servants-guaracco had several in
a nearby cottage peculiar fellows
but deeply devoted to him-brought
around horses a fine white stallion
for guaracco and an ordinary bay
for me i mounted being glad that
i had not forgotten how to ride and
we cantered off along a clay-hard-

ened highway with a groom on a
patient mule behind us

  we had not far to ride to florence
i found the valley of the arno much
the same as i had known it in my
former existence green and bounded
by hills sprinkled with villas clus-
ters of peasant huts and suburbs
with the town in the middle

florence itself was smaller
newer more beautiful the town
lay secure amid high battlemented
walls of stone with the river run-
ning through i saw the swell of the
duomo second cathedral of all
christendom great and round and
pale like the moon descended to
earth-and around it the towers of
many white houses and palaces the
cool green of garden trees

  the gate we entered was perhaps
twenty-five feet wide by fifteen high
and the tall lintel of gray-brown
stone bore a bas-relief of st marks
lion complete with wings and book
also several female figures which
appeared to have tails

  within the walls the town i had
known as grubbily ancient in the
twentieth century shone all new and
fresh by the clean whiteness of the
houses and by their style of archi-
tecture i judged that all or nearly
all of the older florence had been
razed to allow this new renaissance
capital of the medici its full glory

  the streets were for the most part
smoothly paved or at least had good
gutters and cobbles some of them
the side ways were too narrow even
for one-way traffic were darely close
with the upper stories of the houses
projecting in many places these
upper stories jutted out so far as to
make a covered way for pedestrians
at either side here and there stood
the enclosed mansions and gardens
of nobles or wealthy merchants and
at many crossings were wide
squares adorned occasionally with
the statue of a saint or hero

  many folk were afoot or on horse-
back though there were few wains

and these of the most primitive most
of the transport was done by donkey
pannier or in baskets on the brawny
shoulders of porters the people
seemed prosperous and in most cases
happy later i was to be reminded
that the florentines then enjoyed a
unique freedom and were wont to
boast about it to less-favored mila-
nese or venetians

  at last at guaraccos signal we
reined our animals before a tall
barnlike structure of drab stone
fronting away from the brink of the
green arno it was several stories
high pierced with many barred win-
dows and furnished with a double
dobr of iron grillwork

  this is verrocchios hottega
said my guide and we dismounted
leaving our bridle-ends in the hands
of the silent groom

  i moved toward the door but
guaraccos big hand touched my el-
bow i turned inquiringly

  before you enter here i have a
thought to burn into you he said
in a cold hushed voice

  with his deep penetrating eyes
his red beard and suddenly sinister
face he might have sat for a tradi-
tional portrait of judas i knew
more fiercely than ever a dislike and
distrust of him

  you wish to exact a vow of fealty
from me i suggested vows be-
gin ser guaracco only when hope is
dead

  he shook his head and undier his 
beard his mouth wriggled like a
snake in singed grass no he re-
plied i exact no vow i say simply
that if you betray me in word or
deed if you seek ever to hurt or to
hinder me-if in short you do not
adhere to the services i have set you
then will i see that you die by the
foulest death ever invented

  i am not afraid of you i said
to him striving in my heart to make
this the truth

  nor do i seek your fear was his
quick rejoinder only your under-
standing shall we go in
twice in time



the great front room of the
academy was as large as a riding
hall with high musty beams on the
ceiling and whitewashed walls not
as light as one might wish to paint
by but with the windows all set
toward clear open ground the cor-
ners of the room were cluttered with
art materials plaster molds half-
finished paintings on planks broken
chairs pots of paint sheafs of
brushes rolled parchments and can-
vases

 three or four young men in
shabby smocks stopped their various
tasks to gaze curiously at me-stu-
dents i supposed them to be and
from behind a counterlike bench at
the door a man greeted guaracco

  good morrow ser andrea said
my patron i said once that i would

tor high in favor at court but the teacher of some
of the most distinguished artists and rraftsmen
of his time

here is one-my own cousin leo
the master of the bottega came
from behind his bench he was a
spidery little fellow of forty or there-
abouts clad in a long gown of dark
wool like a priests with ill-fitting
worn slippers on his flat feet his
face was beardless white and puffy
and he wore spectacles low upon his
snub nose his hair already gray
had begun to grow thin on top his
finest features were his big wise
eyes and his slender delicate hands
guaracco praised me highly and
finally produced my drawings an-
drea verrocchio carried them into
the light and looked at them narrow-
ly with pursed lips finally he
turned his spectacles upon me

mented drawing is the father of

  i told him quite truthfully that it
was my ambition

  if you study with me he ad-
monished you must work entirely
as i devise

  to devise is the work of the
master i said respectfully to
execute is the work of the appren-
tice

  well worded he nodded and
smiled a trifle come here-look at
this picture

  he beckoned us across the room
against the rear wall hung a size-
able sheet of wood held in place on
a sort of scaffold with cords and pins
upon this had been painted but not
finished an oil of the baptism of
jesus some of the figures were exe-
cuted with spirit and intelligence
but over one of them a kneeling
angel i could not but shake my head

  you see the fault murmured
andrea verrocchio beside me the
draperies ser leo are not properly
done

  they are not sir i agreed after
a careful examination

  he smiled slowly the students too
had gathered with us i had a sense
of their critical suspicion perhaps
they had worked at the thing and
failed

  peradventure boy you can
better it suggested verrocchio in
a tone that was full of superior
doubt

  may i use these paints i in-
quired stooping to some pots and
brushes at the foot of the frame-
work

  as i did so i caught a glimpse of
guaraccos face set in an easy smile
for all his strange menacing nature
he at least trusted my skill

  drapery is a science worth close
study i lectured the group as i
mixed some colors upon a rectangu-
lar palette board the part of the
fold which is furthest from the ends
where it is confined-i pointed with
my brush at the fringe of the angels
robe-will return most closely to
its original extended condition

  one student snickered at- my
words show us what you mean by
these words verrocchio said

  with your leave i shall try i
accepted his challenge and began to
dash on my paint here was another
old skill i had not lost everything
naturally desires to remain in its
own state i elaborated drapery
desires to lie flat if it is caught into
folds or pleats thus-and i exe-
cuted a crumpled crease upon the
knee of the angel-it is forced to
quit this condition of flatness and
obeys the law of this force in that
part where it is most constrained

  i progressed to the hem

  the part furthest away from
such constraint i went on you
will find returns most nearly to its
original state-that is to say lying
extended and full

  you say truth ser leo and you
paint truth too verrocchio com-
mended me warmly and turned
quickly to guaracco your kinsman
stays here as my pupil and helper go
forward with that drapery young
sir when you are finished the pic-
ture can have no further improve-
ment

t worked away caring little for
a the jealous staring of my fellow
students meanwhile guaraccos
groom brought in a bundle of cloth-
ing for me and guaracco himself
gave me a bag of clinking coins

  i have paid the charge for your
education cousin he said to me
stay here live and work here and
do me credit do not forget what i
require from you according to our
recent conversations i shall keep an
eye and ear upon you i may even
take a house to be near you again i
say-do not forget

  and with this equivocal farewell
he strolled out the very picture of a
kindly and helpful kinsman

 a painting that fits this description and that
might be the same exists today in florence it
is certain that the draperies of the kneeling angel
are done more skilfully than those of the other
figures
twice in time



  so i became a pupil of andrea del
verrocchio the finest teacher of arts
in florence i made the acquaintance
of my fellow students and found
them not at all bad fellows some in-
deed quite adept at their work i had
a cell-like room with pallet bed nnd
table and chest of art materials i
listened dutifully to the precepts of
our instructor and undr his tutelage
did many kinds of work

  verrocchios aptitude and taste
were for sculpture d though i
thought this less intellectual fan
painting for it cannot represent
transparent or yielding things i did
not rebel

  my first pece of finished work a
gold ornament for the king of portu-
gal was called splendid by verroc-
chio he let me help him with the
great bronze busts he was fashioning
for the palace of the medici later
let me execute alone a series of orna-
mental shields of painted wood for a
wealthy merchant

  in the evenings and sometimes in
the daytime when work was slack i
was permitted to go with my fellow
students through the streets i could
never weary myself with the sights
and sounds and smells of florence

  i loved the pageantry of the main
thoroughfares-laden beasts pro-
cessions of armed men going from
one sentry post to another occa-
sional rich coaches of the great or
wealthy cavaliers on prancing
horses veiled ladies in mule-litters
rougher but still picturesque guilds-
men artisans beggars burghers
an occasional captain of merce-
naries a condottiero slashed and
swaggering his long sword sheath
hoisting up the hem of his mantle
criers loudly acclaiming their wares
of fruit fish wine or whatnot

  on the poorer narrower streets
there were hucksters and small
tradesmen with baskets and trays-
and bevies of bright-eyed girls on
the lookout for romantic adventure
there were palaces to see in the
wider spaces and the great sculp-

tured bridges across the arno too
there were pleasant cheap taverns
where young men might get good
wine and plenty for copper coins

  so it went for the month of may
twice during that time guaracco
called to talk to me in honeyed pro-
testations of concern over the wel-
fare of his supposed cousin but be-
tween the pleafan lines of his con-
versation my inner ear could dis-
tinguish the warning and insistence
of hs power over me

  once he remarked that lisa-
you remember our little lisa-
had sent me her warm regards i
found mvself henrtilv grateful for
that brief mesrage from one who
ha-l treated me fairly and kindly

  the first of june dawned bright
and sultry hot i was up betimes
putting the last touches to an im-
provement on the scaffolding which
served verrocchio as an easel for
extra-large pictures i fitted its cords
to pulleys and winches so that the
artist instead of moving from one
place to another could hold a certain
position with advantageous lights
and viewpoints while he lowered the
picture itself or lifted it or moved it
from side to side at his will

  in the midst of my work a boy
came in from the street he ap-
proached and said very softly that he
had a message

  a message i demanded turn-
ing for whom

  the little fellow bowed for you
ser leo i am ordered to conduct you
to a place in the next street

  how do you know my name i
asked and looked sharply at him
then i saw that it was no boy but the
dwarf who had once opened guarac-
cos door to me and whom i had then
mistaken for a handsome child

  come he persisted you are
awaited

  turning from my work i asked
verrocchio if i might be excused for
a few moments he glanced up from
the bench where he and two other
students were studying the plans of


wonder story annual

a chapel and nodded his permission

  is it guaracco who waits to see
me i asked the dwarf as we
emerged from the bottega into the
sticky sunlight-but he smiled mys-
teriously and shook his little head

we walked along the street
my guide trotting in front and
turned a corner there at the brink
of the river was a small dwelling
house surrounded by a green garden

  go in ser leo the dwarf bade
me and ran around to the back with
the nimble suddenness of a dog

  left alone i knocked at the door
there was no answer and i pushed
down the latch and went in

  i found myself in a cool dark hall
paneled in wood on a leather-cush-
ioned sofa sat lisa the ward of
guaracco her feet were pressed
close together under the hem of her
wide skirt and her hands were
clasped in her lap about her whole
attitude there was an air of tense
embarrassed expectancy she looked
up as i came in then quickly dropped
her gaze making no answer to my
surprised greeting

  as i came farther into the room
approaching the girl a pale oblong
caught my eye-a folded paper ly-
ing on a little round center table
upon it were written three large
letters leo

  is this for me i asked lisa
who only bowed her head the lower
i began to catch something of her
embarrassment your pardon for
a moment i requested and opened
the paper the letter was brief and
to the point it read

  my dear adopted kinsman

  you have thus far pleased me
much and i have high hopes of
great advantage from your acquaint-
ance and endeavor it occurs to me
to make you a present

  in the short time you were my
guest you saw my ward lisa she
likes you and you are not averse to
her society take her theref ore and

i wish you joy of each other

              from

                    guaracco

chapter v
the gift of guaracco

the first sentence of the letter
astonished me beyond measure
the last had two effects overwhelm-
ing and sudden in succession like the
reports of a double-barreled gun

  for my primary impulse was to
rejoice to be glad and thankful
why had i never realized that i loved
lisa thinking of her now how
could i help but love her but my
second reaction was one of horrified
knowledge of what guaracco meant
by such a gift

  lisa fair mistress i said this
letter-you know what it says

  she nodded and the living rose
touched her ivory skin

it cannot be i told her soberly

  cannot she repeated no louder
than a sigh it might have been a
protest it might have been an agree-
ment

  i overcame an impulse to fall on
one knee before her like any melo-
dramatic courtier of that unre-
strained age and land

  lisa i said again desperately
choosing my words first of all let
me say that i am deeply moved by
the mere thought of winning you
guaracco appears to mean what he
says and you appear ready to con-
sent watching her i saw the trem-
bling of her lips but i cannot take
you at his hands lisa

at last she looked me full in the
face she too began to comprehend

  that subtle wizard guaracco
i went on growing warm to the out-
rage he would wreak tries to rule
us both by fear he sees that he is
not successful we yield slowly bid-
ing our time for orders are orders
twice in time



 until there comes strength for dis-
 obedience and so he seeks to rule
 us by happiness confess it lisa
 for a moment you too would have
 wanted love between us

   she gave me her sweet little smile
 with unparted lips but shyness and
 restraint covered her again and she
 did not answer me

   we cannot lisa i said earnest-
  ly it might be sweet and for me at
 least it would be the easiest course
 in the world but guaraccos touch
 upon our love-heaven forefend that
 we be obligated to him

   eloquently said leo my kins-
 man 

   it was the voice of guaracco i
 spun quickly around ready to strike
 out at him but he was not there
 only his laughter like the whinny-
 ing of a very cunning and wicked
 horse was there combing the empty
 air of the room

   do not strive against nothing-
 ness young hero his words admon-
 ished me out of nowhere and do
 not anguish me by spurning my poor
 tender ward she loves you leo
 and you have just shown that you
 love her

   such words made it impossible for
 me to look at lisa and therefore i
 looked the harder for guaracco in
 the midst of his mockery i located
 the direction of the sound he spoke
 from the rooms very center and i
 moved in that direction

   at once he fell silent but i had
 come to a pause beneath the point
 where the final syllable still echoed
 almost in my ear i glared around
 me down and upward

   a cluster of lamps hung just above
 my head held by several twisted
 cords to the ceiling among the
 cupped sconces i spied what i sus-
 pected-a little open cone of metal
 like a funnel i am afraid that i
 swore aloud even in lisas presence
 when i saw and knew the fashion of
 guaraccos ghostly speaking but i
 also acted with a single lunge and
 grasp i leapt to grasp the lamps and

pulled with all my strength

  they came away and fell crashing
but not they alone for with them
came a copper tube that had been
suspended from cords and concealed
there i tore it from its place in the
ceiling beyond that ceiling i knew
another tube went to the lips of gua-
racco in hiding i cast the double
handful of lamps upon the planks
of the floor

  once aain guaracco laughed but
this time from behind me in the room
itself again i turned a panel of
the woodwork had swung outward
and the man himself stepped
through all black velvet and flaming
beard and sneering smile

  you are a quick one he re-
marked i have fooled many a wise
old grandfather with that trick

  i gathered myself to spring
nay leo he warned me quickly
do nothing violent nothing that
you would not have set down as your
last act on earth his hand lifted
and in it was leveled a pistol mas-
sively but knowingly made i stared
for a moment forgetting my rage
and protest at his villainous match-
making surely pistols were not in-
vented so early

  it is of my own manufacture
he informed me as though he read
my mind though short it throws
a ball as hard and as deep as the
longest arquebus in christendom
do not force me to shoot you kins-
man his lips writhed scornfully
over the irony of our pretended re-
lationship

  shoot if you will i bade him
i have said to lisa and i also say to
you that i shall not be led by love
into your deeper hateful service
he shook his rufous head with a
great show of melancholy alas
young cousin you do great and un-
deserved wrong to lisa and to me
only this morning she was disposed
to thank me for the thought to scan
by way of rehearsal the marriage
service ah i have it he laughed
aloud
	wonder story annual

  you do not think that a poor art
student like yourself can support a
wife and household he held out
his free hand as warmly smiling as
any indulgent father take no fur-
ther thought of it i myself shall
provide a suitable dowry for the
bride

even poor wretched lisa ex-
claimed in disgust at his evil
humor and i started forward sud-
denly coming so close to guaracco
that i found the hard muzzle of his
pistol digging into the pit of my
stomach

  back he commanded with quiet
menace back i say at once that
is better what fantastic objection
have you to raise this time

  you add money to beauty and
love in the effort to buy me i cried
thoroughly disgusted dowry a
bribe to marriage oh you are in-
famous  surely we are living in the
last days of the world i flung wide
my arms as though in invitation of
a shot kill me guaracco you
said once that you would kill me if
i disobeyed you well i disobey and
with my last breath i do name you
a sorry scoundrel

  he shook his head and moved
back no he demurred gently
perhaps after all the fault was
mine i was too abrupt for your
dainty nature leo he turned his
eyes but not his head toward the un-
happy lisa where she sat in mute
and woeful confusion forgive this
ungallant fellow my child perhaps
another time-

  there shall be no other time i
said flatly i refuse once and for
all

  then go guaracco bade me and
he simulated a bored yawn you
have disappointed me and shamed
lisa return to your labors among
the arts and when your heart is
cooler we shall talk again go

  i went and my nature was more
fiery hot than the waxing sun over-
head

  guaracco had spoken this much
truth i had brought shame to lisa
apparently she had been ready to
accept me as a mate and whether
this was at guaraccos hypnotic sug-
gestion or not made little difference
in the way my reaction must have
affected her she had come to meet
me hoping to hear my praises and
pledges to stand with me before a
priest

  undoubtedly she understood my
refusal to be her lover but could i
not have been more kindly toward
her could i not have said paren-
thetically that it was in reality gua-
racco i refused that on some happier
occasion   like many a man leav-
ing a stormy center i was aware of
fully a score of things i should have
said and done

  i was also aware that i loved
lisa there was no getting away
from that even when i tried to say
that it was all guaraccos adroit sug-
gestion that he might have hypno-
tized me as well as lisa from the
first day he had introduced us to
each other

  conjectures about it were only
the more disturbing finally i gave
up the struggle against my new
realization i loved lisa and prob-
ably i had lost her there was noth-
ing i could do about it i told myself
as i drew near to the bottega turned
my footsteps to enter at the door

  a final glow of rage swelled all
through me i yearned wildly for an
opportunity to catch guaracco off
guard to strike and throttle him a
mood rare in me made my heart
and body thirst for violent action

  as fate would have it violent ac-
tion was about to be provided for
my needs

  a horseman came cantering along
the street his horse a handsome
gray spurned a loose stone from its
place among the cobbles another
moment and the beast had stumbled
and fallen throwing its rider head-
long

  a crowd of strolling pedestrians
twice in time



within view of the mishap all hur-
ried close myself among them my
hand went out to lift the sprawling
man but with a grunt and an oath
he had scrambled to his feet and was
tugging at the bridle of his horse
it would not rise

   the beast is hurt i suggested

  not this devil-begotten nag
growled the rider he dragged on
the bridle again then kicked the ani-
mals gray ribs with his sharp-toed
boot

  harshness to animals has never
pleased me and as i have said my
anger was ready to rise at anything
i shouted immediate and strong pro-
test the man turned upon me he
was tall and sturdy with a forked
black beard and two square front
teeth showing under a short upper
lip he wore a long sword under his
cloak of brown silk and had the look
of a tough customer

  do not meddle between me and
my horseflesh he snapped and once
more heaved at the bridle

  the injured horse struggled up
at last driving the little crowd back
on all sides and the master laughed
shortly did i not say he was un-
hurt belly of bacchus it was his
careless foot that threw us-curse it
and him

  he clutched the bit of the poor
beast and struck it across the face
with his riding whip

  stop that i shouted and caught
his arm he tried to pull loose but
i was as strong as he a moment
later he had released the horse
which a passerby seized by the reins
and cut at me with the whip my
left hand lashed out as quick as im-
pulse it smote solidly on those two
front teeth and the man-at-arms
staggered back with a roar

  i would have struck again per-
haps stretching him on the cobbles
had not andrea del verrocchio him-
self running from his door thrown
his arms around me meanwhile the
black-bearded man had whipped out
his sword and swearing in a blood-

curdling manner was struggling to
throw off two voluble peacemakers
and get at me

  have you gone mad boy ver-
rocchio panted in my ear that is
gido the first swordsman of lor-
enzos palace guard

chapter vi
swords beside the river

when i say that i did not flinch
at verrocchios warning i do not
call myself brave-only possessed by
a white heat of anger for a moment
i made as if to rush fairly upon the
point of gidos sword but a saving
ounce of wit returned to me

  my eye caught a gleam at the hip
of one of the growing throng of
watchers i made a long leaping
stride at the fellow and before he
knew i was there i had clutched and
plucked away his long straight blade

  thank you friend i said to him
hastily i will return this steel when
i have settled accounts with ser gido
the ruffier

  gido was roaring like a profane
bull he cursed me by every holy
christian name and some that
smacked of the classic greek and
roman but by now i had recovered
my own self-possession sufficiently
to make me recognize my danger and
face it i thrust away verrocchios
pleading hands and interrupted gido
in the middle of a sulphurous rodo-
montade

  you talk too loudly for a fighting
man i told him come i am no
burgher let him go you good peo-
ple he needs blood-letting to ease
his hot temper

  there shall be blood-letting
enough and to spare the palace
guardsman promised me balefully

  verrocchio pleaded that there be
no brawl outside his house but gido
loudly claimed that there must be a
wonder story annual

back courtyard where we could have
quiet for our work and with the
crowd clamoring and pushing after
us to that back courtyard we went
through a little gate at the side of
the bottega

  there was a level space flagged
with stones at the grassy brink of
the arno all the spectators jammed
close to the walls of the house and
its paling at the sides while my ad-
versary and myself stood free near
the water

  gido gave me a quick businesslike
scrutiny that had something in it of
relish-the sort of gaze that a carver
might bestow upon a roast with a
quick flirt of his left arm he wound
his brown cloak around his elbow to
serve as buckler

  i will teach you to defy your
betters master paint-smearer he
promised

  teach on i urged him i may
be a good enough pupil to outshine
my teacher

  all this time i was telling myself
to be calm ruthless and wide-awake
that i must not fear the raw point
i had done some fencing in prep
school and at my university and it
was another thing that i remem-
bered fairly well with my hand if
not my head i felt that i had a cer-
tain advantage too in being left-
handed

  we moved toward each other by
common consent gingerly talcing the
stylized paper-doll pose of fencers
as my left hand advanced my sword
gido saw that he would have trouble
shielding himself with that wadded
cloak

  fortune favors the right he
muttered and his square front teeth
gleamed with pleasure at his own
pun

  for answer i made a quick simple
attack it was no more than a feel-
ing thrust and he swept it aside with
an easy shifting of his straight
blade at once i made a recovery
ready to parry his riposte

  the riposte did not come instead

this crack swordsman of the medici
tried to beat down my weapon and
so clear the way for a stab at my
breast i yielded a little before his
pressure disengaged parried in
turn dropped back another of his
slashing assaults i only half-broke
with my edge and felt the delicate
sting of his edge upon my left fore-
arm

  first blood yelled one of the
watchers and a little cheer went up
for my enemy the florentines were
en joying the sport

  but i was not injured as far as
my activity was concerned as gido
rushed to follow his advantage i was
able to parry cleanly immediately
while he was yet extended in his
forward lunge and well within reach
i sped my riposte it caught him un-
prepared and he barely flung up his
cloak-swaddled left arm in time

  through half a dozen thicknesses
of brown cloth my edge bit its way
gido swore as his blood sprang out
to dye the fabric a deep red

  he who bleeds last bleeds long-
est i paraphrased and made a
sweeping slash on my own account

  gido had to spring all the way
back to escape and upon his face
dawned an expression of perplexed
concern

  was this the best swordsman that
the medici could send against a raw
student of the arts i felt a little
perplexity on my own account gido
had the look and with verrocchio at
least the reputation of a seasoned
fighter yet he was doing no more
than enough to hold his own against
my sword he had missed a chance
to riposte at my first attack and a
moment later he had been foolishly
open to my own riposte

as our blades grated together
again i found the answer in my
own semi-obscured memory riposte
that was it-or rather the lack of
riposte the movement the counter-
attack made when your opponents
thrust has been parried and he has
twice in time



not yet recovered is in great meas-
ure instinctive but in these renais-
sance times it was not rationalized
was not yet made a definite pseudo-
reflex of swordplay i knowing the
formal science of it had a great ad-
vantage i could win by it

  fight you knave i taunted
gido as my steel pressed against his
til cut you into flitches like a pig

  again he thrust wildly in his
angry terror and again i warded
then with a quick straightening of
my arm i touched him before he
could recover my point snagged his
bearded cheek and a great thread of
gore showed this time the onlookers
cheered for me

  gido retreated once more two
paces this time his face frankly
showed terror he is a devil he
choked out he knows a seeret

  	no scientific treatment of the riposte in
rwordplay is to be found in any manual of the
exercise before the late seventeenth century

thrust unfair

  i will show my secret drive it
to your heart i growled back
pressing forward after him fight
man or i will butcher you

  he tried for a moment to oppose
me then fled again from my menac-
ing point now that his nerve was
gone he could barely hold up his
sword

  i cannot stand against you he
mumbled wretchedly

  show him mercy called vei
rocchio to me and i half lowered my
weapon

  gido saw and struck only a quick
recovery of my guard saved my life
i roared wordlessly and sprang upon
him my first sweeping slash he par-
ried the second almost cut away
his left arm he staggered back and
tried unsuccessfully to hold off my
long point thrust but i got home
deep between his ribs pulling away

he ran like a boy caught stealing
fruit and i ran after him

  he gained the gate that led to the
street leaning for a moment upon
it half a dozen of the onlookers
rushed to bar my way pleading that
i was already the winner but my
rage was up again i struggled
through their arms and after gido

  he had gone through the gate
fallen through it as i came into
the street with the throng at my
hels i almost trod upon my ad-
versary he lay sprawled across the
curb and into the gutter his sword
under him blood gushing from his
mouth and drenching his black
beard he had only life enough to
grope in his pierced bosom pull
forth a crucifix of silver and try to
kiss it

  the fight and the fury went out
of me as i watched him die for it
was the first violent death i had ever
witnessed i looked around at the
staring scared faces saw among
them that of the man whose sword
i had snatched

  take back your weapon i said
to him but he drew fearfully away
from me

  hoofs were thundering on the
cobblestones the knot of people
pressed back to the front of the
bottega and let a little cloud of horse-
men approach a voice shouted com-
mandingly and there was a quick or-
derly dismounting one of the ar-
mored men stopped to gaze at the
body

  gido he grunted slain

  what demanded a voice from
behind gido you say who slew
him

  two men richly dressed had re-
mained upon their superb horses
one of them reined in almost above
me he was a handsome dark young-
ster no older than i with abundant
curls descending from under his
plumed velvet cap to the shoulders
of his plum-colored houppelande or
gownlike outer garment his belt
gloves and boots were embroidered

with massy gold he stared at the
body of gido at me at the bloody
sword i still held

  it was the other sitting his steed
just beyond who had spoken he
was also young tall and rugged with
harpies blazoned richly upon the
breast of his surcoat his strong
face framed between sweeps of
straight black hair had broad fierce-
ly-ugly features above the right
corner of his mouth grew a wart
to me his appearance suggested
something of my former life-a
painting or statue

  gido he said again my own
peerless gido-slain

  here upon me had ridden lorenzo
the magnificent absolute ruler of
the city of florence

  and now the eyes of this great
despot prince in all but name had
fastened upon me bright deadly
intent flared from them like fire
from black flint

  is that the assassin he de-
manded seize him some of you
i turned toward him i am no
assassin your magnificence i pro-
tested it was a fair fight and this
guardsman of yours forced-

  but as i began to speak two of the
men in mail and leather moved
swiftly to my right elbow and my
left the iron gauntlet of one
snatched away my sword and the
other man roughly caught my shoul-
der

  silence he growled in my ear
speak when you are spoken to
others of the party were busy
questioning witnesses who were
many and unfriendly lorenzo de
medici after favoring me with
another long searching look turned
away bring that fellow he or-
dered my captors

  can you ride i was asked and
when i nodded the gray horse of
gido the same over which we had
quarreled was led forward i

  	lorenzo de medici who ruled with his brother
giuliano in florence from  was the true
founder of florentine greatness and was a moat
benevolent despot until his death in 
twice in time



mounted and one of the men-at-arms
caught the bridle reins in the crook
of his arm the other sidled his
horse against me

  come he said you are going
to prison if you try to escape if
you but move as though to leave us
-his voice grew harder still-my
sword will shed your tripes upon the
street

chapter vii
lorenzo the magnificent

lorenzo and his handsome com-
panion had ridden on behind
him rode his retinue one of them
with gidos limp body across his
saddlebow i myself on the gray
brought up the rear with the two
guards

  as we departed i glanced back at
the bottega the crowd was moving
and murmuring and in its midst
stood andrea de verrocchio staring
after me through his spectacles

 we had not ridden much more
than two miles and had made few
turns before our little procession en-
tered a great paved yard before a
white stone palace a groom ap-

eeared to lead away the horses of
orenzo and his companion while
the soldiers rode around to a guard-
house at the rear leading me with
them

  through a small barred door i was
ushered into the palace building
then through a hallway in which
stood a sentry in breastplate and
steel cap finally i was escorted
into a small room finished in great
rough stones and with a single iron-
latticed window it had one stool
no carpet and no table

 await here your punishment
one of my captors bade me and i was
locked in

  i waited there was nothing to
do but think nothing to think but

doleful thoughts my victory over
the bully swordsman mingled as it
was with luck and knowledge from
another century had brought me not
fame but disaster lorenzo de medici
himself had seen fit to notice me-
and with anger i knew well that this
scion of a great and unscrupulous
race had the power of life and death
in florence and that in my case the
power of death was more apt to be
exercised than the power of life

  to be sure i had been drawn on
first had fought only in self-defense
but what judge would hear me
lorenzo who through me had lost
a valued servant what jury would
ponder my case no jury i might
not be allowed to speak in my own
defense even a nod a word-and i
would be condemned to death with
nobody to question or to mourn

  nobody what about lisa but
i had to put her from my mind

  thus i mused in the blackest of
humors until a faint stirring sound
at the window made me lift my eyes
a small childlike face hung there-
the face of the deceptively handsome
dwarf of guaracco

  he cautioned me to silence with a
tiny finger on his lips then with the
utmost suppleness and skill thrust
his wisp of a body between the iron
bars how even so small a creature
coulddo it i have no idea-but in
two seconds he stood in front of me
smoothing out the wrinkles of his
little surcoat

  what do you here i demanded

  it was easy he chuckled by
a vine i swung from the street and
over the wall in a tuft of brambles
i lurked until the sentry walked by
i am here with a message from ser
guaracco your master and mine

  well i prompted a faint hope
wakening in me guaracco had
claimed some influence perhaps he
was bestirring himself on my be-
half

  the message said the dwarf
is this-hanging is an easy death
and a swift one


wonder story annual

  hanging i echoed i am to be
hanged 

  perhaps the little head wagged
wisely that is the punishment for
brawlers and killers in hot blood
but there are other punishments
he smiled up impudently a witch
a devils apostle for instance may
be burned at the stake by compari-
son a sorry end

  i grew ironic myself your rid-
dles become easy to read imp i
said ser guaracco is anxious that
i make no claims of coming to him
miraculously-that i say nothing of
being nourished and ordered to as-
sist him in his intrigues

  they breed quick minds where
you come from said the dwarf

  go back i told him and say
that i know his selfish reason but
that his advice is good i will not in-
volve him in my ruin better to hang
than to burn

the little fellow nodded quickly
turned and wriggled out between
the bars like a lizard time wore on
and i felt weary and hungry final-
ly pushing my stool back so that i
could lean in the corner i dozed off
a rough voice awakened me

  gods wounds knave you do
slumber at the very lip of death
rise and come with me lorenzo the
magnificent has sent for you

  i got to my feet and rubbed my
eyes night had come and i walked
out of my dark cell toward the light
held at the open door two men in
steel-mounted leather waited a
bristle-bearded captain and a lanky
swordsman with a -scarred cheek

  between them i walked away into
a long hall around a corner across
an open courtyard-it was a clear
starrv night overhead-and into a
building bevond a sentry chal-
lenged us in the arras-hung vestibule
we entered at an explanatory word
from the bearded captain he waved
us on through a curtained doorway

  the room in which we came to a
halt was not spacious but lofty

lighted by no less than eight lamps
on tables and brackets or hung by
chains from the groined ceiling the
walls were frescoed with scenes and
figures of grecian mythology and
the floor was richly carpeted

  at a table of polished ebony with
inlaid borders and figures of ivory
sat lorenzo de medici in a magnifi-
cent dove-gray hovjrpelande with
furred neck and wrists his ugly
face was toward us beside him was
stationed a scribe or secretary in the
hooded gown of a monk busy with
pen and ink

  but standing before the table
with back toward us was a long
spare man with a red pate he
could be none but guaracco and he
was speaking as we entered in the
gentle plausible manner he could
affect so well magnificence he
was saying smoothly if to be re-
lated to the young man is a crime i
must plead guilty it is true that i
arranged for his education as ser
andrea verrocchio testified before
you just now but concerning this
butchery of your poor servant i must
say that i have no reaction save
surprise and sorrow

  he was clearing his skirts of me
then

  lorenzo leaned back in his chair
of state it was a square-made arm-
chair of massive carved wood

  i wonder i wonder the ruler of
florence almost crooned his eyes
probed guaracco like sharp points
and if anything could unsettle the
sorcerer-scientists aplomb it would
be such a regard it is possible
continued lorenzo that you as-
signed him to the task of murdering
gido but here is the young man
himself his story may be reveal-
ing

  the captain who had brought me
now thrust me forward with a push
of thick knuckles in my back loren-
zos eyes met mine and i returned
him as level a stare as possible

  stand aside guaracco com-
manded lorenzo now youngrman
twice in time



your name

  leo thrasher i replied

  leo-what lorenzo shook his
head over my surname which all
italians have found difficult the
clerk pen in hand asked me how to
spell it

  a barbarous cognomen which
bespeaks the barbarous fellow re-
marked lorenzo sententiously
what defense have you to offer
only that i did not murder your
guardsman but killed him in a fair
fight i made respectful reply

guaracco standing against the
wall gave me a little nod of ap-
proval and drew in his lips as though
to council prudence

  lorenzo turned and took several
sheets of writing from his monkish
companion according to the testi-
mony of others you were the aggres-
sor said he you interfered and
struck him after he had fallen from
his horse

  he flogged the beast cruelly i
protested i used my bare fist upon
him and he drew his sword i say
i but defended myself

  do not contradict his magnifi-
cence the middle-aged clerk cau-
tioned me bleakly

  and do not traduce the name of
poor dead gido added lorenzo his
eyes still raked me i have lost a
good servant in him

  perhaps i said on sudden in-
spiration i can make good his
loss

  how exclaimed lorenzo and
his black eyes narrowed as a
swordsman in my guard but gido
had conquered hundreds

  i conquered gido i reminded
him despite the fact that guaracco
was signaling again for prudence
lorenzo saw those signals and
turned in his chair

  ha guaracco by the bones of the
saints i do begin to understand it
youll have planned that this crea-
ture of yours might rise on the dead
shoulders of his victim and be taken

into my service as an invincible
blade then being near me and my-
self unguarded-r
as heaven is my judge this is
not my doing exclaimed guarac-
co unstrung at last

  i spoke again to save myself and
him too if i cannot be trusted
to guard your magnificence i have
other worthy gifts i thought a
moment marshaling what latter-day
science my memory still retained
i can build bridges i can make
war machines of various kinds i
can show you how to destroy
fortresses

  indeed broke in lorenzo
how came you by all this knowl-
edge more of guaraccos doing i
make no doubt he is whispered to
be a sorcerer another of his darted
sidelong looks made the tall man
shake violently you too young
man death is the severe penalty
for black magic

  i recognized defeat and shrugged
my shoulders in exasperation i
shall not weary you with further
pleas your magnificence i said
call me wizard as well as mur-
derer i am neither but all are de-
termined to destroy me as well be
hanged for a sheep as for a lamb
the captain at my elbow made a
motion as though to drag me away
but lorenzo lifted one long white
hand with a many-jeweled ring upon
the forefinger wait tell me-
what was that you said

  i said as well be hanged for a
sheep as for a lamb

  hanged for a sheep as for a- a
grin came slowly as if it did not well
know the way to that rugged face it
made lorenzo strangely handsome
neatly said by bacchus he spoke
to the clerk write that down here
we have one gift that was never
won from yonder dull guaracco

  i was stunned at the zest with
which he repeated the cliche why
your magnificence i said wonder -
ingly it is but a saying a hand-
ful of old words


wonder story annual

  yet the thought is new a new
thing under the sun say on leo
the witty if you are an assassin
set to kill me your tongue is as
tempered as your sword

  he called the phrase new and of
course it was

  the fifteenth century had never
heard of it before every cliche
must have been devastating in its
time

 groped in my mind for an-
other and the works of william
shakespeare a good century in the
future came to my rescue

  since i am graciously permitted
to plead my case once more i said
let me but remind your magnifi-
cence that the quality of mercy is
not strained it drops as the gentle
rain from heaven upon the earth be-
neath-

  excellent applauded lorenzo
clerk have you written it all he
smiled upon me the more widely and
winningly you go free young sir
swordsmen i can buy at a ducat a
dozen but men of good wit and ready
tongue are scarce in these decayed
times tomorrow then you shall have
a further audience with me

  i bowed myself away scarce
crediting my good fortune but as
i walked down the palace steps and
through the gate guaracco fell into
step beside me

  under his half-draped black cloak
i caught the outline of that pistol he
had invented

  i have nothing to say to you i
growled i have washed my hands
of you and you washed your hands
of me yonder when my life hung by
a thread

  i never pledged myself to you
he reminded nor did i demand a
pledge of you-only obedience in-
stead of death you win favor from
the medici when you go back to-
morrow you go under new orders
from me

  and thus i was deeper than ever
in his strong wicked clutch

chapter viii
the court of lorenzo

perhaps it is odd and yet not so
odd that i remember no more of
that particular walk of my warm
disgust at guaraccos confident leer
of his insistence on my aid to him
it is my fixed belief that during our
conversation he found and took the
opportunity to throw upon me his
hypnotic spell he could do that al-
most as well as the best twentieth-
century psychologists

  walking together thus on the way
to verrocchios bottega i entranced
and somnambulistic he alert and
studied there must have been strong
talking by guaracco and receptive
listening by me he must have
planted in my dream-bound mind
that i was his friend and debtor
that i must share lorenzos favor
with him guaracco

  what i do remember is the next
afternoon and an equerry from the
palace presenting himself before an
impressed verrocchio with a mes-
sage summoning me to his master i
went clad in my simple best-the
decent doublet and hose which gua-
racco had given me on my first
evening at his house my red mantle
and a flat velvet cap with a long
drooping feather with a little shock
of pleased astonishment i saw that
the equerry had brought me a horse
-the same fine gray over which i
had fallen out with the late lamented
gido

  the beast is a present from the
magnificent i was informed as i
mounted

  to the palace we rode and there
while my horse was cared for by the
equerry i was conducted through a
great courtyard to a rich garden
among high hedges of yew trimmed
to a blocky evenness with nichelike
hollows for stone seats or white
twice in time



statues of grecian style

  there were roses both on bushes
and climbing briars flowering
shrubs in clumps and ordered rows
a perfectly round little pool with
water lilies-all luxurious and
lovely though perhaps a bit too for-
mally ordered in the center of this
under a striped awning lounged
lorenzo and his friends on cushioned
seats of gilded wood and leather

  to the four other guests i was
introduced as ser leo his magnif-
icence still shied at pronouncing my
barbarous surname and i bowed
to each as his name was spoken
first there was lorenzos younger
brother and co-despot guiliano the
same cavalier who had ridden with
lorenzo upon me at the moment
of gidos death he was one of the
handsomest men i have ever seen
even as lorenzo was one of the
ugliest

  almost as highly honored was an
elderly churchman with a fine merry
face and plain but rich vestments-
mariotto arlotta the aristocratic
abbot of the woodland monastery
of camaldoli his repute i found
was that his repartee was the
sharpest and readiest in all the state
of tuscany and indeed he jested in
a lively though ecclesiastical fashion

  close beside him stood a plump
courteous young man in his middle
twenties sandro botticelli the ris-
ing court painter him i found
friendly though moody

  the last man of the group and the
youngest was an adolescent poet
agnolo poliziano uglier even than
lorenzo he was wry-necked
crooked-mouthed beak-nosed and
bandy-legged yet for all his
sorry person and ungrown youth he
was eloquent and thoroughly edu-
cated from him i was to learn in

   	botticellis most famous paintings are those
of glulianos sweetheart simonetta vespucci he
was a favorite of florentine society and a loyal
friend of the medicls

    poliziano in later life was a tutor to the
children of lorenzo and remained in the medici
household until the death of his patron

after days much of what a man must
know to shine as cultured in fif-
teenth-century florence

  a young sparkle-wit friends
lorenzo told the others in presenting
me he was thrown my way i noth-
ing doubt with the thought that he
might assassinate me yet am i
drawn to him by the lustrant wis-
dom of his speech as well hang for
a sheep as for a lamb he defied me
yesterday

  he paused while the saying went
around the delighted group from
mouth to merry mouth

  if he is dangerous yet shall i
keep him as i keep the lions at the
piazza del signoria guard me all
of you from any weapon save his
tongue once more he turned to me
what of that sorcerer cousin of
yours guaracco

  to my own surprise i found my-
self pleading earnestly and elo-
quently for guaracco it was as if
i had been rehearsed in the task and
indeed i probably was by guaracco
himself hypnotists i say again
can do such things in the end
lorenzo smiled and seemed far less
ugly

  by the mass i wish my own kins-
men spoke so well on my behalf
he said to the others ser leo
your eloquence saved you yesterday
and today it recommends guaracco
he is dull i have thought but he
knows something of science i am
minded to send for him for all he is
a wizard

  sorcery cannot prevail against
pure hearts contributed the abbot
mariotto at which all laughed
heartily

the equerry who had conducted
me was dispatched to search for
and bring guaracco meanwhile i
was served with wine by a bold-eyed
maidservant in tight blue silk and
entreated to join the conversation
it was turning just then on the sub-
ject of a new alliance of the italian
	wonder story annual

powers against possible turkish in-
vasion

  the threat of the infidel comes
at an opportune time lorenzo
pointed out taunted and menaced
we christians forget our differences
and draw together for our common
safety the sultan dares not attack
us we dare not quarrel among our-
selves and peace reigns

  your magnificence does not like
war then i ventured

  he shook his ugly crag of a head
not a whit it is expensive
and vulgar added botticelli
aye and dangerous chimed in
the poet poliziano

  and in defiance of heavens will
sighed the abbot as though to crown
the matter

  and yet lorenzo resumed 
bethink me that it is well for a
state to prepare for war that others
may fear and be content to keep
peace i have it in mind ser leo
that you spoke yesterday of war en-
gines

  i did was my reply but even as
i spoke i was aware how poorly my
scrambled memory mirht serve me
for instance i might design a
gun that shoots many times

  ha some of guaraccos witch-
craft exclaimed lorenzo at once

  not in the least i made haste to
say nothing but honest science
and mechanics may it please your
magnificence

  in my mind the form and principle
of machine-gunnerv became only
half clear i wished that i had men-
tioned something else

  but lorenzo would not be dis-
suaded from knowing all about my
oft-shooting gun he sent poliziano
for paper and pencils and ordered
me to draw plans i made shift in
some fashion to do a picture of a
gun-carriage with wheels a tail and
a mounting of not one barrel but a
whole row ten or more

  	lorenzo was later able to bring alxut thi
alliance both for peace among the italian powers
and safety fro in the moslem raiders

  it is nothing of particular bril-
liance objected the poet a rank
of arquebusiers would serve as well
aye but if we have not overmany
ranks of arquebusiers countered
lorenzo and gave me a most gener-
ous smile a single man i think
could serve and aim and fire this
row of guns ten such machines
could offer a full hundred shot well
aimed and rightly discharged that
hundred shot might decide a great
battle

  encouraged i offered a variation
of the idea a larger and wider gun
emplacement with not small-barrels
but regular cannon placed in a row
and slightly slanted toward the
center these i suggested could be
so trained as to center their fire on
a single point the bank of cannon
wheeled into position and the fuses
lighted in quick succession could
throw a shower of heavy shot
against a single small area upon a
rampart or wall battering it open

 eight you are applauded
lorenzo it would outshine the
greatest battering-ram in all chris-
tendom

  it may be improved i continued
by explosive shot in the cannon
explosive shot guiliano re-
peated in sharp protest how ser
leo  is not all shot solid  can lead
and iron explode

  yes with powder and a fuse in-
side i said at once though none
too surely

  nay nay he argued what
would prevent pch a shot from ex-
ploding in the very mouth of the
cannon belike splitting its barrel
and doing injury to our own
soldiers

  i had to shake my head saying
that i could not answer definitely
just then

  then answer another time said
lorenzo kindly in the meanwhile
-he picked up my two drawings-
these will go to my armorers for
models to be made ser leo can
draw us other things as well
  he draws notably contributed
botticelli

 evening had drawn on lamps
were lighted and we had supper in
the garden a richer and spicier
meal than i care for there was
plenty of wine and all drank freely
of it not excepting the abbot finally
some fruits and ice-cooled sherbet
were brought and as this dessert
was being served we were joined by
five or six ladies

 most beautiful and arresting
among these was the famous
simonetta vespucci the reigning
toast of florence she was no more
than eighteen years old as i judged
but mature in body and manner a
tall slenderly elegant lady a little
sloping in the shoulders but other-
wise beyond criticism in the perfec-
tion of her figure her abundant
hair gleamed golden and her proud
face was at once warmly and purely
handsome



  all the men were her frank and
devoted admirers i have heard that
the very shopkeepers and artisans
who saw her pass on the street were
wont to roll their eyes in awe
at her loveliness even to fight jeal-
ously over this noble creature they
dared not address

  of those present she appeared to
prefer the dark dashing giuliano
de medici

  i fear that it will be a hot sum-
mer she mourned as she finished
her sherbet there will be little ice
left in the storehouses even now
nay then i made haste to say
ice may be kept through the hottest
months if it is placed in houses
banked with earth i quickly
sketched such a half-buried shed
and also let the ice be covered deep
with sawdust and chaff

 how demanded the painter
botticelli i have known chaff to
be placed over fruit in a shop and so
wonder story annual



keep it from freezing if chaff
keeps fruit warm will it also make
ice cold

was on the point of launching
into a discussion of refrigeration
and insulation but prudently stopped
short it does indeed bring cold-
ness i assured him or rather it
keeps the coldness that is there al-
ready

  black magic muttered abbot
mariotto crossing himself with a
beringed hand

 nay white magic decided
lorenzo for it does good on earth
does it not and no harm to any
creature ser leo do you guaran-
tee that ice will thus remain through
the summer and not perish he
turned to a servant go you he
ordered and summon a secretary
and then to me he shall make
notes of what you say young sir and
tomorrow shall see the building of
such a house therein my ice shall
lie with good store of chaff to in-
sure its cold

  this strange young man is a
learned doctor said the silvery
voice of a lady who toyed with a
goblet of jeweled gold

  does he not know of more exalted
things than chaff and houses buried
in the earth asked simonetta ves-
pucci deigning to smile upon me
ser leo-for so you seem to be
called-can you not tell us a tale of
these stars which now wink out in
the sky and float above our earth
her eyes and her smile dazzled
me understandably along with any
man on whom they turned perhaps
that is why i ventured to dazzle
her in turn

  madonna simonetta i said
permit me to say that those stars
are worlds greater than ours
greater than ours she cried
and laughed most musically but
they are no more than twinklets
full of spikes and beams like little
shining burrs

  they are far away madonna i

said a man if only at the dis-
tance of a hundred paces appears
so small that he can be contained
within the eye of a needle held close
before you so with these bodies
which are like the sun-

  the sun she interrupted the
sun ser leo is round not full of
points like a star

  there was applause at her lively
protest from all the men and most of
the women for answer i took up a
sheet of the paper on which  had
been sketching and asked for the
loan of a pin one of the ladies had
a silver bodkin in her cap and of-
fered it with this i pierced a hole
in the paper

  madonna-i addressed simo-
netta-hold this hole to your eye
and look through it the smallness of
the opening will shut away the
glitter  so you do it correctly
now-i pointed to where in the
evening sky hung shimmering jupi-
ter-look yonder is that star seen
through the hole in your paper a
burr or a small round body

  this is marvelous she ex-
claimed it is indeed round like
a gold coin seen from a distance
the others cried out in equal
astonishment and each must needs
look through the hole in the paper
at jupiter i turned over in my
mind the possibilities of explaining
a telescope but decided not to offer
another foggy theory that i could
not support with exact plans or
models i contented myself with at-
tempting to lecture on astronomy

  gentlemen and fair ladies i
said as impressively as i could man-
age these stars look so small that
nothing appears less yet there are a
great many that are far larger than
our own earth think then how
trivial our own star would appear
if-

  faith cousin called out a voice
i knew you seek to belittle the
world and florence and lorenzo
the magnificent

  it was guaracco absolutely over-
twice in time



whelming in green and gold who
strode forward and paid fulsomely
cordial respects all around

 forgive my young kinsman
your magnificence if he has been
impertinent he pleaded eloquently
then turning to me will you step
aside leo i have a message for
you from lisa

  at the mention of that name a
little murmur of laughing con-
gratulation went up to the effect
that i must have a sweetheart in-
deed i felt a quickening of my pulse
as guaracco and i walked a little
away through the garden out of the
range of the lamplight

  what is the message from her
i asked him

  that was but an excuse to get
you alone he growled i warn
you leo say no more of these
matters of the stars

 but why not i demanded
surprised

  the stars in their courses are
a specific knowledge of sorcerers i
overheard your teaching just now
that-

  i was teaching truth i broke in
warm to defend myself

  i know it he said i do not
think this little mote our planet is
the center of all things but the
old belief is part of my trade i
frighten or reward or guide men by
horoscopes and prophecies-from
the stars do you not show me a
liar else i may smooth your way to
destruction

  i glared at him but in my mind
was more wonder than rage once
again he had revealed himself for
he hid his knowledge and fostered
error for profit only some great
evil wish dictated such action i
need not be too ashamed i feel to
say that he made me afraid

the end of the evening

guaracco did his best to be the
lion of the occasion not that he
did not merit attention he could
charm and astound and inform
lorenzo publicly and good-
humoredly withdrew his previous
opinion that guaracco was dull and
bade him talk on any subject he
would strange philosophy-crammed
conversation intrigued lorenzo as
the jokes of a jester or the gambols
of jugglers might intrigue a more
shallow ruler

  and guaracco obliged with im-
provements upon my discussion of
war machines to my multiple-fire
device he added a suggestion where-
by the crossbows of lorenzos guard
might be improved-a quick simple
lever to draw and set the string in-
stead of the slower and moie cum-
bersome moulinet or crank

  the company praised and ap-
proved the idea and guaracco
beamed he liked it less when bot-
ticelli suggested and lorenzo agreed
that i make clearer his rough sketch
of the lever action

  i perceive - guaracco smiled
satirically-that you also admire
my kinsmans drawing has he told
you of that other talent he hopes
to develop flying

  flying repeated the beautiful
simonetta her eyes shining

  aye that with a machine
called an airplane 

  he used the twentieth-century
english word and i must have
started visibly how did he know
that name and invention i did not
remember telling him about air-
planes but simonetta was already
laughing incredulously

  belike this young man seeks to
soar with wings and reach those
great worlds and suns he pretends

to see in the sky she suggested
merrily a twinkle in her eyes

  it sounds like sacrilege
guiliano garnished his sweethearts
apparent effort to embarrass me
flight is contrary to mans pxoper
nature

   i was a little angry how con-
trary i demanded is it more
contrary or sacrilegious than to ride
comfortably and swiftly on the back
of a horse

  the abbot came to my support
the young man says sooth he
pronounced holy writ sings of the
righteous-they shall mount up
with wings as eagles-and again in
the words of the psalmist himself-
 that i had wings like a dove
surely such flight would not be un-
godly unless it were accomplished by
the aid of black magic

  well ser leo lorenzo
prompted me

   he leaned back in his cushioned
chair of state crossing one long
nobby leg over the other his com-
panions grouped themselves grace-
fully if sycophantically around him
all were awaiting my reply to the
abbots last suggestion

   your magnificence there is no
such thing as black magic i said
either in my devices or elsewhere
every eye widened and guaracco
stiffened as though i had prodded
him with a dagger i remembered
that he had come close to frightening
me not an hour before and deter-
mined to make some amends to my
own self-respect

   of all human discourses i elab-
orated warmly watching him the
most foolish is that which affirms a
belief in necromancy guaracco
glared but i did not hesitate if
this necromancy or black magic did
truly exist he who controlled it
would be lord of all nations and no
human skill could resist him

   buried treasure and the jewels
of earths heart would lie manifest
to him no lock no fortress could
remain shut against his will he

could remain shut up or travel the
uttermost parts of the universe
but why do i go on adding instance
to instance what could not be
brought to pass by such a mechani-
cian

  as i finished there was a sigh a
mutter and finallsr lorenzo struck
his hands together in applause
well said ser leo he cried do
you not think so guaracco does
this not prove that there are no
sorcerers

  it proves at least my innocence
of the charge of sorcery guaracco
smiled and bowed to give the reply
strength if i could do such things
would i be so humble and dependent
a servant of your magnificence
surely-his eyes found mine once
more-nothing is impossible to a
true necromancer

  nothing i agreed except ref-
uge from death

  his smile vanished

  lorenzo lolled more easily in his
chair this bethinks me he re-
marked one matter has not been
settled ser leo is a boy a student
of the arts yet he conquered with
ease my nonpareil swordsman that
smacks of enchantment

  i spread my hands in one of the
free florentine gestures i was be-
ginning to use i make bold to deny
that it was aught but skill

  we must make trial

  his magnificence permitted him-
self another faint grin i must have
shown an expression of worry foi
giuliano burst out into confident
laughter and sprang forward hand
on hilt

  let me do the trying he cried
his gay handsome face thrusting
at me in the white light of the
lamps

simonettas silvery chuckle ap-
plauded her cavalier the abbot
also called for this unecclesiastical
performance to take place without
delay before i well knew what was
happening the chairs benches and
twice in time



other furniture had been thrust
back the lamps trimmed to give
more light and i faced giuliano in
the center of the cleared space
poliziano had run to fetch something
and he came close to me

  here young sir he said de-
fend yourself and he thrust a
hard object into my hand

  giuliano had already drawn his
sword and wadded his cloak into a
protection on his free arm i trans-
ferred my own weapon to my left
arm and at sight of it my heart
sank it was a mere cane of wood
hard and round and of a swords
length such as florentine lads used
for fencing practise giuliano on
the other hand fell en garde with a
blade that was one of the finest and
sharpest i ever saw plainly i was
to furnish sport for this gallant and
his friends and all advantages were
denied me

  because i must i lifted the cudgel
to cross his steel lorenzo grunted

  your cousin is sinister-handed
guaracco he observed belike that
is the secret of his skill

  i fear not said giuliano with
unmalicious zest and he disengaged
and thrust at me

  apparently he meant business
for the point would have nicked my
breast had i not shortened my own
arm and beat it aside cheers went
up from the ladies-then slid into
dismayed screams for extending
my parry to its conclusion as a
riposte i smote giuliano smartly on
the inside of the elbow

  he wheezed in pain and sprang
back out of reach had i followed
and struck again he might have been
forced to drop the sword but i
realized that i had to do with the
second greatest man in florence
and only stood my ground

  giuliano laughed again gods
wounds what a tingler he praised
me ill ward it another time

  forward he came again right foot
advanced his cloaked left arm
brought well up again i awaited

his thrust parried it and drove it
out of line then riposted as before
he as good as his promise inter-
posed the folds of the cloak taking
a muffled tap on his left forearm
but that hurt him somewhat and he
retreated this time i followed him
avoided an engagement and half-
struck at his head

  but i stopped in time fearing to
injure him and make dangerous
enemies instead i diverted the
course of the stroke into a sweeping
moulinet passing over his weapon
to my right and his left and termi-
nated it in a resounding thwack on
giulianos velvet-sleeved sword
arm

  absolute silence fell then a mur-
mur of consternation from the on-
lookers for giulianos smile had
vanished and his eyes flashed fire
plainly the contest had ceased to be
sport with him-my thumps had
made him angry he snapped out a
soft blasphemy advanced quickly
and sped a slashing cut-not at me
but at my stick the edge of his
steel keen as a razor shored
through the tough wood without ef-
fort and i was left with a mere
baton in my hand a truncated billet
no more than fifteen inches long

  no no giuliano spare him
called out lorenzo-but too late to
balk his brothers murderous stab
at my throat

  i managed to parry with the short
length of wood remaining to me
causing his point to shoot upward
and over my left shoulder at once
i stepped forward well within his
lunge before he could retreat or
recover my free right hand caught
the crossguard of his weapon and
wrenched his own right arm
bruised twice in the previous en-
gagements had lost some of its
strength and in a trice i tore the
sword away from him

  at once i dropped my severed
stick fell back and whipped the
captured hilt into my left hand

  by your leave my lord i

panted i will continue the matter
with this more suitable equipment

  but then lorenzo poliziano and
guaracco had sprung forward and
between us the sorcerer caught me
in his arms and wrestled me farther
back his red beard rasping my ear
as he hissed out a warning to take
care lorenzo the magnificent was
lecturing giuliano in the manner of
big brothers in every land and
generation and giuliano recovered
his lost temper

  hark you ser leo i did amiss
he called out to me laughing i had
no lust to hurt you at the beginning
i meant only fun and then- he
broke off still grinning and rubbed
his injured arm i forgot myself
it is not many who can teach me
either swordplay or manners-but
by saint michael of the sword you
have done both

it was handsomely said and 
gladly gave him back his weapon
assuring him that i bore no ill-will
at that he embraced me in the im-
pulsive latin manner swearing that
he would stand my friend forever
the company subsided to chairs
again happy that no harm had be-
fallen either of us

  we wander from the path of our
earlier discourse reminded abbot
mariotto tactfully ser leo was
speaking of a flying machine where
is it my son

  it is not yet constructed holy
father i replied

  as with so many other things the
principle of flying a heavier-than-air
machine was caught only vaguely in
the back of my head i could visual-
ize roughly the form a thin body
with a rudder for tail and outspread
wings-and something to stir the
air

  belike you would strap wings to
your arms suggested giuliano

  impossible spoke up poliziano
are not mans arms too weak for
flight would they not need great
muscles at least as strong as those

of the legs

  i had an inspiration and an an-
swer the muscles of our legs are
many times stronger than needful
to support the weight of our bodies
i told him

  lorenzo eager as always for new
philosophic diversion challenged me
to prove it i asked him to get me a
long tough plank and servants were
sent scurrying after it while i
waited i chose a strong straight
chair and sat upon it a cushion i
took and laid upon my knees when
the plank arrived i balanced it upon
this cushion

  now come all of you i in-
vited and rest yourselves upon this
plank

  lorenzo did so at once and then
his brother the others followed
laughingly not excepting the abbot
and madonna simonetta-ten in all
supported upon my knees only
guaracco stood aloof

  your long shanks support many
hundredweight stout cousin he
said but what does this prove
it proves his argument and the
fallacy of mine handsomely re-
plied poliziano for me as he rose
from his seat at one end of the plank
his legs have tenfold strength and
his arms may be strong in propor-
tion enough to flap wings and waft
upward his entire weight

  then let me see it done pro-
nounced lorenzo with a grand
finality that made my heart sink
i am ambitious ser leo to watch
you mount up with wings as eagles
and i do not forget the other ar-
rangement by which you will make
solid shot to explode

  this last labor which i had been
glad to slight in conversation now
seemed actually the easier

  but simonetta and the other ladies
professed themselves weary of cold
science be it ever so important in
a masculine world and demanded
music poliziano whose voice was
as sweet as his appearance was un-
gainly immediately snatched up a
silver lute and picked out a lively
tune the song he rendered was
saucy and merry and not a little
shocking-but the holy abbot led the
loud applause

  more more cried simonetta

  poliziano bowing low to her sang
to a more measured and dignified
tune an offering that had all the
earmarks of impromptu versification
inasmuch as it mentioned the beauty
of simonetta the magnificence of
lorenzo the ehurchlv dignity of
abbot mariotto and finally the
onigmatic quality of my own dis-
course

  and will not ser leo sing
asked one of the ladies when
poliziano had rrmde an end his
conversation and talents are so
varied-war science debate flying
hke a bird-

  let us hear your voice young
sr lorenzo commanded me

  thus urged i took polizianos lute
altering the pitch and harmony of
its four strings until i could strum
upon it in a hit-or-miss fashion
evoking chords to accompany my-
self the song i managed to im-
provise and sing to polizianos tune
was on the subject of stars so edify-
ing to my new friends and so dis-
tasteful to guaracco since lorenzo
and the others commended it highly
it may not be amiss to set it down

the bombs and the wings

silent as we departed from the
gathering together guaracco
soon spoke

  i know very little after all of
how you live he said but per-
haps i can arrange how and when
you die that song was meant to
reproach me 

  just as you like i rejoined for
my fear of him had quite departed
too i was arraying my spirit
against further imposition of his
will your masterful ways become
burdensome guaracco i defy you
and i paused near the palace
gates my fists clenched

  no violence he warned me i
carry a sword as well as that short
gun you saw yesterday and my
dwarfs are never far away you
on the other hand have not yet as-
sumed our florentine fashion of
carrying arms his beard stirred
in the gloom and i knew that he
smiled but i shall not kill you
leo unless you force me all these
defiances stand me in good stead
in good stead i repeated for
after my temporary semi-hypnotized
slavishness nothing had been further
from my wish than to aid guaracco

  aye that in scorning magic and
upholding science you have taught
me a lesson and few can boast of
teaching me anything of worth it
is time for me to forget my scorcery
pretenses at least where it concerns
my relationship to lorenzo science
shall be my way with him hereafter
-but not too much science you and

i shall work wonders for him the
two of us

  am i to help you i sneered
he shook his head laughing it
is i who shall help you for in-
stance that matter of exploding
shot i saw as lorenzo did not that
you were perplexed but it happens
that i may help you to fashion such
a thing again is it not true that
you wish to return some day to your
own century

  useless to deny that and i said so
and have you not forgotten
many details of your time-reflecting
machine

  equally useless to deny that

  for instance went on guaracco
you have forgotten certain ways to
use this strange new power which
you named to me as electricity it
gives light but how

  i could not tell him

  i shall refresh your lost memory
is there not a certain bottle or
globe exhausted of air-and a wire
of some substance set glowing with-
in-

  i clutched his arm so suddenly
fierce that he broke off and swore in
startled pain

  how do you know that i de-
manded yes i had forgotten en-
tirely but you knew and about
airplanes as well

 let me go he commanded
here come lorenzos grooms with
our horses

  we accepted our mounts and rode
away side by side

  now said guaracco as we en-
tered a dim street lighted only by
the lanterns of a watch patrol you
will remember that i showed you a
pearl a beautiful jewel and it put
you to sleep

  you mean that in my trance i re-
membered 

  i could see how possible that was
meanwhile i braced my spirit lest
he try some other occult trick but
he only nodded as if to check the
point

  i learned things about your sci-
twice in time



ence which you yourself cannot
grasp when awake you shall look
into the pearl again leo and more
knowledge will creep forth we shall
produce wonders for lorenzo win-
ning great favor and possessions
and also build your time reflector
nay our time reflector-for perhaps
i shall make the journey through the
ages with you

  he was sway in me very strongly
but still i resented his absorb ng
mastery of every situation he
seemed to read my mind

  let us not be lord and servant
any more he offered but col
leagues and friends lorenzo is dis-
posed to grant us money for a shop
of our own stay on with verrocchio
lest others become suspicious but
your spare time can be applied to
our own profit his voice became
sly lisa asks after you lad she
would be pleased to see you again
and for all your last words to her
i think you would be pleased too
is it not so

  finally i agreed to a truce and a
partnership after all it was the
only way to escape from the renais-
sance and guaraccos concessions
seemed handsome at the time

on the following day i skimped
my work with verrocchio and
called on guaracco at the little house
where once he had tried to bestow
lisa upon me lisa was there shy
but apparently glad to see me how
had i been able to admire simonetta
vespucci so greatly only twelve
hours before i could not understand
buti did my best to conceal my
feelings guaracco must not bring
that influence to bear upon me a
second time

  as at his house in the country
guaracco had fitted up the cellar for
laboratory and workshop at once
we began work on the explosive
shot which lorenzo had demanded

  at my recommendation we made
it cylindrical instead of round a
good eighteen inches long and six

in diameter bronze being light
strong and workable was our choice
for the outer shell of this bomb and
i cut deep cross-lines in the outer
surface so that it might the more
easily explode and fly in pieces the
inside we filled strategically with
lumps of lead with spaces between
for powder

  guaracco though helpful was as
puzzled as giuliano de medici about
the delay in explosion to be cer-
tain of that delay i mixed a slow-
burning powder with charcoal of
willow wood only lightly burnt the
completed mixture was no more than
dark brown in color and a noticeable
interval of time was needed for its
ignition of this slow-burning pow-
der i made a fuse or match which
led through a hole in the rear part
of the bomb

  the discharge from the cannon
will ignite the match i explained
and the explosion will come in as
short a space as you would take to
say an ave maria

  say an ave maria for the souls
of those it strikes guaracco
laughed with cruel relish

  we also made a more elaborate
bomb its curved sides pierced with
muzzles from which bullets could
be thrown by the explosion when
both were finished-we took only a
morning and an afternoon-guarac-
co recommended that we wait before
presenting them to lorenzo

  i take a parable from the con-
struction itself he admonished me
delay the explosion of this wonder
it will be the more effective with his
magnificence remember also that
when you have given him the ex-
plosive shot he will demand at once
the flying machine

  that was excellent advice for i
was still muddled in my plan to build
man-lifting wings and guaracco
could not-or would not-help me

  i therefore went into the trading
centers of florence to shop for ma-
terials my teacher andrea del ver-
rocchio who had heard little of my

problem suggested as framework
the wood of spanish yew which was
employed by the archers of england
for their superb longbows and was
undoubtedly the strongest and light-
est wood to be had i purchased a
bundle of such staves which i
thinned and shaped by careful whit-
tling and procured strong silk cloth
for the fabric

  my best model it seemed to me
would be the wing of a bat i went
so far as to snare and kill several
birds-sorrowfully for i love ani-
mals- and by manipulating their
wings and bodies i found out certain
principles of flight these i demon-
strated by small-scale models to be
hung on threads and made to simu-
late flying by a strong blast of air
from a bellows a new problem
added itself to that of the wings-
the construction and manipulation
of the tajl as a rudder i sketched
a design like a fan which i hoped
to control by pressure and motion
of the feet

  guaracco professed a great deal of
interest in this work of mine which
took up all my spare time for several
days his interest seemed to partake
a little of superior amusement as
though he foresaw failure but lisa
was kindly and admiring and even
helped in the sewing of the fabric
which needed a womans skill i
joined the ribs of the wings and tail
myself with looped pieces of leather
at the junctures and my thread for
sewing and binding was new raw
silk

  it was late in the summer of 
-the last of august i think-when
i had the trial of my machine

  for greater privacy we returned
to guaraccos country house the
scene of my first appearance in this
age guaracco led the way on his
fine white stallion-i rode the gray
that had belonged to my hapless ad-
versary gido which was later given
me by lorenzo

  lisa had a pretty little mule and
two grooms carried the unwieldy

bundles that held my wings and rud-
der how and when guaraccos
dwarfs made the journey i do not
know we left them behind in flor-
ence but they were waiting for us
when we dismounted at the country
house servants like that pleased
guaracco immensely

after a light noon repast of cold
meat bread and some white wine
i went to a shed at the back of the
house scrambling up i donned my
pinions

  they measured almost thirty feet
from tip to tip and were fastened
to me with light strong straps under
the armpits around my biceps and
between elbow and wrist there
were springy grips for my hands
and by relaxing or applying squeeze-
pressure i could spread or fold the
umbrellalike ribs that supported the
fabric the tail was similarly fixed
to mv less which i could straddle to
extend thp fan or hold close to fold it

  i gazed down to the ground it
seemed a long way off beneath me
stood lisa her face full of apprehen-
sive interest-and at an upper rear
window of the house guaracco thrust
his red-bearded head forth to watch

  ready i said to myself go

  i sprang as i did so i spread and
beat the wings extended the tail
downward to prive me direction in
soaring a sickening airy moment
my face turned up into the sunlight
i seamed to feel the world grow
small beneath me another longer
moment with the touch of triumph
another beating thrash of the wings
then i whirled helplessly in the air
and fell

  i suppose i was stunned there
was a galvanizing shock and dark-
ness then from far away laughter
-the delighted laughter of guarac-
co blending with it came a second
voice softer gentler lisa was pat-
tering a prayer for my safety

  struggling with my close-clamped
eyelids i managed to gaze up lisas
face was close above mine all white
twice in time



except for the dark worried eyes
she had taken my head in her lap

  you are not dead leo she
asked

  not i i assured her and sat up
it was difficult for i was bruised in
all my limbs and the laboriously-
fashioned wings and rudder were
broken to bits

  guaracco descended from his post
at the window and came out into the
yard not icarus himself plunged
so tragically from heaven he jibed

  i rose to my feet unstrapping the
tangled wreckage for a moment i
flew i defended myself the next
time-

  must there be a next time in-
terposed lisa who still trembled
pray heaven you do not seek to fly
again

  she pleads most prettily gua-
racco observed stroking his beard
are you not content to remain on
the ground with hr leo will you
not leave flight to the birds its prop-
er masters 

  but  shook my head stubbornly
not i a bird is no more than an
instrument working according to
mathematical law it is within the
capacity of man to duplicate that
instrument and its working i shall
try again and  shall succeed

  see that i am present to watch
said guaracco chuckling

  but he was more helpful when in
the house i stripped off my doublet
and showed bruised ribs and shoul-
ders his many skills included that
of mixing salves and ointments and
the sticky stuff he applied to my
hurts helped them swiftly and great-
ly

hopes of escape

bombs were a curiosity but ours
pleased lorenzo greatly when
guaracco and  returned to florence
with them he gave us an audience
and later entertainment on the ter-
race of his villa in the pleasant green
suburb of fiesole

  these things would do us credit
in any battle he was gracious
enough to say yet it is my hope to
profit by some more peaceable ma -
vel of yours what for example of
that flying machine

  i make progress

  i attempted to put him off and
guaracco also labored to change the
subject we discussed the summer
heat and the threatened drying up
of wells

  may it please your magnifi-
cence i made bold to say an irri-
gation plan might be drawn up the
waters of the arno could supply
the town in driest season and water
the fields as well

  that would benefit the people of
my beautiful florence said the des-
pot with one of his softening smiles
at play on that arrestingly ugly
face

  again i pursued does it not
seem well to widen the streets of the
town  a street should be as wide as
the houses are high

  make haste slowly he bade me
finish the flying machine before
you turn florence into a paradise
but an early autumn with real
tuscany frost enabled me to ask for
time and a brighter day as winter
came on i lived in florence working
under verrocchio at paintings stat-
ues metalwork and my own devices
in the evenings i had plenty of diver-
sion for the artist sandro botticelli
showed himself willing to become my


wonder story annual

  friend and sponsor in artistic so-
ciety

  i was often entertained at great
mansions one or two times i was
present at informal dinners and dis-
cussions at lorenzos palace and
once at the house of simonetta ves-
pucci herself there i met her kins-
man amerigo vespucci who had
won fame as a geographer and map-
maker visiting him was a tall roan-
haired young man from genoa a
sailor and adventurer

  cristoforo colombo vespucci
introduced him to botticelli and my-
self as we stood warming ourselves
before an open fire of aromatic wood

  colombo i repeated the name
did things to my maddeningly dis-
torted recollections colombo hark
you sir you intend to follow the sea
for all your days

  the roan-haired visitor nodded
and smiled aye that i have vis-
ited the infidel princes to the east
and spain and even england i hope
to go further some day

  go further i exclaimed excited-
ly i should think you will go fur-
ther in my earnestness i laid a
hand on his shoulder ser cristo-
foro i said much of the world re-
mains unclaimed undreamed of
there are whole continents besides
these we know-whole oceans and
shoals of islands it is fated for you
to sail westward to find a new
world

  how a new world  he asked me
a little puzzled

  this earth is round i informed
him weightily it is shaped like a
ball with oceans and lands at every
quarter of it in circumference it is
nearly twenty-five thousand miles

he burst into laughter at that
laughter so hearty that botticel-
li and some others looked up to see
the reason

  i see it now ser leo cried
cristoforo colombo you have been
reading that strange book by the
englishman

 what strange book i de-
manded puzzled in my turn

  john mandeville was the eng-
lishmans name and he wrote his tale
of wondrous travels a good hundred
years ago i bethink me he even said
that the circumference of the earth
is something near your measure-
ment above twenty thousand eng-
lish miles but to my mind it is
smaller than that with indias most
eastern spice islands not too many
days sailing out from the azores

  you tell us nothing new young
sir amerigo vespucci said to me
surely only the simple country folk
think that earth is other than round
and without end the journey of
the sun and stars the dropping
down of a vessels hull at the line
of sky and sea these prove the
roundness of the earth

  and so i might have demon-
strated by a voyage had some prince
given me ships rejoined colombo
wistfully

  i	could not help but assure him
that this gift would come to him in
the year  from the ruler of
spain

  by your leave my friend i shall
wait until that happy day dawns
he said with a bow

  that incident cured me of making
prophecies

  yet i was successful in fashion-
ing many devices which served to
appease lorenzo though i was so
long in perfecting my flying ma-
chine the most popular to peas-
ants and porters as well as to my
companions in higher social scale
was the wheelbarrow

  as to my studies in art i was
able to contribute many suggestions
which verrocchio accepted grate-
fully among them the rather ob-
vious one that a painter or sculp-
tor of the living figure should study

  	the travels of sir john mandeville knight
existed in manuscript form as early as  the
theory of earths roundness common among in-
telligent geographers in the fifteenth century is
set out at length by mandeville who describes a
reputed voyage nearly around the world in his
own time
twice in time



anatomy such study was most dif-
ficult in florence for religious law
frowned upon the godless cutting
up of bodies that should have chris-
tian burial

  however lorenzo once again
showed himself ready to assist me
and i was enabled to visit the
morgue to study and even dissect
bodies of paupers some of my
sketches verrocchio posted on the
walls of his botteqa as ideal studies
and we also assembled on a pedestal
the complete skeleton of a horse to
be observed in making equestrian
paintings and studies

  at the end of winter lorenzo en-
tertained galleazc maria sforza the
duke of milan in lavish manner an-
drea del verrocchio was pageant
master during those glittering days
and i helped him to plan processions
of horsemen and costumed figures
routs balls receptions and miracle
plays even a warlike afternoon of
jousting in one of the public squares

  here banks of seats were erected
all around a cleared space so that
the square resembled a stadium or
hippodrome and various florentine
cavaliers tilted against the followers
of the milanese ruler lorenzo
offered in what he must have
thought a kindly mood to provide
me with armor a lance and a war-
horse that i might take part in the
activity when i declined he
thought  was being only modest

  you are an artist and scientist
he argued and therefore among
free florentines at least a gentle-
man and the peer of any do not be
afraid of lords with their lances

  but i managed to beg off though
the sport was not as dangerous as i
had surmised for one thing the
opposing cavaliers did not dash full
upon each other they rode on op-
posite sides of a paling endeavoring
to strike or push across it with lance-
point against shield or helmet

  for another thing professional
soldiers were barred as apt to for-
get themselves giuliano de medici

handsome and dashing wore a knot
of ribbon tied upon his mail-clad

arm by the beautiful simonetta and
overthrew two opponents other-
wise the jousting struck me as
rather tame

iorenzo took special pride in
j showing his art treasures to
sforza who as poliziano later told
me cried out that mere gold and
silver could not approximate such
riches of the soul and when the
milanese departed they were too
greatly impressed to hide their ad-
miration-which was what lorenzo
had hoped

  it had been guaraccos earnest
ambition to make a friend of gal-
leazo sforza but after a carefully
contrived interview on the final day
of the visit he sought me out at ver-
rocchios bottega shaking his head

  sforza is too absolute a tyrant
among his milanese he complained

  is money not something i sug-
gested teasinglv for in those days
we were on terms of something re-
sembling good fellowship

  he shook his foxy red head
money is little to me-i want
power i want wills to be bowed to
mine cities to rise or fall at my
lifted hand great men to go on mis-
sions here and there with my words
and wishes upon their lips i want
the oceans to shake with the pas-
sage of my ships the continents to
vibrate under the marching feet of
my armies i want to rule

  money rules i reminded look
at lorenzo the founder of his house
was a druggist a simple maker of
pills yet by the accumulation and
wise use of gold-

  gold snorted guaracco it
buys food clothes women wine
music-but of what value is it save
to attract thieves it was powerful
with the medici only through genera-
tions of careful planning and i can-
not wait so long cold steel is the
better metal if held by a brave man
and ruled by a wise one

ib eg an to appreciate something
of the ambition that stirred this
charlatan-genius

  i followed sorcery from boy-
hood guaracco went on because
at first i believed in it as you your-
self once put it a true sorcerer could
travel winds chain lightnings know
and rule the universe even when i
found that supposed enchantments
were but a fraud i remained a stu-
dent and practitioner of the false
art-and i have won some rewards

  you saw my coven of deluded
witch-worshippers they serve me
in many ways-through fear or awe
or fascination-that they would
never dare if i offered them only
gold too a great many nobles and
merchants respect and fear me be-
cause i seem to foretell events can
cast horoscopes and apparently sum-
mon devils one or two are well
within my power i gave a certain
man poison for instance to serve a
certain other man that certain
other man owes me both gratitude
for the vengeance and fear i
betray him	

  but now you follow true science
i said you told me so

  science-and sorcery of a kind
i shook my head there is no
such thing as sorcery

  is there not come with me
once again i accompanied him to
his house nearby the front room
was changed in that there was a
massive square table with a thick
velvet covering extending to the floor
on all sides in its center stood a
great bowl of silvercoated glass

  guaracco drew the heavy curtains
so that it was quite dark in the
room and lighted a candle then
at the clap of his hands the two
dwarfs entered with a great ewer of
water between them from this gua-
racco filled the bowl to the brim

  look into it leo he bade me
as the dwarfs departed

  i did so what then i chal-
lenged him here is a simple basin
of water

  you are sure of that he per-
sisted thrust in your hands and
convince yourself

  again i obeyed him it was water
sure enough and beneath it the sur-
face of the bowl was smooth and
normal

  i see no wonder i said to gua-
racco

  what did you expect to find in
that bowl-the face of lisa he
laughed favor me kinsman by
blowing out the candle

  i blew it out the room fell dark
all at once no not entirely for a
faint filtered glow came up from the
bowl of water

  a chemical trick i pronounced
immediately you have put phos-
phorus in there

  did you not see the water poured
from pitchers he asked but i
make no argument look into the
bowl again

  as he spoke he put in his own
hand and stirred the liquid into
ripples i saw nothing but a dis-
turbed surface like a tiny ocean in
a gale with light beneath then the
ripples grew less slowed finally de-
parted i gazed deep into the radiant
water

  from its bottom a face looked up
at me

  lisa

  i think i spoke her name aloud
and put forth a hand to touch her
forehead but my finger only dipped
into water and guaracco laughed his
familiar mocking peal

  you were deceived for all your
assurance he taunted me quickly
he moved to uncurtain the windows
letting in light see it was simple
i arranged it an hour ago to mystify
one of the milanese a hole in the
table a glass bottom in the bowl-
and under the velvet a couch where-
on lisa lay with a light close beside
her-

  he lifted a corner of the cloth and
lisa slowly emerged

  it was as if you looked upon her
through a window guaracco
twice in time



summed up he saw that i gazed
reproachfully at the girl and laughed
once again

   nay leo she did not deceive you
of herself i put her to sleep as you
know i can do-with this

  he held it up in his fingers-the
glowing pearl that more than once
before had drawn forth my wits
staring at it unguardedly i felt my-
self ensnarled before i could set up
my defense he caught my elbow
with his other hand easing me into
a chair as mists closed about me

  when i awoke guaracco sat at the
velvet-covered table scribbling
hastily upon a tablet of white paper

   you will rejoice he said seeing
my eyes open i took opportunity
to open again that closed memory
of yours

  what this time

  details of the machine you for-
got the time reflector

  at once i lost my resentment of
his sly assertion of power of my
senses full details i cried

   enough i think to build the ma-
chine itself

   and then i saw lisas eyes turned
mournfully upon me as though al-
ready she bade me goodbye

chapter xii
the new reflector

even if i could i do not think i
would set down exact details of
a machine so apt to cause trouble
as the one guaracco had retrieved in
theory from the waste places of my
mind the fact is he kept the plans
to himself and questioned me only
now and then sometimes hypnotiz-
ing me for the questions sometimes
not and there were bits of science
which even he could not digest

  these exact measurements of the
steel frame parts-how can we
achieve them he would ask you

tell me in your sleep of micrometers
yet how can we design a microm-
eter how even knowing its prin-
ciple can we make it without proper
tools  how was the first micrometer 
made

  automatic lathes alloy charts and
welding torches were equally unob-
tainable guaracco did the next best
thing he sought out a master
swordsmith and in some adroit way
-i think his witch-cult helped him
-bound the fellow to his service by
terror and awe this craftsman
with all his tools and materials he
transported to the country estate
and there set him to work pains-
takingly shaping the metal skeleton
of the reflector mechanism

  electrical engineering guaracco
learned from the ground up here
once again i must needs be hypno-
tized and my subconscious mind
probed my partner began with
sticks of sealing wax and glass rods
rubbing them with fur or silk and
studying the effects of the static
charges

  from that he progressed to what
i was able to remember as a leyden
jar contrived by his own cunning
hands after several unsuccessful
trials finally came simple batteries
but here he kept back from me the
knowledge he had mined from my
own inhibited memory he refused
to tell me the acids and metals in-
volved

  when i insisted interruption came
-a messenger from lorenzo asking
how i progressed with the flying
machine

  you reminded him i accused
guaracco in private

  how ungrateful vou are leo
he snickered unabashedly fingering
his red beard go to florence and
make your report i shall work here
in our laboratory and promise you
that i will have progress to show
when you return

  to florence perforce i went
lorenzo received me with some im-
patience in his frescoed audience

chamber at the palace

  well young sir what of the
wings you were making he de-
manded i gave you and guaracco
money for your experiments and it
is high time you made me some re-
turn

  i exhibited my small models all
that i had to show since the breaking
of my first wings he was interested
but not completely satisfied and i
regretted having mentioned aviation
to him yet i knew men could fly i
remembered seeing them in that age
whence i came and which itself was
yet to come-men flying singly or in
parties with the aid of great spread-
pinioned contrivances

  meanwhile lorenzo was giving
me orders i shall see this device
take shape under my own eyes at
my villa in fiesole is a great guest
house go you thither set up your
shop and have sent to you all that
you need work where i can watch

  i bowed acceptance and went to
fiesole there messengers brought
me the remains of my wings and
rudder also more leather silk and
staves while lisa came at my urgent
plea to help with the sewing she
made a considerable impression on
the various guests who thronged
lorenzos villa

  botticelli wanted to paint her
poliziano wrote six sonnets about
her giuliano spoke so gallantly to
her that simonettas eyes took on a
green glow to a certain captain of
mercenaries a spaniard named her-
nando villareal i was even forced
to voice a warning

  the young lady is working on my
machine i told him at my wish
and under my protection she does
not welcome your pressing atten-
tions

  by gods blood he sneered we
were walking in a grove of poplars
to which i had drawn him for pri-
vacy i think ser leo that it is
you who finds the situation unwel-
come

  i do not like it either if that will

content you

  he caressed his long moustache of
black silk nay it does not content
me a whit i shall say to her what-
ever i please whenever i please
few wrords are best i made re-
ply if you speak to her again i
shall deprive your company of its
captain and i turned and walked
away

  he was in a towering rage and
made haste in search of a friend to
bear me a formal defiance the first
he met was giuliano who had not
forgotten the cudgeling i had given
him and the friendship he had sworn
giuliano informed the spaniard that
i was the most dangerous antagonist
in christendom in whose hands a
wand was worse than a sword and a
sword itself a finger of fate where-
at captain hernando villareal left
fiesole the same day indeed left
florence and i never heard speak of
him again

when my wings were completely
repaired and improved i made
a second attempt springing from the
eaves of the guest house while lor-
enzo and his friends watched again
i failed badly tumbling aslant
through the air-but this time i
managed to land upright on my feet
only spraining my ankle my wings
and other harness remained un-
damaged and i was not distressed
by guaraccos ironic laughter

  i count myself lucky i said and
giuliano ran out to support my limp-
ing stens my ankle will mend of
itself but my wings being broken
would take much more labor and
time

  you have not a complete loss of
labor to show lorenzo was con-
siderate enough to say you came
to ground a good ten paces beyond
the house farther than you might
have leaped unaided

  and had you leaped without
wings you would have hurt worse
than vour ankle added giuliano
though he had first disputed my
twice in time



theory of mans ability to fly for
those two moments you were above
ground methought i saw your fabric
hold you aloft it fully broke your
fall at least

  this encouragement heartened
me i shall yet succeed i made
bold to say while a physician plucked
the shoe from my injured foot it
is not the fault of my theory nor
the weakness of my arms i must
learn as a fledgling bird learns

  but my sprained ankle kept me for
days at fiesole where i could prac-
tise no art save lute playing and
repartee among those silken cour-
tiers lisa insisted on remaining
with me most prettily concerned
over my injury after a day or so
guaracco appeared with some of his
healing salves to care for me with
the apparent solicitude of a kinsman
to bow and utter compliments to the
ladies to discuss poetry with poli-
ziano weapons with giuliano sci-
ence and government with lorenzo

  i submit that my young cousin
leo makes progress with his flying
he told the company who can hold
these first failures against him  can
he learn as a science in a few days
the behavior that has been a born
instinct of birds since the creation 

  with more such talk guaracco
helped to convince lorenzo that i
should continue my labors in the
field of aviation i came to realize
it was to guaraccos interest that i
do so he wanted me to stay out
of his way he was carefully arrang-
ing that i not relearn too much of
the science i remembered only when
in trance

  the rest of that summer i was
able to put off a third experiment
with my wings-not that i did not
want to fly but i dreaded failing and
falling agam before the eves of my
patron during the winter i achieved
several substitute offerings

  these included a plan for drain-
ing some nearby swamps which lor-
enzo approved but did not act upon
at once-a brief written outline of

a new system of swordplay for the
palace guardsmen which lorenzo in
high good humor caused me to
demonstrate upon two very sur-
prised and glum fencing-masters-
and a suggestion rather vague
about the use ar i purpose of anti-
septics at whila lorenzo laughed
and which i coud not demonstrate
at all

  i made several attempts at fash-
ioning both a microscope and a
telescope but i did not understand
the accurate grinding of lenses and
nobody was skillful enough to show
me also even when i secured from
andrea del verrocchios spectacle
maker a pair of indifferent lenses
that would serve i could not bring
them into proper relationship in a
tube

  one thing i remembered well from
my century or rather from the one
before it was mark twans pleasant
novel a connecticut yankee in kina
arthurs court i was failing sig-
nally to duplicate the exploits of
that hard-headed and blithe hero
perhaps the yankee being an adroit
and impassioned mechanic knew the
principles of all things from the
ground up

  mv science first of all had been
sketchy and too derived second i
had been too interested in art so art
had been set above my less-loved
-studies in chemistry engineering
and physics and they had been
shoved too far back in that now-
clouded brain of mine without gua-
raccos hypnotism hardlv anything
of real complex practicality could be
evoked and with guaraccos hyp-
notism i was unable to see or appre-
ciate the very things i was caused
to remember

  poor andrea del verrocchio who
had honed for so much from my
drawing dared to shake his untidy
head over these scientific gropings
of mine

  his magnificence will ruin a
master painter to make a convenient

was true that i had little or no op-
portunity that winter to paint the
picture i had once visioned as my
footprint in the sands of renais-
sance time

  as for the time reflector which
guaracco worked on with phenom-
enal energy and understanding it
took form and power as the cold
weather passed us by among the
things it lacked was a piece of alum
large enough to make a lens but the
most notable alum mines of our
knowledge were not far away-fifty
miles to the southwest in the ancient
town of volterra

  at that time however the volter-
rans chose to refuse any trade or
tribute to lorenzo-even to defy
him it began to look as if the only
alum we could get must be secured
by theft or force

chapter xiii
the fate of volterra

here was indeed what seemed
a full stop to our hopes for com-
pleting the mechanism i could think
of nowhere to get alum in a large
enough portion but in a mine true
crystals may be built or fed but i 
did not know how-and the only
available mine was at volterra

  that defiant city was a small one
but plucky and proud with splendid
defenses as i mused into my mind
drifted a few lines of a poem i had
heard often in my other existence

    lordly volterra
 where stands the far-famed hold
 piled high by hands of giants
 for god-like kings of old

  whether volterras defenses were
giant-built and god-begun i cannot
say-but they were tremendously
old and strong walls of rough-cut

	these lines are from horatius at the
bridge by thomas bablngton macaulay the

alum mines referred to are still workable

stone that were said to go back to
ancient etruscan times the city
thus enclosed stood upon a huge
olive-clad height from which the
sea was visible a score of miles dis-
tant near at hand opened the dark
mouths of the alum mines which
were so suddenly forbidden to us
in fact the volterrans forcibly
ejected certain florentine commis-
sioners who claimed a tribute for
lorenzo

  his magnificence undoubtedly
meant what he had once told me
about wishing to avoid war as costly
dangerous and ignoble but this was
too loud a challenge for even his
considerable patience in the spring
of  he called a meeting of the
signoria-the lot-chosen body of
citizens who acted as public council
-for discussion of the problem it
so happened that guaracco himself
a florentine resident by virtue of
that house near verrocchios bot-
tega was a member of this jury-like
group of governors and was present
at the meeting

  i too would have liked to attend
but it was impossible lorenzo had
called for a secret session-proof of
his concern over the matter all i
knew was that one of the signoria
a conservative old fellow by the
name of tomasco soderino was in-
tending to speak strongly for con-
ciliation and peace perhaps he
could restore friendship with the
volterrans make it possible for me
to secure my alum

  i wished lisa were there to talk
serenely and pleasantly to me but
with guaraccos permission she was
visiting a friend the abbess of a
convent near venice

  the meeting lasted all morning
and all afternoon-and at the end
of it guaracco came to seek me at
verrocchios it is all settled he
informed me grinning triumphant-
ly-

  settled  i repeated peace
you mean

  war he replied we take your
twice in time



needful alum by force

   i felt a little shocked but soder-
ino was going to-

  aye and he did guaracco an-
ticipated the end of the sentence
bleated about soft answers to turn
away volterran wrath bleated for
hours i had an answer ready i
told lorenzo that we could not make
your flying machine without alum
and plenty of it

  alum is riot for the flying ma-
chine i protested but for the
time reflector

  he gestured idly with a big hand
do you not think i know boy
but we need alum and what matter
under which pretext we get it lor-
enzo is obsessed with desire to see
men fly my word was the final
ounce in the balance to make him
decide for war

  after that things moved fast in
florence because word arrived that
the town of volterra had employed
a round thousand tough mercenaries
to defend her ancient walls lorenzo
immediately gathered four times
that number of troops and as their
commander engaged federigo dur-
bino one of the most noteworthy
soldiers of the italian peninsula
he did not deign to take command
himself and forcibly restrained the
younger and more fiery giuliano
from volunteering to lead the
mounted lancers but the brothers
did lead the force in procession
through the chief streets of the city

to me that glittering spectacle
was somehow ironic the cavalry
was for the most part french and
navarrese the pike-trailing in-
fantry largely swiss and swabian
the crossbow companies from sicily
the artillery and siege train spanish
the whole cosmopolitan host was

  	this famous general of mercenaries later com-
manded an army that fought against lorenzo
war to these soldiers of fortune was a game
and a business there was no more lasting
enmity between such mercenaries than there is
today between lawyers who may have opposed
each other in lawsuits

sprinkled here and there with scots
hungarians englishmen and moors

  if any element was missing it was
florentine

  yet that was the way the city-
states of italy fought-not with
their own blood but with profes-
sional adventurers perhaps some-
thing can be said for the system
battles lacked the extreme ferocity
of deadly enmity for opposing gen-
erals flrere often old friends and com-
rades in arms willing to win or lose
so to speak on points at any rate
the florentine shopkeepers and ar-
tisans seemed pleased and cheered
those foreign soldiers as loudly as
though a force of native tuscans
was marching away to war

  guaracco as leader of the party-
that advocated strife went to the
palace for permission to accompany
the mercenaries i was with him as
he found lorenzo writing busily at
his desk in the audience chamber

  go if you will the ruler told
guaracco without raising his eyes
from the page i trust that this
campaign is final

  you mean destruction of vol-
terra prompted guaracco like a
lawyer wrenching an admission
from a witness

  lorenzo seemed to hear him only
by half that physician is often
most cruel he murmured as he re-
sumed writing what looked to be a
verse perhaps a sonnet who ap-
pears most compassionate

  to this moment i am sure that
what he said was being fitted into
his poem and had nothing to do with
the campaign even if i am wrong
it was a most equivocal answer but
guaracco bowed as though he had
received specific and welcome orders
then he hurried away

  perhaps i should have gone with
him then but i had no stomach for
battle i felt some uneasy guilt be-
cause with federigo durbinos
train of siege ordnance went my
multiple-cannon arrangement for
battering down walls and many of

the crossbowmen carried weapons
with guaraccos lever improvement
which i had clarified in a sketch

  a day i lingered in the town
which buzzed with excitement about
the campaign a whole night i lay
wakeful in the cell-like room i still
kept at verrocchios bottega some-
thing indefinable made me woefully
nervous dawn had barely become
bright before i dressed drew on
thigh-boots and leather riding-coat
girded myself with a sword and hur-
ried to where my gray horse was
stabled

  it was as if a voice called me to
volterra

  yet for all my strangely-risen
anxiety i could not ride my poor
horse to death i did no more than
thirty-five miles the first day stop-
ping the night at a peasants hut
when in the morning i continued
before i had ridden an hour i met
another horseman galloping in the
direction of florence he was a
half-armored french lancer with
the velvet-edged sleeves of an under
officer also he was three-quarters
drunk and waved a grubby wine
bottle at me

  way way he bawled i bear
messages to lorenzo

  but i spurred forward and man-
aged to seize his bridle tell me
i said earnestly how goes the
fighting at volterra

  he started to laugh and finished
by hiccoughing fighting he
echoed scornfully there was no
fighting

  hows that i persisted

  we marched under the walls of
the town and bade them surrender
and-he broke off to swig wine-
and they did more gulping laugh-
ter over something he deemed a joke
now let me ride on with my dis-
patches young sir

  one word more i begged but
he struck at me with the bottle

  it was of stone and heavy but i
flung up my forearm to save my
head and sustained only a musty

drenching with a prick of the spur
i forced my gray horse close against
his mount shifting my hand from
his bridle to his collar and with the
other hand i wrenched the bottle
away from him

  why is the army not returning
i demanded and shook him hard

  he lost his fierceness but not his
joy over what had happened

  you cannot guess he flung
back with a soldiers contempt for
one who does not understand mili-
tary routine the lads are plunder-
ing what else so should i be
plundering if-

  i pushed the wine bottle back into
his fist and let him go with whip
and spur i sped on my way but
when i arrived i was too late even
if i had had the power and knowl-
edge to divert that misdeed

volterra gushed flame from
within her walls around the
town capered the victorious troops
some of them drunker than the cour-
ier i had met others staggering un-
der burdens of loot even from afar
i heard yells and laughter the
camp a great field of tents beneath
the hill that supported the town
was to the eye almost deserted and
into it i spurred by chance i came
almost immediately to the com-
manders pavilion and there i found
federigo durbino sitting alone

  he slouched forward on his fold-
ing chair his long black-tufted chin
clutched in a hard hand his face
was as somber as his armor was
bright he glared up as i swung out
of the saddle

  you come with dispatches from
florence i make no doubt he
growled ride back and tell that
blood-drinker lorenzo that i will
never draw sword for him again not
if he seek to buy me with all the
treasure of croesus

  what is this drivel i snapped
back is not this atrocity your
bidding in my revulsion i forgot
that i was calling to account the
twice in time



foremost soldier of the peninsula
but he only shook his head

  not my bidding-lorenzos i
have a reputation as a gentleman
and a merciful christian

  to be sure it was lorenzos bid-
ding said a voice behind me a
voice that often had a way of break-
ing in on conversations you my
dear young cousin heard lorenzo
speak to me give me a message

  i whirled upon guaracco thrust-
ing my angry face into his you
dared order this pillage and destruc-
tion as though you were lorenzos
agent

  aye that i did he admitted
with the utmost good cheer you
can bear me witness before ser
federigo his magnificence was
plain-that physician is often most
cruel- 

  so you interpreted his thought-
less speech you murdering dog
i almost choked and out of my scab-
bard i swept my blade draw be-
fore i cut you down and rid earth
of your eternal deviltry

  the red beard rustled in his old
smile of mockery i have no sword
leo he said as though in chiding
reminder i bear only-this
from under the fringe of his
mantle his hand stole into view with
his self-invented pistol ready cocked
even at that i might have fallen
upon him and forced him to shoot
perhaps killing me but federigo
durbino who did not recognize that
deadly little weapon for what it was
sprang up and caught my arm

  do not add one more murder to
this massacre young sir he begged
me it is possible that ser guarac-
co truly misunderstood yet- he
turned away somehow i must stop
these fiends at their hells work
left alone with me guaracco
stepped warily out of my reach-
pistol still leveled it is true that
i urged lorenzos words upon the
army and it was none too loath to
sack the town i have even taken a
piece of loot myself come and see

  at some time during that speech
he had brought his other hand into
view something gleamed softly and
slyly between thumb and finger-
his great lustrous pearl full of
spells

  i fought against its power as
against a crushing weight and in-
deed i did not lose my wits but
i grew tremulous and vague of
thought and let him coax me to
sheathe my sword

  come and see he repeated and
i went with him slowly and a little
drunkenly to a tent not far from
the commanders

  and there he showed me what he
had seized from some volterran shop
or warehouse a great soapy block
of alum reflecting subdued gray
and blue lights lay upon a length of
canvas it was almost exactly cubi-
cal and a good yard along the edge

  i knew that i must get hold of
this piece guaracco told me and
sp i passed on lorenzos orders you
must not blame me leo if i show
scientific zeal

  some worse motive had really
caused him to start the cruelties
but i gazed at the greasy-looking
crystal and its light seemed to drive
out some of his spell in it i saw
even a gleam of hope it would help
me to a completion of the time re-
flector then i would be quit of the
renaissance its frustrations and
fantasies above all i would be quit
of the abominable guaracco

chapter xiv
almost

now if ever can i offer proof that
this is not fiction if it were and
i were the hero i would have tried
to slaughter guaracco there in the
camp before sacked volterra despite
his triumphant exhibition of the
mammoth alum-crystal despite his


wonder story annual

ready explanations despite the pistol
he kept ready in his hand that
would have been the honorable the
courageous the dramatic course

  but it happens that the story is
true and that i was and am of hu-
man clay for two years guaracco
had alternately intimidated and ca-
joled me with judicious applications
of hypnotic influence my ultimate
emotion was only one of hopeful re-
lief if this be shameful so be it

  we left the camp together almost
like friends with some peasant at-
tendants and a two-wheeled cart to
carry the piece of alum we did not
go directly to florence but sought
a rather rough road that took us
around and then to guaraccos house
there we placed the alum with in-
finite care and numerous helping
hands in the cellar workshop

  guaracco assuredly knew more
about grinding lenses than i did
probably it was oijfimore twentieth-
century science he had developed
from his hypnotic interviews with
my subsconcious self too the alum
was a larger and softer piece of
raw material than the fragments
of glass i had worked with in one
day he roughed it into shape and in
two more with the help of the
swordsmith he made of it a perfect
double-convex lens

  this two feet in diameter was a
gray-gleaming discus that dealt
weirdly with light

at length the time came for
the machine to be assembled we
took our place in the same upstairs
chamber from which in that twen-
tieth century which would now re-
claim me i had vanished-the same
where my friend astley waited at
my direction prepared for my re-
turn

  i helped to bolt the rods into a
framework and lifted into place gua-
raccos battery a massive but ade-
quate thing inside a bronze case
worked over in strange bas-reliefs

  i think that case came from the

orient it was to do the work i had
done with many smaller batteries
in my first reflector into sockets
were fitted his electric light globes
most cunningly wrought-again by
guaracco in secret

  they are not the best he said
i understand-and he smiled
wispily as always when he referred
to his findings through hypnosis-
that an element called vanadium is
the best for the filaments inside
it is more than the best-it is
necessary i pronounced that much
stuck in my mind

  he shook his head i have used
manganese that i have come to
believe-again his wispy smile-
is almost as good obtainable too
as vanadium is not he cocked his
lustrous eyes upward did you not
once predict my dear adopted cous-
in that a genoese friend of the ves-
pucci family-colombo-would dis-
cover a new world in the west

   i did

  and is not vanadium to be mined
in those latitudes    just so but
not elsewhere we must make this
substance serve

  he studied the camera apparatus
slipped the lens of alum into place
and secured it with clamps then he
set the time gauge

  may first nineteen thirty-nine
he said aloud and so much allow-
ance for the coming change in calen-
dar which you predict it was on
may first nineteen thirty-nine that
your friend was to bring in a car-
cass from which your structure
wrould be reapproximated eh he
straightened up from his tinkering
now leo do you wish to say good-
by to lisa

  i had not forgotten her rather i
had fought against thinking too
much of this sweet restrained girl
whom i had refused as a gift from
guaracco but to whom my heart
turned in spite of all his speaking
her name wakened certain resolu-
tions i had made i left the room
immediately
twice in time



she was lingering in the upper
hall just outside the door dressed
in a girdled gown of blue and a
bonnetlike headdress her dark
eyes gleamed with tears-like stars

  lisa i called her in a voice 
could not keep steady lisa child
i have come to say-to say-

  farewell she tried to finish for
me and her face drooped down into
her hands i could not but catch her
in my arms and kiss her wet cheeks

  dont cry i begged her dont
my dear listen while i swear to
come back to hurry back-

  we shall not meet again lisa
sobbed

  i will come back i insisted
since this second machine remains
here it will take us eventually into
the age from whence  came and
then-

  us she repeated trying to un-
derstand

  i will rescue you from this cen-
tury and this fantastic world and
chain of sorrows i promised

  guaracco cleared his throat we
looked up and moved apart for his
head was thrusting itself around the
edge of the door

  lisa he said i leave certain
preparations in your hands at this
time tomorrow you will bring into
the room with a machine a slaught-
ered calf-

  turning from the girl as guarac-
co continued to talk i hurried into
the room and closed the door behind
me i saw that the power of the
machine was turned on the light
gleaming blue-gray through the lens
the misty screen sprung up in the
framework once passed it was 
beyond   

  and then i saw that guaracco was
removing the last of his clothes

  what does this mean i de-
manded of him

  he confronted me a naked figure
of baskety leanness i have decided
to make the journey through time
instead of you

  but i- the words broke on

my astonished lips

  no arguments said guaracco
it is too late and he sprang into
the midst of the framework and
through the veil of fog

  for a moment i saw him beyond
in the room as fragile as a man of
soap-bubbles less than a ghost i
gazed waiting for him to fade away
completely but his substance thick-
ened again took back its color i
saw the pink of his skin the red of
his beard the gleam of his abashed
eyes he staggered on the floor as
on the deck of a ship he was still
in his own age the reflector was a
failure

  i laughed triumphantly almost
jauntily and half sprang at him but
he slumped down on a chair still
naked so much gloom had fallen
around and upon him that part of
my anger left me my clenched fists
relaxed my denunciation stuck in
my throat he had tried to trick
me to shove himself into my own
age at my expense-but it had not
worked i only paraphrased robert
burns

the best-laid plans of mice and
men i taunted go oft astray
he looked up and stared at me for
a full minute-yes at least sixty
seconds-before making any reply

  i can understand your feelings
he muttered then as humbly as a
child caught in a jam closet once
more i thought i had tricked my
way ahead of you but i reap the
reward of my sinful vanity

  i was amazed this was nothing
like guaracco do not tell me i
jeered that you repent

  his hand wrung the point of his
beard is it not permitted the
proudest and foulest wrongdoer to
say that he has done ill his head
bowed almost upon his bare scrawny
knees leo let me make my poor
excuses my heart was full of zeal
for what i should behold and learn
five centuries in the future it would
be to me what heaven is to the true
churchman and now without even

a glimpse-

  at last he rose he held out a
trembling hand he seemed suddenly
grown old and frail do not laugh
or reproach i have been deceitful
but let me make amends we shall be
true scientists and philosophers to-
gether will you not forgive and
take me as your friend

  i could not exult over so patently
broken an adversary and his manner
of earnest humility disarmed me i
took his hand at once he straight-
ened up and his voice and bearing
captured some of the old sprightli-
ness

  that is better cousin leo-for
we are kinsmen in taste and direc-
tion at least what wonders shall
we not work together the word
will hear of us

  as he spoke a commotion and the
sound of an excited voice came from
down below us

  i being dressed ran down in
place of guaracco

  botticelli stood facing lisa he
was mud-spattered and panting as
from swift riding and his plump
pleasant face was full of grave con-
cern

  leo he said at once i risk my
career perhaps my life in warning
you fly and at once

  at once i echoed scowling
amazement why

  he gestured excitedly do not
bandy words man he scolded me
begone i say lorenzo has signed
a writ for your arrest you are a
doomed man

  my mouth fe	it seemed to

me a good twelve inches

  it is because of what happened at
volterra botticelli plunged on
that town was sacked because of
you lorenzo wanted alum for your
flying machine

  aye and i got alum-

  rut you did not make a flying
machine with it criticism has
flamed up over the treatment of the
volterrans and lorenzo needs a
scapegoat when guaracco informed

him thart you had used it deceitfully
for another purpose-

  guaracco i roared

  i saw his plan now to usurp my
place at the time reflector leaving
me to imprisonment perhaps death
on a trumped-up charge i took a
step toward the stairs for i wanted
that scoundrels blood

  but botticelli came hurrying after
me and caught my arm i hear gal-
loping hoofs leo the officers are
coming run i tell you run

  at that moment the door burst
open and two officers rushed in

      chapter xv
      santi pelagrini

eliberately i gazed at the
men who had entered so uncere-
moniously you are officers i de-
manded you tire to arrest me
where is your warrant

  here it is

  the chief of them drew his sword
i was unarmed having laid aside
even my dagger for the attempt to
pass through time resistance was
useless and i spoke only to save poor
botticelli from possible punishment
for riding to warn me

  you will get no reward after all

i addressed him with simulated
spitefulness these gentlemen will
take me to lorenzo not you its well
for you that they came your effort
to arrest me might have wound up
in your getting hurt i advise you
to stick to paint daubing ser
sandro and not to play catch-poll
again

  he stared at me in pained sur-
prise then in grateful understand-
ing i walked out closely guarded
by the patrol and was mounted upon
a spare horse then we started-
but away from florence

  did not the magnificent send you
to seize me i demanded of the
twice in time



leader take me before him that
my case be heard

  they did not reply to that or to
other demands we went southeast
mile after mile leaving the good
main road for shorter and rougher
stretches once again i asked where
we were going and what my fate
would be and once again i was un-
answered we stopped that night at
a little house where a grape grower
gave us bread and cheese and wine
and subsequently shelter i slept
in front of the fireplace with the
men standing watch over me in turn

  by mid-morning of the next day
we rode into the seaport of rimini
and straight to the stone wharfs
the leader of our party sent a mes-
senger to call ashore the captain of
a small lateen-rigged ship riding
close in at anchor he talked aside
with this captain and gave him an
official-looking document then i
was taken from my horse and led
forward

  go with this ship master or-
dered the chief officer

  i protested loudly and one of the
officers gave me a rough shove next
instant i had knocked him down and
the instant after that the others had
swarmed upon me throwing me to
the stones of the wharf and pinion-
ing me

  before i was put into a skiff to go
to the vessel irons were procured-
broad heavy cuffs connected by a
single link and fastened with coarse
locks- and clamped upon my wrists
there was no further sense in resist-
ance i was rowed out hoisted to
the half-deck and placed in a closet-
like compartment off the captains
cabin we sailed at noon

  the captain did deign to tell me
a little of what was to befall you
are ordered to imprisonment sir
he said at the fortaleza degli santi

  	this fortress of the holy pilgrims must have
been located off the coast of albania which
country was almost entirely overrun by invading
turks during the fifteenth eentury though no
record of it seems to exist nor any concerning the
order of the holy pilgrims

pelagrini-the fortress of the holy
pilgrims

  i had never heard of it and said
so

  it is a great grace and service to
heaven the captain elaborated
holy men built it two good centu-
ries gone for an abbey but the
heathen turk who flouts true belief
and seeks to conquer us all has taken
the coastline all save this fortress
alone because we would hold our
own even in the teeth of islam it is
garrisoned by the holy pilgrims

  he told me about the order of the
holy pilgrims as well they were
military monks not powerful or
highborn like the templars of the
knights of st john but simple
monks armed and trained to fight
as he described them they had been
originally a band of common soldiers
who reaching jerusalem at the high
tide of the crusades forsook the
world and entered the church after
the ousting of the christians from
the holy land they had survived and
fought on and now stubbornly de-
fended the island on which their
fortress-priory stood

and they were to be my jailers it
did me no good to protest my in-
nocence and my right to justice lo-
renzos anger stimulated by the lies
of guaracco had caused him to doom
me thus to imprisonment and forget-
fulness without benefit of trial he
or any other ruler of the time was
able to do so putting away a man as
easily as he might put away a book
or a suit of clothes i could be thank-
ful that he had not executed me or
could i

  five days we sailed before a
light breeze south and slightly east-
ward over the waters of the adri-
atic i was not permitted to go on
deck but there was a latticed port
and i saw as quickly as any lookout
the two rakish galleys with crescent-
blazoned banners that gave us chase
on the fifth day

  for awhile it was a close race and
	wonder story annual

i thought i might soon exchange my
enforced idleness in the little cabin
for labor at a galley oar then guns
spoke to our front a cheer went up
from our sailors and we drew nigh to
the defending shores of the island
where stood the fortress of the holy
pilgrims

  i was allowed on deck at last i
saw the island as a rocky protuber-
ance from the blue ocean its flattish
top green with growth and but a
single landing place-an arm of the
sea extending almost to the foot of
the great square-towered castle of
gray stone that dominated all points
of the rock a boat was put off with
myself the captain and sme sailors
to row us i could see afar off the
sullen turkish galleys

we came to the mouth of the
inlet and found that it bore
two great lumpish towers of ma-
sonry one at either brink for the
stretching of a chun if an enemy
were to be held off a skiff came
forward to meet us rowed by two
tanned shaven-headed men in black
serge robes a third stood upright
with his foot on the thwrt a cross-
bow in his hands its cord was
drawn a bolt ready in the groove

  who are you he called in a
clear chaenginsr voice

  christian vessel with a message
and a prisoner for you rented our
captain a ierk of thp crossbowmans
shaven skull granted us leave to en-
ter the inlet i could see that the
monks of the fortress wore each a
symbol on his breast-a black cross
outlined in white with a white
cockle-shell at the center emblematic
of church and pilgrimage the two
boats rowed inland to a dock of mas-
sive mortared stones where we
landed

  one of the monk oarsmen went
swiftly ahead with the papers the

 	this chain defense for a harbor or landing
was long a favorite with fortresses as late as
the american revolutionary war the british were
prevented from comintr up the hudson by a chain
stretched across at west point

captain had brought while the rest
of us mounted more leisurely the
paved slope that led to the great
gate of the castle i looked linger-
ingly upon the outdoors which i
might well be leaving for a term
of years if not forever

  there were some goats in a little
herd-a series of rock-bordered
fields where monks with looped-up
gowns wore hoeing crops apparently
of beans and barle-an arbor of
pra-o-nes at the few spots where
the steep shores relented enough to
allow one to reach the seaside
parties of fishermen seined for sar-
dines or speared for mullet

  the big gateway of colossal
timbers fastened with ancient
copper bolts stood open and allowed
us to pass through a courtyard in-
side stood a row of black-robed men
arned wth spears apparently tak-
ing prt in a most unpriestly mili-
tary drill they were all tanned
lan and hard-faed and handled
tfieir nikes with he precision and
dscirline of trained soldiers which
indeed they were into the castle hall
we went then down a corridor to a
plr windowless cell lighted by a
candle

  father augustine respectfully
called the monk who had conducted
us

  someone moved from behind the
plain table of deal planks and stood
up to greet us he was a gaunt
fierce man who wore a robe and
symbol in no way differing from the
others yet i knew at once that here
was the master of the priory

  his shoulders rose high and broad
so that he seemed a great black capi-
tal y of a man and his face dark
as a moors was seamed and cross-
hatched with scars his nose had
been smashed flat by some heavy
blow the right corner of his mouth
was so notched that a tooth gleamed
through and his left eyelid lay flat
over an empty socket the sole re-
maining eye quested over us with
stern appraisal
twice in time



the monk stood at attention and
offered the letter that the captain
had brought father augustine
opened and read it quickly then
spoke in the deep voice of practised
command

  go brother pietro and fetch
giacopo the clerk he shall write to
lorenzo de medici that this prisoner
will be held here as he desires
the monk made a gesture similar
to a salute and departed as briskly
as a well trained orderly father
augustine faced the captain will
you partake of our humble hospi-
tality my son

  gladly holy father was the
captains reply i dare not leave my
anchorage under your guns until
yonder dog galleys of mahound de-
part in any case

  the notched mouth spread in a
smile nay they shall depart with-
in the hour our own warcraft will
see to that we have two armed
boats of our own and not a holy pil-
grim of us but is worth three of the
best of the turkish pirates whose
feet have fast hold of hell i shall
order a party out to battle

  he came forth from the cell that
did duty as his office i noticed that
he limped slightly that around his
lean middle outside the gown was
belted a crosshilt sword

  is this the prisoner he asked
turning to me prisoner i call upon
you to repent your sin

  i dp freely repent all sins that
lie upon my soul father augustine
i replied at once of the sin with
which i stand charged before you i
cannot repent since of it i am en-
tirely innocent the guilty are those
who falsely procured my imprison-
ment

  he is a lying dog grumbled the
captain but i thought that the scar-
chopped face and single eye of the
prior lit up as though he approved
my boldness

  then another monk arrived with
a sword at his hip and a half-pike
upon his shoulder at father au-

gustines order he marched me away
upstairs and along a gallery above

  we came into a corridor lined
on either side with locked doors and
full of a musty sweaty prison smell
a porter burly and black-gowned
unlocked a heavy door of planking
for me and pushed me inside

  my cell was some six feet by ten
with a wooden cot at the inner end
above this was a window not more
than a foot square and blocked by
two crossbars the walls were all
of uneven cut stones the mortar
scraped away around each for the
depth of a full inch-the work of
many an idle prisoner there were
a stool a jug for water a wooden
refuse bucket the door that
clanged shut behind me had a
wooden sliding panel through which
food could be given me or slops
poured forth into a gutter

 when i stretched my hands
reached up to the ceiling overhead
and when i knelt on my straw
mattress i saw that my window was
only a tunnel through seven feet of
wall i looked out upon a sandy
shelf beyond that to the sea

  this was my home for heaven
and lorenzo de medici knew how
long

chapter xvi
captivity

for one reason alone i pass over
the next six years in a few words
that is because those six years were
empty-heartbreakingly empty

  i was not released from my cell
except for the reason i shall relate
i knew no passage of time except
by the shifting of the sunlight patch
on my wall opposite the little window
and by the arrival each noon of
coarse food in a wooden plate and
water in a leather mug this was
the same fare i make no doubt as


wonder story annual

that of the monks who were my
jailers

  on sundays came a cup of wine
and i could hear the intoning of a
mass then i would make a mark
to denote a weeks passing under
the date which i had scratched in the
biggest stone these weekly marks
added into months the months into
years

  i found myself pacing up and
down up and down like a beast in
a cage to break myself of that
frantic habit i spent hours at
calisthenic exercises which served
to keep me fairly fit and at sketching
with bits of burnt wood or
scratching pictures on the wall with
the tongue of my belt-buckle

  my best effort was a madonna
amusing her haloed son with a
flowery twig as i worked thus i
wondered if the picture would ever
be seen by other eyes than mine 
decided that probably it would the
fortress was old and might last for
centuries i might die in the cell and
another captive replace me a cap-
tive who would look at the work of
my hands and muse idly about the
predecessor who had wrought thus

  nobody spoke to me not even the
monk who thrust in my daily ration
and nobody watched me in the
summer of  my second in the
cell i decided that escape was not
impossible

  first i detached a leg of my bed-
stead and with this as a lever
worried the crossbars out of my win-
dow they had been set in mortar
and had sharp points stealthily i
began to widen the narrow aperture
working each night and restoring
the bars by day lest someone look
in from the outside and bring my
labors to naught

  after a month i decided my dig-
gings adequate-but they were not
trying to wriggle through i became
jammed in the window tunnel and
there i was forced to stick until a
goat-keeper chasing his charges
around the walls happened to spy

my protruding head it took two
muscular friends to drag me back
into my cell and i was marched be-
tween them to father augustine

  the prior spoke sadly upon my
prideful and rebellious nature urged
me to pray for forgiveness and a
softer heart then sentenced me to a
term of bread and water-and a
flogging when an attendant came
with a knotted bundle of thongs and
laid them like burning wires upon
my bared back rage swallowed my
reason

  a sudden jerk freed my wrists
from those who gripped them and i
tackled my flogger threw him
heavily and clutched his throat with
both hands half a dozen of the
holy pilgrims as ready to do battle
as to pray dragged me free before
i could damage the whip-wielder

  father augustine had watched
the incident with an appraising light
in his single eye you refuse to
be corrected pronounced he very
coldly

  keep your lash for slaves i
retorted passionately i will die be-
fore i submit

  to my considerable surprise he
nodded understandingly his eye
danced a trifle and his wide lips
smiled revealing other lean white
teeth than the one which showed
through the notch

  be it so he granted in a more
humane tone i remit the flogging
but you must be closer penned
brethren put him in the cell below
his old one

they didso the new prison was
smaller and for bed had only a
shelf under the window spread with
musty straw the window itself
was crossbarred and looked out upon
a face of hewn rock this part of the
fortress was below ground and a
foot-wide trench was all that gave
me air and light

  gloom and closeness were new
burdens upon my soul but i had
gained one advantage-the stem ap-
twice in time



proval of the prior to him i sent
request for a lamp and pen and
paper these were given me and i
had surcease from ineffable ennui
in writing and drawing among
other things i set down in outline
most of the story told here in full
that outline is spread before me as
i write these words and is a check
against my irritably failing memory

  i kept up my exercises too
shadow-boxed on occasion and in-
cised more pictures upon the wall
even so i had many hours in which
to meditate upon the injustice of
lorenzos decree concerning me and
upon the things i would do to
guaracco if ever i came within
reach of him of lisa i tried not
to think

  in the fall of  and again two
years later attacks were made upon
the fortress there was a cannonad-
ing from the stronghold and in re-
ply from ships once an effort was
made to storm us i heard commo-
tion fierce yells the clash of steel
in the end i could hear that the
austere soldiers of the church had
repulsed their assailants and for a
day the castle rang with chanted
paeans of praise

  i grew to have a philosophic sym-
pathy with my jailers they had
acted upon agreement with lorenzo
in imprisoning me they confined
me closely only because they must
if my food was plain my bed hard
so were theirs for the rest they
were sincere worshipers and fierce
fighters the world was full of worse
people

  thus i reasoned but still it was a
desperate struggle to remain con-
tented and sane i tried to remember
the prisoner of chillon which had
one or two stanzas to comfort me
the captive but it would not come
to mind in any case lord byron
would not write it for a good three
hundred and forty years

  the spring of  saw yet an-
other attack by enemies a strong
and more stubborn effort to carry

the fortress of the holy pilgrims i
could hear the battering of a wall
close to me and the overthrow of
part of it so hot was the fight so
narrowly balanced for an hour that
the very jailer monk rushed from
the corridor outside my cell to help
defend the ramparts during his
absence i had time to do a thing i
had long planned to do

  the lamp that lighted me was an
iron saucer with a central clip to
hold aloft the wick i ignited the
straw of my bed and holding one
edge of the lamp saucer in a fold of
my jerkin contrived to heat the op-
posite edge red hot then with a
loose stone for a hammer and the
bed shelf for an anvil  pounded
reheated and pounded again until
i beat that rim into a knifelike edge
after the battle the jailer returned
but he had not heard my noisy
labors and i began to whittle at
my wooden door

  the planks were thick and sea-
soned almost as hard as iron but
i persevered all that stifling sum-
mer i counted myself lucky when
between one dawn and the next i
shaved away as much as a handful
of splinters boresome it was and
eventually heart-breaking for my
first burrowing brought me to metal
i dug at another place hoping to
avoid such a barrier but found more
-more that is of the same sheet

  eventually i had removed almost
all the doors inner surface and
found myself confronted with a
copper plate a central layer
probably with as much wood outside
as i had already disposed of my
tappings and proddings convinced
me that it was solidly massy except
for the small slide-covered opening
for food

  i am afraid i both cursed and
sulked i had no cutting tools the
blunt-edged piece of glass i used
for an occasional shave was far
from adequate even if i had had
tools-file chisel or drill-i would
not have dared use them for the


wonder story annual

noise would attract guards what
then

 acid came to mind-sulphuric
acid but where to get it the
stones of my cell were volcanic
might contain sulphides but how
could i burn or distill them even if
i got the acid would not its strong
odor bring investigation i ap-
proached the problem from another
viewpoint considering not the best
acid but the most available

  chilly fall was upon us and the
sharp strong wine was served daily
instead of on sunday only once
again i was inspired

when my next food was brought
i pleaded for a little vinegar to
medicine a chest ailment it was
brought me in a saucer and i steeped
in it some shavings whittled from
my door when they seemed sour
enough i placed them at the bottom
of my wooden bucket

  into this day after day i slowly
trickled my ration of wine it pro-
duced a greater quantity of excellent
vinegar-at least for metal-destroy-
ing purposes-and after tasting it
i felt sure of my acid acetic acid
perhaps eight or ten percent at the
most

  painfully scrabbling with a spoon
in the trench outside my window i
gained enough clay earth to mix with
water and fashion into clumsy
basins and jars these i cautiously
hardened in another fire and em-
ployed to hold my supply of vinegar
as i increased it also for other
things

  for instance i constructed a really
workable distillery-a narrow-
mouthed vase or bottle suspended
above a fire which i fed with chins
from the door and furniture and
straw from my bed as winter
came on i heated vinegar in this
and the vapor passed through a hol-
low reed which i cooled with bts of
ice from just outside my barred
window the condensed drops i
caught in my cup they were not

pure acetic acid but a liquid with a
high content

  these labors lasted for months i
speak of them briefly saying noth-
ing of the trial and error the
ludicrous failures and the chance
successes that finally made my skill
and product adequate at length
well after christmas of  i be-
gan my attack upon the copper
plate that barred me from freedom

  at the height of my forehead and
again at the height of my knee i
constructed clay troughs against the
metal these i filled and kept filled
with the acid when the action
proved slight i hit upon the device
of adding salt procured by soaking
my preserved meat and then
evaporating the brine to the liquid

  thus i got a crude form of hydro-
chloric acid which made an ap-
preciable impression i constantly
scraped awav the weakened particles
of metal and replenished my supply
of salted acid i wrought for months
and was finallv rewarded when the
last of the copper along those two
narrow lines was eaten away

  the perpendicular acidulation was
more difficult but i managed it by
fashioning two clay tubes at the
edges of the door open at the too
rather like the covered tunnels built
by tropical ants these i filled again
and agam sometimes pulling them
down to nrv out the di crested copper
then building them afresh for new
attacks

  here too  was successful and one
day in february i was able to pry
awav the whole rectangle of metal
within the comnass of my four acid-
cut channels here was more wood
beyond but heartened by my tri-
umph i scraned and chiseled until
the door was almost as thin as paste-
board to the outside view it might
apnear as strong as ever

  at middav of anril   i
made mv bd for escape

  the attendant came to my door
pushed back the slide and stooped
to thrust in my food i had been
twice in time



waiting for an hour tense and
ready as i heard him outside i
sprang bursting through the thin
wood like a clown through a paper
hoop

  landing on the monks unsuspect-
ing back i whipped an arm beneath
his chin shutting off his breath he
could not cry out and his struggles
availed nothing i choked him until
his limbs grew slack then stripped
off his robe i donned this and
pushed him senseless through the
smashed door into my cell

  then i headed down the corridor
cowl over my face his keys in my
hand i unlocked the door at the
end mounted steps and came to an
upper level another corridor i
traversed with measured tread as
though deep in meditation and none
challenged me

  i came into the main hall saw the
doorway to the courtyard beyond
would be the open the beach a boat
i would row away they would think
that a brother had gone fishing
after that i would seek land even
among the turks but a voice spoke
at my elbow

  you pass me without saluting
brother

  father augustine he had fallen
into step beside me i lifted a hand
to my hooded brow and his single
eye fastened upon it

  how white your flesh brother i
thought that every monk of our
order was tanned brown by gods
sunlight who are you

there was nothing for it but
battle i sprang at him

  surprise was on my side i tripped
him and fell heavily upon him but
that old priest-soldier lame and
half-blind was as strong as i as
fierce i clutched and pressed his
throat but he caught my two little
fingers in his hands bent them pain-
fully backward until i quit the grip

  his thumbs drove into the inner
sides of my biceps torturing nerves
between the muscles and i rolled

free of him we came up to our feet
i struck him heavily on the jaw and
his one eye blinked but he did not
stagger or flinch

  strongly grappling me around the
waist he rushed me back against a
wall and so held me despite my
pummeling fists in his face while
a dozen monks swords and axes in
hand rushed in from all directions
in an instant i was secured and
father augustine stepped clear of
me dabbing at a trickle of blood
from his scarred nose he panted
and grinned as if he had enjoyed
the scrimmage

  heres a stout sinner he
growled never did the blessed
angel clip father jacob more
strongly thank you for the bout
my son put him in my office

  there i was kept under close
guard while the chief stumped away
to investigate

  he returned after half an hour
and dismissed the guards but kept
his dagger drawn lest i attack him

  i am amazed at the cunning and
courage and labor of your attempt
he began how did you manage to
cut through the door copper and
all

  i described my method and he lis-
tened with interest several times
he asked me to amplify my remarks
at length he smiled you have
science and inspiration how great
would be your works if they were
turned to honest godly uses

  being held prisoner i can turn
them only to an effort at escape i
replied

  aye that your months of toil
so brilliantly planned and so wearily
carried out came to naught within
short minutes a tragedy father
augustine paused and meditated
then my son what if i gave you
freedom

  freedom i echoed him hope-
fully

  within limits of course i could
take you from that cell and let you
live among us you could work more

science with true materials to aid
you instead of such makeshifts as
you fashioned in prison he gazed
at me encouragingly say but the
word-swear that you will not seek
to flee from this island-

  i am sorry i broke in but i
cannot so doom myself

  doom yourself but you are now
held by iron bars and guards
and by a false charge brought
against me by a vile rascal i
finished for him i thank you good
father for your offer but i live
only to escape and to avenge myself
i cannot give you a parole

  he shook his scarred head sadly
going to the door he called his
monks hither some of you he
commanded we must find this
fellow a straiter prison still

  a new figure pushed through the
circle of black gowns a man in the
dress of the world all parti-colored
hose and plum-purole mantle with
a gay beard and curling locks
plainly he was a visitor from some
italian city

  surely quoth he this is ser
leo the artist and scientist who is
held captive bv order of iiorenzo
the magnificent

  aye that father augustine
nodded you know him

  i know him was the reply
where doth he go now

  to an oubliette i fear from
there he will need winprs to rise
two of the armed brothers had
torn away my disp-uisng robe and
now marched me down steps more
steps to a level of natural rock
where no light shone save a torch
one of them hoisted a great iron
trap-door i looked into a bottle-
shaped pit that was at least twelve
feet deep

  at that moment the upper levels
of the castle wakened to noise-a
blown trumpet a chorus of yells
the two monks turned to look i
tightened my sinews for a desperate
fight against them before i might be
hurled into that tomblike prison a

flying figure came downstairs

  the infidel turks their galleys
blacken the seas come to the de-
fense 

  as soon as we lower this captive
into- began one of my guards

  no a bearded face looked over
the black-clad shoulder of the news-
bringer it was the visitor who had
recognized me bring him along
he will help fight

  well thought of came the deep
voice of father augustine higher
on the stairs free every captive
who can bear aims let them fight
for life

  we all raced up the steps to-
gether

chapter xvii
defense of the fortress

mounting to battlements
around the upper wall of the
castle we saw that the sea was in-
deed full of craft there were gal-
leys a full dozen many smaller
feluccas and open rowboats swarm-
ing thick as a school of mullet
drums resounded from the larger
ships-and horns our own bugles
braved back defiance

  father augustine was rasping
orders like any seasoned captain
man and load each gun he com-
manded line tbe walls-keep
lookout for where they may land
his eye found me ha wrestler
canst use a sword he motioned
to an aide who thrust a hilt into my
hand you have fought your fellow
christians overlong fight now
against infidels

  i shifted the weapon to my left
fist trying its balance at an op-
posite rampart stood the man who
had recommended my joining the de-
fense and to him i made my way

  i do not know you sir though
you know me i said thanks
twice in time



for saving me from that spiders
hole into which they would have
thrown me

  we will speak more of it anon
he pointed to where inside the little
harbor lay a trim sailing vessel
among the boats of the holy pil-
grims yonder is my craft and up-
on it a fair lady who must not set
foot on this monk-owned island i
pray heaven naught befalls either
of them

  but i showed him where some of
our men strung a heavy chain at the
mouth of the inlet that would pre-
vent the approach of enemy boats
which in any case sought to storm
us from the other side

  at that point the wall dropped
straight to the sea and hadbeen
badly damaged not long before-per-
haps in the fight a spring ago when
i had heard crumbling of stones
the brothers had built it up roughly
with broken masonry and spaded
earth faced it with timbers and
logs but it was still the weak spot
of the defenses

  even the stone flooring at the
top had collapsed and was replaced
with planking-while instead of an
adequate parapet a work of earth-
filled goatskins had been laid in and
topped by a great log nearly a hun-
dred feet long from this log ran
back crosspieces lashed on as slant-
ing supports

  here the fire from the galleys was
concentrated round shot tore holes
in the goatskins and let out cas-
cades of the heaped earth while a
blizzard of arrows and slings picked
off such of the brothers as manned
the log-topped parapet the others
crouched low

  they will seek to carry this
quarter announced father augus-
tine sagely limping across to the
log

  his gown looped up to kilt length
showed great steel greaves upon his

  	a log of this length was by no means rare in
the fifteenth century well before the deforesta-
tion of italy

shins and he had thrown back his
cowl to don a plumeless helmet a
bolt from a crossbow struck his
shoulder then glanced away he

	must have been wearing a steel
cuirass under his robe

   aye he called here they come
a hells spawn of boats under their
fellows fire keep down brethren
until they mount our wall then the
fire must slacken and we will meet
the unbelievers with an argument
they will understand

  drawing his sword he spat be-
tween big hand and worn hilt

   i dared look over the log a shoal
of boats swept swiftly toward us
from the galleys boats filled with
gesticulating and howling turks i
saw the glitter of their mail the
curves of their flourished scimitars
the upward jut of helmet spikes
from their turbans a moment later
a jagged little stone sang upward
and against my forehead-slung
like davids pebble from a sling
like goliath i fell sprawling on my
back half dazed and almost drop-
ping my sword

  father augustine leaned farther
from his point of vantage careless
of the rain of missiles

  they raise ladders he cried
here they mount he turned to
his followers strike brethren for
the true faith

  i made shift to rise a little
shakily and watched as a line of
black-robes came swiftly forward
over the planked-in floor swords and
axes and halberds at the ready the
sound of firing had ceased from gal-
leyward as father augustine had
predicted a moment later a
yodeling cry rose from below
ululululallahuakbar 

   one prolonged bellow of challenge
and of profession then the outer
side of our log was lined with tur-
ban ed bearded heads

  the storming party was upon us
eager for trouble nor could they
have come to a better place to find
it


wonder story annual

  the holy pilgrims hurled them-
selves upon the attackers calling
upon the name of every saint in the
calendar hewing and thrusting like
fiends instead of clergymen at their
head and in the hottest press nimbly
hobbled father augustine his
straight sword playing like a strik-
ing adder against a whole forest of
scimitars

  something impelled me in his di-
rection and in good time for him
while his point was wedged in the
neck-bone of one adversary another
charged close and catching him by a
fold of his gown slashed a scimitar
viciously at his head

  the blow was turned by father
augustines helm but its force stag-
gered him and a second effort beat
him to his knees with a whoop the
turk lifted his blade for a third
and finishing cut but at that moment
i hurled myself between my own
steel forestalling his

  he was a deep-chested fellow
brown as chocolate with mad foam
on his black beard

  ya nazarini he snarled ya
bn kalbf

  and he fell furiously upon me
but for all his fierceness i was more
than his match first my slicing
lunge laid open his face my second
bit into the side of his neck he
collapsed bleeding from nose to
mouth to die even as i turned away

  the surviving turks were reeling
back whipped along by the savage
garrison they tumbled down their
ladders and rowed hurriedly away
in their boats under a new curtain
of shot and arrows

  father augustine was up again
glancing around to estimate the
situation

  we suffered sorely but they
suffered worse he commented
what says holy writ blessed be
the lord my strength who teacheth
my hands to war and my fingers to
fight  he turned his eye on me

 	arabic oh christian oh son of a dogrl
 perhaps spoken by a saracen rover

thanks for the rescue my son
yet i make no doubt that with
heavens help i could have risen and
overthrown him whence will come
the next assault

te found out soon enough
three great galleys moved
against the mouth of our inlet our
gun crews toiled madly but could
not batter them back when the
galleys had drawn close a great
throng of little black figures dived
overside and began to swim for the
inlet

  by heaven i see that they carry
axes spoke up my friend the
bearded visitor they will attack
the cjiain if it is cut they will come
in and seize our ships

  a sortie a sortie yelled father
augustine out brethren and meet
them in the water

  he led the rush downward him-
self leaving only the armed
prisoners and a dozen black-robes to
hold the upper ramparts we
watched fascinated from above as
the monks burst from the great
gate hurried down to the waters
edge some of them were shot by
crossbows on the galleys but the
greater part reached the water and
swam forward to meet the turks
there was a fierce clumsy melee in
the waves that lapped along either
side of the chain

  the brethren triumph pointed
out a monk at my side look the
forgotten of god are retreating
swimming away

  they do so more readily than i
had hoped i replied thinking of
the previous stubborn assault my
own words gave me a new disturb-
ing wonder what i demanded
if it were a false attack to with-
draw us from our own defense
even as i spoke i saw that the
galleys were pulling away with all
their oars skirting the rocks nar-
rowly and speeding around to the
point from which the earth-mended
wall had once been stormed
twice in time



  rally rally i shouted and led
the rush across to the rampart of
earth-bags and log

  it was as i had been inspired to
guess the sea was full of boats
again scores of them rowing swiftly
forward to the attack a spatter of
shafts and shot made the few of us
who were left put our heads down

  what is to be done demanded
a wide-eyed brother with a smear
of gore on his chin see their
whole force comes to this side more
than the first time their rush will
beat us back and our comrades out-
side returning from the chain will
not arrive in time to hold the castle

  stand to the rampart hurl down
their ladders stoutly shouted an
armed captive

  as he leaned forward to suit ac-
tion to word a crossbow bolt
whacked into him and he crumpled
across the log dead the rest of us
crouched low swords in hand de-
termined to die hard

  i found myself kneeling beside
one of the lashed crosspieces that
propped the great log which was our
temporary coping it was none too
firm that crosspiece i judged and
again i was inspired

  hark ye all i cried at the top
of my voice we can save ourselves
form in parties by these cross-
pieces clutch them in your arms
if we bear with all our strength at
once it will force the great log for-
ward and outward

  to what good demanded an-
other

  to overthrow the ladders as we
cannot with such a fire against us
do not argue friends but do as i
say

  there was no time or hope other-
wise in a trice we formed in half a
dozen knots all crouching or kneel-
ing our weapons flung down and
our arms wrapped around the cross-
timbers

  whoops and execrations rang
from beneath us where the ladders
were being reared from the boat

bottoms to give access to our
fortress i felt my heart race like a
drum-roll but kept my eyes steadily
on the parapet where the spiked
ends of the ladders showed

  allahuakbar thundered the
enemy and again a row of heads shot
up into view

  now i shouted my loudest and
taxed all my muscles to drag for-
ward on the crosspiece i clutched

  there was a concerted grunt from
every defender as we bore mightily
against the log and as i had dared
hope so it was the mass of timber
slid gratingly forward as a drawer
slides from a bureau with it swayed
the storming ladders so precariously
balanced they toppled a single
concerted shriek assailed heaven
from the many throats of those who
were suddenly hurled back down
among the boats and into the surf

  dragging back our timber defense
we cheered each other in wild and
thankful joy

  that unexpected reverse gave the
moslems pause-a blessed blessed
pause-enough for the return and
remarshaling of the swimming
sortie led by father augustine he
clapped my shoulder with a hard
hand

  you have saved this holy place
he told me and if it were in my
power to free you-

  he turned away to thunder new
orders i stood alone for the moment
then a hand clutched my sleeve i
turned to see the bearded man
whose name i did not know but who
knew me the man whose boat was
in the little harbor below

  come he said softly if he
cannot give you liberty i can

  how i demanded hope pound-
ing in my breast

  he did not pause to reply but drew
me with him to the stairs and down
we went unchallenged through the
lower part of the castle and came
to the gate he unfastened it and
we stepped outside

  see he bade me the turkish
wonder story annual

boats have all gone around to the
other side hoping to make good that
assault which you foiled now is
my time to flee i have too fast a
ship for them to catch and i will
take you along

  i was too amazed and thankful
to speak a moment later we had
hurried down sprung abroad his
half-decked sailing vessel and were
headed out for that quarter of the
sea just now unguarded by either
holy pilgrim or infidel turk-the
sea beyond which lay the italy from
which i had been carried captive
six years before

chapter xviii
return to florence

just as soon as my feet were on
deck my enigmatic friend hustled
me into the cabin where he left me
alone i heard his shouted orders on
deck felt the ship move we sailed
out unchallenged and unchecked
and headed northwest i heard the
muffled noise of a fresh attack on
the fortress but we were not pur-
sued

  after some time the master of the
vessel appeared he offered me a
razor with which i thankfully took
my first decent shave a mirror
showed me my face smooth again
but no longer fresh and boyish my
brow avas cleft with a brown mark
my nose and chin had hardened and
my eyes blazed with challenge and
truculence over one temple rose a
purple bump where the turkish
slinger had struck me not a pretty
face

  my rescuer was offering me new
clothes i pulled on dark green hose
and a velvet doublet then looked in
surprise at the cloak he offered-a
cloak of florentine scarlet

  why it-it is mine i cried
it was given me by-

  by guaracco he supplied yes
from him i took it

  but guaracco caused my im-
prisonment i protested

  he now causes your release
was the answer he knew through
spies that the turks would attack
he arranged that i come to the
fortress in good time for that event
with instructions to help you escape
it took but a word to draw you out
of your cell and into the ranks of the
defenders after that- but you
will know all anon stay in this
cabin for it would be ill for any
sailor to see you and gabble in port

  i stayed perforce all that day
and for some days following we
talked no more about my strange
rescue and i could learn nothing
at all of the reason for it at last
on the morning of april th we
docked peeping through a porthole
i watched the mariners tie us up to
the pilings

  i raked the shore with my eyes on
the lookout for guaracco i won-
dered what i would find to say to
him

  in the midst of this my companion
entered here is a fellow-passenger
of yours whom i at last show you
he said

  with him was a slender figure
cloaked and masked as at a carni-
val saying nothing this figure
handed me a folded and sealed
parchment on the outside was the
address written in the fashion of
the time

this to the hand of my
kinsman leo

quickly

  wondering i broke the seals and
read

  my dear cousin and partner

  do not think me neglectful if i
have left you like a dagger in a
sheath until the time was ripe to
use you for the ill you have known
twice in time



at my hands  now make full
amends i have prospered in flor-
ence and power shall be mine and
yours come and aid me as i shall
aid you

	guaracco

  i looked up again with an ex-
clamation the figure had unmasked
and dropped the cloak it was lisa
her deep dark eyes looked into mine

  i have come to take you back to
florence she said mechanically

  i stared at her and my eyes must
have been like those of a frog what
is the matter lisa i asked

  because something was the
matter she seemed to move and
talk in a dream

  i have come to take you back to
florence she said again

  guaracco had done it-had put
his spell upon her and sent her here
nay he had sent her all the way to
the perilous fortress to assure my
own obedience to his call i gazed
at the letter crumpled it in my hand
it was baleful foreshadowing tricks
and traps

  will you come lisa asked

  she spoke in the measured tone
she might have used when purchas-
ing meat from a butcher her eyes
were upon me drawing my gaze to
them but they only half knew me

  i could not refuse guaracco had
known as much when he had sent her
after me in this state i felt fear
and rage and mystification but i
could not send her back alone

  come i said and flung my red
mantle around me

  we went ashore another fa-
miliar figure was on the dock-a
tiny figure guaraccos uglier dwarf

  welcome he greeted me softly
our horses are ready at yonder
hostlers he silenced my question
with a finger on his twisted lip
guaracco will tell you all trust
him

  trust guaracco i did not know
whether to laugh or curse

  we rode swiftly away in the

brightening morning lisa and the
dwarf and i

the horses were good and i found
mine easy to manage for all i had
not put foot in stirrup for six years
lisa must have worn mens clothes
beneath her long cloak for she rode
cross-saddle and she neither spoke
to me nor looked at me the dwarf
led the way hunched over his mount
like a trained monkey

   we took the road that once i had
galloped with lorenzos officers
this time we paused once at an
inn where fresh horses awaited us
we changed to them and took a cup
of wine and some bread and goats
cheese as we sat in our saddles
eventually as sunset came we rode
into the valley of the arno and in
the dying daylight i saw florence
yet again a white city caught mid-
way on the silver cord of the river
with green fields all around

  but as we came near a gun
sounded and the dwarf grumbled
that a watch would be set at the
gates for my sake he said we
must not enter there i might be
recognized for all the change in my
appearance

   we turned therefore into the yard
of a waterside house above the city
where our hideous little guard whis-
pered to certain acquaintances of
his we left our horses and boarded
a small barge it dropped downriver
with us drifted stealthily within the
walls and under the bridges came at
last to a wharf where we disem-
barked

  almost immediately at hand was a
house i knew the house where
guaracco had once offered me the
hand of lisa where we had experi-
mented and quarreled together
where he must now be waiting for
me we walked along the street that
led to the front door and there at
the door we paused still lisa did
not speak

  knock the dwarf bade me

   as i did so i divined the presence


wonder story annual

within of a watcher but there was
no response no audible movement
even it was only when lisa
prompted like me by our companion
spoke her name aloud that we heard
a clang of bars and the door opened
a trifle to show a face

  it was guaraccos other dwarf
the handsome one who acted as
porter the ugly little man came
close to my side both of them held
drawn swords and their eyps turn-
ing up to me were bright and hard

  come in whispered the one who
acted as porter they wait for
you

  i started to speak to lisa but she
was walking around the side of the
house i entered the front hall to
learn what lay in store for me

  there stood a sizeable oblong
table littered with papers find men
sat in chairs along its sides seven
of them guaracco alone t know and
he stood up at the hed of thp board
his face toward rnp he did nt sppui
changed in so rtich as a red hair of
his beard or a gaunt line of his
figure at sight of me he cried out
as if in joy and bustled around the
table to me before i could move he
caught me in his arms most affec-
tionately

  my cousin my cousin he was
saying and his grin was wthin six
inches of my face yon  nve come
as t begged to help me in my great
triumph

  his right arm clasping- me around
the body had slid under my loosened
mantle now it pressed something
against the middle of mv back-
something round and iron-hard the
muzzle of a gun if t moved quickly
or denied him i would die on the
instant

  with that pistol-bearing hand
urging me forward as though he
still embraced me he led me to the
head of the table and there kept me
beside him

  this is my kinsman leo gentle-
men he introduced me to the com-
pany he is the man i told you of

whose wonders you have heard me
speak of in times past he has more
scientific miracles at his fingertips
than ail the saints in the calendar
i know him said a fragile
shifty-eyed man in black and crim-
son he was once pointed out to
me at the palace and it was said
that lorenzo set great store by him
are you then satisfied guarac-
co asked the company with him as
our helner thereafter can we fail
if he is true to us- offered
another

  i vouch for that promised gua-
racco his gun prodding me

  their silnnce iae him consent
and he went on all is agreed then
bv this tlnp tomorrow night we
shall be in full nossession of flor-
ence in a portion to dictate to tus-
canv as a whole the oppressors
will have shd thpir inst drop of
blood the magistm tp will sneak and
act only as wp see fit to bid them
hif eifbip relaxpd his pistol
csed to d nfo my hph bone but
i knew that it was still at the ready
in his hand

  the peonlp asked a thickset
man in a leather doublet his eyes
burned from undpr black brows the
widh of a thumb

  the people will oftpr no trouble
even if we cannot rouse them gua-
racco returned was it not you
captain montesecco who have had
charge of gathering two thousand
hired soldiers outsidp the walls

  i had charge and  have done so
repiph the man addressed as cap-
tain montesecco it is well we strike
at once ere so many armed men
cause suspicion yet florentines are
many and valiant-

 we can count on many sup-
porters in the city interrupted the
fragile man in black and crimson
we pazzi have servants and de-
pendents to the amount of several
hundred our houses are close to-
gether in one quarter and a rising
of our household would mean the
rising of all that part of florence
twice in time



as he mentioned his family name
i was able to identify him as
francesco de pazzi he was one of
the family of florentine bankers
not as rich or powerful as the medici
but as ambitious

  all of us stand ready he was
continuing with influence men and
arms-all that is but my cousin
guglielmo you er guaracco ad-
vised against telling him of our
plan

  guaraccos rufous head nodded
he is married to t orenzos sister
later with his brother-in-law and
the rest out of the way gugbelrao
will be glad to join us but not now
your uncle giac-opo the head of the
pazzi-what is his temper tonight
of course i did not bring him
here said francesco de pazzi for
he has archaic ideas about fair play
howbeit he know that there is to
be an arising against the medici
whom he has ever hated as upstarts
and thieves he will lead the muster
of our men

  another of the group about the
table gave a little nod of approval
te was tall and high-shouldered a
scraggy-necked fellow in a purple
houppelande and he had a shallow
pinched jaw like a trowel

  what is my task he inquired
eagerly as though concerned lest
all the blood be spilt by other hands

  a task worthy of francesco sal-
viati of pisa guaracco flattered
him i rely upon your eloquence
and courage either may suffice-
both will be invincible

  you intend said pazzi to as-
sign him to the palace

  guaracco nodded i shall put
some of my best blades in your
charge salviati he announced at
the appointed time go to the palazzo
publico where the magistrates live
and sit in judgment i will draw a
diagram

  dipping pen in ink he began to
sketch on a white sheet for all to
see once up the stairs he in-
structed you come into a hall

there ask the guard to summon the
magistrate of the day while he is
gone let your men pass through
this door which you will see upon
your left hand

  it leads to an antechamber large
enough for them all to wait the
magistrate will arrive and you will
tell him that liberty is at hand for
florence if he will he can join us
if not call forth your band to make
him see wisdom

  and my assignment prompted
another one of three who sat to-
gether at the right hand of guarac-
co he was a youngish hook-nosed
fellow in good clothes with a look
about him of fine breed-ng gone to
seed i have a sure hand with a
dagger

   mind it well ser bernardo
guaracco sad and smiled you and
ser francesco de pazzi will strike
down giuliano and see that he does
not rise again have i your approval
bernardo bandini it was plain
that he had it and he turned his
smile toward captain montesecco
our friend the captain promises to
deal lorer  his death

  an i miss stroke may my sword
arm wither vowed the sturdy sol-
dier

  meanwhile-guaraccos eyes
slid toward me-we have with us a
fighter the nonpareil of any leo my
kinsman known as luca the ad-
miral for freebooters who has lashed
the moslems to their kennels for six
years he is famed admired and
knows more about warfare than any
man living i will place him as our
general

      chapter xix
      the conspiracy

quite well i knew now why
guaracco had thought to drag
me into his scheme he would serve


wonder story annual

himself with my brains and skill as
so often before it was one more
item that made his plot complete
even i within minutes saw how the
rebellion would succeed

  the conspiracy was not for a
single blow but several all accom-
plished at the same moment lo-
renzo and giuliano the heads of the
medici were to be assassinated the
palazzo publico would be seized and
the officers there taken into custody
by armed men

  the adherents of the plotters
would rise in an impressive manner
swaying the unsuspecting and per-
haps dissatisfied citizenry by their
cries and promises and to guard
against the forming of a violent
resistance two thousand merce-
naries were ready to march into the
city

   it could not fail with the fall of
lorenzos power my exile and dan-
ger would be past yet my para-
mount impulse was to cry out against
so ruthless a measure

  but if i spoke so my life would
be forfeit i would not live to get
out of the room i remained silent
while captain montesecco asked
when and where the medici brothers
were to be struck down

  tomorrow morning said gua-
racco at church

  church repeated the captain

  aye tomorrow is sunday you
will remember we cannot be sure
of getting them together at any
other time cardinal riario is to
say mass at the cathedral which
will insure their attendance we
will be ready for them each nearest
his man at the moment when the
hose is elevated and all attention
directed thither-

  nay the leather-clad figure
started from the chair monteseccos
black brows lifted into horrified

  	cardinal riario was a nephew of sixtus iv
then pope of rome some have tried to connect
him with the pazzi conspiracy but the great mass
of evidence shows that he had no other connection
than that a cardinals presence at the cathedral
would insure the presence of the two brothers
medici

arches i cannot draw swords at
that holy moment god would be
watching me

guaracco chuckled and so did
francesco salviati the trowel-
jawed man in purple but monte-
secco was not to be laughed out of
his impulse

  i have sworn to help he ad-
mitted and i shall do so or my
name is not giovanni battista mon-
tesecco i will command the merce-
naries raid the palace help to rouse
the city-but i cannot and will not
do murder in the cathedral

  the man of blood shows himself
blood-drawn sneered pazzi

  say you so gritted the captain
if you will take a sword in hand
messer francesco you will end up
more blood-drawn than i

  but guaracco caught monteseccos
leather-clad shoulder in a big placat-
ing hand none call you coward
ser giovanni he assured the mer-
cenary withdraw this part of it
if you will-none will blame you-
and we can use your talents else-
where bernardo bandini you are
still ready to deal with giuliano
guaraccos wise glance shifted to
the two men who had not yet spoken
both were clad in black and their
faces were somber to match

  what do you say antonio maf-
fei methinks you lived once in
volterra which lorenzo saw fit to
sack and destroy

  my mind leaped back to volterra
guaracco had managed its destruc-
tion primarily so as to get a crystal
of alum for our unsuccessful time
reflector but he must have made
other plans in connection with that
apparently senseless cruelty for
one he had discredited me when i
might have been a stumbling block

  he was able now also to use the
incident against lorenzo for an-
tonio maffei was saying with growl-
ing relish that the scent of lorenzo
de medicis blood would smell sweet
to the saints in heaven
twice in time



  he is a devil he garnished the
conceit and merits urging to hell
your gossip stefano da bagnone
there will help you asked guarac-
co you make a sign of assent
stefano as i take it and i may
provide a third for your dagger
party again he glanced sidelong
at me we need not speak further
tonight gentlemen let us meet early
on the morrow and then to work

he let them out by a rear door
of the group he detained fran-
cesco de pazzi for a moment advis-
ing him strongly to keep an eye on
captain montesecco who had turned
strangely squeamish for a profes-
sional killer then when all were
gone lie wheeled upon me with a
sultry grin of welcome

  welcome- home lad he cried
fine things are to be our doing
within the twenty-four hours
murder you mean i flung at
him anarchy riot i walked
close to him lisa under your
power of will brought me hither i
demand that you free her and at
once she and i will depart before
another hour is passed

  i think not he said in his fa-
miliar easy manner of a master but
 snarled in scorn

  i am vastly different from the
man you lyingly accused to lorenzo
i am a killer bring on your dwarfs
and see if they frighten me i came
here only to take lisa away and by
the saints i shall do so

  lisa he repeated where is
she

  and i realized that i did not know
i was beforehand with you he
continued i hold her hostage for
your good will and support yet
all may be well he waved toward
a chair sit down

  i did so and he talked the pazzi
he said powerful and extravagant
were on the verge of bankruptcy
they slavishly sought to work under
him for overthrow of the medici
forgetting that when the overthrow-

ing was complete guaracco would
rule through them and could in good
time overthrow them also

  florence is as good as mine to-
night he said after florence
other states all italy he beck-
oned come

   he led the way down some rough
stairs to the cellar where we had
once worked together it seemed
stocked with firewood until he kin-
dled a lantern then i saw the stacks
were of weapons

  there were rifles and bayonets
boxes of grenades machine guns
canisters that must hold high ex-
plosives and many another baleful
thing toward guaracco i turned
a wondering face and he laughed the
old superior laugh

  i quarried theseweapons or the
knowledge to make them from that
bemused mind of yours leo i had
two years to delve into your trances
six more to forge and fashion what
ordinary army could stand against
me

  you have soldiers i asked him
when first you came you saw the
worshipers i governed by tricks of
deviltry those and more like them
will rally at my call to use these
arms after that-but leo you
cannot demur longer you and i
cannot succeed without each other
again he plunged ahead with the
wild sketch of his plans after the
subjugation of italy the subjuga-
tion of france and spain-a united
and submissive europe would toil
for guaracco its lord of lords
cristoforo colombo would be sought
out given his fleet and sent to
america to win its wealth

  once you fancied such an em-
pire he reminded me am i not
the true master sorcerer with whom
all things come to pass

  not all things i demurred i
remember that i foretold the defeat
for such a master-death it will
come to you

  his eyes turned frigid seek not
to kill me unless you want to lose


wonder story annual

lisa join me and she is yours
otherwise i may give her to bernar-
do bandini for stabbing giuliano
or i might use her to persuade that
overgodly mercenary montesecco
you can have her only if you are my
devoted lieutenant

  lisa loves me i said stoutly

  only at my bidding my will
commands her

  i gazed at him as though i had
never seen him before not that i
had not known him from the first
day as a dangerous scoundrel not
that i had not always hated and
feared him but at last i knew that
i must not delay he must die for
the sake of lisa and myself and
all the world

  in one motion i bared my sword
and darted it at jjim he reeled back
with a cry but no blood came my
point had turned against a concealed
shirt of mail he extended his arm
dangling the lantern above an open
cask

  there is powder inside he
warned attack and-

t hesitated only a second then

  turned at the sound of pattering
feet his two dwarfs were at me
ducking under the sweep of my
sword to close in but i brought
down the pommel of my weapon
upon the head of the hunchback even
as he shortened his own blade to
thrust down he fell and i sprang
across him and darted upstairs

  lisa lisa i cried only the
roared curses of guaracco answered
me he was pursuing a rifle in his
hands

  you cannot catch me i yelled
on inspiration i go back to my
prison

  i gained the front door and ran
out away i fled past verroc-
chios bottega around a corner to a
broader street and toward the heart
of florence for i had only pre-
tended that i was fleeing the city

  what now seek lorenzo and
warn him dared i show my face

to him ahead of me loomed the
palazzo publico destined for a stir-
ring scene of tomorrows uprising
i had a sudden hope and plan

  unbuckling my sword i hid it in a
bush boldly i went to a side door
and knocked a porter opened to me

  i am the locksmith i said i
come to fix the antechamber door

  i heard no orders he temporized
but allowed me to enter and mount
the stairs to the upper floor

  here were a reception hall and a
door opening to the left guaracco
had designated it as an ambush for
the bravos who would follow fran-
cesco salviati i examined its heavy
lock and with my dagger made shift
to drag it partially from the door
still watched by the suspicious
porter i tinkered with its inner
works

  now it will serve i told him
and went my way

  to all appearances i left the lock
as it had been but i had bent a
spring and pried out a rivet any
man or men going into that room
and closing the door behind could
not get out again without the aid
of even a better locksmith than i

  after that i sought a livery stable
and with the few coins that were
left in my pouch hired a horse
somehow i wheedled my way past
the watch at a gate and made the
best time darkness would allow to
the old familiar country house
which guaracco still kept

  a single caretaker opened to my
thunderous knocking without cere-
mony i drew my sword and swore
to cut out his liver if he forestalled
me by word or deed he tremblingly
made submission and i locked him
in a closet then i took a lamp down
to the cellar workshop where gua-
racco had tested my scientific knowl-
edge on our first day of acquaint-
ance

  it was in a dusty turmoil but in
a corner among odds and ends of
machinery was what i had hoped to
find-the remains of our unsuccess-
twice in time



ful time reflector i checked the bat-
tery found it in bad shape but
materials were at hand to freshen
it when i had restored it to power
i procured salt from the kitchen
and mixed a great basin of brine
finally i attached two wires to the
terminals of the battery and thrust
their ends into the liquid

  i watched carefullv electrolysis
commenced the bubbles that rose
at the negative wire would be liber-
ated hydrogen those at the positive
end were what i wanted from a
bench i brought a glass bottle hold-
ing more than half a gallon filled it
with brine and inverted it above
the stream of bubbles

  steadily the gas crowded out the
salt water showing greenish yellow
i stoppered the bottle as it filled
then charged a second and a third
finally i drew the wires out the
bottles had earlike rings at their
necks and i strung them on a girdle
under my cloak

  they were now a weapon for me
that guaiacco had not dreamed of-
for i had produced chlorine gas such
as had poisoned armies in the first
world war the war that was still
centuries ahead of me

  as i finished the work sunday
dawned grayly i released the fright-
ened caretaker and rode once more
to florence

chapter xx
turmoil

undoubtedly as i have said
 ii duomo-saint marys of the
flower-was the second cathedral
in sill christendom i was there gas-
bottles and all the next morning be-
fore cardinal riario began to say
mass

  i tried to lose myself among the
throngs of worshipers who strolled
most informally among the banks of

seats in the octagonal choir space
beneath the great open dome

  for once i was glad of the natural
darkness that clung in the cathedral
lighted only by the ornate upper
windows

  at the high altar the cardinal
young and handsome for all his high
dignity was intoning the service
i found a shadow beside a carved
wooden screen and tried to shrink
my height by bowing my shoulders
unh-r my mantle

  more worshipers appeared and
more brave in all the colors and
fabrics of sabbath costume a tall
ruddy head and beard showed among
them-guaracco i saw at once in
my heart i prayed that he would
fail to see me and he did he was
looking for other things and perhaps
he believed that i had indeed fled
florence

  then on the other side of the choir
a flash of blue velvet a smiling hand-
some face it was giuliano de me-
dici and his arm was linked with
that of francesco de pazzi as
though with a close friend on the
other side of giuliano and a little
to the rear walked bernardo ban-
dini the dissolute young gentleman
on whom guaracco threatened to be-
stow lisa

  and then someone strolled past
me-lorenzo-a gorgeous figure in
a crimson iioujypelande sword at
side chatting with a crooked smil-
ing young man-agnolo poliziano
the poet behind them tense and
pale slunk two dark-clad figures
the assassins maffei and bagnone

  i took a step toward the ruler of
florence i drew in my breath to
shout a warning in the midst of the
holy service i saw guaracco ap-
proaching beyond some chairs

  it was then that the host was ele-
vated at the altar the young car-
dinals voice rang out the prayerful
words that all unknowing would

 	giuliano was hi on this fatal sunday but
francesco de pazzi and bernardo bandlnl went
to his house and urged him in a friendly manner
to attend mass

signal for violence

  ite missa est

  maffei the vengeful volterran
who was closer to me than bagnone
stepped suddenly forward clutching
at lorenzo his dagger twinkled in

air

  i seemed to move of an involun-
tary stimulus had i been a true
florentine i would have paused to
draw sword and would have been
too late to save lorenzo being an
american and from the twentieth
century i struck with my fist
maffei staggered under the blow his
thrust went awry it glanced along
lorenzos neck

  beware your magnificence i
cried and struck maffei again a
roundhouse blow

  he turned halfway toward me
catching my knuckles on the point
of his chin down he floundered in
a flurry of black robes and i set my
foot on his dagger hand the weap-
on clanked on the floor and i kicked
it away

  all had become howling confusion
my gas i saw would not affect only
guaraccos party but the whole con-
gregation i dared not release it
at last i thought to draw my sword

  across the octagonal space chairs
were overturning and horrified peo-
ple were scurrying and gesticulating
for a moment i saw giulianos blue
velvet form struggling on the floor
while francesco de pazzi with his
knee on giulianos breast struck
viciously with his dagger other
swords were out on all sides

  down with the medici oppres-
sors i heard guaracco trumpet-
ing

a cheer answered him for the
service had been liberally at-
tended by members of the conspira-
cy the cardinal his young eyes
wide with horror was drawing back
from the altar and a priest in black
robes was trying to lead him away
maffei had risen and was running
before my sword-point i turned to

see what was happening to lorenzo

  he had drawn his own sword and
was parrying the wild dagger
thrusts of bagnone but his wound
streamed blood and the terrified
poliziano hampered him by clinging

to him	

  i hurried to them and thrust hard
at bagnone but my stroke was
turned for as guaracco had done the
night before this conspirator wore
mail under his gown yet the dig-
ging jab drove him back i gestured
poliziano toward a doorway with my
weapon

is that the sacristy i shouted
get him in there and bolt the door

  giuliano lorenzo was shouting
back is giuliano safe

  but i gave him an unceremonious
shove and a moment later poliziano
had dragged him to the threshold

  down with the medici yelled
guaracco again

  his voice was near and i faced
upon him and half a dozen of his
supporters who were rushing to cut
lorenzo off i threw myself in their
way quickly wadding my cloak into
a shield and engaged several blades
at once i heard the clang of the
door behind me and the shooting of
the bolts

  medici medici i roared fend-
ing off my assailants murder
help honest men murder is being
done

medici someone echoed and
never have i heard a sweeter voice

  a robust cavalier in plum-purple
hurried to my side he too had a
sword and struck manfully at the
conspirators his example fired
others in a trice the entire floor of
the choir was a melee of jabbering
voices and clashing steel

  several armored guardsmen made
their appearance i saw guaracco
fleeing i followed suit for i re-
membered that lorenzo whose life
i had just saved had doomed me

  the public square outside the
cathedral was swiftly jamming with
people some armed and angry
twice in time



others frightened and mystified all
were talking at once and nearly all
were shouting medici medici in
this quarter at least the people were
for their ruler

  a fellow in a jerkin of falding
with gray hair and a cast in his eye
stopped me with a fierce clutch even
as i emerged from the cathedral

  is it true that ser giuliano de
medici is slain he asked

  i fear so i replied i saw him
struck down

  the gray head shook dolefully but
the one good eye lighted up come
to the palazzo publico young sir
the man urged me there is good
sport there

  what sport i asked panting
from the excitement

  salviati and some cutthroats
went up to seize the magistrates
but the bulk of them were trapped
in a room the door had a spring
lock

  joy surged into me my device had
worked how then i cried

  some guards and friends of the
medici came and seized the lot he
replied with relish even now they
are being hanged from the windows
like hams on a rafter

fierce as it sounded the news
came gladly to my ears guarac-
cos conspiracy had failed in part at
the cathedral had failed utterly at
the palace but i had no time for
rejoicing elsewhere in the city
fresh danger was rising

  nay come with me i bade my
new friend i know of better sport
still i raised my voice hark all
true florentines and servants of the
magnificent who will fight for
the medici

   stoutly called a youth bran-
dishing a cudgel and i came
another volunteer   chorused
others half a score offered them-
selves in as many seconds

  then follow i said and set off
at a trot for the pazzi quarter i
now held a bottle of chlorine gas in

each hand the fellows set up a
shout of enthusiasm or excitement
and ran at my heels

  we had not far to run out of a
narrow side street rode a man on
horseback-a square-faced man
bright of eye and straight of back
for all the whiteness of hjs hair he
wore gold-filigreed armor on chest
and legs and waved a sword armed
footmen came at his heels liberty
liberty he was shouting over-
throw the oppressors 

  he had to be giacopo de pazzi the
aged but sturdy head of the rebel-
lious family behind him were mar-
shaled the retainers of his house a
good hundred-and dangerous look-
ing and masses of citizenry pressed
from other streets to stare perhaps
to ioin

  there was nothing for it but au-
dacity medicr i thundered in re-
turn to the pazzi slogan and flour-
ished one of the gas-bottles as though
it were a battle flag forward loyal
florentines smite the assassins

  my own following set up a shout
and pressed forward with me i had
more adherents than i had thought
at first doubtless we had been re-
enforced by others as we passed
along the street but giacopo de
pazzi was not the man to be daunted
he had come out looking for trouble
and seemed glad to find it yelling
a war-cry he came toward us at a
trot

  his horse alone would scatter my
band for we were all afoot i made
a decision and hurled my first gas
bottle it burst on the pavement
several yards ahead of the old man
and he checked and stared i ran
ahead and threw the second

  it smashed even closer to him
the cloud of gas rising and mixing
with the air must have been driven
sharply into his eyes and nose as
well as into the nostrils of his horse
the poor beast snorted and reared
giacopo de pazzi kept his seat with
difficulty coughing he dropped his
sword and clutched at his throat

with his hand a moment later his
frightened steed out of control had
sidled into the foremost of his own
men throwing them into disorder

  the onlookers knew less of what
had happened than giacopo de pazzi
but he had lost command of the
situation and the balance of approval
tilted from him hoots and jeers
rang in the air

  medicii i screamed again

  medici medici echoed back
from all sides

  i hurried almost into the midst of
the pazzi party from mv belt i
tore my third and last bottle bomb
and threw it it broke only a few
feet from me and the fumes blinded
and strangled me as well as others
i retreated as best i might cough-
ing and dabbing at my tear-filled
eyes but though i could not see
that final dose of irritating gas must
have completed the job of halting
the rush to dominate the city

  i heard an increasing hubbub of
loud shouts for the medici and
when my vision cleared at last i saw
a flash of armor guardsmen were
making their appearance threaten-
ing the parade with swords and
pikes i saw the foremost armed
servants of the pazzi faltering and
drawing back crumpling the head
of the column some darted to right
and left losing themselves in the
crowd

  giacopo de pazzi had recovered
somewhat from his taste of chlorine
he was no coward but he knew when
he was beaten he spurred quickly
around a corner and away before
we could reach him and drag him
from the saddle

  i thought that he might reach the
gates and escape and did not be-
grudge him that boon to me he
seemed the least grisly of all that
group of rascally plotters

  	giacopo de pazzi was a simple and decent
man who might not have approved of the entire
conspiracy he was later captured and his
mutilated body tossed into the arno another
conspirator bandini was a fugitive for months
ut was finally haled back to florence and hanged
from the palazzo publico

  an officer of the guard passed
close to me and i hailed him how
goes it at the palace i asked

  the rebels are all taken or slain
he answered his magnificence is
safe and has spoken from a balcony
begging that there be no more
butchery and asking that the sur-
vivors be delivered to fair trial he
urges peace even while his tears
stream for his dead brother

  it is not over yet i admonished
him keep watch on the gates
some mercenaries have been
gathered there to help the con-
spiracy

  they will never enter this city
he assured me

  i turned from him toward the
arno

  there was one more thing to do
and its doing lay with me to do it

      chapter xxi
      the christening

close to the riverside guaraccos
house never looked so quiet and
yet so forbidding i ran to the door
and tried it from within a voice
challenged me quietly cautiously

  i am from guaracco i called at
once all is lost in the city

  there was a rattling of chains
as if the barrier were being lowered
and i did not wait for the door to
open with my shoulder i bore
strongly against it and it creaked
back

  a cry of profane execration
greeted me one of the dwarfs the
ugly one i had stunned the night
before swung up his curved sword
but my own point was quickly in
this ones throat and he crumpled
on the threshold his oaths dying
into a blood-choked gurgle i hur-
ried inside without waiting for him
to cease struggling

  lisa i shouted as i ran through
twice in time



room after room lisa where are
vou

  leo

  it was muffled little louder than a-
whisper but i having come into the
kitchen traced the direction of her
voice she was beneath me in the
floor showed a great cleated hatch-
way she must be in the cellar amid
guaraccos stacked weapons seiz-
ins the iron ring that served as
handle for the door i heaved it up
liffht gleamed from below

  there was no ladder or other way
down but i swung myself into the
hole landing unright on the earthen
cellar floor she was there seated
like a stone figure upon a great chest
that must have been full of ammnni-
tion beyond were the stairs that
led to the front of the house fer
eyes sought rrvne in the lantern
light

leo she murmured as softh
a sigh of wind youve come back
fly awav from here i gasped
at her these devils machines and
weapons shall be destroyed within
the minute and we are leaving
florence forever-before guaracco
finds us or lorenzo does either
but i must stay she protested
as though she reminded me of the
obvious i was told to wait
told by guaracco i cried hotly
for it now was manifest to me that
he had bound her to her nlace by
hypnotism stronger than shackles

  guaracco yes her dark head
dipped a little in agreement he
said that all would be well a new
florence would be built with no op-
pression

  lies lies i cried passionately
he tried to form himself a devils
kingdom here erected on spilt blood
and corpses  caught her hand
come lisa

  i got her to her feet but it was
like lifting a straw dummy

  i was told to wait leo she said
my hands seized her shoulders
and i tried to shake her into con-
sciousness

  lisa do you love me or is-
that only an illusion too turned on
and off by guaracco like the spigot
of a wine cask

  love you yes she was definite
enough

  then come i say i backed
toward the stairs drawing her along

with me she looked ahead and saw
somethin her eves widened her
mouth opened to cry out

  t eo-danger

  she tore from my grasp and scur-
ried around me so that she was be-
tween e and the toirs i turned on
my heel only swiftly enough to see
what she had seen

  gurracco had descended upon me
and his hand was lifted holding
something that gleamed i heard
the bark of an explosion saw a sud-
den ghostly puff of smoke and
lisa sagged against me into my
arms her eyes were suddenly
bright and wakeful again and her
mouth tremblingly smiled i eased
her slackening body to the floor i
knew that she was dead

  do not move leo warned gua-
racco hastily still at the foot of
the stairs he leveled his weapon at
me pointblank this fires six shots
it is one of the guns i made accord-
ing to the science i gleaned from
you

  it was indeed a revolver his
thumb had drawn up the hammer
and the muzzle stared me between
the eyes i gathered for a spring but
paused i did not fear to die but i
feared that guaracco might live

  you have failed were the first
words i spoke to him

  failed

 his eyes flickered down toward
lisa with his rebellion crumpled
around his head he could still smile
in triumph

  failed i said again lisa was
under your spell but she broke it to
save my life she loved me her
love was more than your dirty con-
juring tricks

  true true he admitted smooth-
	wonder story annual

ly and i am glad after all that
she did save your life leo there
is still time and opportunity for us
to help each other

  i curled my lip in contempt but
he went on many have died today
why should we if you do not un-
derstand leo look at what else i
bring

  his free left hand extended to-
ward me and between thumb and
finger flashed a globule of rosy-silver
light it is a pearl he intoned in
a new voice the pearl of sleep
leo look upon it

t looked i felt my senses sway
but held them firm it was only
a pearl the light did not wax or
blur or brighten i was resisting
his spell it was only a pearl that
guaracco held trying to spellbind
me with it but i stared and would
not let it have power over me

  you are going to sleep leo
guaracco was intoning to sleep-
and all is well between us

  i gazed my mind at work a way
opened to revenge and victory if i
were cunning slowly stiffly simu-
lating trance i took a step toward
him he thought himself the win-
ner

  leo leo-i am your friend he
dinned into me i am guaracco
who adopted you as his cousin who
made you great and wealthy and
you will be grateful and help gua-
racco you will tell lorenzo de
medici that guaracco too fought to
put down this conspiracy those
who can testify otherwise are dead
it would have worked had he been
able truly to impose his will i let
him deceive himself and took an-
other step we were almost within
arms reach of each other the
leveled revolver was bigger than and
brighter than the pearl to my gaze
i kept my face gravenly rapt my
eyes staring but i was awake and
resolute would he suspect

  once we are believed we can still
work together leo guaracco was

insisting plan again and better
we may yet rule the world

  i threw myself upon him

  he pulled the trigger but my
right hand was upon the revolver
pain bit my thumb that i had
thrust between breech and hammer
and the firing pin drove deep into
the base of the nail a moment more
and i wrenched it away and flung it
behind me it exploded with the
shock and the bullet sang into the
beam overhead a moment later we
had both drawn swords

  you triple traitor growled
guaracco parrying my first lunge
come then if you will have death
this way

  i made no reply but deflected his
riposte-the trick he had learned
from me his chest was exposed to
a return riposte but i knew the mail
that defended it and swept my blade
in a quick arc he got his brow out
of the way with millimeters to
spare

  falling back he tried to clutch at
another pistol one of a heap in an
open box but i nicked at his out-
flung hand and got home he whim-
pered two of his fingers soared
away and blood fountained forth

  wait leo he changed his tune
at once i must not die if you ex-
pect to live and -

  i did not expect to live and made
him no answer his sword was up
and i beat it momentarily aside and
slashed at his face quickly he par-
ried but only half broke the force of
the blow his cheek was laid open
and his beard suddenly gleamed a
deeper red

  the time reflector he yam-
mered at me on sudden inspiration
only i can show you how to rebuild
improve get back to your own age
he should have saved his breath
for he was panting and choking
his thrusts were unsteady easy to
foil my digging lunge at his belly
while it did not pierce the chain
mail drove most of the wind out of
him it drove out the fight too he
twice in time



tried to retreat to the stairs but
misjudged and brought up against
the plank-faced wall he threw
down his sword and lifted his hands

  mercy he begged i sur-
render leo

  his unwounded right palm snread
itself against a stout timber i dart
my point at it all my weight behind
a tremulous unmanned howl from
guaracco-his hand was spiked to
the wood by my blade like a big pale
spider on a bodkin

  then i let go my hilt and stepped
back i spared no eye to my enemys
plight nor ear to his prayers

  lisa lay still and misty pale but
there was no blood on her calm face
i closed her eyes straightened her
body and folded her hands upon her
quiet breast in her last instant of
life her mouth had fallen into the
little close-lipped smile i had known
kneeling almost to earth i kissed
her once and her face was still warm

  leo leo sobbed guaracco in
shameless entreaty what will you
do

  he was trying to seize my sword
and wrench it away but the point
was tightly wedged into the wood
and his free left hand shorn half in
two by my previous stroke could
not grip the hilt

  i let my actions answer him from
its peg i snatched the lantern with
my foot i stirred some straw and
rubbish into a mass against the foot
of a barrel he saw what i intended

  there is gunpowder in that
barrel he shrieked

  i knew it but still i spoke him no
word with all my strength i dashed
the lantern down the glass shat-
tered the straw blazed up and
then i raced away up the steps
behind me fire gushed luridly

at the door of the house i almost
trampled upon guaraccos re-
maining dwarf the handsome one
he stared at me in mute horror
then at the glow behind me he
seemed to read in my face what had

happened for he scuttled past and
dived into that flaming cellar
master master he screamed
i gained the street ran along it
for more than a score of paces be-
fore the whole world seemed to turn
into thunder and lightning j was
flung to my face skinning my cheek
on the pavement but i rose and ran
on that was the end of guaraccos
house-his weapons-his dwarf-
himself-lisa nothing remained
for me to co save to go and give
myself up to lorenzo 

  in the evening i stood in the
groined frescoed chamber where
fust the ruler of florence had given
me audience lorenzo de medici
was seated opposite in his chair of
state across the ebony and ivory
table ilis collar hung loose over
his neck bandage but otherwise he
was the same lorenzo as ever-
alert self-contained far-thinking

  i am driven to believe all points
of your strange story he said
gently and no one can deny that
you have saved florence and me
poliziano says so and so do the offi-
cers of the guard i grant you full
pardon and i ask you to pardon me
it seems that i drove you away once
by my mis judgment it shall not
happen again

  i bowed thanks but i could think
only of lisa he read that tragic
thought

  sorrow touches you my friend
as it has touehed me my brother
died today as did your sweetheart
but perhaps work will comfort us
both and florence hath need of my
rule and your science

  you are right magnificence
yours will be a great labora-
tory he promised aye and a
studio of your own in the gardens of
san marco above all honor and
safety but one chief change must
be made in you

  and that

  this matter of your strange
journey from another age which
though i believe i do not begin to

understand it must remain a sec-
ret since the death of guaracco
and your lady lisa you and i alone
know it others might think you a
devils apostle and urge that you be
borne to the stake

  he paused pursed his lips as if
completing some decision there-
fore it is expedient that we provide
you with an ordinary birth and fam-
ily among us-a father and all the
rest

  a father i echoed him not
comprehending

  aye that i know the very man
-an attorney who is in my confi-
dence and who has several children
already if i ask it he will gladly
own you as yet another son the
records can be arranged in various
offices to make it believable forget

  i sank back into my chair impli-

cations rushing upon me with be-
wildering shock and speed

  leave all arrangements to me
said lorenzo it is my peculiar
talent to make perfect all such little
things his bitterly ugly face grew
suddenly beautiful with that warm
smile of his from this day for-
ward you are leo-no leonardo da

to lead as crown of the age and in-
spiration for ages to come my

do we have to die

  thirty-nine years ago in forbidden tibet be-
hind the highest mountains in the world a
young englishman named edwin j dingle
found the answer to this question a great mys-
tic opened his eyes a great change came over
him he realized the strange power that knowl-
edge gives

  that power he says can transform the life
of anyone questions whatever they are can be
answered the problems of health death pov-
erty and wrong can be solved

  in his own case he was brought back to
splendid health he acquired wealth too as well
as world-wide professional recognition thirty-
nine years ago he was sick as a man could be
and live once his coffin was bought years of
almost continuous tropical fevers broken bones
near blindness privation and danger had made
a human wreck of him physically and mentally

  he was about to be sent back to england to
die when a strange message came - they are
waiting for you in tibet he wants to tell the
whole world what he learned there under the

guidance of the greatest mystic he ever encoun-
tered during his  years in the far east he
wants everyone to experience the greater health
and the power which there came to him

  within ten years he was able to retire to this
country with a fortune he had been honored
by fellowships in the worlds leading geographi-
cal societies for his work as a geographer and
today  years later he is still so athletic capa-
ble of so much work so young in appearance it
is hard to believe he has lived so long

  as a first step in their progress toward the
power that knowledge gives mr dingle wants

the lost hour

bv alexander samalmau

one day in march 
earths scientists discovered
that the world had lost one
hour of time

  beneath the globes surface a mol-
ten mass of matter which for a cen-
tury had bubbled and boiled as if
stirred by the fires of hell subsided
in its mad upward surge

  concurrently fissures on the crust
of the earth closed there was a
change in the eternal rhythm of
earths contraction and expansion



and a consequent lowering of its
surface

  local disturbances were reported
-however as the severest shocks
were felt at the north and south
poles and under the atlantic and
pacific oceans no general cataclysm
took place

  the occurrence was the subject of
a lengthy statement by professor
aldous grant world-renowned
physicist

  professor grant was quoted as
	wonder story annual

follows in the daily record for
march  

    these phenomena which we are wit-
  nessing are not unfamiliar to scien-
  tists although they have never been as
  marked as at present because of in-
  ternal disturbances our spheres rate
  of rotation or the length of the ter-
  restrial day is undergoing a change

    as early as  astronomers no-
  ticed certain irregularities in the mo-
  tion of the moon these were inex-
  plicable and in a strict sense are in-
  explicable to the present day

    irregularities in the motion of the
  sun were also observed checking
  these against the irregularities of the
  moon it was discovered that they
  coincided this left no alternative
  other than the assumption that the
  true change is in the speed of the
  earth and not in the speed of either
  sun or moon at various times in
  the past notably in  in  in
   and in  the earths speed
  was subjected to sudden changes

    these changes have been attributed
  to contraction and expansion of the
  earths crust due to altered tempera-
  tures within the molten layers in
  the nineteenth century the effect of
  these erratic pulsations was the
  lengthening of the year by one second

  in  it was observed that an op-
  posite effect was obtained-the ap-
  parent length of the year becoming
  shorter by almost a full minute

    the present disturbances however
  bid fair to break all records we have
  been losing time at an unbelievably
  swift rate nothing has as yet been
  done to adjust ourselves to this ac-
  celeration nevertheless it is doubt-
  ful whether-

in a dark prison cell a man
was preparing to die praying
fervently he sought to make peace
with his god

 ralph frazier knew he was in-
nocent but the circumstantial evi-
dence was all against him and so
he had to die

  the sentence was definite left no
room for doubt he was in a strange
land and thus far nobody had come
to his defense

 the words echoed in his tortured
mind-to be hung by the neck un-
til dead on the morning of march
eleventh nineteen hundred eighty
at or before five oclock-

  it was shortly before the fatal
hour when they called for ralph
frazier and marched him into the
prison yard he looked up at the sky
for what he thought would be the
last time-and suddenly he gasped
the sun was high in the heavens

  look padre he said to the dig-
nified figure at his side it is past
dawn

  the guards gaped their astonish-
ment in the prison yard stood an
ancient sundial ralph frazier
pointed to it it is six oclock ac-
cording to that sundial over there
it was true although every clock
in the vicinity proclaimed the hour
of five the evidence of the sundial
could not be denied

  our clocks must be out of gear
said the warden but it makes no
difference let us go ahead

  ah no spoke the padre the
young man must not be executed for
god has wrought a miracle on his
behalf you must grant him the
privilege of a re-trial according
to the laws of this community
benevolently the padre patted
ralph fraziers head my son he
said thank the lord for this pre-
cious chance that has come to you to
prove your innocence

  ralph frazier was conducted back
to his cell where he flung himself
upon the stone floor and wept in
prayer and gratitude

fr james hoskins was
u roused from his sleep by the in-
sistent ringing of the telephone he
looked out of the window and saw
that it was dawn the voice over
the wire was anxious and grief-
stricken

  we waited until day came the
mother spoke nervously but the
babys condition hasnt improved
he is very feverish now oh doc-
tor we dont know what to do and if
you can hurry-

  it meant a long trip across ex-
tremely bad roads in the heart of the
woods dr hoskins sighed as he
the lost hour	

dressed life wasnt easy

  when he arrived at the babys bed-
side he took one look at the flushed
face of the tossing infant rolled up
his sleeves and set to work

  hell pull through all right he
said comfortingly but if youd
waited another ten minutes before
calling me it would have been too
late

the dictator of a large empire was
giving his final instructions to his
espionage chief you hold the fate
of esthinia in your hands he said
gravely my people there are ready
to overthrow the government-but
they need your guidance your pres-
ence would electrify them spur them
into action

  but i cant reach esthinia said
the spy not if as you say the mis-
sion is so secret that i cant use a
plane the route is heavily guarded
and theres a price on my head in
the intervening territory

  under cover of night you can
work your way through the dicta-
tor advised i order you to go now
-and you will be there in time you
must not use a conveyance of any
kind for your preparations would
be observed and theres no one i can
trust this is of the utmost impor-
tance

 as he made his way through
forest and field in the darkness the
spy realized the vast significance of
his mission once he presented him-
self in esthinia the spark would be
put to the powder keg revolution
would flame there would be war
and conquest glory and widespread
disaster but-the esthinians would
not act without him

  the dictator wanted revolt-it
would establish him as the ruler
the man of destiny over a much
larger emoire than that he now con-
trolled if however the spy were
stopped before reaching his destina-
tion the threatened uprising would
peter out

  nearer and nearer he came to the

border the darkness and his own
cleverness in avoiding detection were
serving him well

  suddenly he looked up and ws
startled out of his wits had the
night passed so quickly  the fingers
of dawn were painting the sky

  now the spy became frantic has-
tened toward his goal it was a mad
fight against time scratched and
bruised he tried to run through
bramble and bush vainly pounded
against obstructing trees

  it was no use lighter and lighter
it grew and he could no longer hide
himself while traveling if only
he had another hours time he
crouched under the outspread
branches of a protective tree and it
was then a sentry saw and recog-
nized him

  as he was led away to a place of
detention the spy trembled at the
thought of the dictators mighty
wrath

  today was the day to strike-and
he had failed and another dream of
world domination was shattered

	   

  the report of the learned pro-
fessor grant went on

  it is doubtful whether the current ac-
celeration of the earth will have any
noticeable influence on the earths popula-
tion perhaps the majority of individ-
uals will be completely unaware of what
has happened only the most astute will
understand the cosmic occurrence-and
even they will be at a loss to explain the
amazingly swift terrific contraction and
consequent acceleration of the earth

  i predict that though we shall have
lost an entire hour by tomorrow march
eleventh life will go on in much the same
way and people will devote their energies
to quite the usual pursuits granted of
course that present calculations are not
upset by unforeseen eruptions

  though of immense significance from a
scientific viewpoint this phenomenon will
pass almost utterly unmarked by and be
of no importance whatever to the hurry-
ing and scurryjng beings who make up the
major population of this globe

  they will soon become accustomed to
the changed time cycle and after official
action is taken will accept it with the
same nonchalance with which they accept
daylight saving schedules

the great change

stupendous things have hap-
pened in this world but noth-
ing as stupendous as the great
change that came over earth in
 at first it was just a subtle
change hardly noticeable conti-
nents did not sink nor did tidal
waves engulf cities nothing visible
or tangible occurred at all never-
theless it was different

  manifestations were numerous
yet hard to define first of all a
greedy little nation dreaming the
dreams that caesar and napoleon
had also once dreamed suddenly
and inexplicably withdrew her
powerful navy from the hawaiian
islands thus taking away the threat

of war between herself and another
great power

  at the same time she demobilized
from the siberian front when it was
expected that within a month she
would have swept into the wheat
fields of the north robbing them
from a frantic european nation
not long after these two enemies
signed an everlasting peace treaty

  that was the first major indica-
tion of the great change it was
not long after that the big powers
of europe so delicately balanced on
the verge of a disastrous war de-
mobilized from opposing frontiers
almost all at once and in another
few months a dozen short and honest

treaties made war remote and un-
thinkable before a decade- had
passed all europe united to form a
commonwealth for the betterment of
all concerned-a union not in name
only but in fact

  these astounding results in the
international field were matched by
equally amazing changes in the gen-
eral everyday life of mankind peo-
ple began to grow kinder toward one
another a feeling of brotherhood
sprang up and waxed stronger day
by day

  it is safe to say that a person
taken from the twentieth century
prior to july  and transported
suddenly to july of  would have
sworn he was on some other world
than that he had known because of
the difference in human relationship
occasioned by the change

  for instance up in the hills of
kentucky two lanky bearded drawl-
ing backwoodsmen armed with
rifles faced one another shyly and
finally shook hands that was in
september of  a few months
before those two would have shot
it out between them for their feud
went back a hundred years and so
on and on

  it was as though the human race
had labored for countless centuries
under an incubus of evil which had
suddenly in july of  been
wrenched away from earth and
flung into the nethermost voids of
space  

the two experimenters stood be-
fore a sprawling apparatus on the

energy-a leaping sizzling kind of
energy that would have burned
copper to vapor and would have
caused even silver to weaken and
soften some of the coils of
beryllium were immersed in vats of

liquid air to preserve them from a
like fate

  a dialed panel reposed at the
center of the maze with a series
of button switches and illumined
indicators over its surface hardly
breathing the two men watched
the meters as the professor slowly
twisted one dial after another up
above hung from the ceiling and
connected to the panel by a single
wire was a triangle of delicate wir-
ing again beryllium

  it was the aerial for psycho-
waves

  suddenly there was sound and the
two men stiffened attentively yet
it was not sound nothing came
through the air from the apparatus
to their ears yet they seemed to
hear voices-voices that went di-
rectly to their brains without pass-
ing through their auditory organs

  they were simply thought-waves
vastly amplified by the psycho-re-
ceiver and so powerful that they im-
pinged directly on the auditory seat
of the brain

  in awe and wonder they looked
at each others toil-lined faces as
they heard the cacophonous voices of
a million different people they were
hopelessly entangled like a radio re-
ceiver attuned to the entire wave-
band at once

  the voice of the world whis-
pered professor thode almost rev-
erently the constant flow of
thought that whirls about our heads
and is never heard except in a few
instances every human on earth
must always be thinking something
but the thoughts can never be de-
tected except bv super-sensitive
minds and then only under excep-
tional circumstances-those care-
fully arranged experiments in telep-
athy

  with this sort of receiver and
amplifier one can be in touch with
all the worlds thoughts at once
listen now while i turn the selector
dial his face wore a rapt expres-
sion
the chessboard of mars



  the scientist twisted the dial and
clutched at his chest as a dry cough
bent him almost double he would
have fallen except that fred bilte
his assistant caught him in strong
arms and helped him to a chair

  success fred success cried
the old scientist weakly when his
coughing had subsided

  that ecstasy of achievement had
cost them ten years of painstaking
research and most of the professors
fortune ten years before professor
boris thode retired from the indus-
trial boom that had enriched him
had said-

  the mystery of thought how is
it born how does it manifest it-
self regardless of the contempt
that science shows toward telep-
athy i truly believe in it i believe
that thought can be transmitted as
readily as voice as light as elec-
tricity-if only we knew the means

at the time it seemed to fred
bilte that they had completely
lost themselves in a maze of pseudo-
science they pursued research that
was only half science the other
half something beyond

  they had combed the entire ether
spectrum in the search for thought-
waves cosmic rays gamma rays
x-rays had been the first three steps
then had come the examination of
several octaves only slightly explored
by others the ultra-violet visible
light and infra-red had been dis-
sected for their purnose another
little known gap in the scale next
then the radio waves finally the
alternating current waves

  each of these had been suspected
in turn of being the range of psycho-
waves but what they had sought
had not been found

  they had gone further above the
scale they explored waves that were
possibly the answer to the condensa-
tion of nebulae but were not in any
way related to thought radiation

  then below the cosmic rays they
came across radiations half electro-

magnetic half something else that
were closely related to gravitation
these had proved to be a sort of
transition product between ether
emanations and waves that had no
measurable velocity just as the
archaeopteryx was a transition be-
tween reptiles and birds in prehis-
toric times

  the z-rays they were tentatively
named they had a shorter wave-
length than the cosmic rays and a
still more terrific penetrative power
they were apparently the next step
above the gravitation rays which
were undoubtedly infinitely penetra-
tive in common with the letter
these z-rays had an almost infinite
velocity in that mysterious sub-ether
beyond the electro-magnetic ether

  it was only a year before that
the professor had said eagerly
tensely all electro-magnetic waves
have a constant speed something
over one-hundred-eighty-six-thou-
sand miles a second these new
z-rays below the cosmic of a dif-
ferent order must have a far higher
speed possibly beyond measurement
and the penetration of thought
though figurative is proverbial
come on theres work ahead and
hope

  a month after they succeeded in
first absorbing thought-waves out
of the air they had completed a pair
of miniature psycho-receivers
modeled after the big set with which
they planned to carry out tests of
range and selectivity these were
contained in small flat wooden cases
that fitted easily into their pockets
the energy supply was a tiny bat-
terylike cylinder of cellophane con-
taining delicate coils of gossamer
beryllium

  its simple explained the pro-
fessor at the doubt that was still
in biltes face supnose we are
separated now by a distance of a
hundred miles i send my thoughts
out your receiver picks them up
instantaneously and amplifies them

  but what amplifies them in-


wonder story annual

sisted bilte

  your own thought emanations
the old scientist smiled he was
again a jump ahead of his assistant
your own psycho-waves constantly
contacting the receiver-coils in your
pocket induce a psycho-current
which amplifies the far weaker
waves coming from me

  there is an analogy in radio
transmission very weak stations
are sometimes caught up in the car-
rier wave of a powerful station and
are thereby greatly amplified the
carrier wave of your psycho-waves
will similarly pick up and strengthen
my incoming emanations

   but then i will be receiving both
sets of thoughts

  well i hope-the professor
grinned-that you can distinguish
your own thoughts from mine
bilte grinned sheepishly in return
then as long as these test receivers
are done lets try them out

  all right you have a sister in
los angeles fred whom you
havent visited for some time
not for three years

  then take a trip down there and
well see if these psycho-phones as
we may call them will give us an un-
broken connection each hour dur-
ing the day on the hour we will con-
nect up and transmit to one another
short sentences of any kind which
each of us will record in writing at
both ends then on your return
well compare notes now pack up
and go-but be back in two weeks

chapter ii
mass psychology

bilte returned from los angeles
on july first  that date
meant nothing in particular to the
two experimenters but to the world
it was to signify that three weeks
later would come the great change

  a comparison of notes indicated
that their connection had been com-
plete and perfect at all times it
struck a sort of wonder in their
minds to think that two humans
separated by hundreds of miles
could converse freely with but a
slight mental effort

  radio was much the same but re-
quired ponderous apparatus and
much attention with the psycho-
phones communication was magi-
cally simple

  professor thode was elated at the
success in this first step toward ap-
plied telepathy but bilte noticed be-
fore he had been back long that the
elderly scientist seemed preoccupied
even while comparing notes and
commenting on the different phases
of the experiment the professors at-
tention wandered erratically

  what is it professor bilte
asked finally pushing the written
pages aside

  professor thode started then
motioned toward the laboratory
striding to the set with which they
had first received outside thought
waves he snapped the on-switch he
made no motion to alter the tuning

  suddenly it came a loud voice
-yet it was not a voice as their
other thought pickups had been it
seemed to be more of an emotion that
had somehow been converted into a
psycho-wave no actual word-
thoughts were distinguishable yet
the general meaning of the message
became clearer as the amplified
emanations continued to radiate
from the set

  bilte looked in amazement at the
professor as he felt his heart pump
faster and his muscles unconsciously
tighten just what is it he asked
perplexed it isnt really a definite
message it seems more like a-an
emotion as if we had tuned in the
incoherent thoughts of an enraged
man

  whatever it is murmured the
professor it comes in from at least
a hundred different psycho-wave
the chessboard of mars



lengths like a chain-station and
theres something ominous threaten-
ing about it

  they stared at each other silently
for a moment

 just what do you think it
means whispered bilte

  withholding an answer the pro-
fessor pointed to the panel board
a fine needle delicately balanced on
a sharp agate pivot reposed there
in a hollow formed by a group of
beryllium coils

  ive constructed a psycho-sensi-
tive unit explained the professor
which will point to the source of
any psycho-wave when connected to
the big set watch

  as goon as the mysterious mes-
sage began again to emanate from
the set the sensitized needle flicked
back and forth in wide gyrations
when it gradually subsided it
pointed out the window across the
blue of the pacific

  which means said the old
scientist that the source of the
radiation lies somewhere out in the
pacific-or across it in asia by the
power with which it comes in sup-
posing it to be at least a thousand
miles away the source must be a
greatly energized one obviously no
single human mind could produce
such a powerful thought-emanation
without some sort of amplification
you mean gasped bilte that
someone else has-accomplished
what we have and-

professor thode nodded re-
luctantly either that or it may
be the combined mass radiation of a
group of people his eyes narrowed
strangely mass psychology di-
rected toward one goal-almost mass
hypnotism

  this psycho-message that we re-
ceive so powerfully and on so many
different wa ve-lengths may be the
fighting spirit of a nation feeding
and constantly renewing itself on
military propaganda you will no-
tice that the needle pointed directly

west-toward japan

  then he stirred himself under
biltes incredulous stare yes far-
fetched i know fred either of the
two possibilities has me intrigued i
couldnt rest without knowing the
true answer therefore well track
down the source of this super-power-
ful psycho-radiation

  aboard an ocean liner speeding
toward japan the two experi-
menters became daily more excited
as the needle never failed to point
westward to the land of flowers and
sloe-eyed people it was a halfday
before docking that they made a
final test they watched the swing-
ing needle come to a rigid halt

  the professor uttered a surprised
exclamation and bent lower over
the needle good lord it isnt
pointing to japan now at least not
to japan proper it lines up-he
hastily unfolded a map of the jap-
anese archipelago-with the first
of the kurile islands

  he sat down weakly that then
precludes my theory

  bilte fidgeted uneasily well if
it isnt the mass mind-delusion of
a great number of people and since
it cant be the emanation of one
single mind it must be a mechanical-
ly amplified psycho-radiation he
shuddered a bit the nearer we
draw to the source the more i feel
a sort of involuntary animosity-a
dissatisfaction with lots of things
professor thode nodded i feel
it too-rolling waves beating at our
subconscious minds stirring our
fighting blood like fanfares of mar-
tial music foreign correspondents
have mentioned that strange feeling
of restlessness and militarism as
though all the nation were bathed
in the fiery breath of mars god of
war-as in central europe in nine-
teen hundred and fourteen the
breath of mars-

  the professors voice suddenly
hardened suppose a japanese
scientist stumbled on psycho-phe-
nomena in his research and pro-


wonder story annual

gressed with it as far or farther than
we-to the point where amplification
of psycho-waves is possible

  suppose he decided to conceal his
discovery from the world and in-
stead pervert it to evil use-to the
purpose of stirring his people to
conquest that man could have set
up to the north where our needle
points a powerful thought amplifier
with which to accomplish his pur-
pose

  very possible agreed bilte
gloomily but how could he-this
hypothetical machiavelli-c o n t r o 
his emanations so that only the jap-
anese people wtere subject to their in-
fluence

  he wouldnt have to control
them the most direct and powerful
of them would saturate japan and
the east coast of asia which is un-
der japanese dominance anyway to
the north and east and south the
radiations would go a long way be-
fore impinging upon large groups
of other races in fact it may be
those tailings of the original radia-
tions that have so stirred europe
today and placed it upon the brink
of another fearful internal war

  it was at this point that the two
men began to realize that they had
stumbled onto something of major
political importance

   fred said the old scientist later
in a fierce low voice of determina-
tion regardless of the consequences
you and i are going to trace down
this mysterious psycho-emanation

they landed in tokyo and im-
mediately embarked again on a
coastal steamer for nemuro on the
island of yeddo some seventy miles
to the northeast lay the first of the
kurile islands and the needle pointed
rigidly in its direction there was
two days delay at nemuro before
much argument and bribery con-
vinced the japanese port officials
that the two american tourists were
not spies

  in calm clear weather professor

thode and his assistant chauffeured
by a taciturn native motored their
way in a launch to the island at
which their needle pointed a damn-
ing finger

  by judicious use of a compass and
their combined sense of direction
they were able to determine three
hours later that they had reached
the approximate point where the
needles line of extension intersected
the coast they landed at a stretch
of weed-grown sandiness standing
on the shore bilte hesitated

  were absolutely unarmed pro-
fessor and we dont know what
were walking into

  but the old scientist had already
set the needle apparatus on the
sand and again closed the switch
the quivering needle swung in a
lightning quarter circle and fastened
rigidly to the northwest without the
least hesitant swinging back and
forth as formerly

  the two men looked at each other
significantly

  it must be very close whispered
bilte hoarsely

  professor thode was already mak-
ing his way toward a fringe of
gnarled bushy growths further down
the shore beyond which nothing
could be distinguished almost like
a robot he strode along and bilte
felt it would be better to check him
before he ran into something un-
expected but as he was about to
call he saw from the corner of his
eye that the pilot was tugging at
the launch to shove off to the un-
knowing pilot the place seemed be-
witched with ghostlike voices

  with a shout bilte turned back
and pulled him away before he
could get the nose of the launch off
the sand and when bilte next
turned around the professor was
nowhere in sight

  he stood a moment undecided
then he heaved at the launch with
all his strength pulling it as far up
on the sand as he could thereupon
he left the beach reasonably certain
the chessboard of mars



that the pilot with his slighter
strength could not drag the launch
clear by himself

  at a trot he made for the thickets
and snapped on his pocket psycho-
phone while he ran hoping to con-
tact the professor in that way but
it was a vain hope as the very
strength of the projectors emana-
tions was sufficient to drown out any
lesser psycho-waves

  reaching the thickets bilte
crashed through the bushy growths
unmindful of clinging tendrils and
barbs that scratched his skin soon
he came out upon clear land that
sloped gently upward for a hundred
feet then abruptly veered off into a
large depression the professor was
still nowhere to be seen and a wor-
ried frown came to biltes forehead

  he ran forward toward the closer
edge of the large depression ahead
when he had struggled up the short
slope the whole of the little valley
suddenly swung into his line of vi-
sion and he stopped frozen dumb-
founded in utter amazement

at the exact center of the huge
depression was an apparatus
whose top did not rise above the gen-
eral ground level set on a wide
spreading tripod it consisted of
nothing more than a colossal metal
globe whose one surface-that fac-
ing southwest toward japan-was
punctured by a flanged aperture as
though from it something was meant
to pour

  evidently that was the projec-
tor whose existence on the island
he and the professor had suspected
but the other thing his eyes saw he
was not to understand until later

  back of the projector was another
spherical globe of metal but this did
not seem to be a permanent part of
the apparatus since it was suspended
a few feet off the ground that in
itself was astounding-a large
spheroid of metal hanging in the air
like a feather

  at the same time bilte saw the

projector and the suspended globe
he saw the professor-and a hoarse
cry burst from his throat he had
no time to shout again or to rush to
his chiefs assistance the suspended
spheroid suddenly leaped through
the air right over the cringing pro-
fessor who had evidently been ex-
amining the projector

  a hole yawned in its under-sur-
face and-bilte gasped in disbelief-
the professor without any voluntary
motion on his part rose and was
catapulted into the hole as though
an invisible giants hand had yanked
him off the ground

  then the hole in the spheroid
closed and without a sound the amaz-
ing object levitated itself from the
ground and gradually disappeared
into the blue sky

   bilte crouched at the depressions
edge for a full minute unawe to
collect his scattered senses then
he staggered in a daze back to the
stretch of beach scratched and
bleeding enervated by the shock of
what he had seen bilte hardly no-
ticed at first that the pilot was fran-
tically tugging at the launch and had
almost succeeded in shoving it clear
bilte broke into a stumbling run
shouting madly and arrived just
in time to climb into the boat with
the pilot

  hours later bilte awoke from a
mental lethargy to notice the quays
and docks of nemuro rapidly ap-
proaching utterly deflated in spirit
he went directly to his hotel room
all that afternoon and evening he
paced to and fro trying to think
coherently what had the spherical
vessel been  where was the profes-
sor nov what was to be his fate
what should he fred bilte do now
what could he do

  that same evening dinnerless and
sleepless bilte began to think he was
going mad he imagined he was
hearing the professor calling his
name more than once he half turned
ready to swear the professor must
be there suddenly he gasped and


wonder story annual

with trembling fingers pulled out
his pocket psycho-phone cursing
himself aloud for having neglected
his sole direct means of communica-
tion

  immediately at the snap of the
switch the professors psycho-voice
reverberated in biltes mind calling
his name over and over

professor bilte half-shouted
fred thank god youve finally
closed our contact ive been trying
to connect with you for hours
professor are you safe where
are you what-

  fred stop listen to me there
is no time to lose i cant tell you
much because i havent found out
much but youve got to get away
from japan and back to the states-
back to our laboratory ive been
locked into a little room in this ship
without seeing anybody but i know
it has been moving all the time its
speed constantly accelerating and
must be going somewhere

  that somewhere must be the
hideout or headquarters of these
people who have made the projector
the one thing in our favor is that
apparently they dont know you were
with me on that island that means
i can relay what i learn to you

  but it will take the big set back
home to do that if this ship goes
much further i will begin contact-
ing you again in five days whether
or not you give me a return call
if im out of range of your psvcho-
phone i will have no way of knowing
whether you are listening or not but
its all we can do

  if only our big set could transmit
as well as receive anyway im going
to see the finish of this and pass
what i find out along to you now
get out of japan and hurry
perhaps the two servants in pro-
fessor thodes laboratory-home were
surprised at biltes orders when he
returned from their foreign trip
a couch was installed in the experi-
ment room beside the big psycho-
receiver and meals were brought in

regularly he ordered them to leave
him strictly alone at all times told
them not to worry about professor
thode-that he had gone to china
and would be back some time in the
future

chapter iii
the voice from the ether

it was during the evening of july
  that professor thodes
psycho-voice first came over the big
set

  fred are you listening it be-
gan how useless for me to ask a
question whose answer i may never
know i have just found out several
things one of which makes it im-
possible for you ever to contact me
with the psycho-phone

  fred i told you the ship was ac-
celerating that puzzled me and
probably you too only one type of
ship would do that-a spaceship
well im on a spaceship

  bilte bit his tongue drops of
blood fell unnoticed from his lips
the osycho-voice went on

  yes fred im on a spaceship
just an hour ago the door of my
prison opened and before me stood
a creature-well a creature i will
not attempt to describe him you
can believe that i was thoroughly
frightened and thought i was mad
especially when the creature spoke
to me-in english-and addressed
me as earthman

  to make it short he informed me
that i was aboard a spaceship bound
for the planet mars-and that he
was a martian my skepticism must
have shown itself in my face for the
creature then took me by the hand
and led me up corridors and pas-
sageways in this amazing vessel and
finally brought me before a window

  and there it was-earth-a
green-grey ball hanging in space
the chessboard of mars



  you cant imagine the shock of
it fred nor the wonder and glory
of it-seeing the heavens from a
space-ship the amazing blackness
of space the steely stars the im-
pression of tremendous depth the
shuddering awe of its immensity
and then earth-but a ball a mote
hanging in the nothingness its sur-
face indistinct with a gauzy halo
over it

  i wonder how long i just stood
there and stared finally i turned
to my guide he seemed amused by
my awe

   earthman he said does your
mind reel at these things i see it
does naturally it would i forget
that the undeveloped intelligence of
earth has thought of space travel
as remote and in the main improb-
able-if not actually impossible

   sir i said not knowing how
else to address him this is like a
miracle

 the creature-or martian i
should say-laughed insolently
fred from that moment on i hated
him it would be hard to explain
why perhaps if his acid laugh and
the peculiar tones of his voice rang
in your ears you too would promptly
hate him-this creature

  his whole demeanor was conde-
scending and arrogant-oh ten
times more arrogant and contemptu-
ous than the most conceited ruler of
rome could ever have been he made
me feel during those few minutes
we were together that i was a
crawling worm that had to get out
of his path before being stepped
upon

  i am back in my little room-my
prison-now they have been feed-
ing me regularly a liquid food very
sweet but satisfying the room im
in has a higher air-pressure than
outside and seems to be equipped es-
pecially for an earthman i wonder
what that means

  of course a thousand and one
other speculations have been tortur-
ing me what were this martian

and his companions doing on earth
what is their connection with the
projection of the psycho-wave that
is inundating japan with its insidi-
ous influence why am i being taken
to mars

  at times i feel i have gone mad
or that this is a horrible nightmare
and yet it seems to be real fred
tell me am i-

the incoming psycho-voice was
jumbled for a moment bilte
crushed his knuckles against the
hard bench top till the skin cracked

  then came from the void i shall
have to remember i am a scientist
fred and as such must keep my
wits ive figured that i have been
aboard now over six earth days and
we cant be more than halfway if
that

  i suppose you have already added
a hexa-bank amplifier to the set
probably youll have to add another
to be able to catch my waves when
and if i arrive on mars thank
heaven psycho-waves have such a
great penetrating power and-oh

  bilte started and turned pale at
the agonized gasp that registered
from the professor then his voice
came again broken accelerating-
tremendously-tons of weight-

  that was all and bilte staggered
to a chair mopping a feverish brow
for twenty-four hours there was
utter silence from the psycho-ether
tuned to professor thodes wave-
length and bilte grew haggard in
anxiety

  in the early morning of july th
the suspense ended thereafter the
professor radiated messages three
separate times-a lost soul crying
from a spatial wilderness only fred
bilte was ever to know the full de-
tails of professor thodes three mes-
sages from the planet mars

july   a m

  the ship has landed on mars
fred when i last contacted you a
full day ago our connection was
broken when i was hurled against


wonder story annual

the wall by a terrific surge of the
ship soon after i lost consciousness
and when next i opened my eyes i
could see through a window that we
were no longer in space but on a
solid surface in short on mars

  if i could somehow transmit to
you psycho-television then perhaps
you might then gain some idea of
this martian city that spreads be-
fore me imagine spires and towers
a mile high-bulbous dwelling places
suspended at any and all heights-
majestic edifices that could house a
hundred of earths ocean liners-
columnar decorations glinting with
inlaid jewels and burnished metals-
all intertwined and connected with
conduits and tunnels and such

  this is a city of mars im in
fred the only city

  ive found out many things the
duration of intelligent life on mars
goes back a half million years it was
then that the martians developed
their speech and writing and first
beginnings of science

  their early history-when earth
was but a primeval jungle-is curi-
ously parallel to our own recorded
story-a series of wars famines
pestilences revolutions and mass mi-
grations they had seas then and
continents and islands just as on
earth

  it was a hundred thousand years
after their first written records that
spatial navigation became possible
to their science-and the martians
swarmed all over the solar system
no life was found on any of the
outer planets nor on their satellites
by reason of their remoteness from
the life-giving sun mercury sup-
ported a hardy silicic form of unin-
telligent life venus and earth were
steamy pots of struggling evolution-
ary forms of life and man was yet
unborn on our world

 thus the martians were sole
rulers and masters of the solar sys-
tem for the next hundred thousand
years the most precious and useful
products of all the different planets

were brought to mars to further and
make great martian civilization

but the next hundred-thousand-
year period was a period of
breaking down rather than building
up with the immense strides of
their science deadly and horrible
weapons of destruction were de-
veloped and the various classes and
races fell on one another and waged
war these periodic wars gradually
became more and more catastrophic
and disastrous and the once teeming
and thriving population dwindled

  it his hard to believe but my mar-
tian mentor-his name is sokon-in-
timated that for a long time the sole
ambition thought and endeavor of
all mars was toward warfare and
military dominion first one race
and then another gained ascendancy
in endless cycles that might have
gone on forever

  truly fred from what ive
learned this planet was rightfully
even if accidentally named after the
god of war-mars

  but it could not go on indefinitely
because of the rapidity with which
the population dwindled about fifty
thousand years ago all the planet lay
wasted and war-torn and its deni-
zens numbered but a few millions
scattered all over the planet in proud
little isolated communities each a
deadly enemy of the others

  you can surmise that while the
long series of wars went on scientific
advancement was hampered and the
peaceful trade fell almost to nothing
i am beginning to think fred that
warfare on earth is a small thing
compared to what it must be in such
an advanced superscientific world

  but just when it seemed that their
civilization was doomed to suicide-
the few millions left would not feed
their weapons more than another
century-salvation came to them

  that fred is all i know of the
story of mars for some strange-
and i fear awful-reason my mentor
would tell me no more on the sub-
the chessboard of mars

m

ject how the unity of the warlike
martians was achieved i shall tell
you when i find out

  someone is coming into my room
now fred goodby youll hear
from me-if providence wills it-as
soon as i can manage it in secrecy as
i fear to transmit in the presence of
sokon

july   a m

  i have finally got the chance to
transmit to you again fred but you
will never know what torture i went
through for awhile before i could
bring myself to contact you once
more perhaps it would be better
that you should never hear what i
have learned in the past day here on
mars

  but i have made the decision to
tell you all fred and if it plunges
your mind into a fog such as mine
heaven forgive me for the act

  some hours ago sokon took me to
the roof of this giant building and
into an airship in this vehicle we
darted over the immense mazes of
this city to its outskirts there the
ship dropped to what must be the
largest building on mars i estimate
it at a mile square yet it is not high

  not a word did sokon speak all
this time but after landing on the
roof of this cyclopean structure he
faced me with a strange and dread-
ful smile

  earthman he said now you
shall find the answers to all your
questions look around-he waved
an arm to include the conglomeration
of strange apparatuses spread all
over the roof near the landing field-
and know that from here is con-
trolled the superficial destiny of
earth

  of earth the thought rocketed
through my brain and made me
weak what could he mean i was
soon to know

  the apparatus i might explain
seemed to my wavering mind a hope-
less maze of geared machinery all
covered with some transparent pro-
tective material from which pro-

  truded hundreds of long thin spouts
or nozzles meaningless for the mo-
ment-but later they came to have a
frightful significance

  sokon then took me down an ele-
vator down into the building itself
i wish i could picture for you the
scene that met my unbelieving eyes
as the elevator door opened and i
was led out upon a balcony from
which could be viewed the entire in-
terior which was one immense room

  all around me was the gigantic
columned interior evenly spaced
across the floor were hundreds of
rows of apparatuses something like
organ consoles in each of which sat
a martian

   close scrutiny of one of the affairs
just below me revealed it as a circu-
lar button board in the center of
which sat the operator as i watched
his long arm with its sensitive fin-
gers flicked buttons with marvelous
rapidity causing little pilot lights
to flash about his head was a maze
of wires and tubes connected to the
control board by several strands of
heavy wire

  but of what use to describe to you
something whose immensity and
alien quality you could never grasp
except that it relieves my tired mind
to tell of these common details i
will go on as sokon went on when
i had recovered from astonishment
and wonder

  sokon returned to the previous
days talk and picked up the thread
of the story he had left unfinished
the martians faced with self-in-
flicted extinction decided at last that
it was foolish to fight among them-
selves when they could satiate their
battle lust in a way not at all harm-
ful to their persons

  earth had been explored and on
its surface had been found a form
of life with rational intelligence in-
habiting forests and caves-paleo-
lithic man a diabolical plan was
conceived and with a hue and a cry
the martians adopted it in bound-
less enthusiasm

  with their marvelous science and
their full and complete understand-
ing of psycho-phenomena they built
psycho-transmitters capable of pro-
jecting psycho-beams all the way to
earth which would give the mar-
tians practical control of the activity
of mankind on the young world

chapter iv
the chessboard of mars

can see you now fred trem-
bling and pale not daring to be-
lieve yet it is gods truth

  these control boards at each of
which sits a martian like a gloating
tyrant are psycho - transmitters
which project to earth at the will
of the operator any sort of psycho-
emotion or actual direct thought

  you will understand that the mar-
tians have refined and improved
their apparatus beyond our under-
standing so that they can either
fasten like a leech to one certain
mind of earth to a group or to a
whole nation-and pour their insidi-
ous psycho-emotions forth like a foul
wave of slime

  and the sole purpose and aim of
each martian is to wreak as much
bloodshed and harm as he can on
earth

  so all through the ages while
aboriginal man gradually arose from
ignorance and darkness to the glim-
merings of intelligence the martians
have been holding mankind back in-
stigating wars tribal battles per-
sonal fights and internecine revolu-
tions satisfying their bloodthirsty
warlike natures in playing warlord
v earth like an evil entity in the
heavens the martians have been
strewing the pages of earth history
with blood and gore and hatred and
discontent

it has always been the wonder and
surprise of most intelligent people

of our time fred why mankind had
wars at all why there was constant
bickering and battling when things
could be settled so easily in more
peaceful ways

  the beast in us it was called but
actually it was the beast being put
into us and god only knows how
far ahead the world might be on the
road to true civilization if it werent
in the fatal bloody grip of mars

  all through the ages then our
superficial destiny has been guided
from mars by beings who not will-
ing to battle themselves have in-
stead caused battles and bloodshed
on another world sokon tediously
traced earth history for me with
which naturally all martians are
smugly familiar he showed me all
the innumerable incidents which we
thought to be the course of fate but
which were really the results of the
martians psycho-waves-a vicari-
ous means of satiating their lust for
battle

  just to give a few instances alex-
ander the great world conqueror
was started on his bloody career by
a martian psycho-beam that from
babyhood on stirred his fighting
and ruling nature the psycho-emo-
tion goaded him and tormented him
till he had to obey its call

  partly under its guidance and
partly due to the conditions under
which he lived he swept out from
macedonia and poured blood on
dozens of battlefields alexanders
whole army was constantly under
the influence of a psycho-beam from
mars which made them so vicious
and fighting mad that they swept all
before them including the persian
hosts of darius

  then attila the hun his inva-
sions were first conceived in a mar-
tian brain and then forced on him so
that he became one of the bloodiest
and most vicious scourges in earths
history his little slant-eyed troops
were bathed in a psycho-beam so
powerful that some of the worst
atrocities of all time were the result
the chessboard of mars



  then napoleon the little corporal
who as a youth dreamed of a great
france his dreams were not his
own-they came hurtling across
millions of miles of space and were
implanted in his sensitive and keen
mind he arose lashed by the ham-
mering psycho-beams and swept all
europe wallowing in blood sacrific-
ing human lives without pity

  yet it was not napoleon himself
who cared so little for human life
and suffering it was the martians
across space who chuckled in glee
when vast armies swept together
and decimated one another

  then in the modern world that
we know-the fearful carnage of the
world war when mankind had ad-
vanced enough scientifically to pro-
duce terrible weapons that reminded
the martians of their own disbarred
ones in telling of this last earth
war let me mention again the build-
ing and its psycho-control boards

  the boards are divided among all
the different nations that were for-
merly represented on mars before
their union each group still as
proud and hateful as of yore when
they battled with guns instead of
psycho-waves concentrates itself on
a certain warlike project on earth
for instance in the world war the
martians decided to make it a grand
and glorious game between two and
only two sides

  accordingly half the boards were
then relegated to control the allies
the other half the central powers

  i will never be able to erase from
my mind fred the unutterable look
of glee on sokons face as he told
me that never in all their fifty thou-
sand years of playing had the mar-
tians had so much fun as during
the world war it had been a
grand game which had occasioned
intense rivalry and they had been
sorry when it finally ended

think of it fred all earth
every section and corner of it
constantly under the evil influence

which darts from mars at instan-
taneous velocity and submerges it in
psycho-waves that have as much to
do with the destiny of earths peo-
ples as their own hampered efforts to
rise above brutality and bloodshed

  the chief occupation of the mar-
tians in the past ages of their civili-
zation was warfare now their chief
occupation is playing on this gigantic
chessboard of mars moving humans
in paths of fate as the chess player
moves his pawns and pieces

  and fred the martians got so
much enjoyment out of the last
world war that they have again de-
cided to play such a two-sided game
japan is to be the nucleus of one
warrior group russia the nucleus
of the other they plan so sokon
tells me to draw into this war all the
nations of earth in a grand melee
which they plan to make a dozen
times more horrible than the last
holocaust

  furthermore sokon informed me
that the projector set up on that
kurile island which we first thought
to be the work of an earth madman
is part of a secret plot of his to beat
the other side one of the rules
of the game is that neither side shall
set up concentration projectors on
earth itself as this would give it
too much opportunity to incite
earth and destroy it completely

  sokon and several of his arch-
plotters secretly went to earth a
year ago and set up the projector
this will incite the japanese much
faster than the enemy and cause
them to arm more quickly and fight
more viciously

  this reveals to me the true de-
cadence and evil of martian nature
in general whatever was the initial
cause the martians grew up with a
far greater heritage of warlikeness
than-i am sure-ever reposed in
earth-peoples basic natures

  if only there were something i
could do if only there were some
way i could destroy them

  goodby fred perhaps goodby


wonder story annual

for good sokon is waiting for my
reeling mind to break down he does
this now and then with earthmen
delighting to watch them fall to
pieces when knowing the truth in
case there is anything more i should
want to transmit wait for me a full
earth day if i do not call by then
you will know that i am dead

in silence that seemed to echo
with the satanic leers of other-
world demons fred bilte moved
about the laboratory with a sort of
aimless purpose he rummaged in
the cabinet taking from it papers
covered with scrawled formulae

  hours later he took the sizeable
batch he had collected and burned
them wholesale on the tile floor
opening a window to let the acrid
smoke out he stared until the last
flame went out the secret of psycho-
detection would not leave the labora-
tory

  then he went to his couch his
eyes glinting with a bleakness like
that of frigid space itself he
stretched himself out stiffly his face
was like a graven wax mask he
waited not caring to sleep he re-
fused entrance to the manservant
with a tray of food and in the early
hours of july st the professors
voice came again

  fred fred are you there pray
god you are sokon had not tor-
tured me enough so he again dragged
me to the chessboard of human life
not many hours after the first time
-and went into vivid detail more
horrible than i dare to relate to you

  suddenly an enormous thought
struck me-a mad thought yet it
may have been a sublime thought i
will soon know

  sokon whom i will curse in my
dying breath above all other mar-
tians as the master fiend of them
all took me into the section whose
psycho-boards are on the enemy side
-russias side you know in this
titanic earth war they are investi-
gating one of that sides members

threw a taunt to sokon which he
returned with interest the taunting
grew and became a quarrel between
the two martians

  it was then the thought struck me
i obeyed my sudden inclination to
carry it through and dashed away
from the two bickering martians
and ran further into the section
whose members are opposed to so-
kon in the war game

  i betrayed sokon at the top of my
voice and told his opponents of the
illegal projector which had been set
up on earth head after head stirred
from the boards and jerked up

  then sokon came bearing down on
me having heard a little and sur-
mised the rest he fastened his bale-
ful speckled eyes on me and my
voice died in my throat i uttered a
brief prayer and waited for death

  but it did not come

  i opened my eyes a moment later
to find a dozen martians all enemies
of sokon protecting me from him
furthermore they were demanding
something from him and i could
easily guess what

  i know little or nothing of just
what was done then i was led by
the hand to a little cupola of trans-
parent material which overhangs the
entire interior of the building in it
are strange instruments that i sur-
mise to be deadly weapons this
cupola seems to be a sort of policing
center to insure peace in the as-
sembly the guns are on swivel
mounts and can rake any part of the
building

i am here in that cupola above the
chessboards now fred i have
not been fed for several hours my
throat is parched and dry i am
numb from mental agony yet a
faint spark of hope has been born
within me not hope for myself-no
what does my life mean but hope
for earth perhaps the investiga-
tion will result in the removal of the
projector on earth

  that there is an investigation in
the chessboard of mars



progress i know one of the fellows
up here in the cupola-there are
dozens of them equally divided in
allegiance-casually told me that as
soon as the right part of earths sur-
face turns in the direction of mars
their powerful telescopes will ex-
amine the kurile islands for that
outlawed projector i asked what
would be the result when it was
found he made a shrugging ges-
ture but his hand unconsciously
caressed the gun near him

  there is nothing more to say
fred except that there is unrest in
the very atmosphere around here i
can almost feel the hatred and sus-
picion welling up between the two
sides what the outcome of my ac-
tion in betraying sokon will be i
dont know but almost all my suffer-
ing at that devils hands is repaid
at the thought that at least ive put
him in a troublesome predicament

  the voice ceased later it burst
forth again excitedly

  a message fred a message cor-
roborating my story-the telescopes
saw the projector also they saw
something more-a spaceship land-
ing beside it and blowing it to drift-
ing dust sokon had sent a space-
ship post-haste to earth to destroy
the incriminating evidence of his
treachery-but too late

  i hardly know what to say about
things here now excitement is run-
ning high many martians have left
their boards and are gathering in
little groups there is much shout-
ing back and forth the very air
is electrified with wrath and hatred
sokon is down there conferring with
his henchmen his opponents are
glaring angrily in his direction for
he has been a leader of the other side

  the fellows up in this gun-cage
are very nervous and fidgety they
have in their hands the power to
wipe out all below them the sym-
pathizers of sokon in the cupola are
sitting at their guns the others are
watching the scene below

  somethings beginning now

  a group from sokons opposition
is running at him shouting sokon
faces about in fear-it is the begin-
ning of a riot they near him   
several martians tumble in the rush
   lord    sokon gunners just
fired a livid bolt of something that
whiffed a dozen martians to dust
now the opposing gunners retaliate
with a bolt to the other side

  it is a battle royal now without
restraint the gunners are shooting
down rioting martians hundreds
have been converted to puffs of va-
por good this in a small measure
repays earth for the sacrifice of her
murdered peoples this thing is
getting bigger and bigger-perhaps
it will become   

  yes part of the roof has been dis-
integrated at its edges appear mar-
tians from the city with weapons
that they rapidly install like ma-
chine-guns    the disintegrating
bolts are becoming thick    the
battling and rioting is turning into
an actual war i can see centuries
of repression swelling into a terrific
bloodlust i see a giant airship  it
hovers above the roof    the roof
puffs away  a searching ray
springs from the ship  it is sweep-
ing in circles and in its path nothing
remains death for the martians
 my heart sings

  the gunners here are busy wiping
out their fellowmen in absolute war
madness it is awful the look in
their eyes now is my chance i am
stealing over to the giant chessboard
psycho-transmitter a few twists of
several different levers and i am
ready to start

  im wiping out the entire bloody
planet fred  im concentrating
on the thought that every martian
kill his neighbor kill himself   
never before have the psycho-waves
been used at such short range   
the psycho-transmitter is now fo-
cused to envelop all mars with its
waves of hate    im not leaving
this machine until i have destroyed

chapter i

the mountain of the moon

before me not half a mile
away rose the nearest ram-
parts of the mountain of the
moon it was after noon and the red
sun blazed down on the bare un-
dulating sandy waste with fearful
intensity

  the air was still and intolerably
hot heat waves danced ceaselessly
over the uneven sand

  i felt the utter loneliness the wild
mystery and overwhelming power
of the desert the black cliffs rose
cold and solid in the east-a barrier
of dark menace pillars of black
basalt of dark hornblende of black
obsidian rose in a precipitous wall of
sharp and jagged peaks that curved
back to meet the horizon

  needle-like spires rose a thousand
feet and nowhere was the escarp-
ment less than half that high it was
with mingled awe and incipient fear
that i first looked upon the moun-
tain of the moon

  it was a year since i had left
medical college in america to begin
practise in perth australia there
i had an uncle who was my sole sur-
viving relative my companion on

the voyage had been dr horace
austen the well-known radiologist
archeologist and explorer he had
been my dearest friend that he
was thirty years my senior had
never interfered with our comrade-
ship it was he who had paid most
of my expenses in school

  he had left me at perth and gone
on to investigate some curious
ruined columns that a traveler had
reported in the western part of the
great victoria desert there austen
had simply vanished he had left
kanowna and the desert had swal-
lowed him up but it was his way
when working on a problem to go
into utter seclusion for months at
a time

  my uncle was an ardent radio en-
thusiast and it was over one of his
experimental short wave sets that
we picked up the remarkable mes-
sage from my lost friend that led
me to abandon my practise and
heeding the call of adventure that
has always been strong in those of
my blood to seek the half mythical
mountain of the moon in the heart
of the unexplored region of the


intelligence

while seeking a missing scientist in the australian deseit

    young winfield fowler wanders into a lost world where
past and future meet in a fantastic reign of terror


wonder story annual

great victoria desert of western
australia

the message was tantalizingly

  brief and hard to interpret we
picked it up five times over a period
of two weeks always just after
sunset evidently it was sent by
one who had not recently practised
his knowledge of code and it seemed
that the sender was always in a
great hurry or under considerable
nervous tension for minor errors
and omissions were frequent the
words were invariably the same i
copy them from an old notebook

  to winfield fowler physician
perth australia-i horace austen
am lost in an unknown new world
where alien terrors reign it lies in
a crater in the mountain of the
moon i implore you to come to my
aid for the sake of mankind

  bring arms and my equipment-
and roentgen tubes and coils and
the spectrometer ascend ladder at
west pinnacle find my friend mel-
var maiden of the crystal city whom
i left beyond the silver lake come
for the sake of civilization and may
whoever hears this forward it with
all dispatch

  my uncle was inclined to suspect
a hoax but after the message had
come over twice i received telegrams
from several other radio amateurs
who had heard it and were for-
warding it to me we took the di-
rection of the third call and had
amateurs in adelaide do the same
the lines intersected in the great
victoria desert at a point very
near that at which wellington lo-
cated the mountain of the moon
he sighted and named in 

  knowing austen to be intensely
human as a man but grave and
serious as a scientist it was impos-
sible for me to take the message as
a practical joke as my uncle-derid-
ing the possibility of my friends be-
ing imprisoned in an unknown new

world-insisted it was

  it was equally impossible for one
of my impetuous and adventurous
disposition to devote himself to any
prosaic business when so attractive
a mystery was beckoning then i
would never in any case have hesi-
tated to go to austens aid

  i got together the apparatus he
had mentioned-it was some equip-
ment he had left with me when he
went on-s well as my emergency
medicine kit a heavy rifle two 
colt automatics and a good supply
of ammunition then i waited for
more explicit signals but the calls
had not come regularly and after
the fifth no more were heard

  having waited another irksome
week i bade my uncle farewell and
got on the train i left the rail-
way at kanowna and bought three
ponies i rode one packed pro-
visions equipment and water
bottles on the other two nothing
need be said of the perils of the jour-
ney three weeks later i came in
sight of the mountain

  wellington had christened it as he
did because of an apparent simi-
larity to the strange cliff-rimmed
craters of the moon and the appel-
lation was an apt one the crags
rose almost perpendicularly from
the sand to the jagged rim to
climb them was out of the question

  the rock was polished slick by
wind-blown sands for many feet but
was rough and sharp above to my
left at the extreme west point of
the great curve was a dark needle
spire that towered three hundred
feet above its fellows i knew that
it must be austens west pinnacle
what sort of ladder i was to ascend
 had little idea

  as the sun sank back of the roll-
ing sea of sand dark purple shadows
rose about the barrier and i was
struck with deep forebodings of the
evil mystery that lay beyond it the
fold of the desert changed to silver
gray and the gray faded swiftly
while the deep purple mantle swept
the alien intelligence



up the peaks displacing even the
deep red crowns that lay like splashes
of blood upon the summits still i
felt or fancied a strange spirit of
terror that lurked behind the moun-
tain even in the night

  quickly i made camp just two of
the ponies were left and they were
near death i have passed over the
hardships of my trip i hobbled
them on a little patch of grass and

far away and up i thought over
the cliffs then the cloth of the tent
was lighted by a faint red glow
thrown on it from above i shivered
and the strange spell of the moun-
tain and the desert fell heavier upon
me

  i wanted to go out and investigate
but unfamiliar terror held me
powerless

 i gripped my automatic and

credit for discovery of the first lost world must go of
course to sir arthur conan doyles bearded and explosive
professor challenger who first found the isolated south american
plateau where the dinosaurs still range in a volume published in
london in 

thus as major sdence-fiction themes go the lost-world idea
is a comparatively new one-perhaps because the darwinian
theory of evolution was not acceptable to readers of popular fic-
tion until the edwardian era had tempered the whalebone rigidity
of victorian conformity

at any rate it arrived some centuries later than the space
voyage the time machine the android and other stf staples

but once arrived it quickly established itself as a basic theme and has yet to show
signs of waning popularity there is something inherently fascinating in the pale-
ontological absurdity of little man pitted against the reptilian monsters of the past
that holds the attention not only of its devotees but of motion picture producers and-
yes even editors

one years ago you can scarcely do better than read mr williamsons novelet the

brush that grew where water had
run from the cliff pitched my little
tent and found brush to start a tiny
fire

  i ate supper with but a scanty
cup of water then oppressed by
the vast mysterious peaks that
loomed portentously in the east
shutting out the starlight i went in
the tent and sought my blanket
then came the first of those terrible
and inexplicable occurrences that led
up to the great adventure

first i heard a faint whispering
sound or rather a hiss infinitely

waited tensely the scarlet radiance
shone ever brighter through the
cloth the sound turned to a hissing
scream it was deafening and it
plunged straight down it seemed to
pause to hover overhead the red
glare was almost blinding

 abruptly the tent was blown
down by a sudden tempest of wind
for perhaps a minute the terror
hung about me i lay there in a
strange paralysis of fear while a
hurricane of wind tore at the canvas
upon me i heard upon the tempest
above that awful whistling a wild
mad laugh that rang against the


wonder story annual

cliff weirdly appalling it was
utterly inhuman not even the laugh
of a madman just once it rang out
and afterward i imagined it had
been my fancy

  then the light and the sound
swept up and away with belated
courage i tore my way from under
the cloth the stars were like
jewels in the westward sky where
the zodiacal light was still visible
the ominous blackness of the moun-
tain blotted out the eastern stars
and the peaks were lighted by a
vague and flickering radiance of
scarlet like the reflection of un-
pleasant fires beyond

  strange pulsing fingers of red
seemed to thrust themselves up
from behind the cliff somehow they
gave me the feeling that an in-
credibly great incredibly evil per-
sonality lurked beyond the crimson
light shone weirdly on the wild sum-
mits of the mountain as if they were
smeared with blood

  i threw more brush on the fire
and crouched over it feeling uncom-
fortably alone and terrified when
the flames had flared up i looked
about for the ponies seeking com-
panionship even in them they were
gone at first i thought they had
broken their hobbles and run off but
i could neither see nor hear them
and they had been in no condition
to run far

  i walked about a little to look for
them then went back to the fire i
sat there and watched the eerie un-
wholesome glare that shone over the
mountain no longer did i doubt
the existence of austens world
where alien terrors reign i knew
even as i had felt when i first saw
the mountain that strange life and
power lurked beyond it

  presently i stretched the tent
again and lay down but i did not
sleep

  at dawn i got up and went to
look for the ponies i climbed one of
the low dunes and gazed over the
gray infinity of sand but not a sign

of them rewarded my look i tried
to trail them i found where they
had been hobbled and followed the
tracks of each to a place where their
hoofs had cut deep in the sandy
turf beyond there was no trace
then i was certain of what i had
already known that the thing had
carried them away

then i found something stranger
still-the prints of bare human
feet half erased by the wind that
had blown while the terror hung
there that unearthly laugh and the
footprints-was there a land of
madmen be h i n d the mountain 
and what was the thing that had
come and gone in the night those
were questions i could not answer
but daylight dulled my wondering
fear

  the sun would not rise on my side
of the mountain until nearly noon
and the cold dark shadow of the cliff
was upon me when the desert all
about was a shimmering white in
the heat of the sun austens call
had mentioned a ladder i set out to
find it just north of the peak i
came upon it running straight up
like a silver ribbon to the top of the
cliff

  it was not the clumsy affair of
ropes that i expected in fact i
at once abandoned any idea that
austen had made it at all it was
an odd looking white metal and it
seemed very old although it was
corroded but little the rungs were
short white bars riveted to long
straps which were fastened to the
rock by spikes of the same silvery
metal

  i have said that the mountain rises
straight from the sand and the
ladder goes on into the ground that
suggests that the sand has piled in
on the base of the mountain since
the ladder was put there at any
rate i am sure that it is incredibly
old

  i went back to camp packed to-
gether my guns a little food and
the alien intelligence



austens equipment-and started
up the ladder although it was no
more than six hundred feet to the
top heavily laden as i was i got
very tired before i reached it i
stopped several times to rest

  once looking down on the illimi-
table sea of rolling sand with the
tiny tent and the sharp shadow of
the mountain its only definite fea-
tures i had a terrible attack of
vertigo my fears of the night re-
turned until i almost wished i had
never started up the ladder but t
knew that if i were suddenly back in
perth again i would be more eager
than ever to set out upon the ad-
venture

  at last i reached the top and
crawled up in the mouth of a narrow
canyon with black stone walls ris-
ing straight to the peaks on either
side down the crevice was a smooth
curving pathway very much worn
it seemed more by time than human
feet

  it was not yet noon i waited a
few minutes to rest then walked up
the path with keen curiosity as to
where it led it grew so deep that
the sky overhead was but a dark
blue ribbon in which i saw venus
gleaming whitely it widened i
walked out on a broad stone plat-
form and below me lay-the abyss

  i stood on the brink of a great
chasm whose bottom must have been
miles below sea level the farther
walls of the circular pit-they must
have been forty miles away-were
still black in the shadow of the morn-
ing clouds of red and purple mist
hung in the infinities of space the
chasm contained and completely hid
the farther half of the floor

  beneath me so far away that it
might have been on another world
was a deep red shelf a scarlet plain
as weird as the deserts of mars to
what it owed its color i could not
tell in the midst of the red rose
a mountain whose summit was a
strange crown of scintillating fire
it looked as though it were capped

not with snow but with an immense
heap of precious jewels set on fire
with the glory of the sun and blazing
with a splendorous shifting flame
of prismatic light

  and the crimson upland sloped
down-to the silver lake it was
a lake shaped like a crescent moon
its horns reaching to the mountains
on the north and the south in the
hollow of the crescent beyond low
hills rose impenetrable banks of
purple mist lying back of them to the
dark wall in the distance

  the lake gleamed like quicksilver
and light waves ran upon it reflect-
ing the sunlight in cold blue fire it
seemed that faint purple vapors
were floating up from the surface
set like a picture in the dark red
landscape with the black cliffs about
the argent lake was very white
very bright

chapter ii
down the silver ladder

for a long time i gazed into the
abyss lost in the wonder and the
mystery of it meanwhile the sun
climbed over and lit the farther rim
which still was black or dully red
because of the daik colors of the
volcanic rocks of which it is com-
posed the scene was so vast so
strange so wildly beautiful and un-
earthly that it seemed almost a
dream instead of an ominous reality

  it was hard to realize that some-
where upon the red plain or along
the shores of the silver lake or per-
haps beneath the banks of mist be-
yond austen was-or had been-
alone and in distress i wondered too
from what part of this strange world
had come the thing of the whistling
sound and the red light which had
taken the ponies

  it was well after noon before i
ate a little lunch and took thought


wonder story annual

of the matter of descent i saw that
a second ladder led down in a fine
thread of silver until it disappeared
above the crimson upland miles be-
low i climbed over the brink and
started down

  descending was easier than climb-
ing had been but i had infinitely
farther to go the soles of my shoes
were cut through and my hands be-
came red and blistered on the rungs
sometimes when i was too tired to
go on i slung myself to the ladder
with a piece of rope from my pack
and rested

  steadily the black walls rose
higher before me the red plateau
beneath the mountain with its
crown of flaming gems the strange
white lake beyond came nearer and
nearer i was still half a mile above
the scarlet plain when the shadow
of the western wall was flung fast
over the valley floor and the light
purple mists beyond the argent lake
deepened their hue to a dark and
ominous purple-red

  but the silver lake did not
darken it seemed luminous it
gleamed with a bright metallic
silvery luster even when the shadow
had fallen upon it whenever i
rested i searched keenly the whole
visible floor of the abyss but no-
where was any life or motion to be
seen

  with growing apprehension i real-
ized that i would not have time to
reach the ground before dark i
had no desire to be stuck like a fly to
the face of the cliff when the thing
that had made the red light was mov-
ing about

  disregarding my fatigue and pain
i clambered down as fast as i could
force my wearied limbs to move
the process of motion had become
almost automatic hands and feet
moved regularly rhythmically with-
out orders from the brain but
sometimes they fumbled or slipped
then i had to grasp in frenzy at the
rungs to save my life

  night fell like a black curtain

rolled quickly over the top of the
pit but the half-moon of the silver
lake still shone with its white
metallic light and strange moving
shapes of red appeared in the mist in
the hollow of the crescent the light
that fell upon the rock was faint but
enough to help and still i hurried-
forcing hands and feet to follow
down and find the rungs fearfully
i looked over my shoulder at the
bank of mist

  suddenly a long pale finger of
red-a delicate rosy ray-shot high
out of it up the vague pathway it
sped a long slender pencil of crim-
son light-a narrow sharp-tipped
scarlet shape-high into the night
and over and around in a long arch-
ing curve down it plunged and back
into the mist

  presently i heard its sound-that
strange whistling sigh that rolled
majestically and rose and fell vast
as the roar of an erupting volcano
other things sprang out of the
purple bank slender searching
needles of brilliant scarlet sweeping
over the valley and high into the
starlit sky above

  following paths that were smooth
and arched with incredible speed
they swept about like a swarm of
strange insects always with amaz-
ing ease and always shooting back
into the cloud leaving faint purple
tracks behind them and the great
rushing sounds rose and fell those
lights were incredible entities in-
telligent-and evil

  they flew more often than any-
where else over the crown of lights
upon the hill-the gems still shone
with a faint beautiful glow of
mingled colors whenever one
swept near the mountain a pale blue
ray shot toward it from the cap of
jewels and the red things fled
from the ray

  more and more the flying things
of crimson were drawn to the moun-
taintop wheeling swiftly and cease-
lessly ever evading the feeble beams
of blue their persistence was in-
the alien intelligence	

human-and terrible they were
like insects wheeling about a light

all the while i climbed down as
fast as i could driving my worn-
out limbs beyond the limit of en-
durance while i prayed that the
things might not observe me then
one passed within a half mile with
a deep awful whistling roar fling-
ing ahead its dusky red pathway and
hurtling along with a velocity that
is inconceivable

  i saw that it was a great red body
a cylinder with tapering ends with
a bright green light shining on the
forward part it did not pause but
swept on along its comet-like path
and down behind the silver lake
behind it was left a vague purple
phosphorescent track like the path
of a meteor that lasted several
minutes

  after it was gone i hurried on
for a few minutes breathing easier
then another went by so close that
a hot wind laden with the purple
mist of its track blew against my
face

  i was gripped with unutterable
terror i let myself down in the
haste of desperation then the third
one came as it approached it
paused in its path and drifted slowly
and deliberately toward me the
very cliff trembled with the roaring
blast of its sound the green light
in the forward end stared at me
like a terrible evil eye

  exactly how it happened i never
knew i suppose my foot slipped or
my bleeding hands failed to grasp
a rung i have a vague recollection
of the nightmare sensation of fall-
ing headlong of the air whistling
briefly about my ears of the dark
earth looming up below i think i
fell on my back and that my head
struck a rock

  the next i knew it was day and
the sun was shining in my eyes i
struggled awkwardly and painfully
to my feet my whole body was
bruised and sore and the back of my

head was caked with dried blood
my exhausted muscles had stiffened
during the night and to stand upon
my cut and blistered feet was tor-
turing but i had something to be
thankful for-i had been within a
few feet of the ground when i fell
-and the red thing had departed
and left me lying there perhaps
thinking me dead

  i leaned against the base of the
metal ladder and looked about i
had fallen into a thicket of low red
bushes all around grew low thick
brush covering the slightly rolling
plain the plants were scarcely
knee-high bearing narrow feathered
leaves of red

  their delicate fern-like sprays of
crimson rippled in the breeze like
waves on a sea of blood the leaves
had a peculiar bright and greasy
appearance and a strange pungent
odor the shrubs bore innumerable
tiny snow-white flowers that
gleamed like stars against the deep
red background

  i think that the red vegetation
must have evolved from a species
of cycad undoubtedly the greater
crater had been isolated from the
outer world when the great tree-
ferns were reigning throughout the
earth and as i was presently to
find the order of evolution in the
deep warm pit had been vastly dif-
ferent from that which had pro-
duced man as its highest form of life

  presently i was to meet far
stranger and npre amazing things
than the red bush i am inclined to
believe that the extraordinary color
may have been due to the quality
of the atmosphere perhaps to the
high pressure or to the purple vapors
that ever rose from the region be-
yond the silver lake

  nowhere did i see any living thing
nor did i hear any sound of life
in fact one of the strange things
of the place was the complete ab-
sence of the lower forms of life
even of the smaller insects the
silence hung oppressively it grew


wonder story annual

intolerably monotonous-madden-
ing

  far away to the right and left the
walls of the pit rose straight and
black toward the azure infinity that
arched the top to my left five or
six miles away towered the gem-
covered hill its summit a blaze of
ever-changing polychromatic flame
beyond it all along the east the red
plateau fell away to the silver lake
which lay like a curved scimitar of
polished steel the faint bank of
purple mist shrouding the low red
hills that rose inside the curve be-
yond the sun was just above the
eastern peaks shining purple
through the mist

  after a time i limped slowly down
the nearest of the little valleys as
i went my roving eye caught the
bright glitter of brass on the ground
at my feet searching in the red
shrubs i picked up three fired
cartridges from a  calibre auto-
matic

  i held them in my hand and gazed
over the weird scene before me lost
in wonder they were concrete
proof that austen had passed this
way had here fought off some
danger he must yet be somewhere
in this strange crater but where
was i to find melvar maiden of
the crystal city-and what was she
to do for me

  presently i went on i wanted
water to bathe my cuts and bruises
i was very thirsty as well as hun-
gry my pack was an irksome
burden but i did not discard it and
i carried the heavy rifle ready in my
hand i was still feeling very weak
after a painful half mile i came to a
tiny pool in a thicket of the red
scrub i lay down and drank the cool
clear water until i was half sick i
threw away the remnants of my
shoes and bathed my feet

suddenly my attention was ar-
rested by a crystal clashing
sound there was a marching
rhythm in it and the clatter of

weapons i crouched down the
shrubbery and peered fearfully
about i saw a line of men queerly
equipped soldiers marching in single
file over the nearest knoll

  they seemed to be wearing a
closely fitting chain mail of silvery
metal and they had helmets breast-
plates and shields that threw off
the sunlight in scintillant flashes of
red as if made of rubies their long
swords flashed like diamonds their
crystal armor tinkled as they came
in time to their marching feet

  one whom  took to be the leader
boomed out an order in a hearty
mellow voice they passed straight
by within fifty yards of me i saw
that they were tall men of magnifi-
cent physique white-skinned with
blond hair and blue eyes on they
went in the direction of the fire-
topped mountain until they passed
out of sight in a slight declivity
and their music died away

  it is needless to say that i was ex-
cited as by nothing that i had seen
before a race of fair-haired men
in an australian valley-what a
sensational discovery i supposed
that they had built the metal ladder
and come down it into the valley-
but from whence had they come or
was the mountain of the moon itself
the cradle of humanity the garden
of eden

  then the weapons of the soldiery
suggested that they used some trans-
parent crystalline substance in lieu
of metal that the iridescent crown
upon the mountain might be the city
of the race was it austens crys-
tal city that would suggest a high
civilization but i saw no sign of the
mechanical devices that are the out-
standing features of our own civi-
lized achievement certainly the
soldiers had carried no modern arms

  then i thought of the footprints
and the eerie laugh i wondered
what contact austen had had with
these people had they been friends
or foes i wondered if it had been
the men of the crystal city who had
the alien intelligence



  paid me a visit outside the cliffs
  if so the red torpedo-shapes of the
  night must be aircraft and they must
  have advanced the art of aerial
  navigation to a very high and sig-
   nificant degree

    i determined first of all to do
  some spying to find out as much as
  possible about the strange race be-
  fore i revealed my presence i was
  not in a very good trim for battle
  and i had taken much pains for con-
  cealment when the men passed but
  i had little doubt that my guns
  were so far superior to their crystal
  swords that i could fight them at any
  odds if they should prove to be un-
  friendly

    so presently i bound my feet with
  bandages from my medicine kit at-
  tended as best i could to the wound
  on the back of my head and walked
  slowly on in the direction of the
  mountain keeping in the cover of
  the valleys as much as possible al-
  though i could limp oainfully along
  the red vegetation offered no serious
  impediment to my progress

  the low bushes crushed easily un-
  derfoot burdening the air with
  their unfamiliar pungent odor the
  country was rolling the low hills and
  level valleys all covered crimson
  with the scrub gigantic boulders
  scattered here and there

    the silver lake shimmered in the
  distance-a bright white metallic
  sheet

    the gem-capned mountain rose be-
  fore me until i saw that the gaunt
  black sides rose a full thousand
  feet to the crown of blazing crystal
  and as i drew nearer i saw that
  indeed the gems were buildings of
  a massive fantastic architecture

    a city of crystal prismatic fires
  of emerald-green and ruby-red and
  sapphire-blue poured out in a
  mingled flood of iridescence from its
  slender spires and great towers its
  central ruby dome and the circling
  battlements of a hundred flashing
  hues

chapter iii
melvar of astran

just before noon i staggered into
a little dell that was covered with
unusually profuse growths of the
crimson plants along a little trick-
ling stream of water they were waist
high bearing abundantly the star-
shaped flowers and small golden-
brown fruits

  suddenly there was a rustling in
the thicket and the head and shoul-
ders of a young woman rose abruptly
out of the red brush in her hand
she held a woven basket half full
of the fruits in my alarm i had
thrown up the rifle but i soon
lowered it and grinned in confusion
when i realized that it was a girl
by far the most beautiful i had ever
seen

  i have always been awkward in
the presence of a beautiful woman
and for a few minutes i did noth-
ing but stand and stare at her while
her quizzical dark blue eyes in-
scrutably returned my look

  she was clad in a slight garment
green in color that seemed to be
woven of a fine-spun metal her
hair was long and golden fastened
behind her shapely head with a cir-
clet-a thin band cut evidently from
a single monster ruby her features
were fine and delicate and she had a
surpassing grace of figure

  that her slender arms were
stained to the elbows with the red
juice of the plants-she had been
picking the golden fruits-did not
detract from her beauty i was
struck-and i admit conquered-by
her face for a little time she stood
very erect looking at me with an
odd expression and then she spoke
enunciating the words very care-
fully in a rich golden voice

  the language was english

  she said are you-american 


wonder story annual

  at your service i told her
winfield fowler of white deer
texas and new york city not to
mention other points but i own
to some surprise at finding a knowl-
edge of the idiom in a denizen of so
remote a locality

  i can understand she smiled
but i think you could talk-more
simply so you are winfield who
came with austen across the great
-ocean from america

  you guessed it i said trying
to keep my growing excitement in
hand while i marveled at her beauty
is mind reading common in these
parts

  doctor austen-the american-
told me about you his friend and
he gave me two books-tennysons
poems and-the pathfinder 

  so you have seen austen i
cried in real astonishment are
you melvar are you the maiden
of the crystal city 

  i am melvar she told me and
austen stopped in astran one sutar
-that is thirty-six days

  where is he now i eagerly de-
manded

  he was a strange man the
golden voice replied he did not
fear the krimlu as do the men of
astran he walked off toward the
pass in the north that leads around
-around the silver lake he called
it he had been watching the krimlu
as they came at night and doing
strange things with some stuff he
took from the silver lake

  while he was here the hunters
brought in one of the-again she
hesitated at a loss for a word-
the purple ones she concluded
he took that to examine it

  what are the krimlu i ex-
claimed what-or who-are the
purple ones what is the silver
lake

  you are a man of many ques-
tions she laughed for a moment
she hesitated her blue eyes rest-
ing on my face

  the krimlu so say the old men

of astran are the spirits of the
dead who come back from the land
beyond the silver lake to watch
the living and to carry off the evil
for their food so the priests taught
us and so i believed until austen
came and told me of the world that
is beyond

  he told the elders of the outer
world but they put upon him the
curse of the sun and drove him
away and indeed it is well that he
was ready to go so willingly beyond
the silver lake for jorak would
have offered him to the purple sun
had he been in the city another
night

  suddenly she must have become
conscious of the intensity of my un-
thinking gaze for she abruptly
dropped her eyes and flushed a little

  go on i urged what about
the purple ones and the silver
lake your account is certainly en-
tertaining if somewhat more mysti-
fying than illuminating at this
rate you will have me a raving
maniac in an hour but the process is
not unpleasant proceed

she looked up at me smiled looked
off to the side then let her eyes
return to mine with curious specula-
tion in them what is the silver
lake she went on you know as
well as i though austen tried to find
its secret the touch of its water
is death-a death that is terrible

  and the purple ones-you will
see them soon enough they are
strange beings who come no one
knows whence into the land of
astran the priests tell us that they
are the avengers of the purple sun
-but did you come down the ladder
as austen did 

  most of the way in the same
manner i told her i finished the
descent rather faster than he did i
imagine

  is there really she asked a
forests that are green and seas of
clear blue water and a sun that is
broad world beyond with fields and
the alien intelligence

s

not purple but white such austen
told me but the elders say that the
ladder is the path to the purple
sun and that beyond is nothing

  is it true that there is a great
nation of the men of your race a
nation of men who know the art of
fire that austen showed us and
greater arts-who can travel in
ships over water and through the
air like the krimlu

  yes i said the world is that
and more-but in all of it i have
never seen a girl as beautiful as
you

  it is not my habit to make such
speeches to ladies but i was feeling
a bit light-headed that morning as
a reaction from my terrible adven-
ture-and i was rather intoxicated
by her charm

  she smiled evidently not dis-
pleased and looked away again
composing her expression with dif-
ficulty there was a suspicious
twinkle in her dark blue eyes

  tell me why you have come into
this land she asked abruptly

  austen sent for me to come to
his aid i replied

  you and austen are not like the
men of astran she mused not
one of them ever went out to face
the krimlu or even the purple ones
of his own free will you must be
brave

  say ignorant i said since i
have seen the krimlu as you call
the flying lights i am about ready
to give up courage of any kind

  then because my exhausted con-
dition had robbed me of my ordi-
nary sense of responsibility i did
such a thing as i had never dared
before the girl was standing close
before me matchlessly beautiful
infinitely desirable her eyes were
bright and the sunlight glistened
in her golden hair

  and-well i admit that i did not
try very hard to resist the tempta-
tion to kiss her i felt her arm at
my back a sudden quick thrust
of her lithe body the next i knew

i was lying on my back and she was
bending over me with tears in her
eyes

  oh she cried i didnt know
your head it is bleeding and your
hands and feet i didnt notice

  so i was compelled to lie there
while the beautiful stranger very
tenderly dressed apd bandaged the
cut on my head in truth i doubt
that i would have been able to get
up immediately the touch of her
cool fingers was very light and deft
once her golden hair brushed
against my cheek her nearness was
very pleasant i knew that i loved
her completely though i had never
taken much stock in love at first
sight

  presently she had finished then
she said when austen gave me the
books he left a letter for any man
of the outside who might happen
to come to astran you might come
with me to the city to get it-and
to rest until you can walk without
limping so painfully

  then if you will you can find
austen but the krimlu are mighty
no man of astran has ever dared
oppose them no man who has ever
gone into that accursed region has
ever been seen again

chapter iv
astran the crystal city

the sun dropped beneath the rim
and the purple dusk began to
thicken and creep over the valley
floor i took up my precious equip-
ment and melvar and i walked off
through the red brush in the direc-
tion of the mountain the vast
strange buildings of the city of gems
were still glowing with soft color
and the cold bright surface of the
silver lake flashed often into sight
beyond the rolling eminences

  presently we came to a well-worn


wonder story annual

path through the crimson scrub but
i saw nothing to indicate that any-
one had thought of paving or im-
proving it the astranians did not
seem to have much energy for any
kind of public work their material
civilization appeared to be on a
rather low scale in fact they sup-
plied their wants in the way of food
entirely with the abundant fruit of
the red bushes

  as i had guessed from the girls
remarks they did not have even the
use of fire indeed the great physi-
cal and mental development of the
race and the splendid city in which
it lived were strangely contrasted
with their absolute lack of scientif-
ic knowledge

 our pace was hastened b y
thoughts of the terrors the night
would bring perhaps because of
them we walked nearer to one an-
other and presently we were hurry-
ing along hand in hand about us
the purple night deepened and be-
yond the argent brilliance of the
silver sea the strange evil of the
darkness gathered itself for the
attack

  at last we came to the narrow
path that wound up the side of the
mountain to the splendid palaces
that crowned it we hurried came
to a great arched gate in the emerald
wall and entered the huge and in-
credibly magnificent buildings were
scattered irregularly about the sum-
mit with broad spaces between them

  here and there were paved courts
of the silvery metal which must
have been an aluminum bronze but
the open ground was for the most
part grown up in rank thickets of
the red brush the great buildings
showed the wear and breakage of
ages here and there were great
heaps of gleaming crystal where
wonderful edifices had fallen with
the brush grown up around them

  incredible as it may seem i think
the old civilization of astran had
possessed a science that was able to
synthesize diamonds and other pre-

cious stones in quantities sufficient
even for use as building stones
later i had opportunity to examine
bits of the fallen masonry

  towering above all on the very
peak of the mountain was a great
ruby dome vast as the dome of st
peters mounted upon the center of
the top was a huge machine that re-
sembled nothing so much as a great
naval gun though it was made of
crystal and white metal

 a little group of men were
gathered about it and as i watched
they swung the great tube about
and a narrow ray of pale blue light
poured out of it down on the plain
below where the practise beam had
struck a great boulder flashed into
sudden incandescence

  in their exploration of the ultra-
violet spectrum our own scientists
have found rays that are strangely
destructive to life and considerable
progress has been made in the de-
velopment of a destructive beam of
wireless energy but later i was to
meet a far more terrible ray weapon
than that slender blue beam

  with that said melvar our
people fight off the krimlu at night
but the krimlu are so many that
sometimes they are able to land
and take our people if only we
had more of the beams

  but there is no man in all astran
who knows how the light is made-
or anything save that the blue light
shines out to destroy when rock of a
certain kind is put into the tube
austen wished to examine it and
spoke of something he called radium
ore but the priests forbade indeed
his curiosity is one of the reasons
jorak had for driving him away

  standing about the ill-kept streets
were a few of the people of the
crystal city all were of magnificent
physique and intelligent looking
white-skinned and fair haired all
wore garments that seemed of spun
metal and bore gleaming crystal
weapons

  most of them were hurrying along
the alien intelligence



intent on affairs of their own but
a few gathered around us almost as
soon as we stepped in the gate i felt
that they were hostile to me they
questioned melvar in a tongue that
was strange to my ears-then be-
came engaged in a noisy debate
among themselves their glances
toward me were furtive and sullen
and their eyes had the look of men
crazed by fear

melvar was saying something
in a conciliatory tone and i was
swinging my rifle into position for
use when there was a sudden shout
from the gate of the city and the
clashing of crystal weapons the
interruption was most welcome to
me the crowd turned eagerly to
the new arrivals

  i saw that they were a band of
soldiers possibly the same that had
passed me in the morning slung to
a pole carried between the foremost
two was a strange thing weirdly
colored and fearfully mutilated as
it was i saw that it was the naked
body of a human being

  the head was cut half off and
dangling at a grotesque angle the
hair was very long and very white
flying in loose disorder the features
were withered and wrinkled indeed
the whole form was incredibly ema-
ciated it was the corpse of a woman
the flesh was deep purple

  as i stood staring at the thing in
horror there was laughter and cheer-
ing in the crowd and a little child
ran up to stab at the thing with a
miniature diamond sword melvar
touched my arm

  come quickly she whispered
the people do not like your coming
they did not like the things austen
told of the world outside for the
priests teach that there is no such
world it is well that the hunters
came when they did with the purple
one and let us hope that the priests
of the purple sun do not hear of
you

  as she spoke she steered me rapid-

ly away through a tangle of the red
brush and through a colonnade of
polished sapphire then she quickly
led the way along a deserted alley
across another patch of the red
shrubbery and down a short flight
of steps into a chamber that was
dark

  wait here she commanded i
must leave you i think that jorak
has had spies upon me and if i were
too long absent he might grow sus-
picious he was the enemy of mv
father and some day my brother will
slay him sometimes i am afraid of
the way he looks at me

  however there is no danger now
if the priests hear i will somehow
get you out of astran i think they
will not seek you here whatever may
happen my brother will bring the
message from austen and food and
drink may you rest well and have
faith in me

  she ran up the steps and left me
standing in the darkness in a state
of uncomfortable indecision i did
not like the turn that affairs had
taken

  it is never pleasant to be alone
in the dark in a strange and dan-
gerous place

  i would have much preferred to
take my chances out on the open
plain with nothing but the moving
lights to fear terrible as they were
than here in this strange city full
of ill-disposed savages

  a diamond knife will kill a man
just as effectively and completely
as the weirdest death that ever
roamed the night

   for a time i stood waiting tensely
my rifle in my hand but i was very
tired and weak presently i got out
my flashlight and examined the
place it was a little cell apparently
hewn in the living rock of the moun-
tain there was nothing in the way
of furniture except a sort of padded
shelf or bed at the back i sat down
upon it and presently went to sleep
there though i had no intention of
doing so
	wonder story annual

the next i knew someone was
shaking my arm and shouting
strange words in my ear i opened
my eyes standing before me was a
young man in one hand he held a
crystal globe filled with a glowing
phosphorescent stuff faintly light-
ing the little apartment i sat up
slowly for my limbs were stiff the
gun was still in my hand

  without saying anything more the
young fellow pointed to a tray that
he had set by me on the shelf it
contained a crystal pitcher of aro-
matic liquid and a dash of the yellow
fruit i gulped down some of the
drink and ate a few of the fruits
feeling refreshed almost immediate-
ly

  then the boy-he was not more
than sixteen years of age-thrust
into my hand an envelope addressed
in the familiar handwriting of
austen he handed me the light and
walked up the stone stairs

  with feeling that well may be
imagined i tore open the envelope
and read in the faint light of the
glowing bulb the words of my old
friend

  to whomsoever of my own race
this may be delivered-

  since you must so far have trav-
eled the mysterious dangers of this
strange world it is needless for me
to dwell upon them i write this brief
missive for the information of any-
one who shall happen to find the
way here in the future and in order
that the riddle of my own disappear-
ance may some time be cleared up
if i fail to return for i intend to
explore the region beyond this lake-
i call it the silver lake-or to lose
my life in the attempt

  my name is horace austen i came
to the great victoria desert to in-
vestigate the sculptured columns re-
ported by hamilton far to the west
of here i found the ruins and in-
credibly ancient they are they must
date from fifty thousand years ago
at the latest

  among them was an amazing pic-
tographical record of a raceof men
driven by the drying up of their
country to emigrate to the crater of
a great mountain nearby there was
no mistaking the meaning i was of
course intensely interested for
nothing of the kind had ever been
reported in australia and certainly
the people depicted were not bush-
men

  it happened that i remembered
wellingtons account of the moun-
tain of the moon whose northern
cliff was followed for a few miles
by his route of  that appeared
to be the best chance for the great
crater described on the columns it
was but natural for me to decide
to investigate it there is no use for
me to dwell upon my hardships but
the last of my water was drank when
i found the ladder which was lo-
cated just as the inscriptions indi-
cated

  i reached the red plain without
accident and found the fruit of the
strange vegetation a palatable and
nourishing food so far i have
escaped the red lights that haunt
the night and it is their mystery
that i am determined to solve i
went down to the metallic lake and
investigated it

  i confess myself quite unable to
account either for the nature or for
the incredible origin of the fluid
with proper precaution it can be
studied without great difficulty but
since i am almost entirely ivithout
apparatus i have learned little
enough about it

  i had been in the crater a week
when i decided to approach the city
of jewels on the mountain i have
been in astran over a month but on
account of the savagery and igno-
rance of the people and the oppres-
sive rule of the priesthood i have not
been on very friendly relations with
melvar who seems far above the
others of her race and who has been
my friend from the first
them-with the exception of the girl
the alien intelligence



  i have been able to learn but little
from them although i have acquired
a fair knowledge of the language
my instructor the beautiful melvar
is showing a keen desire to learn
english of which she is gaining
command with remarkable speed

  she is developing as well an in-
satiable curiosity about the outer
worlds

  the sentiment against me has been
ever running higher and tomorrow
i shall leave the crystal city and en-
deavor to roundthe sea in the north
and to reach the mist-veiled land
beyond my only regret in leaving is
that i shall see melvar no more 
wish there were some way to secure
for her the advantages of a civilized
education

  these may be my last words to
the world if indeed they ever come
into the hands of a civilized man
but i knotv that sooner or later the
crater will be discovered andi en-
tered my chief purpose in writing
this aside from the satisfaction of
leaving an account of my own do-
ings is to state my firm belief i may
say my certain knowledge that the
strange things that may be observed
here supernatural or incredible as
they may appear result from per-
fectly natural forces in the control
of a civilized power that may not be
much above our own advancements

               horace austen

       chapter v
     fowler recovers
     

t read it in the faint glow of the
phosphorescent globe then read
it again so austen was beyond the
crescent if he had been able to carry
out his plan the date of the letter
was ten months back then the radio
message had probably come from
the other side and why had it been
sent

  austen was not one to appeal for
aid for himself alone had he feared
some general danger to the human
race i thought of his phrase for
the sake of mankind and shuddered
at a picture of the red lights sweep-
ing like destroying angels over a
great city like new york decimat-
ing the terrorized population

  i tried to think what was best for
me to do if ever i got out of astran
alive i supposed that austen had
been able to round the silver lake in
the north i should be able to follow
him clearly there was nothing for
me to do but to find out as much
about this strange world as possible
and to get the equipment to him as
soon as i could do so

  i stayed in the cellar-like home for
a week twice each day the young
chap came to bring food and drink
he knew but a few words of english
and during the hour or so he stayed
each time i had him try teaching me
the language of astran but my
progress was slow and i never
learned more than a few score
words the language seemed much
more complex than english with
bewildering rules of inflection

  but i developed quite a liking for
the boy he had a simple straight-
forward manner and a good sense of
humor his name was naro he was
the brother of melvar and was two
years younger their father it
seemed had been carried off several
years before when the flying lights
made a great raid and the mother
had soon after fallen a victim to the
sacrificial rites of the hated jorak

  the boy himself bore the scars of
wounds he had suffered a few
months earlier in a terrific battle
with one of the purple ones as
those monsters were called which so
mystified me then and with which i
had such terrible experiences later

  on the second day melvar came
she brought a great flask of aro-
matic oil that she poured over my
wounds it must have been remark-
ably healing for in a few days i


wonder story annual

found myself entirely recovered be-
fore she left she told me that the
priests had heard of my arrival and
that it was whispered among the
people that i was a supernatural
being sent as an omen of an attack
by the krimlu

  she told me too that there was
talk of a sacrifice soon to be offered
at the altar of the purple sun to
appease the angry spirits of the
dead sweet and innocent child she
seemed to have no fear that she
who had brought me into the city
would be the sacrifice i did nothing
to let her know my misgivings al-
though i did propose that we leave
the city together as soon as possible
how i hated to see her leave the
apartment

  during the following days i
questioned naro constantly as to the
doings of his sister and of the as-
tranians but i was able to elicit
no very satisfactory information ex-
cept that none of the krimlu had
been seen for several days and that
the headmen of the nation were be-
ginning to expect a raid in force

  also i persuaded him to keep a
very close watch on the movements
of melvar and to come to me at once
if jorak made any attempt to get
her into his power or if the sacrificial
ceremony was begun with the vic-
tim unselected

  during the interminable periods
when i was alone i was driven al-
most insane by the monotony and
anxiety of my existence but i had
my scientific equipment and i had
the boy bring me a few assorted
fragments of the crystal building
stones which i tested and found to
be real gems of several varieties
many gems are simple enough in
chemical formula and composed of
the most common elements so the
synthesis of them by scientific means
is not unreasonable

  for example it is a well-known
fact that diamond is just a crystal
form of carbon which element oc-
curs in three allotropic forms those

three forms are diamond graphite-
which also crystallizes-and amor-
phous carbon of which charcoal is
a form since carbon occurs in the
air in carbon dioxide it is not im-
possible that latterday science should
be able to manufacture diamonds
from the air

  sapphires are aluminum oxide or
alumina colored with a little cobalt
and rubies are composed of the same
oxide with a trace of chromium to
which the color is due a clay-bed
would supply an inexhaustible
amount of the elements needed for
the synthesis of these gems and i
think the people of old astran had
been able to accomplish it

  i examined the little glow-lamp too
and found it to be simply a crystal
bottle filled with the moist crushed
leaves of the red plants which
formed a culture of some kind of
luminous bacteria

on the seventh night when the
pale ray of daylight that filtered
down into my hiding place was
dimmed naro burst into the cham-
ber panting and wild-eyed with ter-
ror his crystal sword was gone
his metallic mangle was torn and
blood was falling drop by drop from
a deep scratch on his arm

  he thrust into my hand a tattered
scrap of paper evidently the flyleaf
of a book on it in an ink that i
took at first to be blood although
it was probably the juice of the red
plants the following words were
formed in hastily drawn printing
characters-

  winfield there is no hope the
priests will offer a gift to the purple
sun i am the victim already i
am in the hands of jorak i am
sorry f or i loved you it may be that
i can give this to naro who will take
it to you

  the krimlu are coming tonight
already their lights flicker above the
mist in the morning my brother
will take you to the gate and you
the alien intelligence



may escape if only it had been one
night later we might have all been
away together farewell

                      melvar

  no time was to be lost i had been
anticipating something of the kind
my guns were cleaned and loaded
my pack was soon ready naro took
a part of my equipment i followed
the boy up the stair with the phrase
for i loved you ringing in my
heart

  we reached the top and walked out
into the red brush beneath the pur-
ple starlight the vast fantastic col-
umned halls of astran were gleam-
ing faintly i caught a brief blue
flicker from the great machine on
the ruby dome

  suddenly with a sharp thrill of
terror that made me catch my
breath i heard a distant whining
sigh that grew until it rolled and
reverberated through the heavens
and the air seemed alive with its
deep intensity above the emerald
wall i glimpsed the green-tipped
needle of crimson that made the
sound

  it was sweeping through the sky
meteor-swift while the pale blue
beam stabbed out at it ineffectually
it passed in an instant but others
came and soon the sky was lighted
with the weird red radiance the
very mountaintop vibrated with the
whistling roars the things swept
around and around in a mad confu-
sion of darting flames they were
like moths about a candle 

  we passed an amber palace and
came suddenly upon a great metal-
floored court marching across it
were a half-score of the astranian
men-at-arms their accoutrements
gleaming weirdly in the light of the
strange things above they saw us
at once and charged upon us with a
shout

  i dropped to my knees once my
rifle spoke and i rejoiced at its heavy
thrust against my shoulder and the
acrid odor of the smoke i felt a

man again and the leader of the
soldiers fell upon his face

  naro gripped my shoulder and
pointed upward one of the red
things was plunging down like a
great red zeppelin with a great
green light at its forward end its
purple phosphorescent track swirl-
ing up behind it the soldiers forgot
us and scattered in mad terror naro
jerked my arm and we tumbled into
a copse of the red brush

  for a moment the bloody radiance
was thrown upon us in an intense
flood and the screaming roar was
deafening a few moments more and
the thing had flashed up and away
a breath of hot purple mist passed
over us when we got to our feet
and crept out of the thicket the sol-
diers were gone

  swiftly naro led me on keeping
in the shadows of the buildings or
in the cover of the thickets once a
man sprang suddenly at us from be-
hind a sapphire pillar diamond
sword drawn my pistol exploded in
his face and blew his head half off

  naro possessed himself of the dead
mans weapons and we went breath-
lessly on three times in other parts
of the city we saw the red shapes
drop to the ground briefly then dart
up again while ever the blue ray
played back and forth upon them

at last we passed between vast
ruby columns and stood beneath
the huge red dome before us lay
a great space fairly lit with a rosy
light from the crystal walls around
the farther side were seated tier
upon tier thousands of the brilliant-
ly clad people of astran

  in the center of the great floor
resting upon a pedestal was a globe
of shining purple-a sphere of cor-
uscating flame-itself immense per-
haps forty feet in diameter but in-
significant in that colossal hall
standing at rigid attention in regu-
lar rows about the pedestal were a
few score bright-armed soldiers and
as many other erect men in long


wonder story annual

purple robes all eyes were fixed on
a point in front of the gigantic globe
hidden from where we stood

  we hurried silently across the
smooth metal floor our footsteps
drowned in the rushing sounds of
the flying things above we ran
around the great purple sun-sphere
of crystal and came abruptly upon a
dramatically terrible scene beneath
the sphere was an altar of glowing
red with the priests and soldiery all
grouped about it

  by the altar kneeling and silent
clad in a filmy green robe was the
beautiful form of melvar just be-
hind her stood a tall hawk-like man
in his hands a great transparent
crystal vessel full of a liquid that
gleamed like molten silver

  as we came around the sphere he
was holding up the vessel and re-
peating a strange chant in a monot-
onous monotone at sight of us he
dropped into alarmed silence with
an ugly scowl of hate and fear dis-
torting his harsh features for a
moment he stood as if paralyzed
then he rushed toward the silent girl
as though to empty the contents of
the crystal pitcher upon her

  i fired on the instant and had the
luck to shatter the vessel splashing
the shining silvery fluid all over his
person the effect of it was instan-
taneous and terrible his purple robe
was eaten away and set on fire by
the stuff his flesh was dyed a deep
purple and partially consumed he
tottered and fell to the floor in a
writhing flaming heap

  in the confusion and dazed silence
that fell upon the vast assemblage
at sight of that horrible thing mel-
var aroused from her resignation
of despair by the report of the pistol
sprang to her feet in incredulous
surprise for a moment she looked
wonderingly at us then she turned
and shouted a few strange and im-
pressive words at the priests her
white arms swept up in a curious
gesture

  she turned and sped toward us

we started running back the way we
had come the dramatic fall of
jorak and the evident terror that
melvars courageous and timely
words whatever they were had in-
spired served to hold the astranians
motionless until we had traversed
the better part of the distance to
the columns

  but then they started after us en
masse i dropped to my knees by the
columns and began firing steadily
with the rifle theyfell sometimes
two or three at a shot but still they
charged on and their number was
overwhelming

  then outside there was a sudden
louder shrieking roar a flood of
red light poured through the col-
umns and there was a terrific crash
upon the dome dense clouds of hot
purple vapor poured into the vast
room one of the flying lights had
landed upon the roof the charging
throng behind us stopped and ran
about in confusion

  we darted out through the purple
clouds and ran for the shadow of
the nearest building we kept close
by the mighty walls until we reached
the gate daring the terrors of the
night we ran out and down the nar-
row trail by dawn we were several
miles from astran in the direction
of the shining lake

chapter vi
the silver lake

at the coming of day we were
walking over a gently rolling
scarlet plain scattered with gigantic
solitary boulders that sloped gradu-
ally down to the silver lake the
lake lay flat and argent white clad
in all the ominous mystery of that
strange world calling beckoning us
on challenging us to learn the secret
of the farthest bank of purple fog
with a grim warning of the doom
the alien intelligence



that might await us

  the red fern-like sprays waved
gently in the breeze and the vivid
tiny white flowers seemed to sparkle
with a million glancing rays like
frost in the sunshine but the deep
intensity of the red color lent a weird
and unpleasant suggestion of blood
beyond the silver lake low hills
rose faint and mysterious in the
purple haze

  melvar walked beside me when
the way was smooth enough she
was talking vivaciously she had a
keen sense of humor and a lively wit
she seemed to have an almost child-
ishly perfect faith in my power and
that of my guns-but i was far from
feeling confident

  at sunrise we stopped by a little
pool of clear water

  we drank and made a meal of the
abundant yellow fruit astran with
the scintillating fires kindled again
in its jeweled towers by the rising
sun lay far behind and above us
when we had finished eating melvar
stood looking for a long moment at
its glorious sparkling light she mur-
mured a few words beneath her
breath in the astranian tongue and
turned again toward the silver lake

  in two hours we came to the shore
of the great lake the red scrub
grew up to the brink of a bluff a
dozen feet high below was a broad
bare sandy beach with the gleaming
waves quicksilver white rolling on
it two hundred yards away

  for a few minutes we stood at
the edge of the cliff in the fringe of
crimson brush and let our eyes wan-
der over the vast flat desert of flow-
ing argent fire we peered at the
misty red hills beyond trying to
penetrate their mysteries and to
read what lay behind them then
we scrambled down on the hard
white sand naro grasped his weap-
on and looked up and down the
beach

  it is along the shore of the silver
lake melvar said that the purple
ones are most frequently found

  the purple ones again i cried
what are they-decorated rattle-
snakes then with a sickening sen-
sation of terror i remembered the
horrible half-human purple corpse
that i had seen the soldiers bring-
ing into astran are the purple
ones men

  in form they are men and wom-
en melvar said but they dwell
alone in the thickets like beasts all
of them are old and hideous they
are savage and they each have the
strength of many men our soldiers
must always hunt them and fight
them to the death

 a single man even though
armed could do nothing against one
of them for they are terribly strong
and they fight like demons their
country is not known and no children
of their kind are ever found the
priests say that they are of a race
of dwarfs that dwell beneath the
silver lake

  here was another of the baffling
mysteries of this strange world in
fact i was coming upon unpleasant
mysteries much faster than i could
comfortably stomach them lone
purple savage animals in the form
of emaciated humans who prowled
the country like wolves and like
wolves were hunted down by the
astranians

  again i shuddered at the memory
of the limp purple corpse the sol-
diers had carried and with a strange
chill of the heart i remembered the
human footprints that had been left
where my ponies were taken in the
desert and the eerie insane laughter
that i had heard or thought i heard
above the whistling roar

  my thoughts ended with the con-
struction of a mad hypothesis of a
race of purple folk who lived beyond
the silver lake who were accus-
tomed to make slave raids on the
whites in torpedo-shaped airships
and who made a practise of releasing
or turning out the superannuated
ones of their kind to prey on the
people of the crystal city


wonder story annual

  it seemed in fact quite plausible
at the time but i was far from the
hideous truth i could see no reason
if one race could attain a civiliza-
tion high enough to synthesize dia-
monds for building - stone why
another might not be able to build
ships as marvelous as the red tor-
pedoes but my reason rebelled at
the acceptance of the ideas of de-
monic and supernatural horrors my
emotional self tried to force upon
it

oresently i roused myself and
l led the way down the white
waves my companions held back
nervously and warned me not to
touch them lest i die as jorak had
but i succeeded in filling a test tube
with the stuff it was not trans-
parent it was white gleaming
metallic like mercury or molten sil-
ver

  i carried it back up to the bluff
and set about examining it while
naro stood guard and melvar
watched me she asked innumerable
questions concerning not only the
operation in hand but on such sub-
jects as the appearance of a cat and
fifth avenue styles of ladies gar-
ments upon which latter however
i was lamentably ignorant

  so often did i pause to answer her
questions to laugh at the naive
quaintness of her phrases or to let
my eyes rest on her charming face
that the attempted analysis of the
metal did not progress with any re-
markable celerity

  the silver liquid was very mobile
and very light having a specific
gravity of only  or not even four
times that of liquid hydrogen which
is  it was extremely corrosive
tiny bits of wood or paper were en-
tirely consumed on contact with it
with the liberation apparently of
carbon dioxide and water vapor and
a dense purple gas that i could not
identify

  that suggested of course that the
stuff contained oxygen but as to how

much or in what combination i had
no idea a drop of it on a larger
piece of paper set it afire i found
too when testing the electrolytic
qualities of the liquid that when i
introduced into it a copper and a
silver coin electrically connected
the stuff was rapidly decomposed
into the purple vapor with the gen-
eration of a powerful current

  but the metal seemed not affected
at all that was another puzzling
result my experiments of course
were comparatively crude and when
i had pone as far as i could i really
knew little more about the silver
liquid than in the beginning

  despite melvars warning and my
own precautions i splashed a drop
of it on my arm she cried out in
horror and i saw that a splotch of
purple was spreading like a thin film
over the skin there was no pain
but the muscles of the arm were
seized with sudden uncontrollable
convulsions melvar tried to wash
the stain off with water from my
canteen in an hour the color had
faded though the limb was still sore
and painful

  by that time the purple disc of the
sun was sinking low and we took
thought of how to spend the night
naro climbed up on the plain to
gather a few of the fruits for our
supper and we found a little cave
in the bluff that seemed a good place
of shelter i gathered an armful of
the red brush and made a fire

  the leaves burned fiercely crack-
ling as if they contained oil the
fire produced a great volume of acrid
black smoke combustion was great-
ly accelerated on account of the in-
creased atmospheric pressure here
many thousand feet below sea level
melvar and naro were intensely in-
terested in the performance although
they had seen austen light a fire
while he was in the city

  melvar slept in the cavern and
naro and i took turns standing
guard at the entrance the darting
pencils of crimson were abroad again
the alien intelligence



but they passed far overhead and
we heard the sounds of their pas-
sage only as vast and distant sighs

  in the morning we rose early and
clambered back up the cliffs i was
in rather a puzzling situation clear-
ly my duty was to get austens
equipment to him as quickly as pos-
sible but i liked neither to desert
melvar and her brother nor to let
them accompany me into the un-
known perils of the region beyond
but the latter course seemed the
best and they were ready enough to
go with me anywhere

having retraced our course of
the day before for perhaps a
mile in order to get upon the upland
we set out for the north the sun
was just rising above the black rim
when naro shouted and pointed at
the mist-clad red hills beyond the
silver lake at first i looked in
vain then i caught a faint flicker of
amber light pulsing up through the
purple air

  abruptly a vast mellow golden
beam sprang from behind the distant
scarlet hills and spread up toward
the zenith in a deep yellow flood it
seemed to vibrate to throb with in-
credibly rapid fluctuations sud-
denly bright swift-changing form-
less shapes of green and red flared
up within it shot up the beam and
vanished the radiance dimmed and
died

  i could see nothing but somehow
i felt that an invisible beam of vi-
brant force was still pouring up into
the sky here was another manifes-
tation of the unknown power beyond
the sea the beam had come so far
as visibility was concerned it was
gone what had been its meaning
its purpose

  beyond the silver lake low cliffs
rose above a broad sandy beach
faintly veiled by the purple mist
the red hills were fainter still above
them and the thicker pall of purple
haze that hung over the hidden place
beyond stood out distinctly against

the distant steep black wall that
threw its jagged crags to the sky
so far above out of that vale of
mystery the ray had leapt-and died
or had it merely faded to be now
invisible-but pulsing still

  all seemed as it had been before
but from the attitude of my com-
panions i knew there was more to
come they were gazing up into the
sun-bright void above and waiting
expectantly

  then i saw far far above grow-
ing gradually brighter against the
sky as if it were being projected
there by a great magic lantern be-
hind the hills an upright bar of sil-
ver haze

  slowly it grew brighter and its
outlines sharper until it looked like
a vertical bar of silver metal in the
sky-inconceivably huge the
length of the bar must have been
miles its diameter many hundreds
of yards it hung still in the heavens
neither rising nor falling here was
a display indeed of alien science and
power

  presently i recovered from my
first wonder and became conscious
that the blue eyes of melvar were
upon me quite as much as on the
astonishing thing in the sky

  melvar have you seen it before
i asked is it real-natural is it
made by man i found to my sur-
prise that my voice was odd and
quavery i had not realized the in-
tensity of my nervous strain i
waited eagerly for the reassurance
that she could not give

  it comes often she replied
every day for many months of the
year the priests say that it is the
evil goddess of the under-earth who
loves the purple sun and flies to
the sky to meet him but the sun
goes on unheeding and the goddess
cries silver tears until her lord is
gone from the sky but there is yet
more to see

  i looked up again and saw that a
faint colored mist was gathering
about the bar it grew brighter
	wonder story annual

condensed seemed drawn into swirl-
ing rings by a sort of magnetic at-
traction and the iridescent mist-
rings swam about the bar moved
ever faster until they were whirling
madly

  their coruscating shapes grew
brighter plainer until they were
vivid spinning flames of color in
the sunshine i noticed that the red
was about the center of the silver
bar and that the bands of color
above and below ran regularly to
the other end of the spectrum with
rings of violet at the bottom and at
the top during all this time i heard
no sound it was as still as death

  still the color-rings spun and
changed growing ever brighter and
sharper edged the red band grew
larger about the center until its
diameter was the length of the cyl-
inder it gleamed with a lurid scarlet
light below and above were spin-
ning burning circles of orange yel-
low green and blue each thinner
than the one next nearer the center
and of smaller diameter the violet
rings had shrunk to great globes of
violet fire shining with painful in-
tensity

indeed as melvar had said there
was more to see the phenomenon
was so utterly strange so utterly in-
exnlicable that i was grasped in a
paralvsis of unfamiliar terror my
breath was choked and my heart
beat wild with fear as i stared
straight at it it was so definitely
directed by intelligence that i felt it
must spring from a weird and awful
mind

  indeed it seemed that i felt the
power of a vast and alien will steal-
ing over me seizing command of me
making me the slave of itself i
struggled against it i clenched my
hands and knotted my muscles with
the intensity of my resistance to the
spell wheeling sparks of red fire
swam before my eyes

  then my efforts weakened i could
hold out no longer the alien will

had won reason and feeling and
love flowed away and left me as cold
and cruel as a rock in a stormy
wintry coast-a savage inhuman
animal care had left me my soul
had lost her throne i laughed a
wild unearthly sound it was like
that i had heard as i lay beneath
the tent beyond the barrier

  i whirled around fiercely but a
firm arresting hand was laid on my
shoulder from afar off deep blue
eyes looked into mine-eyes that
were cool and sane and brave they
shone through the red curtains of
insanity in my brain they broke
the spell of fear

  suddenly i was weak and trem-
bling and sick melvars lithe arms
were close about me her throbbing
heart was close to mine and in her
dark warm blue eyes so close to
mine were sympathy and tender-
ness and love she was human-she
was real i knew that her love would
shield me from these terrors i
smiled at her and sank down weakly
in the red brush but she had saved
my mind i had wandered on the
brink of the fearful insanity of
terror and she had brought me back

  i looked from her sweet face so
full of anxious concern to the thing
in the sky but now it seemed re-
mote unreal and i gazed at it with
indifference presently i saw that
the whole thing was beginning to
sink as though a weight were being
accumulated upon it suddenly an
immense gleaming globule of silver
fell from the lower violet globe and
drooped straight for the silver lake
while the weird form of lights that
had made it floated back to its for-
mer elevation the great shining
sphere fell and struck the white lake
with a deafening roar sending out
great concentric waves in all direc-
tions

  the amazing phenomenon sank
again released a second huge drop
and rose the process was repeated
again and again the interval being
about  minutes  seconds by my
the alien intelligence



watch all day it went on the great
waves washing against the bluffs
above the beach by nightfall the
level of the silver lake stood per-
ceptibly higher

  here was the mystery of the ori-
gin of the silver lake explained but
by a phenomenon more inexplicable
than the sea itself in vain i tried
to account for it in some rational
way or to assign some natural cause
for the thing my mind could hardly
grasp it it was almost unbelievable
even as i looked upon it my reason
would not admit that such a thing
could be in a rational world

chapter vii
stalked by the purple beast

so weak was i after that terrible
experience that it was noon be-
fore i felt able to go on the phe-
nomenon as i have said continued
to stand in the sky all day and drop
regularly its burden ofilver liquid
but presently i became accustomed
to it and realized that it threatened
us with no immediate danger

  after a light lunch of the yellow
fruit and a deep draught of water
from a little stream that ran almost
parallel to our route of march for
a mile or two we retired to the
higher ground where the scrub was
not so dense as in the bottom of the
valley and set out for the north
again still i was feeling mentally
limp--dully indifferent to what was
passing about-and physically ex-
hausted as well i was not as much
on my guard against the weird perils
surrounding us as i should have
been

  several times naro stopped and
listened declaring that something
was following us keeping in the
cover of waist-high brush in the
bottom of the little valley along the
side of which we were traveling

but i could hear nothing

  melvar for once had ceased her
eager interrogation and was enter-
taining me with the legendary ac-
count of the past great heroes of
astran she sang me a few pas-
sages from the epic in her native
tongue her voice was clear and
pure and very beautiful

 and though the words were
strange to me their sound was noble
and suggestive and there was a
powerful compelling rhythm in the
lines she translated the story into
english it was about such an epic
poem as might have been expected
dealing with the adventures of an
immortal hero who had once con-
quered the purple ones set up the
vast palaces of astran and at last
lost his life on an expedition across
the silver lake to battle the krimlu

  suddenly her sweet voice was in-
terrupted by a low cry from naro
who had fiercely gripped my arm i
turned in time to see a weird figure
gnarled and stooped and with long
white hair slink swiftly and fur-
tively from a great rock to the shel-
ter of the red brush squat and bent
as it was there was no mistaking
that it was human in shape and that
the skin was purple

  in the dull apathy in which i was
sunken i could not realize the dan-
ger i guess a rifle bullet will fix
it i said

  the purple ones have more pow-
er than you know cried melvar
let us try to get on more open
ground before it attacks then it
will have to leave its cover

  so we turned and ran away from
the stream to a rocky hillside where
the red scrub grew low and scant
as we ran i heard a crashing behind
us once i turned quickly and raised
my rifle the strange figure darted
abruptly into view and i fired on the
ifistant

  i think i hit it for it spun-around
quickly and fell to the ground but
in a moment it was up and running
toward us with an agility that was


wonder story annual

  incredible springing over the red
  brush in great bounds with a motion
  more like that of a monstrous hop-
  ping insect than of a human being

    his white hair was flying in wild
  disorder his shrunken limbs plainly
  flashing purple and a terrible sound
  came from it as it bounded along-
  not a scream of rage or of pain but
  a weird uncanny laugh that rang
  strangely over the red plain and
  made us pause in our race and
  tremble with alien terror

    but we broke the icy fingers of
  fear that gripped our hearts and
  ran on until we reached a great flat
  rock that lay at the upper edge of the
  bare space in the rim of the thickets

 i lifted melvar in my arms until she
  could reach the top and scramble up
  when i looked back i saw the purple
  man leaping across the clearing with
  incredible speed not two hundred
  yards away

 then naro and i got up on that
 rock-i have never been able to
 remember just how we did it i
 dronned to my knees seized the rifle
 that i had pushed ud before me and
 began to purn lead at the beast as
 faf as i could work the bolt

    the recoils of the gun seemed al-
  most a steady thrust i heard the
  bullets thud into the purple bocv
  i saw it checked or driven back bv
  the impacts one bullet took it off
  its balance and it fell but in a
  moment it was racing on again em-
  powered by sunerhuman energy

    when my rfle was empty it was
  not twenty fe away onp arm was
  gone one side of the body was
  fearfully torn the purple face was
  a hideous mangled thing it did not
  blwd but the wounds were covered
  with a purple viscous slime one of
  the eyes was rone and the other
  glared at us with a wild red light
  anything of ordinary life must long
  since have been dead but it gathered
  itself and leapt for the top of the
  boulder

    on the day before i had showed

melvar how to use my guns merely
by way of proof that there was
nothing supernatural in the working
of the weapon that had slain so many
of the astranians in the temple now
i pushed one of the pistols toward
her she was standing there motion-
less there was no panic in her face
and i knew that she would have the
courage to use the weapon to save
herself from the terrible brute if
things came to the worst she smiled
at me even as she picked up the
gun then looking at the safety she
gripped it in a businesslike way

  as the purple monster sprang
upon the boulder i emptied my auto-
matic into it great wounds were
torn in the dark flesh and half the
face was shot away but the thing
seemed immune to death by ordinary
means as the last shot was fired it
stood before us on the rock a ter-
rible mangled thing its one red eye
blazing with demonic inhumanity

  naro sprang out before me his
crystal sword raised high as the
beast sprang at him he cut at it
with a mighty sweep of the razor-
edged weapon but the stroke which
would have decapitated an ordinary
human was parried by a terrific
blow of the claw-like hand of the
thing and the boy was sent spinning
back against me we fell together
on the rock

  then it burled itself toward mel-
var it all happened in the briefest
of moments before i could even be-
gin to rise she swung up the auto-
matic with a quick graceful move-
ment she was like a beautiful god-
dess of battle blue eyes shining
brightly golden hair gleaming in the
sun

  again that mad laugh was ringing
out with a choking sob in it for the
things vocal organs were injured
it leapt at her its lacerated limbs
working like machinery calmly she
stood with automatic raised the
muzzle of the gun was not an inch
from the throat of the beast when
she fired
the alien intelligence



  the strange head was blown com-
pletely off the body and fell rolling
and bouncing to the red brush below
the body collapsed writhing and
convulsed it was not quiet for many
minutes

  the girl dropped the gun sudden-
ly trembling and threw herself into
my arms sobbing uncontrollably
her courage and coolness had saved
us all and i admit that i was quite
as much unstrung as she after the
danger had passed what a wonder-
ful being she was

it was so late in the day and we
were so completely exhausted that
we decided to go no farther naro
was not hurt save for a few scratches
and i suppose he was the least ex-
cited of the three in a few minutes
he threw the quivering purple body
off the boulder and carried it and
the head back across the clearing
to dispose of them

  when he returned we found an
overhanging shelf on the north side
of the boulder that would afford
some shelter from the flying lights
we gathered some of the yellow fruit
for supper cleaned and reloaded the
weapons and prepared to spend the
night there

  naro called me aside and showed
me a curious much-worn silver
bracelet with a singular design upon
it he told me in his imperfect eng-
lish that it had belonged to his fa-
ther who had been taken by the fly-
ing lights many years before this
was a curious development it
showed that there was some connec-
tion between the dreaded purple
ones and the terrible pillaging red
lights but the full significance of
it did not dawn upon me until later

  by that time i was in a measure
accustomed to the passage of the
whistling needles of crimson fire and
during the first part of the night i
was able to sleep while naro sat up
to keep watch at midnight he
awakened me and we changed
places

  the sky was crossed and recrossed
by the faint and flickering tracks of
red and the night was weirdly lit
by the torpedo-shades of scarlet
flame that sped upon them with a
fatuous sense of security i was lean-
ing back against the boulder smok-
ing my pipe and caressing the cold
metal of the rifle in my hand dream-
ing of what melvar and i might do
if ever we were to emerge into the
world alive

  the red thing was upon me before
i knew it the light of my pipe
must have been visible to it in my
accursed thoughtlessness that dan-
ger had never occurred to me the
thing came plunging down flooding
the landscape with its lurid crimson
radiance while the earth vibrated
to its whistling hissing scream

  there was no need to waken my
companions for they sprang to their
feet in alarm we all cowered back
against the rock in the hope of escap-
ing observation but the thing had
already seen us i put my arm about
the warm throbbing bodv of melvar
and drew her close to my breast her
cool white hand grasped mine as
silently we waited

  the red object came down swiftly
paused just above the crimson
thickets before us then settled de-
liberately to earth it was the first
opportunity i had had for a close
examination of these things their
shape was plainly cylindrical taper-
ing toward the ends it was perhaps
ten feet in diameter and a hundred
long set on the forward end was
a bright green globe some three feet
in diameter

  a clump of brush about the end
of the cylinder burst into flame as
the bright crimson hue began to dull
i suddenly grasped the fact that the
red color was due to the red heat
generated by friction with the air
which was very great at the meteor
pace the thing attained

  it lay there not fifty yards away
with the fire blazing and crackling
about the end of our right eating


wonder story annual

its way into the thickets the green
sphere on the other end seemed to
stare at us like a great intent eye
the red color slowly faded sud-
denly melvar gripped my arm

  why wait she whispered per-
haps it does not see us after all lets
slip around the boulder

  but the instant we moved a great
oval space swung out of the side of
the cylinder we saw that the door
and walls were of a bluish white
metal and were very thick it was
very dark inside a blood-congealing
eerie laugh sounded out of that
darkness and i shuddered quickly
five human-like figures leaped one by
one out of the oval doorway

  with heart-chilling fear i saw by
the flickering light of the burning
thicket that long white hair hung
about faces wrinkled and hideously
aged faces with toothless mouths
red glaring eyes and skin that was
purple without a moments hesi-
tation the five naked monsters
rushed down upon us

  the fire was fast blazing higher
burning rapidly into the brush be-
tween us and the cylinder and we
could see the purple boasts quite
nlainlv in its light and they were
hideous to look upon they came
toward us with monstrous springing
bounds actuated by some extraor-
dinary force

  their muscles must have been far
stronger than those of men perhaps
as strong as those of insects or
since muscular force depends on the
intensity of nerve currents perhans
their nerves were extraordinarily
excited and there was something
insect-like in the way life had lin-
gered in the body of the one we had
killed when it had already many
wounds that should have been mor-
tal

  i leveled my rifle drew a bead on
the neck of the foremost one and
fired i must have had the luck to
shatter the bones for the head
droooed limplv to the side the thing
stopped abruptly groping blindly

about with its talon-like fingers it
seemed very strange that it did not
fall

   in an instant one of the others ran
close by it the crippled monster
sprang savagely at the other and in
a moment they were writhing and
struggling in the brush tearing at
one another with tiger-like ferocity
the others passed by them for a
moment while i finished emptying
the rifle without visible results

by that time the crackle of the
swiftly spreading fire had grown
to a dull roar it swept fast across
the brush red flames flaring high
and dense smoke rolling up into the
night the purple beasts did not ap-
pear to see it they made no effort
to avoid the flames were they in-
vulnerable to fire or was fire mere-
ly unknown to them as to the people
-of astran

  the three rushed straight on
toward us disregarding the rushing
wall of flame not a dozen yards to
the right of them i kept firing
madly the leg of one went limp but
he leapt on with scarcely diminished
speed laughing terribly white hair
flying about his awful face while
his purple limbs moved frenziedly
the flames rushed over the fallen
two and hid them in another instant
the curtain of fire rolled over the
others and even the ship was hidden
from our view

  suddenly i realized that we were
in quite as much danger from the
fire as from the monsters already
we were shrinking from the hot
wind that blew before the flames
half choked by the acrid fumes for
the second time we made a mad re-
treat to the top of the boulder and
lay flat

  i heard a terrible laugh from the
flames and one of the things dashed
out his hair was gone his ourple
flesh burnt black i shot as it showed
itself and it fell in another instant
the flames had raced over it again
none of the others appeared
the alien intelligence



  we lay on the rock for several
minutes gasping in the cooler air
that lingered near its surface for
a time the heat was stifling but the
scanty vegetation burned off quickly
and soon a cool breeze came up from
the south and lifted the smoke

  we saw that the cylinder still lay
where it had been although the
heavy body was closed the green
light still shone in the forward end
about it the earth lay black and
smoking and a low line of flame lay
below the pall of smoke in a great
ring all about us between us and
the ship i saw in the darkness the
black shadows that were the five
dead man-beasts

  i was just beginning to wonder if
all the crew of the ship were dead
so that we might enter and examine
it when the great oval door in the
side swung open again and some-
thing sprang out of it into the night
i heard a strange hissing and a
clatter of metal

  in the semi-darkness i could see
nothing plainly but there was a float-
ing shape of greenish mist with a
vague form beneath i strained my
eyes to try to distinguish its shape
while it stood motionless

  abruptly a narrow intensely-
bright beam of orange light shot out
of it and impinged upon the rock
there was a dull thud from the rock
and the ray was dead in a moment
but the granite where it had struck
was cut away-obliterated the
beam had shone straight through the
boulder carrying away or resolving
into primary electrons the matter
on which it had struck the smooth
edges of the cut were glowing with
a soft violet radiance

  my rifle was at hand and on re-
covering from my surprise i fired i
aimed just below the greenish patch
something must have been exploded
by the bullet for there was a vivid
flash of white fire and a loud sharp
report the spot of green was visible
no longer and we saw no motion
about the cylinder

  at the time i had no idea what
it was that i had shot i supposed
that it had been another of the
purple beasts armed with a strange
ray-weapon i imagined that the
bullet had struck the weapon and
caused the explosion

chapter viii
the battle in the mist

for perhaps an hour we sat there
on the rock as soon as the
smoke cleared we could see the crim-
son needles flying high upon their
vague red tracks we watched them
with a sort of hypnotic fascination
dreading the moment when one of
them would land to investigate the
fate of the ship that lay silent and
presumably empty before us

  the ground was still too hot for us
to walk upon and we felt the use-
lessness of attempting to escape on
foot even if it had already cooled
with a feeling of resigned and hope-
less horror we saw one of the crim-
son pencils circle lower about the
place then disappear in the direc-
tion of its lair beyond the silver
lake

  even as the whistling roar of its
passage was rolling down upon us
melvar spoke how i admire the
courage and indomitable resource-
fulness of the girl while i was
hopelessly lost in despair feeling all
the desolation of this region and the
infinite remoteness of the world of
men her pure rich voice and the
warm living touch of her hand
brought new courage to me

  the krimlu are coming she
cried there is no use to try to
fight them or to try to outrun them
but that ship must be empty the
walls are metal and strong per-
haps they could not open it

  while several things about the
proposition were not very attractive


wonder story annual

it seemed our best resource be-
sides i had a keen desire to see the
interior we gathered up our equip-
ment climbed off the boulder hur-
ried over to the cylinder

  i was possessed by a haunting
fear that we would find something
hideous awaiting us but the bright
pencil of light from my pocket lamp
revealed no living being in the long
interior nor could i find even a
trace of the green patch that had
blown up in front of the door we
scrambled through the opening
without difficulty and i turned a
handle that swung the heavy door
shut and evidently locked it

  then i set about examining the
mechanism for i had an intense
curiosity about the propulsive force
that enabled the vessel to attain a
speed that must have reached thou-
sands of miles per hour in one end
were rows of long cylinders of a
transparent substance evidently
filled with the metallic fluid from
the silver lake

  pipes ran from them to a complex
mechanism in the rear end of the
ship from which heavy conduits ran
all over the inside of the metal hull
while my understanding of it was
far from complete i was able to
verify a previous idea-that the
strange vessels were driven by use
of the rocket principle

  it seems that the silver fluid was
decomposed in the machine and that
the purple gas it formed at a very
high temperature was forced out
through the various tubes at a ter-
rific velocity propelling the ship by
its reaction the whistling roar of
the things in motion was of course
the sound of the escaping gas the
red-purple tracks were merely the
expelled gas hanging in the air

  the green globe in the forward
end may have been the objective
lens for a marvelous periscope at
any rate the walls of the forward
part of the shell seemed trans-
parent and the periscope must
have utilized infra-red rays for the

scene about us seemed much
brighter than it was in reality we
could see very plainly the burned
plain and the granite rock and once
through a rift in the clouds of smoke
that were rising about i caught a
glimpse of the gleaming city of
astran high above us in the west

  i noticed a slender lever with a
corrugated disc at the top rising
out of the floor in the bow of the
ship it occurred to me that it was
the control lever i took hold of it
and gingerly pushed it back great
jets of purple gas rushed past the
transparent walls about us and the
ship slid backward on the ground
the sensation of motion was most
alarming

  the illusion of the transparency
of the bow of the ship was so per-
fect that it seemed almost as if we
were hanging in space a few feet in
the front of the mouth of an open
tube it was impossible for me to
realize that i was surrounded by
solid walls of metal until i touched
them

  i think the wonderful telescope
worked on much the same principle
as television-that is the rays of
light were picked up converted into
electrical impulses amplified and
then projected on the metal wall
which served as a screen

i returned to my experiments
with the lever the control was
relatively simple the vessel was
propelled forward when the lever
was pushed forward reversed when
the lever was pulled back slipping
the little disc up or down raised or
lowered the prow and twisting it
accomplished the steering in the
horizontal plane

  by the time my cautious experi-
ments revealed all this melvar had
pointed out three slender crimson
craft wheeling low about us and
evidently preparing to land i pulled
the knob up and pushed it forward
all the way a pale red beam shot
ahead the black landscape dropped
the alien intelligence	

away from us and we hurtled
through the air of the night

  i was amazed at the lack of any
great sensation of motion that the
jets of gas for all their appalling
roar without were barely audible
within the cylinder still the fore-
part of the ship was transparent
from within so that we had the
oddest sensation of floatingfree in
space

  i saw that the three ships had
fallen in a line behind us and were
following at the same terrific pace
when we had reached an altitude of
perhaps a mile i twisted the knob
to bring the helm about we shot
over the silver lake which lay like
a white desert of moonlit sand be-
neath us standing out sharply
against the dark plain around it

  in a moment we had gone over it
and over the low hills beyond into
the bank of purple mist i had
hoped to have time to land and have
the vessel on the ground below but
i looked back and saw that our pur-
suers were gaining swiftly slender
twisting rays of bright orange and
green were darting toward us from
the hurtling arrow-like ships of red

  in the darkness and the mist we
could see nothing of the ground be-
low the only visible things were
a few mist-veiled stars above and
the bright scarlet torpedoes that
shot after us quickly i circled and
raised the helm i was almost in-
toxicated with excitement and the
indescribable sensations of our swift
and lofty flight

  i felt released from all the weak-
ness of the body-i had conquered
the force that holds all men to earth
i felt a new wonderful sensation of
freedom and power i had but to
move the little piece of metal in my
hand to go where i pleased with
almost the speed of light but still
the line of ships behind us came out
at an incredible pace stabbing at
us with the green and orange rays

  then high above the others i
brought the ship around in a hair-

pin turn and plunged directly at
them they tried to turn aside
while their rays shot thickly toward
us but our speed was too great the
foremost suddenly turned broadside
toward us attempting to get out of
our path i held our bow directly
at it raised it a trifle at the last
instant the keel of our vessel
struck the other amidships the
terrific crash of the collision hurled
us to the floor

  when i regained my feet we were
falling in a crazy twisting path our
ship altogether out of control no
sooner was i on my feet than the
floor tilted up again and i fell back
to my hands and knees i saw that
the one we had struck was broken
in two and plunging toward the
earth far behind us while the other
two were circling far overhead

  the mist about us grew thicker
until the other ships and the frag-
ments of the wrecked one were
strangely colored purple-thicker
still until they vanished we floated
in a world of purple fog

  i seized the control lever as soon
as our wild gyrations enabled me to
reach it but my unskilled efforts
only resulted in making us roll and
twist more wildly so long as we
had been on an even keel the pilot-
ing had been easy enough although
i imagine my success in ramming
the other ship had been largely due
to luck but the blow against us
had been broadside setting the ship
to spinning like a top it seemed
that we fell an interminable time
whenever the stern pointed down-
ward for a moment i pushed the
lever forward to check our fall as
much as possible

  through the mist i suddenly
caught a glimpse of the dark ground
below in another instant the ves-
sel had struck heavily throwing us
against the floor again

  day was beginning to break at
last and we could see that we had
fallen on a bare gravelled hilltop
the clear space was only an acre or


wonder story annual

so in extent we were shut in on
all sides by a dense dark forest of
gigantic trees that rose threaten-
ingly seeming to grasp us to close
in on us the purple mist hung in
a sombre curtain overhead

naro and i strapped on our packs
picked up our weapons and
opened the door the three of us
stepped out to face the perils of
another world what they might
be we did not know i had no idea
what part of the country was in-
habited by the krimlu but austen
had not let himself be conquered by
the mere strangeness of the place
i still hoped to be able to find him
although a search in such a jungle
as that about us seemed hopeless

  the walls of the rocket-ship were
still glowing dull red with the heat
of its passage through the air and
we hurried away over the gravel for
fifty yards to get beyond the fierce
heat it radiated the patch of sky
above was a dull dusky luminescent
purple

  all about us towered the forest
as the light grew better we could
see that the trees were red they
bore the same feathery fronds the
same starlike flowers of brilliant
white the same golden-brown fruits
as the plants of the plain about
astran but they were immensely
greater-they towered up hundreds
of feet

  it was like a forest of the tree-
ferns of the carboniferous period
save for the deep bloody scarlet of
the leaves

  the ground all about the knoll
was low and marshy and the air was
heavy with the odors of rotting
vegetation there was no wind and
the air under the great atmospheric
pressure was heavy moist and hot
it was oppressive it hung like a
weight upon our chests and the
crimson jungle seemed to possess a
terrible life and spirit of its own
it did not belong to our world

  the undergrowth was very thick

the higher branches were dimmed
by the purple mist they seemed
almost to reach the heavy dull pur-
ple sky it appeared useless to try
to penetrate it it was an evil be-
ing waiting to seize us

  i got out my compass and we de-
cided to try to make our way toward
the north in the direction of the
pass by which we supposed austen
to have rounded the silver lake as
i had last noted our position above
the mist with reference to the lake
and the crater walls we had been
roughly fiften miles south of the
pass i hoped by taking a course
in that direction to come across
some trace of austen

  as we approached the north side
of the clearing i made a startling
discovery in the side of the hill
was a deposit of iron pyrites not
that there was anything remarkable
about that but the thing that
struck me was that the vein had
been recently worked

  i sprang down in the pit and
found on the rock traces of copper
that had evidently come from soft
copper tools i knew that austen
would have needed minerals that
indeed if he had set up a wireless
outfit in here he must have been
compelled to do an immense amount
of work in collecting and refining
the needed materials

  i had little doubt that he had been
there but it had been evidently weeks
or months earlier any trail that
he might have made through the
forest would have already grown up

  i thought the situation over for
awhile but there still seemed noth-
ing better to do than to follow our
original plan of exploring the jungle
to the north we plunged into the
crimson gloom without the com-
pass we would have been quickly
lost even with it it was hard
enough to keep in the same direc-
tion walking over the marshy
ground and breaking a path through
the heavy undergrowth we were
soon covered with mud and dyed red
the alien intelligence



with the stain of the vegetation

  for many hours we struggled
through a wilderness of endless
sameness-a dank morass a crim-
son jungle with the dusky purple
sky hanging heavily in the treetops

  at first the forest had been quiet
with a silence that was dead and
depressing for there were no living
things about us no birds no in-
sects-not even a bright moth or
butterfly it was a wilderness of
death but presently we heard far
ahead of us a dull constant roar
that grew louder as we went on

  at last it grew so loud that we
had to shout when we wished one
another to hear our words i was
glad of the roar for it drowned the
sound of our progress through the
jungle but the forest was so dense
that there seemed little danger of
our capture unless we stumbled on
the habitation of the krimlu

  abruptly the jungle ended and we
stepped out on a bare ledge of stone
before us was one of the most mag-
nificent spectacles that i have be-
held to the west a great black cliff
rose perhaps a thousand feet-until
it was almost lost against the lower-
ing smoky purple of the sky over
it plunged a vast sheet of the glow-
ing white liquid of the silver lake
falling in a gigantic unbroken arch
to the immense pool beneath us
where it broke with a deafening
roar into a gleaming bank of soft
silver haze

  surrounding the black rock rims
of the pool the gloomy crimson of
the forest closed in the pool it-
self was a thousand feet across
the whole scene was colossal it
was awe-inspiring and impressive

  there was no visible outlet for the
silver liquid so i knew that it must
find its way off underground i
sensed that we must be far below
the level of the silver lake and the
plain beyond that fact may have
accounted for the more luxuriant
growth of the red vegetation

  suddenly naro reported the dis-

covery of the comparatively fresh
print of a hob-nailed boot in a little
patch of mould on the rock that
set us to looking again for traces of
austen and presently we found a
well-defined trail that led east

  we followed it eagerly when we
had gone perhaps a mile we came to
an outcropping seam of coal there
i found the plain marks of a copper
pick evidently a good deal of coal
had been dug up and carried off
down the trail

chapter ix
austens retreat

perhaps two hundred yards
further we came upon the camp
it was atop a little hill below a giant
tree by the trunk was a mud-
daubed hut with an open shed in
front of it by the shed was a rude
clap furnace with piles of coal some
strange ore and large lumps of na-
tive copper lying by it

  beneath the shed was what ap-
peared to be a small steam turbine
with a kettle-like boiler of ham-
mered copper connected with it
was a dynamo of crude but ingeni-
ous construction also there were
a rude forge and hammers anvils
saws and drills all of copper or
bronze and a device that i supposed
had been used for drawing wire

  simple as it seemed that camp of
austens was perhaps the most re-
markable thing i came across in the
crater austen was a wonderful
man having not only an exhaustive
knowledge of a half dozen fields of
science-and he had not mere theo-
ries but a practical working knowl-
edge-he had also courage and de-
termination patience manual skill
resourcefulness and invention

  while the average man would
hardly have been able to keep alive
in the jungle austen was able to do
	wonder story annual

such things as smelt and refine ore
and set up complicated and work-
able electrical machinery of course
he was fortunate in finding himself
in a place where practically no effort
was needed to satisfy his physical
needs and where he could find vari-
ous natural resources in available
and easily accessible form but i
shall never cease to wonder at his
accomplishments in less than a year

  i was struck by a sudden fear
that we had come too late that
something had happened to him
austen i shouted austen are
you here

  for answer an old man whom i
recognized joyfully as the scientist
appeared in the rude doorway of the
hut his clothing was tattered be-
yond description and he looked very
worn and thin there were lines of
age about his wrinkled face

  but his hair was neatly brushed
and he had just been shaving for his
safety razor was in his hand a
smile of astonishment and incredu-
lous joy sprang over his face for
a moment he was speechless then
the old familiar voice called out un-
certainly almost sobbing with joy

  winfield melvar naro can it
really be you  at last

  then as if he were a little
ashamed of the feeling he had
shown he pulled out his pipe and
began to try to fill it his fingers
trembling with emotion but melvar
sprang to him and threw her arms
about him in a way that gave me a
momentary pang of jealousy he
stuck the pipe back in his pocket
grinning awkwardly in a way that
tightened the strings of my heart

  i forgot he said my tobacco
was all gone a week ago

  i shook his hand and it clung to
mine for a moment as if he were
seeking support then naro placed
his palm upon austens shoulder in
the customary greeting of astran

  id almost given up the old man
said the world is so far away
that it seems almost unreal after

i had sent the wireless call a few
times the devilish rustling in the
sky got too close for comfort and i
decided that the hissing red lights
whatever they are were about to
locate me by the signals so i quit
that but how did you come over

  i told him briefly about our ad-
venture with the red ship

  yes i knew that the things were
ships of some kind he said when i
had finished i have been working
on the quicksilver stuff and making
a few exploring trips i have dis-
covered several things i had to
work-work endlessly-to keep go-
ing sometimes i got to feeling
pretty low

  then i would shave and try to
clean up like a civilized man and
i kept repeating all the poetry i
knew-that helped a lot but lord
-you havent any idea how glad i
am to see you by the way did you
bring the spectroscope and tubes

  by way of reply i took off the
pack that contained them he began
to open it with as much enthusiasm
as a small boy investigating a
christmas present suddenly he
looked at us but you dont look as
if youve had any holiday your-
selves what happened to you

  two or three things i told him
it hasnt been a holiday at all do
you happen to have any coffee left
i left mine in the tent outside the
cliffs

  and how about a little hot mulli-
gan stew to go with it he grinned
beckoning the way inside

so we went into the cabin most
of the room seemed to be devoted
to his crude laboratory equipment
on one of his benches were several
roughly modeled pottery jars filled
with the liquid from the silver sea

  in a few minutes he had the cof-
feepot boiling over a charcoal bra-
zier i believe its aroma was about
the most pleasant that ever reached
my nostrils

  when the coffee was done austen
the alien intelligence



served a meal consisting of a great
pot of steaming soup made of the
yellow fruits cooked with the tender
roots of the red plants that stands
out in my memory as one of the
truly magnificent repasts that have
ever been laid before me

  finished melvar retired to aus-
tens bunk and naro and i lay down
on a blanket on the laboratory floor
i went to sleep at once and if i may
credit the word of our host slept
for thirty-seven and a half hours
although i am inclined to believe
that is an exaggeration

  at any rate when i got up i felt
a new man austen had set up the
apparatus we brought he had a
test tube full of the silver liquid in
a beam of x-rays the spectroscope
was in position to examine the dense
purple gas that was rising from the
stuff

  hows it coming i asked him

  he shook his head sadly i dont
know he said i have a theory
but it doesnt seem to work out
right the key is in sight but it
always eludes me there is energy
stored in the silver liquid it may
be that that amazing thing in the
sky stores the energy of sunlight in
the stuff

  you know that the energy in
sunlight amounts to something over
one horsepower for each square yard
on which it falls or perhaps the
atomic energy of the gases in the
air is released it seems impossible
to find the key although i have been
able to analyze the stuff pretty ac-
curately if i had it i could make
the silver stuff go off like ten times
its weight of tnt

  do you think i asked him ea-
gerly that you could set off some
of it and wipe out the krimlu

  winfield the old scientist sober-
ly replied even if you could would
you wipe out a whole civilization-
a science as high as that which made
the silver lake-a culture equal to
if not above that of our own
world

  if you had seen those purple
things-men and women old and
hideous and fearfully strong and
malignant-you couldnt move too
quickly to blot them off the earth
i cried

  i have seen he said seriously
i have seen the purple monsters
and they are terrible enough but
they are not the masters they are
but the servants or perhaps i should
say the machines of a higher power

  there is another form of intelli-
gence here winfield a form of life
unrelated to humanity without any
sympathy for mankind or any share
of human feelings perhaps it is a
danger to the human race these
beings would not hesitate i suppose
to use all humanity as they have
used the people of astran

  but that does not solve the prob-
lem would it be right to wipe them
out  perhaps it would be better for
mankind to go under perhaps they
are superior to us the purposes of
the creation of intelligent life might
be better met by these things than
by man i have given it a great deal
of thought and i cant decide

  he fell silent and presently i said
you say there is another form of
life here what is it like

  you will know soon enough i
wish i had never seen it is not a
good thing to talk about there is
no use for me to tell you

he would tell me no more
presently i left him and went
down to bathe in the stream that
flowed back of the camp the water
was sluggish and tepid certainly not
invigorating but it was cleansing
when i got back melvar and naro
were up the girl seemed very glad
to see austen again she was talk-
ing with him very vivacious and
very beautiful when i saw her i
loved her more than ever

  as soon as we had eaten austen
began to dismount the spectrometer
and other equipment and pack them
i can go no farther with the experi-


wonder story annual

  ments here he said i am going
  to take the outfit to a place where
  we can see one of the engines of the
  krimlu where the silver liquid is
  broken up there i may be able to
  get the clue i need

    in an hour we were ready to de-
  part austen led the way silent
  and preoccupied with the details of
  his work we went down a narrow
  trail through the stagnating
  marshes in the eldritch gloom of the
  weird red jungle under the dull pur-
  ple mist for many hours we were
  on the way until the purple dusk
  began to thicken and a distant sigh-
  ing whistle told us that night had
  fallen and the evil masters were
  abroad again

    suddenly austen called out in a
  guarded tone for us to halt we
  crept forward cautiously until we
  could see over the brink of a vast
  circular chasm sheer black walls
  ringed by the red jungle fell for a
  thousand feet the round floor was
  a half mile across

    upon it was the most gigantic and
  amazing mechanical device i have
  ever seen it was incredibly huge
  and throbbing with strange energy
  it made little sound but the air all
  about us seemed vibrant with power

    in the center of the pit was a
  titanic shining green cylinder per-
  haps a hundred feet in diameter and
  five hundred in length a river of
  - gleaming silver fluid ran from an
  opening in the rock through a great
  open aqueduct and poured into the
  cylinder in the middle of the upper-
  side

    at each end of the colossal cylin-
  der rose a metal tower at the top
  of each tower was a fifty-foot globe
  of blue crystal slowly turning be-
  tween and above the spheres arched
  a high-flung span of white fire-a
  great pulsing sheet of milky opales-
  cent light-that roared and crackled
  like a powerful electric discharge
  and lit the chasm with an unearthly
  radiance

    toward the farther side of the

floor was a second enormous ma-
chine apparently unconnected with
the first resembling a vast tele-
scope the white metal tube was a
full two hundred feet in length
mounted on massive metal supports
it did not seem to be in action the
barrel of it was pointing at the sky

  then i saw a row of openings low
down in the side of the vast green
cylinder with shafts of bright green
light pouring from them and i
saw tiny human figures working
feverishly about them they had
escaped my observation at first so
far away was the floor of the pit
now i saw that they were taking
great blocks of a luminous green
substance from the doors in the
cylinder and carrying them to the
tube that was pointing at the sky

  i saw now that the bodies of the
toilers were purple there was
something in their motion that re-
minded me of ants i was amazed
at their strength and agility at
their ceaseless machine-like activity

  i remembered the time i had
splashed the white fluid on my arm
turning it purple and the strange
excitement of my nerves at once
i linked up the raids on astran the
bracelet that naro had found on the
dead purple beast and what austen
had told me of superior beings who
enslaved the purple things i knew
that i looked upon the captured men
and women of astran converted to
machines in this strange place

  perhaps they were already dead
certainly they moved not by their
own volition but by a stronger me-
chanical power they must have
been under the absolute hypnotic
control of the higher intelligences
who treated their unfortunate cap-
tives perhaps with the argent liquid
to convert them into unearthly ma-
chines of superhuman strength

  we turned away into the night
that had fallen on the red jungle
while we watched i was sick with
horror austens face was white
and his hands were trembling
the alien intelligence



  now i knew in spite of what he
had said that were the opportunity
given him he would not hesitate to
wipe out the masters of the purple
slaves he said nothing but his
hands worked spasmodically he
muttered under his breath and his
dark eyes snapped with angry de-
termination

  in a little while we set about pre-
paring the apparatus for the work
of the night the spectroscope was
set up with telescopic condensers to
collect and analyze the radiation of
the arch of crackling milky flame
we took care to screen ourselves in
the jungle fringe and to expose no
more of the equipment to the sight
of the beings below than necessary

  austen had his drawing board set
up in a convenient place behind our
shelter and he alternately peered
through the telescope at the spec-
trum and turned to make intricate
calculations by the light of a shaded
flashlight we worked till dawn

  all night long the white flame
played between the spinning blue
crystal spheres above the vast green
cylinder filling the air with its
ghostly crackle and whisper all
night long the tireless purple human
machines toiled in the pit carrying
the great green blocks and evidently
stacking them in the vast cannon-
like tube at the side

  whenever austen did not need me
with the analysis i spent my time
searching that amazing scene but
not once did i catch a glimpse of
anything that might have been the
directing intelligence of all that
marvelous activity

  melvar was very tired and i had
contrived a hammock for her from
a great sheet of fibrous bark torn
from the trunk of one of the red
trees she spent the night asleep
in that while austen and i carried
on the work naro not having
scientific inclinations contented
himself with a couch composed of a
few feathery branches torn from
the undergrowth

chapter x
what the analysis showed

just before daylight austen com-
pleted his calculations and stated
the result he was very tired and
his eyes were red he had worked
for a day and two nights since we
had found him

  you know he said that there
are several rare gases in the air in
addition to oxygen and nitrogen
the inert gas argon comprises near-
ly one percent of the atmosphere
and tere are in addition smaller
quantities of helium neon xenon
and krypton not to mention carbon
dioxide and water vapor those
gases are monatomic and do not or-
dinarily enter into any compounds

  you know that lightning in the
air causes a union of nitrogen and
oxygen to form nitrous and nitric
acids which may later release their
energy in the explosion of gun-
powder or nitroglycerine in much
the same way the force that forms
the silver fluid utilizes the photo-
chemical effect of sunlight to build
up a complex molecule containing
oxygen nitrogen and the inert gases
of helium group

  it is very unstable and may be
disrupted with the release of a great
amount of energy i was able to de-
tect the characteristic lines of most
of the gases in the luminous spec-
trum of the purple gas-but not un-
til i had analyzed the light of the
opalescent flame and made my de-
ductions from that was i able to de-
rive the equations and arrive at the
precise structural formula and at
the exact wavelength necessary to
break down the molecule

  he proceeded to launch into a de-
tailed technical discussion of the
process of analysis he had used and
of the methods of inductive reason-
ing by which he had arrived at his


wonder story annual

conclusion it was rather deep for
me and i am afraid some of the
salient points have already slipped
my mind

  something more important was
on my mind have you found out
enough i asked can you blow
up the stuff can you wipe out the
krimlu

  i am not sure he said but i
think if i could get at that machine
with a little of my equipment i
could manipulate it to make it go
off like a thousand tons of dynamite
the silver stuff runs into the cylin-
der and is converted into pure vi-
brant energy if i could just speed
up the process a bit

  the krimlu seem to live under-
ground like ants a month ago i
found an opening into their world
near the cliff south of the falls
there are the shafts where their
ships come out ventilator tubes and
funnels for the purple smoke from
their engines i will go down one
of the shafts and see what can be
done

  you mean we will go i told
him you dont think-

  there is  need for you to risk
your life he said in a voice pur-
posely brusque to hide his emotion
i can do as much by myself then
there is melvar we must get her
out of here if we can i think a
great deal of her if we both should
go-and not come back  

  no i want you to stay on top
i know i can trust you to treat her
fairly if i can blast down the earth
on their underground world we
might be able to make it back
around the silver sea and eventu-
ally to the outside

  you can trust me sir to care
for her to the best of my ability
i told him trying without notable
success to keep my voice even and
casual

  really he cried looking at me
intensely do you love her

  i admitted that i did

  i had hoped so austen said

she and you are the ones dearest
to me in the world if you were out
and safe i could-go-in peace

  the rude hammock in which mel-
var had been lying sprang into vio-
lent motion and erupted her slender
beautiful figure she came running
toward me i am sorry she gasped
no i mean i am glad i was awake
winfield i heard you- her later
statements were not particularly co-
herent since she was kissing me and
i was holding her in my arms and
returning the embrace i gathered
on the whole that my feelings for
her were well reciprocated some
minutes later when i came back to
earth i observed that austen was
taking the equipment down and that
naro was standing and looking at us
with an expression of extreme and
comical disgust on his face

by that time it was light and
soon by the brightening of the
purple haze above we knew the sun
was rising i saw that austen was
looking into the pit melvar and i
walked to the edge the great metal
tube which the purple beings had
been all night in loading with the
green bars was being swung slowly
about upon its mounting until pres-
ently it was pointing at the sky

  for a moment nothing happened
then a low humming drone reached
our ears coming apparently from
the complex machinery at the base
of the tube steadily the sound rose
in pitch until it was an intolerably
high and painful scream suddenly
the high rhythm bf it had be-
come unsupportable and we ceased
to hear it but i knew that it had
merely passed up the scale beyond
the range of our ears

  abruptly the colossal tube seemed
to flash into green incandescence
and a broad beam of yellow light
blindingly brilliant and pulsing with
strange energy poured up into the
dusky purple sky then i knew that
it was this machine which made the
amazing thing above the silver sea
the alien intelligence



from which the white liquid fell

  as we watched bright patches of
red and green shot up the beam
slowly the bright yellow faded from
the ray but still the green luminosity
clung about the tube and still i felt
that the flood of radiant purposeful
energy was flowing up into the sky

  it was not long before i heard far
above us in the distant west beyond
the red-clad hill the splash of the
first great drop of silver into the ar-
gent lake below us the white tor-
rent was still pouring into the vast
green cylinder the white fire was
still arching between the crystal
globes and the purple slaves were
still rushing about the pit with fe-
verish machine-like energy

  we turned away from the place
and walked back into the terrible
and weird semi-darkness of the scar-
let jungle still beneath the shadow
of the evil intelligence that ruled
the crater

  we reached the camp long before
night and austen and i went to
sleep the old scientist was up again
at daylight i was amazed at his
energy and vitality he got ready
the equipment he intended to take
and we were soon ready to set out
for the entrance of the underworld

  austen insisted that we leave mel-
var and naro behind there was no
use he said in exposing them to the
hardships and dangers of the jour-
ney and it seemed that no harm
would be likely to come to them at
the cabin

  i did not like to leave melvar but
she was very courageous about it
smiling through her tears it always
takes more courage for those who
stay behind and wait than for those
who have the lure of mystery and
adventure to beckon them on

  melvar walked with me to the
edge of the clearing and there we
left her taking a dim trail that led
through the dense jungle to the
south austen was saying nothing
he was lost in meditation but i
knew that when the time came he

would be ready for action

  but how could i guess the noble
thoughts that were passing in his
mind how could i realize that he
was marching willingly to his doom
for my part i was thinking of the
wonderful girl i had left at the
cabin i thought too of the horror
of the lights that haunted astran
and of the horror that would come
if the lights ever went beyond the
rim-into the outer world

  after several hours austen
stopped it is not a half-mile to the
shafts he said we shall have to
make a rope i have made cords from
the tough bark of the red trees they
do very well i want to reach the
bottom of the pit before night

  but i have reason to think that
the things are active in their under-
world at all hours of the day emerg-
ing at night only because the mag-
netic vibration of sunlight interferes
with the operation of the delicate
machinery of their bodies

  we began to weave a rope of strips
of leather-like bark torn from the
mighty red trees we kept at it until
we had many hundred feet of the
tough strands as we worked austen
began to talk a little in a voice that
was very low and a little husky of
his boyhood on a western farm and
of the bright spots of his life

  he told a few stories of his school
and college days of the girl he had
loved and lost but when the rope
was finished and coiled he fell silent
again and grimly examined his
automatic he adjusted his pack got
out his pipe and filled it with my
tobacco and grinned then he said
soberly we are here we are ready
to play our hand to win or to lose
and if we lose  

  he thrust out his hand i shook it
and we walked on silently we had
not gone more than a hundred yards
when the scarlet forest thinned and
we walked out on a level stretch of
bare white sand

  along the western side rose a dark
precipitous cliff like that over which
the silver fall plunged with a line of
red brush along the top at its foot
was a great sloping bank of talus
scattered with gigantic boulders
the cliff and the lofty crimson forest
that rimmed the open space on the
other three sides seemed to reach
into the dusky purple of obscurity
of the low-hanging sky

  spaced irregularly about the
center of the flat were perhaps a
dozen low circular metal structures
-evidently the mouths of great
white metal tubes projecting from
the earth from five of them dense
clouds of purple vapor were pouring

we left the shelter of the
jungle and quickly approached
the nearest of the wells the metal
curbing was about four feet high
around a circular pit some  feet in
diameter we leaned over and looked
into it the tube was lit faintly for
a few feet down the walls but we saw
no light toward the bottom

  a faint humming sound came up
out of the darkness and i felt a
strong current of air flowing down
the tube it was altogether stranger
and more terrible than i had an-
ticipated i doubt that i could have
found the courage to descend is
the rope long enough  i whispered

  yes he replied on the day i
discovered this place i dropped a
pebble in the well and timed its fall
with my watch the depth is just
over five hundred feet

  i put the end of the cord over the
metal rim and paid it out until only
enough was left to hitch around my
body with a smile of forced cheer-
fulness austen looked to his pack
knocked out the pipe and put it in
his pocket

  winfield my boy i hope to see
you soon again he said it may
take only an hour or two to lay my
mine and return to the shaft

  you wait and hold the rope and
if i need to send you any message
i will jerk it three times and you
can pull it up the note will tell
when to put it down again for me
to climb out good-by my boy
you-

  he started to say something more

but his voice broke and he turned
abruptly to the well i braced myself
against the curbing as he climbed
over and started down i looked over
and watched him in a few moments
his head and shoulders had shrunk
to a little blot against the darkness
of the well soon he was out of my
sight although for a long time i felt
the tugging of the rope

  suddenly the tension relaxed he
had reached the bottom or-fearful
thought-he had lost his grip on
the rope and was hurtling downward
through the darkness i listened in
an agony of suspense it was several
minutes before i was reassured to
feel three twitches of the cord i
pulled it up on the end was tied a
piece of paper with these words pen-
ciled upon it-

  dear winfield-i hate to leave us
thus without warning you as i in-
tend to do but i could not tell you
go back get melvar and travel as
far as you can from this accursed
place may you and she survive and
lead a happy life together in here if
you cannot reach the world beyond

  i will give you twenty hours in
that time you can go far north of
thesilver falls i am sure that with
the equipment i now have i can ex-
plode one of the engines and send
all this part of the valley skyward-
if i live to carry out my plan good-
by

                      austen

  then i saw that he had been plan-
ning all along to give up his life
the note had been written some time
before he left i cursed the stupidity
that had kept me from perceiving
his intention dear old austen the
truest friend i ever had his
smiling face his kind blue eyes his
low familiar voice are gone forever

chapter xi
the forest aflame

have a very confused recollec-
tion of what happened immedi-
ately afterward my own actions
seem a vague disordered dream my
bitter grief at austens self-sacrifice
was the only thing real to me i be-
lieve i began carrying rocks from
the boulder-strewn slope at the foot
of the cliff with the idea of securing
the rope to them so that i could go
down in search for him

  the first thing i remember clear-
ly is that i was staggering back to
the shaft with a heavy rock in my
arms when i caught a whiff of acrid
smoke and awoke to the realization
that the purple sky was darkened
with drifting clouds the air already
heavy with the suffocating pungent
odor of burning red vegetation

  i knew that had the red-hot
rocket-ship in which we had crossed
the silver sea chanced to fall in the
jungle instead of on the barren hill-
top a conflagration would have
spread from it at once abruptly i
remembered that the glowing frag-
ments of the one we had wrecked
had fallen in the northern forest
austens cabin lay in that direction

i knew that the red vegetation was
peculiarly inflammable that the fire
fed on the oxygen of the heavy at-
mosphere would advance with ter-
rible speed

  for a moment in a panic of in-
decision i listened from the north
i heard the crackling roar of a
mighty conflagration then my mind
was made up any attempt to find
austen and induce him to give up
his plan of self-sacrifice would be
terribly uncertain

  melvar was in immediate danger
and i knew that austen valued her
life above his own but even then i
knew in my heart that it was too
late though i would not let myself
believe it fire is a pitiless and re-
morseless enemy

  at a dead run i started up the
trail by which we had entered the
clearing even the smoke became
thicker and more acrid while the
crackling roar of the fire rang ever
louder in my ears i ran on through
the ghastly gloom of the scarlet
jungle in mad desperation even after
hope was gone until the hot suf-
focating breath of the flames was

thing of crimson implacable ir-
resistible overwhelming it plunged
forward like a rushing tidal wave of
red already the fire had passed the
site of the cabin

  i was suddenly hopeless and de-
spairing and very tired the flames
rushed forward faster by far than a
human being could force a way
through the jungle with the knowl-
edge that i had just lost the only
two beings that in all the world of
men ever mattered to me it hardly
seemed worth while to try to save
my own life

  for a moment i stood there about
to cast myself into the flames but
it is not the nature of an animal to
die willingly no matter how slight
the promise of life may be

hen i could endure the heat no
longer when the pain of my
blistered skin and the outcries of
my tortured lungs had grown un-
supportable i turned and ran to-
ward the clearing again

  my nostrils and lungs were seared
and smarting the hot wind dried
my skin and left it scorched and
cracked i was blinded by the smoke
i longed to throw myself down and
seek the temporary ecstasy of a
breath of clear air from near the
ground of a cooling plunge into a
muddy pool the red jungle reeled
about me but i fought my way on
like a man in a dream

  at last i staggered into the open
space the last of the giant trees
exploded into flames not a score of
yards behind me sparks rained
upon me my clothing caught fire
i ran on fighting the flames with
my hands the jungle back of me
roared deafeningly an angry surg-
ing sea of lurid red flames

  heat radiation poured across
the clearing in a pitiless beam i
struggled on across the white sand
away from flames that tossed them-
selves up like volcano-ridden ranges
of scarlet alps until i reached the
shelter of a great boulder on the
slope below the cliff

  i flung myself down behind the
rock gulping down the cool air and
rubbing out the fire in my clothing
with my blackened hands for many
hours i lay there tortured by thirst
and pain at last i fell into a light
sleep of troubled dreams in which
huge winged green ants flew after
me through burning crimson forests
and in which i saw the dear form of
melvar devoured again and again by
the flames

  i was awakened after a time i
know not how long by a cool wind
that had sprung up from the north
for a moment my mind was lost in
blank wonder then came the deso-
late awareness that melvar and
austen were lost in hopeless misery
i got weakly to my feet and walked
unsteadily around the boulder until
i could look across the clearing

  as i leaned against the rock gaz-
ing eastward it was a strangely
altered and desolate scene that lay
before my eyes the red forest was
gone below me was a region of
low rolling hills black and grim be-
neath the lowering smoky purple
sky

  the white sand about me stood out
in sharp contrast to the charred and
gloomy waste beyond from which a
few slender wisps of dark smoke
were still rising all life was gone
it was a dead world but still the
dense purple clouds poured out of
the shafts of the underworld adding
their weight to the dismal sky

  a great homesickness for the
world and my fellow men came over
me then i heard a strange hum-
ming behind me and a slight metallic
clatter i turned around in apathetic
curiosity

  i came face to face with a monster
so utterly strange and terrible that
the very shock of it almost unseated
my wandering reason

  at first i looked on the thing with
a curious lack of interest as the
soul of one newly dead might look
with numbed faculties on his new
habitation but as i looked upon it
an icy current of fear stole over me
like the creeping cold of the north
i had met so many horrors that i had
begun to think myself immune but
i had met no such thing as that

  i knew that it was intelligent a
sentient being but it was not
human not a thing of flesh and blood
at all it was a machine or rather
it was in a machine for i felt more
of it than i saw-a will a cold and
alien intellect a being malefic in-
human inscrutable

  it was a thing that belonged not
in the present earth but in the tomb
of the unthinkable past or beyond
the wastes of interstellar space amid
the inconceivable horrors of un-
known spheres

  there was a bright gleaming
globe three feet in diameter lit
with vivid flowing fires of violet and
green a strange swirling mist of
brilliant points of many colored
lights danced madly about it-a
coruscating fog of iridescent fire-
moving flickering in an incredible
rhythm

that unearthly thing rested up-
on a frame of metal it was the
head of a metallic monster it
was set on an oblong box of white
metal to which were attached six
long-jointed metal limbs the being
stood nine feet high at least

  it was standing on three of the
limbs and holding my rifle which i
had left where i had been lying
turning it and feeling of it with a
cluster of slender fingerlike tentacles
on the end of the metal arm it
was working the mechanism of the
gun and apparently looking at it
though it had no eyes that i could
see

  suddenly the gun went off throw-
ing up sand between me and the
monster with a grotesquely half-
human attitude of alarmed surprise
the being dropped the gun and
sprang back like a gigantic spider
the motion freed me from my
paralysis of horror and i started
backing cautiously around the
bolder afraid to ran

  as i moved it sprang forward and
a slender tube of white metal in one
of the tentacled hands was suddenly
pointed toward me when the mon-
ster moved there was a humming

 sound and little jets of purple gas
 hissed from holes in the sides of the
 boxlike body

   i drew my automatic and fired at
 the metal tube i must have made
 an unusually fortunate shot for the
 object was carried out of the metal
 grasp and fell spinning to the sand
 on the instant i turned and ran to-
 ward another great boulder as large
 as a railroad locomotive that lay
 fifty yards to the north as i ran
 i heard the clatter and shirring of
 the mechanical being i paused at
 the edge of the rock and took a last
 glimpse back

   the monster was holding the little
 tube in one of the limbs and ap-
 parently adjusting it with another
 then it suddenly extended the thing
 toward me  dived behind the rock
 a bright ray of orange light shot
 past the boulder-a beam like that
 which had come from the being in
 the door of the rocketship then i
 knew that here was an entity of the
 same kind as the one i had de-
 stroyed that night-one of the ruling
 intelligences of the crater the krim-
 lu

  for long moments i crouched
behind the boulder expecting the
terrible being to come striding
around after me at any instant but
it did not come so presently i be-
gan to think perhaps the things
were not so powerful or so extremely
intelligent after all

   i had killed one even if it had been
 just by a chance shot in the dark
 this one had seemed surprised even
 alarmed when the rifle went off
 and i supposed that a being so in-
 telligent as i had at first thought it
 to be might have inferred the nature
 and use of the weapon from its ap-
 pearance

   and i thought that it must be
 afraid of me after my pistol bullet
 had knocked its own weapon out
 of its grip or it would have followed
 me around the boulder then i be-
 gan to wonder what it was going to
 do

   it evidently intended to strike me
 with the ray weapon not only did it
 respect me but it knew that i stood
 in deathly fear of it it knew that i
 was trying to escape so it might
 reasonably expect me to leave the
 unscalable cliff and attempt to break
 against the open country

   and if i were to do that i would
 naturally keep in the shelter of my
 own boulder as long as possible if
 the monster thought it out that way
 the logical thing for it to do would
 be to creep out of the upper side of
 its rock where i would inevitably
 come into its sight by whatever di-
 rection i left my breastwork

   of course there was a frightful
 risk in taking any action on such a
 hypothesis-a greater risk than i
 realized at the time if the monster
 were less intelligent than i supposed
 i might blunder on it if it were
 more so it mio-ht have anticipated
 my pan-mierht trap me

   but i crawled out along the upper
 side of my boulder and peered over
 a smaller rock which would serve
 me as a breastwork my automatic
 ready i expected to see the creature
 within my range intent upon my
 other lines of retreat rut it was
 not there i thought i was doomed
 but the orange ray did not strike
 and i was forced to the conclusion
 that the monster was not in a posi-
 tion for action at all

for a moment i was tempted to-
ward precipitate flight across the
clearing but i knew that such a move
would put me at the mercy of the
ray i decided that it might not
yet be too late to carry out my
original plan i lay flat my gun
trained on the spot where i expected
it to appear for perhaos fifteen
minutes nothing happened

   then my hypothesis proved to be
 justified the weird bemg suddenly
 sprang into view the strange
 weapon grasped in its glittering
 arm it seemed to be looking beyond
 my boulder i was lying ready with
 the automatic leveled it was
 matter of the merest instant to aim
 at the green sphere and pull the
 trigger

   the globe was shattered as if it
 were made of glass glittering frag-
 ments showered off the metal box

 the whole mechanical body suddenly
 became very rigid and fell heavily
 to the side a puff of coruscating
 green mist floated out of the globe
 as it broke and swiftly dissipated
 and the sparkling lights were about
 the thing no more the monster was
 evidently dead

   for a few moments i hesitated but
 i was sure the thing had been killed
 and my curiosity got the better of
 my fear i cautiously approached
 it for a moment i marveled at the
 wonderful workmanship of the ma-
 chine at the cleverness of its desire
 then i saw something that made me
 forget all else something beside the
 crystal shell had fallen

   the tissue of it was very delicate
 and it had been broken by the fall so
 that the body juices were running
 from it the brain cavity was very
 large-perhaps larger than that of
 a man-covered only with a thin
 chitinous shell the limbs were but
 thin tentacles almost altogether
 atrophied

   in fact the brain seemed to be
 three-fourths of the total bulk the
 body was so badly smashed that i
 could tell little about it but the tiny
 limbs were covered with chitin and
 there were the rudimentary stumps
 of fine tissue-like wings there were
 no visible traces of digestive organs
 or of mandibles

   the thing was plainly an insect
 from just what species it had
 sprung in the long process of evolu-
 tion in the crater it would be diffi-
 cult to say for several reasons i
 believe it was an ant at any rate
 it had reached just about the ulti-
 mate stage of evolution machines
 had altogether replaced bodies of
 flesh and blood i believe the thing
 had been nourished by the sparkling
 green vapor which must have cir-
 culated like blood through the pro-
 tecting crystal sphere

   it seems incredible to find great
 intelligence in any form of life other
 than human-but science thinks that
 life and intelligence must rise and
 fall in recurring cycles that the
 earth has probably been ruled by
 many different forms of life each of
 which has been blotted out by some
cataclysm the krimlu were a sur-
viving remnant of archaic ages

chapter xii
when austen struck

i lost little time in the examina-
tion of the dead creature the
shafts from which it had come were
but a few hundred yards below and
the purple gas was still rolling out
of the funnels i did not know when
a second monster might appear

  my mind was too much upset by
grief and terror to be capable of
intelligent planning but i knew i
wanted to get away from here and
i think i had some notion of reaching
the northern pass of getting back
to an unburned growth of the red
vegetation for i was weak with
thirst and hunger but all that was
very vague

  i walked around the wells keep-
ing at a distance and struck out
for the east as fast as my wearied
limbs could carry me soon the cliff
was out of sight all about was the
desolate rolling black landscape
with the gloomy purple sky over-
head my thoughts were as dark
and sere as the world

  when i had gone perhaps three
hours from the cliff and had almost
lost my fear of pursuit i saw a great
cigar-shaped object of gleaming
white on a low hill before me so
dulled were my perceptions that it
was many minutes before i realized
that it was the rocketship in which
we had come over the silver sea

  then with a faint thrill of hope
the thought came to me that it was
still probably in a condition to fly
and that if i could succeed in con-
trolling it it offered a possible ave-
nue of escape from the crater

  i walked up to the thick metal
walls they seemed undamaged by
the fire of course they were used to
withstanding the far higher tem-
peratures developed during flight

i	walked around the ship and was

 surprised to see that the heavy metal
 door which we had left open had
 been swung shut

   lying against it was the charred
 skeleton of a man about the bones
 were woven metal garments and
 crystal armor that i recognized with
 a shock as naros so i thought the
 fellow had deserted his beautiful
 sister to seek the shelter of the
 rocketship and had fallen a victim
 to the flames at the last moment

   for a moment i stared grimly at
 the remains then animated by a
 sudden ray of hope i sprang to the
 door pulled it open and leaped into
 the ship there lying on the floor
 was the lovely form of melvar her
 clothing was tattered and smeared
 with stains of red and black from
 the burning forest but she was un-
 harmed

   it was almost incredible to me to
 find her restored i was half afraid
 that my mind had failed at last and
 that she was but an illusion i
 dropped on my knees beside her and
 kissed her warm red lips she stirred
 a little and still but half awake put
 a trustful arm about my shoulder

  winfield i knew you would
come she whispered at last but
where are naro and austen

   they will never come i said

   she drew me fiercely toward her
 as if to use me for a shield against
 the awful truth it was some time
 before she was able to talk but
 presently she told me how naro had
 seen the smoke and how she had
 thought of seeking shelter from the
 fire in the rocketship they had run
 down the trail we had made as we
 left the ship

   the fire had overtaken them just
 as they reached it the boy had
 carried her the last few yards had
 put her through the door had then
 been unable to enter himself but a
 hero to the last a worthy warrior
 of old astran he had swung the
 door shut with his dying motion

presently i turned my atten-
tion to the ship the marvelous
periscope still gave the illusion that
the bow was transparent when i
moved the little control lever the jets


of purple gas rushed out again after
a time i had the vessel worked loose
from its place in the earth then
once again i pulled up the little
metal knob and pushed it forward

  the blackened terrain was colored
by the purple mist it was dimmed
blurred blotted out we shot through
the purple cloud and plunged
abruptly into clear air and blessed
sunshine melvar stood by me her
arm upon my shoulder she cried
out gladly as we came into the light

  it was not quite noon and the sun
was shining brightly into the crater
the crescent silver lake was still
gleaming with the same argent
luster and astran shone like a great
gem set in the dark red upland
beyond

  suddenly the clouds of purple mist
below were thrown up and scattered
in a thousand ragged streamers a
great blaze of opalescence burst out
where it had been a flood of fire
ran over the silver sea it was a
white milky light like that we had
seen between the blue crystal globes
to the great machine in the chasm

  in a moment the whole crater was
a torn and angry ocean of iridescent
flame the red upland was blotted
out and astran vanished forever
white flames that were like the
tongues of burning hydrogen that
burst from exploding suns flared up
behind us

  then we heard the sound of the
cataclysm-a crashing roar like the
thunder of a thousand falling moun-
tains as deep as vast as awful as
the crash of colliding worlds at
the same instant we felt the force
of the greatest explosion that has
ever occurred on earth

  the rocket shot upward as though
shot out of a mighty cannon the
blue sky darkened about us and the
stars flamed out like a million
scintillating gems their incredible
myriads gleaming cold and hard
against the infinite empty blackness
we had been hurled out of the atmos-

explosion from our ever-rising
craft we could see the desert spread
out around the mountain like a vast
yellow sea rimmed on the south
by a steely blue line that was the
ocean

  the white fire dulled faded and
was gone as quickly as it had flared
up the crater of the mountain of
the moon was left a wild black ruin
of jagged scattered masses of smok-
ing stone of the silver lake of
the red vegetation upon the upland
of brilliant astran not a trace was
left

  the crater was left far behind in
the long arching flight of the rocket
the white frozen brilliance of the
stars faded out the untold glories
of the solar corona were dimmed and
blue was restored to the midnight
sky we were plunging toward the
desert in the direction of kanowa i
pulled back the lever and used the
full force of the rockets to check our
meteor-like flight until the fuel was
exhausted a moment afterward we
struck the earth

  we climbed out and left the vessel
there on the sand just as the stars
were coming out that night we ar-
rived at the headquarters of a great
sheep ranch people were very much
excited over the earthquake the
shock of the explosion of the silver
lake we learned had been regis-
tered at every seismographic station
in the world

  the rancher and his wife cared
for us with great hospitality if ill-
controlled curiosity after we had
had a week of rest they took us by
automobile to kanowna there i
astounded them by rewarding their
generosity with a magnificent
emerald-i still had in my pack a
half pound or so of jewels that naro
had brought me from astran

  melvar ever surprised me with
her innocent beauty her grace and
poise with the ease with which she
learned to face new situations and
to meet people i believe that no one
ever suspected that she had not had
a lifetime of training in the best of
society we were married at
kanowna and reached perth a few
days later
