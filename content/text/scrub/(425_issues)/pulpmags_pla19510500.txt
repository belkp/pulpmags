observe an anniversary

one year ago planet stories leaped into our lap crying im
yours yours  do with me as you will  since that momentous
embrace we have acquired the suspicion of an ulcer a batik ac-
count a tendency to shriek at sudden noises and a good deal of
pleasure from the work its been fun    and looks to continue
to be fun so may we now for the record state timidly our belief
that the present issue of ps is one of the best to come along for
quite a while and that it together with the last-the march-
issue constitutes a statement of aims  a level of science-ad-
venture quality and entertainment which we hope to hit ever
time from now on thank you kindly    and your comments
and suggestions are as always welcome

no pic-awards this trip for the simple reason that the new
bi-monthly schedule puts issue b on the presses before issue a
hits the stands thus no letters on a can be received-and no votes
on as letters counted-in time for inclusion in b

captives
of the thieve-star

 a novelet by james h schmitz

when peer and channok grappled the derelict
ra-twelve they hooked a death-prize-haunted
by the yomm stalked by the mysterious nine

the celebration of the

wedding of peer and channok had
to be cut a little short because a
flock of police-boats from irrek showed
up at detector-range about midway but
it was carried off with a flourish never-
theless



  the oxygen-bubble in the small moon-
crater was filled with colorful solidographs
creating the impression of an outdoor ban-
quet hall the best bands playing in the
empire that night unwittingly contributed
their efforts and food and drink were be-
yond reproach
with a fraction of a second to spare the reaper talked tint   


	planet

  though somewhat dazed throughout
channok was startled to discover at one
point that the thick carpets on which he
stood were a genuine priceless gai fornaab
weave-and no solidographs either the
eighty-four small ships of the space-rat
tribe-or voyageurs as they distinctly pre-
ferred to be called-lined up along the
outer edges of the banquet hall looked eer-
ily out of place to him but peer didnt
seem to mind her people rarely did go
far away from their ships and the law-
less precarious life they led made that an
advisable practice

  it would be up to him now channok
reflected beaming down on peer to edu-
cate her into customs and attitudes more
fitting for the wife of a regular citizen of
the empire and probable future member
of the imperial secret service-

  and then suddenly the whole ceremony
seemed to be over a bit puzzled by the
abruptness with which everybody had
begun to pack up and leave channok
was standing beside the ramp of his own
ship the asteroid-an honest licensed
trader-when santis strolled over to talk
to him santis was peers father and the
pint-sized chieftain of the tribe

  didnt tell you before son he re-
marked because you were already ner-
vous enough but as soon as they finish
collapsing the bubble youtl have about
six minutes to get your asteroid aloft and
off this moon before the cops from irrek
arrive

  i heard you pop and everythings
packed peer called down from the open
lock of the asteroid come up and kiss
me good-by and well seal her up
frowning suspiciously channok fol-
lowed santis up the ramp why should i
worry about cops he inquired looking
down at the two little people while they
briefly embraced peer came about up to
his shoulder though perfectly formed and
santis was an inch or two shorter the
tribe didnt run to bulk nobodys hunt-
ing for me

  not yet son santis conceded he
twirled h i s fierce brown mustache-tips
thoughtfully and glanced at peer

  if youre passing anywhere near old

stories

nameless you might cache that special
cargo youre carrying for me there he
told her around the foot of the mound
too bulky for the ships ive got here
put a dowser plate in with it and ill
come pick it up with a transport sometime
in the next four months

  yes pop said peer

  the fourth voyageur fleet will ren-
dezvous at new gymovaan next terra-
spring if you can talk this big lug into
it try to make it there daughter

  well be there promised peer

  channok cleared his throat impatient-
ly not if he could help it they
wouldnt

  those cops are looking for the mis-
sing crown jewels of irrek santis re-
sumed looking at him after theyve
opened you up from stem to stern to
make sure youre not hiding them they
might apologize and again they might
not

  holy satellites channok said stunned
did you actually-

  not i son i just master-mind these
things some of the boys did the job
there goes the oxygen-bubble now will
you get going

  they got going channok speechless for
once

some two months later he
stood in the asteroids control room
watching a pale blur creep up along the
starlxard screen

  thats not just one ship-thats at
least a hundred he announced presently
somewhat startled looks like theyve
turned out the entire dardrean war-fleet
wonder whats up

  peer laid the cargo list she was checking
down on the desk and came over to look
at the screen

  hm she said

  it couldnt possibly have anything to
do with us could it he inquired on a
sudden alarming hunch being unfamiliar
with the dialect used on dardrea he had
left most of the bargaining there to
her

  peer shrugged she showed the bland
innocent look of a ten-year-old child but
captives of the thieve-st all



that was habitual with her on one occas-
ion shed been mistaken for his daughter
and at times he even had to remind him-
self that shed been eighteen and a stu-
dent at the imperial institute of technol-
ogy when he first met her there-and then
unwittingly became santis tool in the
abstraction of a small but important sec-
tion of the i its top-secret experimental
files hed been trying to counteract that
little brigands influence on peer ever
since but he wasnt too sure of his degree
of success so far

  we took the merchants guild for
plenty on our auction i she admitted

  well channok frowned theyd hard-
ly send a fleet after us for that

  and of course added peer we got
the duke of dardreas fabulous coronet
forgot to mention that perfectly legal
though some local crook swiped it and
we took it in trade

  channok winced as a matter of fact
fencing iius a perfectly legitimate busi-
ness on dardrea but a man who planned to
enter the imperial secret service as soon
as he could save up the money to pay his
way through the academy couldnt afford
any stains on his past throughout the
empire the service was renowned in song
and story as the one body of men who
stood above the suspicion of reproach

  the duke wont know its gone for
another week peer consoled him any-
way it looks to me as if those ships are
beginning to pull off our course

  there followed some seconds of tense
observation

  so they are channok acknowledged
then he mopped his forehead but i
wish you wouldnt be quite so technical in
your interpretation of local laws peer
those babies are really traveling wonder
who or what theyre chasing

  three days later as the asteroid ap-
proached the area of the red giant sun
of old nameless where they were going
to cache santis cargo for him-hot cargo
probably and it would be a load off chan-
noks mind to get rid of it-they picked
up the trail of the foundering spaceship
ra-twelve and found part of the answer
on board

ii

tt seemed to me channok
jl remarked watching the ra-twelve
in the viewscreen before them as if her
drives had cut off completely just then
but theyre on again now what do you
think crew-member peer

  lets just follow her a bit peer sug-
gested ive seen ships act like that that
were just running out of juice but this
one wont even answer signals

  it could be channok said hopefully
a case of fair salvage you might keep
working the communicators though   
however the ra-twelve continued to
ignore them while she plodded on towards
the distant red glare of the nameless sys-
tem like a blind thirsty beast following
its nose to a water-hole presently she
began a series of quavering zigzag mo-
tions wandered aimlessly off her course
returned to it again on a few final puffs
of invisible energy and at last went drift-
ing off through space with her drives now
obviously dead

  the asteroid continued to follow at a
discreet distance like a chunky vulture
watching if there was anyone on board
the ra-twelve it almost had to be a
ghost her rear lock was wide open and
the hull showed deep scars and marks of
some recent space-action

but she wasnt really badly hurt
channok pointed out what do you sup-
pose could have happened to her crew
peer gave him a nervous grin maybe
a space-ghost came on board

  you dont really believe those spooky
vovageur stories do you he said toler-
antly

  sure i do-and so will you some day
peer promised him ill tell you a few
true ones just before your next sleep-
period 

  no you wont channok said firmly
aside from space-ghosts though that
crate has a downright creepy look to her
but i suppose id better go over and
check as soon as she slows down enough
so we can latch on and youre going to
stay on the asteroid peer

  in a pigs eye i am peer said in-
g	planet stories

diguantly and though chantiok wished
to know if she had forgotten that he was
the asteroids skipper it turned out that
this was one time hed have to yield

  because channy dear peer said her
big dark eyes welling slow tears id just
die if something happened to you over
there and i was left all alone in space 
all youd have to do channok said
uncomfortably is to head the asteroid
for new gymovaan and you know it
well-youve got to promise to stay right
behind me anyway

  of course promised peer the tears
vanishing miraculously santis says a
wife should always stick with her husband
in space because he might lead her into a
jam all right but nothing like the
  jams shes likely to run
into if she strays around by herself
whereas ships regulation -b says
said channok with grim satisfaction that
crew-member peer gets her mouth washed
out with soap just before the next sleep-
period because of another uncontrolled
lapse into vituperous profanity-and what
was that comment

  that one was under my breath said
peer crestfallen so it doesnt count

without making any particular re-
marks about it both of them had
fastened a brace of guns to their jet-
harnesses at close range-held thirty feet
away against the asteroids ring-bumpers
a set of dock grapnels-t h e ra-
twelves yawning lock looked more than
ever like the black mouth of a cavern in
which something was lurking for them

  channok went over first propelled by
a single squirt of his jets and landed a
little heavier than he had intended to
peer following instructions to keep right
behind him came down an instant later
in the middle of his back they got un-
tangled hurriedly stood up and started
swiveling their helmet beams about the
ra-twelves storage lock

  it was practically empty so was the
big rack that had held the ships single
big lifeboat there were some tools scat-
tered around they kicked at them thought-
fully looked afc each other and started
forward through an open door up a dark

passageway switching their lights ahead
and from side to side

  there was a locked door which prob-
ably led into the ra-tzvelves engine sec-
tion and then four cabins each of which
had been used by two men the cabins
were in considerable disorder but from
what one could tell in a brief look-around
each of the occupants had found time to
pack up about what you would expect a
man to take along when he was planning
on a lifeboat trip so whatever had hap-
pened probably hadnt been entirely un-
expected

   the mess-room all tidied up was next
two locked doors were at the back-of it
and also an open entrance to the kitchen
and food storage they glanced around at
everything briefly and went on to the
control-room

   it was considerably bigger than the one
on the asteroid and luxuriously equipped
the pilots section was in a transparently
walled little office by itself the instru-
ments showed both dardrean and empire
markings and instructions channok
switched the dead drives off first and then
reached out quite automatically for the
spot above the control desk where a
light button ought to be-

   light instantly flooded the interior of the
ra-twelve

  the intruders jumped a foot it was aa
if the ship had suddenly come alive around
them then they looked at each other
and grinned

  automatic channok sighed

  might as well do it the easy way
peer admitted she slid the ophto needle
shed half-drawn back into its holster

the ra-twelve had eighteen ful-
ly charged drive batteries still un-
touched with some system of automatic
power transfer working she could have
gone cruising along on her course for
months to come however she hadnt been
cruising channok discovered next the
speed controls were set to full emer-
gency  an empty ship racing through
space till the battery she was operating
on went dead-

  he shook his head and then peer was
tapping his arm
captives of the thieve-star

  look what i found i think its her
log

  it was a fiat steel box with an illum-
inated tape at its front end on which a
date was printed a line of spidery dar-
drean script was engraved on a plate on
the top of the box

  ltratwelve peer translated thats
her name

  so its a dardrean ship but theyre
using the empire calendar channok
pointed out which would make it an
empire crew    how do you work this
thing if it is her log it might give us
an idea of whats happened

  afterwards channy i just found an-
other door leading off the other end of
the control room-

  the door opened into a second passage
parallel to the one by which they had
come forward but only half as long and
very dimly lit filled with uneasy specu-
lations channok forgot his own instruc-
tions and let peer take the lead

  more cabins her voice said just as
he became aware of the wrecked door-
frame out of which the light was spilling
ahead of her

  a woman had been using that cabin a
woman who had liked beautiful and ex-
pensive things judging by what was
strewn about it looked qiannok thought
as if she hadnt had time to finish her
packing

  her spacesuits gone though peers
voice announced from the interior of a
disordered closet

  channok was inspecting the door this
was the first indication that there had
been any violence connected with what-
ever had happened on the ra-twelve the
door had been locked from without and
literally ripped open from within by a
stream of incandescence played on it by a
gun held probably not much more than a
foot away that woman liad wanted out
in an awful hurry

 peer came over to watch him he
couldnt quite read her expression but
he had a notion she wanted to bawl

  lets take a quick look at the rest of
it and get back to the asteroid he sug-
gested somewhat disturbed himself we
ought to talk this over

  the one remaining cabm lay just be-
yond the point where the passage angled
back into the ship there was light in
that one too and the door was half open
channok got there first and pushed it
open a little farther then he stood frozen
in the door-frame for a moment

  whats stopping you peer inquired
impatiently poking his ribs from behind

  he stepped back into the passage pulled
the door shut all the way scooped her up
and heaved her to his shoulder his space-
boots felt like iron anchors as he clunk-
clunked hastily back through the passages
to the derelicts lock there was nothing
definite to run from any more but he
knew now what had happened on the
ra-tzvclvc and he felt nightmare pacing
after him all the way

  he crossed to the asteroids control
room lock in a jump without bothering
with his jets

fflose the outer lock he told peer

  v hoarsely reaching up for the switch
marked decontaminant above him

  a fourfold  spray of yellowish killall
was misting the trapped air in the lock
about them an instant later

  what was it peers voice came out
of the fog

  antibiotic channok said his scalp
still crawling what you-what voya-
geurs call a lich i think i dont know
that kind but it got the guy in that last
cabin

  the occupant of the last cabin had
looked as if somebody had used a par-
ticularly vicious sort of acid gun on him
which somehow had missed damaging his
clothing to the grisly class of life-forms
that produced that effect an ordinary
spacesuit offered exactly no resistance

  a lich cant last more than an hour
or so in space channy peers voice came
shakily after a pause its a pretty awful
way to get it but that stuff over there
must have been dead for a long time
now

  i know said channok he hesitated
and then cut off the killall spray and
started the blowers to clear the lock i
guess i just panicked for a moment but
im going to go over that ship with de-
	planet

contaminant before we do any more in-
vestigating and meanwhile youd better
get in a few hours of sleep

  wouldnt hurt any peer agreed how
do you suppose the lich got on board

  he could tell her that hed seen a
heavy steel-framed glassite container in
a corner of the cabin opened they must
have been transporting some virulent form
of antibiotic and there might have been
an accident-

  five hours later they had come to the
conclusion that it had been no accident
four hours of that time channok had been
engaged in disinfecting the ra-twelve
even her engine sections hed given the
one man left on board space-burial in one
of the asteroids steel cargo crates the
crate hadnt been launched very far and
presently hung suspended some eighty
yards above the two ships visible as a
black oblong that obscured the stars be-
hind it

  it and its contents were one of the
reasons channok was anxious to get done
with the job of salvaging the rar-twelve
she was a stream-lined beautiful ship
but after what had happened he knew he
would never be able to work up any liking
for her she seemed to be waiting sullenly
and silently for a chance to deal with the
two humans who had dared come on
board her again

  he sealed her up presently filled her
with a fresh airmix and having once more
checked everything he could think of let
peer come over again for a final briefing
on their run to old nameless

  peer wandered promptly into the cabin
where the dead man had been and there
discovered the wall-safe

ill

she called him he couldnt
imagine how he had overlooked it
perhaps because it was so obviously there
it was an ordinary enough safe from what
they could see of the front of it and there
was a tiny key in its lock

  they looked at it thoughtfully

  you didnt try to open it did you
channok inquired

  no said peer because-

stokes

  thats what i was thinking channor
admitted

  there had been they had decided at
least two groups working against each
other in the ship the dead man had been
in charge of the antibiotic perhaps the
woman had been on his side perhaps not
but the eight other men had acted together
and had controlled the ship what action
or threat of theirs had caused the dead
man to release his terrible weapon would
be hard to discover now but he had done
it and the eight men had abandoned the
ra-twelve promptly leaving the woman
locked in her cabin   

  it looked pretty much as if she had been
the one who had switched the drives to
full speed-before jumping out into space
a pretty tough desperate lot all around
in channoks opinion the ra-tzvelves
log offered the information that they had
left dardrea three calendric days earlier
but had been of no further help in identi-
fying crew or passengers that most of
of them were professional criminals how-
ever seemed a pretty safe bet-as peer
had pointed out in voyageur terms ama-
teurs didnt play around with taboo-weap-
ons like a bottled lich

  also amateurs-peer and channok for
example-could have sense enough not to
blunder into a booby-trap   

  hed know of course channok said
reflectively that everybody would be won-
dering whats hidden in that safe and it
could be anything up to and including firil
instructions on how to set up an artificial
culture of antibiotics plenty of govern-
ments would pay twenty times what the
rar-twelve is worth as salvage for that
kind of information but its nothing we
need to know

  not that bad peer agreed

  and the guy who opens that wall-safe
had better be an armaments expert which
were not but now crew-member peer
if we want to get santis cargo cached on
old nameless before i fall asleep we
ought to get started idle curiosity is some-
thing we can satisfy some other time

  two hours past your sleep-period right
now said peer glancing at her wrist-
watch tsk tsk that always makes yon
so grouchy
captives of the thieve-star	

  half an hour later they were on their
way-channok in the rar-twelve peer in
the asteroid keeping as close to each other
as two ships in flight could safely get
with the red glare of the old nameless
sun a trifle off-center before him chan-
nok settled down in the most comfortable
pilot-seat hed ever found on any ship and
decided he could relax a trifle peer was
obviously having a wonderful time doing
her first solo-piloting job on a ship of the
asteroids size and since shed run and
landed the asteroid any number of times
under his supervision he wasnt worried
about her ability to handle it however
he continued to check in on her over the
communicators every five minutes or so
and grinned at the brisk spacemanlike re-
plies he got in return crew-member peer
was on her best behavior right now

  by and by then-he couldnt have said
just when it started-channok began to
realize that some very odd things were
happening around him-

it appeared that the thing he had
put out for burial in a space-crate
hadnt like the idea of being left alone so
it was following him

  channok decided uneasily that it might
be best to ignore it but it kept coming
closer and closer until finally the crate
was floating just outside the ra-twelves
control room port spinning slowly like a
running-down top

  the crate stayed shut but he knew the
thing inside it was watching him

  thats my ship the thing remarked
presently

  channok ignored it

  and youre all alone said the thing-

  no im not said channok peers
with me

  peers gone back to santis said the
thing youre all alone except it ad-
ded for me

  well good-by channok said firmly
there was no point in getting too chum-
my with it he punched the ra-twelves
drives down as far as they would go and
the crate vanished

  how that ship could travel nothing
could hope to keep up with him now-
except perhaps that round red glare of

light just behind the ra-twelve

  that was actually overtaking him and
fast it was coming up like a cosmic police-
ship with a huge hollow noise rushing
before it channok listened apprehensive-
ly suddenly there were words

  whoo-whoool it howled this
is the space ghost i

  he shot up out of his chair like a
jabbed cat knocking it over and glared
around

  the ra-twelves control room lay
brightly lit and silent behind him

  ha-ha peers chuckle came from the
communicator that woke you up i bet
was that you that fell over

  aw-awk breathed channok articu-
lation came back to him all right crew-
member peer just wait till we get to old
nameless ill fix you good

  shall i tell you the story now about
the horror ship from mizar peer in-
quired intrepidly

  go right ahead channok challenged
righting his chair and settling back into it
you cant scare me with that sort of
stuff he began checking their position

  he must have been asleep for quite a
while the nameless system was less than
two hours ahead now he switched on the
front screen and the sun swam up like
a big glowing coal before him he began
checking for the seventh planet

  well he reminded the communicator
grimly you were going to tell me a
story

  the communicator remained silent a mo-
ment

  i dont think i will anyway peer said
then rather quietly

  why not channok inquired getting
bis screen-viewer disentangled from a me-
teor-belt in the nameless system

  i made that space ghost too good
whispered peer im getting scared my-
self now

  aha said channok see what behav-
ing like that will get you he got old
nameless vii into the viewer

  the communicator remained still he
looked over at it

  of course theres really nothing to be -
scared of he added reassuringly

  how do you know quavered peer


planet

stories

im all alone

  nonsense channok said heartily i
can see the asteroid right over there on the
screen  you can see me cant you 
sure said peer thats a long way
off though you couldnt do anything
its not safe for two ships to travel
much closer together channok reminded
her were only two hours from old
nameless right now-im already focussed
on it

  ive been focussed on it for an hour
said peer while you were snoring she
added two hours is an awful long time
tell you what suggested channok
ill race you to it the- ra-twelve s a
mighty fast boat- he checked himself
hed only dreamed that after all

  lets go i peer said briefly

he let peer stay just ahead of
him all the way in though the
streamlined derelict probably could have
flown rings around the asteroid at that
just an hour later they went around old
nameless vii twice braking down and
then coasted into its atmosphere on their
secondary drives

  thats the place peers voice said
suddenly i can see the old mound in the
plain in the evening strip channy-that
straight-up cliff

  he set the ra-tzvelve down first at
the base of a mountain that reared up
almost vertically for eighteen thousand feet
or so out of a flat dimly-lit stretch of
rocky desert land

  the asteroid came down in a very neat
landing two hundred yards away he got
there on the run just as the front lock
opened peer came tumbling out of it into
his arms and hung on fiercely while her
skipper hugged her

  let that scare be a lesson to you he
remarked when he set her down

  it certainly will said peer still
clutching his arm as they started over to
the ra-twelve that old space ghost
had me going

me too he confessed just for a
moment anyway well lets get busy
they went over the ra-twelve again
from bow to stern to make sure there
was nothing they would want to take along

immediately and found there wasnt they
gave the unopened wall-safe a last calculat-
ing regard and decided once more that
theyd better not then they shut off every-
thing closed the front lock behind them
and safetied it with the dock bolts

  the plain was darkening when they came
out but the top of the mountain still
glowed with red light they climbed into
the asteroid and channok closed the lock
he started for the control desk then but
peer beat him to it and anchored herself
into the seat of command with hands
knees and feet it became apparent almost
at once that he couldnt get her out of it
without running the risk of pulling off her
head

  now look here crew-member peer
he said persuasively you know good and
well that if these top-heavy cargo crates
have one weakness its the take-off

  it could be the pilot too peer said
meaningly ive been studying the manual
and ive watched you do it its my turn
now

  he considered her thoughtfully
suppose you die of old age all of a
sudden argued peer wouldnt want
me to sit here alone without knowing even
how to take her off would you

  that did it

  go ahead said channok with dignity
taking a position back of the chair go
right ahead this decrepit old man of
twenty-eight is going to stand right here
and laugh himself sick

  youll be sick all right promised
peer but it wont be from laughing ill
read that chapter out of the manual to
you sometime

  she liad studied it too he decided she
sat perched forward on the edge of the
chair alert and cocky and went through
the starting operations without hitch or
hesitation the asteroid rumbled beneath
them briefly building up power   
channok braced himself-

iv

for the next few seconds the
question seemed to be whether theyd
pile into the plain or the mountain first
and for another improbable moment they
captives of the tmfvrstar	

were distinctly skidding along upside down
then peer got them straightened out and
they soared up rapidly into the night sky
above old nameless

  channoks hair settled slowly back into
place

  peer looked around at him puzzled and
rather pale

  thats not the way it said in the man-
ual she stated

  channok whooped then he sat down
on the floor bent over and yelled

  when he got around to wiping the tears
from his eyes peer was looking down at
him disgustedly from the control chair

  it wasnt the way it said in the manu-
al she repeated firmly were going to
have to have this old crate overhauled be-
fore shell be safe to fly-and if you
werent my husband id really let you
have it now

  he stood up muttering some sort of
apology

  ive done some just as bad he as-
sured her

  hum said peer coldly studying old
nameless in the screen below them it
seemed safe to pat her on the head then
but he kept his hand well out of biting
range

  wed better get back to that moun-
tain and bury the ra-twelve before it gets
too dark to find the spot he suggested

  its still just in sight said peer you
get the guns ready and ill run us past
it slowly

  spaceships being what they were there
wasnt much ceremony about caching the
ra-twelve channok got the bow-turret
out and as peer ran the asteroid slowly
along the mountainside a few hundred feet
above the ra-twelve he cut a jagged line
into the rock with the guns twin beams a
few dozen tons of rock came thundering
down on the ra-twelve

  they came back from the other side
a little higher up and he loosened it some
more this time it looked as if a sizable
section of the mountain were descending
and when the dust had settled the ra-
twelve was fifty feet under a sloping pile
of very natural-looking debris to get her
out again theyd only have to cut a path
down to her lock and start her drives

shed come out of the stuff then like a
trout breaking water   

  satisfied they went off and got the
asteroid on an orbit around old nameless
rot too far out peer had assured channok
that santis investigations had proved the
planet safe for human beings so it prob-
ably was but he knew hed feel more
comfortable if they put in their sleep-
periods outside its atmosphere bathed in
the dismal light of its giant sun oi d
nameless looked like a desolate backyard
of hell it was rocky sandy apparently
waterless and lifeless and splotched with
pale stretches of dry salt seas incon-
gruously delicate auroras went crawling
about its poles like lopsided haloes cir-
cling a squat brooding demon it wasnt
channok decided the kind of planet he
would have stopped at of his own accord
for any purpose

the cliff against which they had
buried the ra-twelve was the loft-
iest section of an almost unbroken chain
of mountains surrounding the roughly
circular hundred-mile plain which was
littered with beds of boulders and sand-
hills like a moon crater what peer had
referred to as the mound lay approx-
imately at the center of the plain it turned
out next morning to be a heavily weath-
ered dome-shaped structure half a mile
high and five miles across which gave the
impression that all but the top tenth of a
giants skull had been buried in the sand
dented here and there with massive ham-
mers and sprinkled thickly with rock dust
it was obviously an artifact-constructed
with hundred-foot bricks as the asteroid
drifted down closer to it channok became
interested

  who built it he asked

  peer shrugged she didnt know santis
spent a few hours jetting around the edges
of it once she said but he wouldnt tell
us much and afterwards he wouldnt let
us get nearer than a mile to it he didnt
go back himself either-said it was dan-
gerous to get too close

   it didnt look dangerous but fifty thou-
sand years ago it might have been a for-
tress of some sort

  you oughtnt to be flying so low over


planet

stories

it even peer said warningly right in
the middle on top is where its the most
dangerous santis said

  channok didnt argue the matter-they
had to get santis special cargo cached
and off their hands first anyway he lifted
the asteroid a mile or so and then brought
her down a couple of miles beyond the
mound at the point peer had designated

  they got out of the ship and gazed
about the broken rocky plain the red
light of the nameless sun was spilling
across it in what passed for morning on
this world in it the black mountain chains
rearing about the horizon and the craggy
waves of flat land had the general effect
of a bomb-shattered and slowly burning
city far off to their left he could see the
upper half of the towering precipice which
marked the ra-twelves resting-place

  how long a time did you say you spent
here he asked

  peer reflected about two terra-
months i guess im not sure though that
was a long time ago my youngest brother
dobby wasnt bom yet

  he shook his head what a spot for a
nice family picnic

  it wasnt a picnic peer said but
my kid brother wilf and i had a lot of
fun anyway just running around and teas-
ing the ghouls i guess you dont notice
so much what a place looks like when
youre little

  teasing the what

  ghouls said peer carelessly

  he looked at her suspiciously but she
seemed to be studying the nearby terrain
for a good spot to start digging

  and what were santis and your moth-
er doing he inquired

  they were looking for some sort of
mineral deposit on old nameless i for-
get just what how about that spot-just
under that little overhang it looks like
good solid top-rock

channok agreed it was just the
place hed got a drilling attachment
mounted to the asteroids small all-pur-
pose tractor and now he went back and
ran the machine down the ramp from the
storage lock he ordered peer who wanted
to help up a rock about twenty feet over-

head where she perched looking like an
indignant elf out of reach of any stray
puffs of the drill-blast then he started
running a slanting narrow tunnel down
under the overhang

  half an hour later when he backed the
tractor out of the tunnel pushing a pile
of cooking slag behind him he saw her
standing up on the rock with a small stun-
gun in her hand she beckoned to him

  channok pulled off his breather-mask
shut off the tractor and jumped from the
saddle

  what is it he called anxiously trot-
ting towards her while the machines clack-
ing and roaring subsided

  some of those ghouls peer called
back climb up here and ill show you
she didnt seem worried

  theyve ducked behind those rocks
now she said as he clambered up beside
her but they wont stay there long
theyre curious and i think some of them
remember the time we were here before

  are they dangerous he inquired pat-
ting his holstered set of heavy-duty reaper
guns

  no said peer they look sort of
awful but you mustnt shoot them if
they get inside of thirty feet ill hit them
in the stomach with a stunner they grunt
then and run santis said that was the
right way to teach them not to get too
nosey

  they waited a moment in silence scan-
ning the rocks

  then channok started violently

  holy    satellites he swore his
hair bristling

  a big dead-white shape had popped up
springily on a rock about fifty feet away
stared at him for an instant out of eyes
like grey glass-platters and popped down
out of sight again awful was right

  aha  crew-member peer gloated grin-
ning you shouldnt have said that to-
night youve got to let me soap out your
mouth

  a light dawned gradually

  you did it on purpose he accused
her you knew id say something like that
the first time i saw one

  peer didnt deny it

  its the soap for you just the same
captives of the thieve-star



she shrugged people ought to have some
self-control-thats what you said look
then another one now-no two

when he came up for
lunch he found about fifty ghouls
collected around the area by that time
he had dug the cache steel-lined it dis-
infected it and installed preservatives a
humidifier and a dowser plate loading it
up would take most of the rest of the
day

  he avoided looking at the local popula-
tion as much as he could while he ate
however the occasional glimpses he got
suggested that the nameless system had
made a half-hearted and badly botched at-
tempt at developing its own type of hu-
manoid inhabitant they had extremely ca-
pable looking jaws at any rate and their
wide lipless mouths were wreathed in per-
petual idiot grins the most completely dis-
agreeable parts of them channok decided
were the enormous red-nailed hands and
feet like fat white gargoyles they sat
perched around the tops of the rocks in
a wide circle and just stared

  sloppy-looking things he remarked
noticing peers observant eyes on him
but at least theyre not trying to strike
up a conversation

  they never say anything until you hit
them in the stomach with a stunner she
informed him then they just grunt and
run

  sure they mightnt get mean about
that the smallest of this lot looks plenty
big enough to take us both apart

  peer laughed all of them together
wouldnt try it theyre real yellow wilf
got mad at a couple of em once and ran em
halfway over to the mound before mother
caught up with him and stopped him wilf
had his blood up that time

  maybe the ghouls built the mound
channok suggested their great-great-
ancestors anyway

  they wont go near it now peer said
following his gaze theyre scared of
that too

  they studied the rugged ungainly
slopes of the huge artifact for a moment

there was something fascinating about
it channok thought perhaps just its size

  santis said the plain was the bottom
of a sea a while ago peer offered so
it could have been some sort of sea-things
that built it

  any entrances into it he asked cas-
ually

  just one right at the top

  you know he said i think id like
to go over and have a look at that thing
before we leave

  no said peer alarmed youd bet-
ter not santis said it was dangerous-
and there is something there we saw a
light one night

  what kind of a light

  like someone walking around the top
of it near that entrance with a big lamp
in his hand peer remembered like he
might have been looking for something
sounds a bit like your old friend the
space ghost channok murmured sus-
piciously

  no peer grinned this was a real
light-and we took off the next evening
santis said it might be as well if we moved
somewhere else for a while

  channok considered a moment look
he said finally we can do it like this ill
jet myself over there and stroll around
it a bit in daylight and if youre worried
you could hang overhead in the asteroid
with a couple of turrets out just in case
someone gets tough

  i could maybe said peer in a tight
voice but im not going to if youre go-
ing to go walking around there after all
santis said im going to be walking right
behind you

  oh no youre not channok said
oh yes i am said peer you cant
make me stay here

he looked at her in surprise her eyes
were angry but her lbwer lip quivered

  hey he said startled maybe im
being a pig

  you sure are peer said relieved the
lip stopped quivering youre not going
over there then

  not if you feel that way about it
channok said he paused i guess he
admitted awkwardly i just didnt like
the idea of santis flitting around space


planet

stories

holy aynstyn knows where and still put-
ting in his two millicredits worth every
so often through crew-member peer
peer blew her nose and considered in
turn just the same she concluded
when santis says something like that
its a lot better if people do it is holy
aynstyn knows where a swear-word
no said channok not exactly

hed finished his lunch and was
just going to suggest they run the
tractor out of the cache and back the few
hundred yards to the asteroid for the first
load of santis cargo when he noticed that
all the ghouls had vanished

  he called peers attention to the fact
uh-huh she said in an absent-minded
tone they do that sometimes  

  channok looked at her she was star-
ing at a high boulder a short distance away
with a queer intent expression as if she
were deep in thought about something he
hoped she wasnt still brooding about their
little argument-

  then she glanced at him gave him a
sudden grin swung herself around and
slid nimbly off the rock

  come on down quick she said i
want to show you something before you
get back to work a ghoul-burrow

  a ghoul-burrow channok repeated
unenthusiastically

  yes sure said peer impatiently
theyre cute theyre all lined with glass
or something she spread her arms wide
jump and ill catch you

  channok laughed flopped over on his
stomach with his legs over the edge of the
rock and slid down in a fair imitation of
peers nonchalant style of descent sprain-
ing his ankle only a little well he hadnt
grown up skipping from craggy moon to
asteroid to heavy-planet to whatnot like
she had   

  they threaded their way about the rocks
to the spot she had been studying she
explained that hed have to climb into the
burrow to get a good idea of what it was
like

  well look now peer channok pro-
tested staring into the big round hole that
slanted downwards under a big boulder-
it did seem to be lined with black glass or

some similar stuff that caves got no
trespassing written all over it supposing
i slide down a half a mile and land in a
mess of ghouls

  no you wont peer said hurriedly
it goes level right away and theyre never
more than thirty feet long and the
ghouls out-theres never more than one
to a burrow and i saw this one pop out
and run off just before we started here
youre not scared are you wilf and i
crawled in and out of hundreds of them
well just for a moment then said
channok resignedly

he got down on hands and knees
and crept into the tunnel after
about six feet he stopped and found he
could turn around without too much trou-
ble peer he called back

  yes said peer

  how can i see anything here chan-
nok demanded peevishly when its all
dark

  well youre in far enough now said
peer who had sat down before the en-
trance of the tunnel and was looking in
after him and now ive got to ask you
to do something you know how i always
promptly carry out any orders you give
me like getting in my full sleep-period and
all she added anxiously

  no you do not channok stated flat-
ly resting on his elbows half the time
i practically have to drag you to the cab-
in anyway whats that got to do with-
its like this peer said desperately
she glanced up for a moment as if she
had caught sight of something in the dim
red sky overhead youve got to stay in
there a while channy

  eh said channok

  when those ghouls pop out of sight
in daytime like that its because theres
a ship or something coming

  peer are you crazy a ship who-
im coming right out

  stay there channy its hanging over
the asteroid right now a big lifeboat
with its guns out-it must be those men
from the ra-twelve i they must have had
a tracer of some sort on her

  then get in here quick peer chan-
nok choked hauling out one of the reap-
captives of the thieve-star



ers you know good and well that bunch
would kill a woman as soon as a man
theyve already seen me-i wanted
them to peer informed him she was
talking out of the side of her mouth look-
ing straight ahead of her away from the
cave im not going to be a woman im
going to be a dumb little girl ordinary
size i can pull that one off any time
but-

  theyll want to ask questions i think
i can get them to send that lifeboat away
we cant fight that channy its a regular
armed launch santis says you can always
get the other side to split its forces if
youre smart about it

 but how-

  and then when i yell here we go
then you pop out thatll be the right
moment- she stood up suddenly we
cant talk any more theyre getting
close- she vanished with that from be-
fore the mouth of the burrow

  hold on there a voice yelled in the
distance a few seconds later as channok
came crawling clumsily up the glassy floor
of the tunnel hampered by the reaper he
still clutched in one hand it seemed to
come from up in the air and it was using
the empires universal dialect

  peers footsteps stopped abruptly

  who you people her voice screeched
in shrill alarm you cops i aint done
nothing

vi

cc a nd just look at those
jl  guns shes carrying the deeper
of the two strange voices commented the
real stuff too- a stunner and an ophto
needle better get them from her if it
isnt a baby flauval

  i didnt shoot nobody lately peer
said trembly-voiced

  no and you aint going to shoot no-
body either the other strange voice mim-
icked her that one was high-pitched and
thin with a pronounced nasal twang to
it chief if therere kids with them its
just a bunch of space-rats that happened
along it couldnt be flauval

  id say it couldnt be flauvalif wed

-planet stories-may

found her dead in her cabin the deep
voice said irritably but that door was
burned out from inside-and somebody
ditched the ratzvclve on this clod it
sounded as if the discovery of peer had
interrupted an argument between them

  i still cant see how she got out nas-
al-voice ezeff said sullenly she must
have been sleeping in her spacesuit we
were out of the ship thirty seconds after
i slap-welded that lock across her door
she must have felt the boat leaving and
started burning her way out the same in-
stant-

  it doesnt matter how she did it said
the deep voice apparently it belonged to
someone with authority if flauval could
think and move fast enough to switch the
drives to full emergency and still get
alive out of a ship full of the yomm she
could cheat space too  she always did have
the luck of the devil if wed had just that
minute to spare before leaving to make
sure-

  it paused a moment and resumed gloom-
ily  that stubborn old maniac of a koyle
-im the dukes man sir committing
suicide-like that-so no one else would
get control of the yomm if we hadnt
managed to start the launchs locators in
time    well i hope ill never have to
sweat out another four days like the last
and now we still have to find whoever
got koyles records

  flauval aint here peer offered at
that point brightly

  there was a pause it seemed that the
two newcomers must have almost forgot-
ten their prisoner for a moment

fihat was that you said
  kid nasal-voice inquired care-
fully

  those space-rats are all half crazy
the deep voice said contemptuously she
doesnt know what were talking about

  sure i know peer said indignantly
you was talking about flauval its wilf
thats the crazy one-i aint and she
aint here flauval

  she aint eh nasal-voice said with
speculative alertness

  no sir peer said timid again shes
went with the rest ofm


planet stories

  both voices swore together in startled
shock

  where are they the deep voice de-
manded hiding on the ship

  no sir quavered peer its just me
on the ship till they come back

  you mean the deep voice said with
strained patience youre supposed to be
on the ship

  yes sir said peer she added in a
guilty mutter sleepin  

  where did the others go nasal-
voice inquired sharply

  but i aint tired said peer well
with the boxes and stuff what flauval
wants buried

  there was another duet of exclamations
which channok at almost any other time
would have considered highly unsuitable
for peers ears right now it escaped his
attention

  shes got koyles records stated the
deep voice then

  whats in those boxes nasal-voice
snapped

  d-d-dont shake me wept peer pa-
pers and stuff-i dont know they dont
never tell me nothing she wailed be-
cause im just a little girl

  yes youre just a little girl said
nasal-voice exasperated youre not go-
ing to get much bigger either

  cut that said the deep voice no
sense scaring the kid

  well youre not figuring on taking
them back are you nasal-voice inquired

  no just flauval the colonel will be
glad to chat with flauval a bit now that
shes turned up alive again koyle may
have told her plenty before we soured
him on her but theres no point in mak-
ing the rest of them desperate its easier
when they surrender

  there was a short pause tlien the deep
voice addressed peer with a sort of ami-
able gruffness

  so they all went off to bury the boxes
but you dont know where they went-
is that it little girl

  oh sure peer said anxious to please
yes sir i know that

  where said both voices together
chorusing for the third time

  its that big mound over there peer

said and channok started nervously its
got a big door on top no she added i
guess you cant see from down here-
and you cant see from the ship thats
why i came out to watch form but you
can see it plain from the top of the rocks
that would be the old reservoir or
whatever it was we passed back there
said the deep voice

  thats right said peer thats just
what flauval called it at lunch the word
you said there was water there oncet
she said they flew the boxes over with
jets but theyll be back before its dark
they said

  there was a brief silence

  scares me when its dark it does
grumbled the idiot-child

  well that ties it up the deep voice
said satisfied its the exact kind of stunt
flauval would try but shes outsmarted
herself this time

ffttow do you figure on handling
 xjl it nasal-voice inquired

  get up on one of those rocks with the
kid where you can watch both that mound
and the lock of their ship yes i know
its more trouble that way-but dont ah
do anything conclusive about the-uh-
aforementioned before weve corralled the
rest much more useful while capable of
inhaling hostage possibilities induce-
ment to surrender

  uh-huh nasal-voice said comprehen-
dingly

  yes sir added peer

  there was another short pause

  might as well skip the circumlocu-
tions the deep voice continued barely
human ill send a couple of men through
the ship and if its empty ill leave one
of them in the forward lock where you
can see him thats just in case anyone
slips past us and comes back the rest of
us will go over to the reservoir in the
launch if the entrance is where she says
it is weve got them bottled if it looks
right well go in

  thatll be only four of you said na-
sal-voice no three-youre keeping one
at the launch-guns arent you

  yes of course hey little girl-how
many are with flauval
captives of the thieve-star



  of us you mean peer asked

  of what else snarled nasal-voice
now dont get her so scared she cant
talk the deep voice reproved thats
right little girl-how many of you
well theres me sniffled peer and
my old man and my big brother dobby
and then theres wilf-thats all but
i dont like wilf

  i dont like wilf either agreed nasal-
voice four against three chief  it might
be safer to bring over the two from the
ra-twelve first-no point in searching her
anyway now that we know where the
records are

  no said the deep voice flauval
could just happen to decide to come out
in the few minutes were gone its sewed
up too neatly right now well have the
heavy guns from the launch and well
give them a chance to surrender flauv-
als too intelligent to pass that up-she
never stops hoping the chances are there
wont be any shooting till afterwards
any friends of hers are likely to be
tough nasal-voice warned

  very tough said his chief like the
kid there you worry at the wrong times
my boy a parcel of space-rats that hap-
pened along he swore again that wo-
mans unbelievable luck well take care
of yourself ezeff im off keep your
eyes open both ways just in case-

vii

there was silence for a

moment then footsteps came
crunching over the rocks towards the
ghoul-burrow and channok got set but
the footsteps halted a few yards away

  thats the one i was sitting on peer
volunteered nice easy one to climb
yeah i never saw a nicer looking
rock nasal-voice said sourly weve got
to climb it too im not trying any point-
landings with jets get on up there then
before i boot you up

  there were sounds of scrambling
dont you move now peer said sud-
denly

  what are you talking about  de-
manded nasal-voice

  durn rock come loose muttered peer

near flung me off

  but channok meanwhile had got the
idea and settled back it was not yet the
right moment   

  there were more scrambling sounds and
some breathless swearing from ezeff who
obviously had not spent his formative
years in asteroid-hopping either but at
last all become quiet

  and here we are peers voice floated
down clearly a small chunk of rock
dropped right in front of the burrows en-
trance like a punctuation mark

  sit still blast you said nasal-voice
badly out of breath

  a large dim shadow swept silently over
the ground before the ghouls burrow just
then that would be the launch going to-
wards the mound a prolonged silencf
overhead confirmed the impression

  they want to give flauval a surprise
peer inquired meekly at last

  rather startlingly nasal-voice laughed
they sure do he agreed thats a
good one yes sir they sure do

  flauvals nice dont you think con-
tinued peer conversationally picking up
courage

  depends a lot on how you look at it
nasal-voice said dreamily shes a real
pretty thing anyhow that flauval luck
of the devil shes had too but its got to
run out sometime

  there was another silence then peer
remarked

  boy he set that launch down nice
right quick spang on top of the-what
the big guy said it was on the mound
weve got a good pilot nasal-voice
agreed flauvals going to get her sur-
prise in just a minute now

  and there they come out of the
launch continued peer one two three
four all four of them marching right
down into the mound

  youve got sharp eyes nasal-voice
acknowledged but thats funny he con-
tinued worriedly one of them was to
stay with the guns

  and now look at the launch cried
peer in a high bright voice getting
pulled right into the mound

  nasal-voice was making loud choking
sounds
	planet

  what was that he screamed then
whats happened whats that over
there

  let go my arm cried peer dont
pull it-youre pushing me off here we
gol

a small avalanche of weath-
ered rock came down before the
burrows mouth as channok shot out
through it into the open he looked up in
what looked like an inextricable tangle of
arms and legs peer and nasal-voice were
sliding and scuffling down the steep side
of the rock together nasal-voice was try-
ing to hang on to the rock but peer was
hanging on to him and jerking like a
hooked fish whenever he got a momentary
hold

  she looked down and saw channok put
her boots into the small of nasal-voices
back pushed off and landed two yards
from channok on hands and feet he
flattened himself back against the boulder
while nasal-voice skidded down the rest
of the way unaided wisely refraining from
triggering his jets in the position he was
in they simply would have accelerated
his descent to a fatal degree

  he arrived more or less on his feet
peer bounced up and down before him
her finger pointed like a small lunatic

  surprise she screamed surprise
like flauval got when you locked her
in her cabin and ran off with the launch
so shed have to jump out into space

   thats right kid nasal-voice panted
softly fumbling for his gun without tak-
ing his eyes off her he looked somewhat
like a white-faced lunatic himself just
then dont get scared kid dont run
off i wont shoot

  he pulled the gun out suddenly

  but channok had taken two soft steps
forward by then and he had only to
swing the reaper was clubbed in his
right hand and he brought the butt end
down on the top of nasal-voice ezeffs
skull-tight flying cap as if he were trying
to ram a stake through the surface rock
of old nameless

wftthat happened over there on the
vv mound he inquired in a voice

stories

that kept wanting to quaver he was hur-
riedly pulling on nasal-voices flight suit

  heres his goggles said peer also
shakily tell you tonight about the
mound but santis was right

  thats what it sounded like channok
admitted he slipped on the goggles do
i look like this ezeff now

  not very much peer said doubtfully
you still got that nose and that jaw
better hold me close up to your face ill
put on a good act

  all right as soon as i set you down
in the lock jump past the guard and yell
or something if he looks after you we
mightnt have to kill this one he held out
his arms hop up wed better get
started before those last two on the ra-
twelve decide to come over

  peer hopped up channok wrapped his
right arm carefully around her they
looked at each other thoughtfully for a
moment

   all set he asked

  sure said crew-member peer she
smiled faintly

   he triggered the jets with his left hand
and they shot upwards peer drew a deep
breath

  quit bossing me around all the time
you big lug she yelled suddenly she
reached up for that nose and gave it a
good yank

   all right channok muttered startled
you dont have to be so realistic he
cant even see us yet

  just because youre biggern me 
shrieked peer as they soared over the top
of the rocks into view of the asteroids
lock she hooked a smart right to chan-
noks left ear

  cut that out now peer he ordered
futilely

  he was lightly battered all around by
the time they reached the asteroids lock
though the act did get them in safely
but then-whether it was the nose or the
jaw-the instant he dropped peer to her
feet the guard stopped laughing and
brought a gun out and up faster than
channok ever had seen a man produce one
before however the reaper had been
ready in his hand all the time so with a
safe fraction of a second to spare it
captives of the theve-star



talked first-

  the glare of the discharge seemed about
fifty times brighter than normal

  hit the floor channy he heard
peers shout

  he hit it without thought dropping over
the dead guards legs   

  sound rammed at him enormously
roared on and began banging itself about
and away among distant mountains the
asteroids floor had surged up ponderous-
ly settled back quivered a bit and become
stable again

  an earthquake channok muttered
sitting up dazedly was exactly all we
needed right now

  that wasnt any earthquake said
peer standing pale-faced above him get
up and look

long veils of stuff presumably sol-
id chunks of mountain were drifting
down the distant towering face of the
cliff at the foot of which they had buried
the ra-twelve rising to meet them its
source concealed beyond the horizon of
the plain was the slow grey cloud of some
super-explosion

  i guess he said slowly one of those
two must have got curious about koyles
wall-safe

  we were pretty smart about that nod-
ded peer

  we were for once channok agreed
he was looking around for something to
sit down on quietly when he caught sight
of the dead guard again he started vio-
lently

  almost forgot about him i guess now
ill have to bury him and that ezeff the
first thing maybe this one is carrying
something that will show who they were

  he found something almost instantly-
and he was glad then that peer was still
watching the oily writhings of the cloud
across the plain it was in a flat steel case
he took out of one of the dead mans pock-
ets the identification disk of a member
of the imperial secret service-

  the service

  and they would have murdered us he
thought shocked they were going to do
it

  he turned the guard over on his back

a big muscular young man with a look of
sudden purpose and confidence still fixed
on his face it was the same face as the
one on the disk

  channok put the disk back in its case
and shoved the case into the dead mans
pocket he stood up feeling rather sick
peer turned around from the lock and re-
garded him reflectively for a moment

  you know channy she stated care-
fully if you cant help it it doesnt
count

  he looked back at her i guess not
he said-and suddenly for a moment he
could see four men marching one after
the other down into the mound of
course it doesnt count he told her firm-
ly

hey worked hard rat
shifting the cargo into the cache
but the nameless sun was beginning to
slide down behind the mountains before
they were finished and by the time chan-
nok had rammed the tunnel full of rocks
with the tractor and cemented them into
a glassy plug with the drill-blast and scat-
tered a camouflaging mess of boulders over
everything only a foggy red glow over 
the mountain crests half obscured by the
lingering upper drifts of the explosion of
the ra-twelve remained of the day

  there was no moon but the sky had
come full of stars big and little over the
opposite section of the plain and so there
was light enough to make out the dark
hump of the mound in the distance every
time channok looked in that direction the
low sinister pile seemed to have edged a
little closer and he looked as often as
his work gave him a chance to do it
santis might have been right in stating
that the mound wasnt dangerous if you
didnt get too close to it-but the instant
he suspected there might be something go-
ing on over there channok was going to
hop off the tractor grab up peer and get
off old nameless at the best speed he and
the asteroid could produce

  however the mound remained quiet
with everything done he gave peer a last
ride back to the asteroid on the tractor
	planet

ran it up the ramp into the storage section
and closed the rear lock then they dis-
covered theyd left their lunch containers
lying- among the rocks

  if hed been alone channok would have
left them there but peer looked so matter-
of-fact about it that he detached the trac-
tors headlight and started back with her
on foot it was only a couple of hundred
yards and they found the con-
tainers without any difficulty the mound
seemed to have moved a little closer again
but not too much he gave it only a casual
glance this time

  where are your friends the ghouls
he inquired shining the light around the
rocks as they started back the grisly
creatures had put in a few cautious ap-
pearances during the afternoon but their
nerves seemed to have suffered even more
than his own from all that had happened

  the ghouls always hit their burrows
at sundown peer explained theyre not
like the story ones

  what do they find to eat around here 
channok inquired

  some sorts of rocks theyve got no
real teeth but their mouth is like a grinder
inside most of the rest of their insides
too santis said i had a tame one i used
to pitch stones at and hed snap em up
but all that werent blue hed spit out
the blue ones went right down-you could
hear them crunching for about a foot
what a diet channok commented
then he stopped short- say peer if
they bite like that they could chew right
into our cache

  they wont said peer come on
how do you know channok asked
following her

  they cant bite through a good grade
of steel-alloy and they dont like its
taste anyhow santis said so

well it had been santis this
and santis that for quite a while
now peers father seemed to be on rec-
ord with a definite opinion on just about
everything and what made him think he
knew what a ghoul liked to chew on

  perhaps channok couldnt be blamed too
much he was dog-tired and dirty and
hungry hed killed his first two men that

stomes

day and not in fair fight either but with
an assassins sneak thrusts from behind
and by trickery and hed buried them too
hed seen the shining iss disclose itself
in action as something very tarnished and
ugly and a salvaged ship worth a fortune
go up in a cloud of writliing grey smoke

  there had been a number of other things
-close shaves that had felt too close
mostly

  at any rate channok stated in flat
unequivocal terms that he didnt wish to
hear anything else that santis had said
not ever

  youre taking the wrong attitude
peer informed him frowning santis is
a very smart man he could teach you a
lot

  what makes you think i want to learn
anything from a space-rat channok in-
quired exasperated

  peer stopped short that was a dirty
thing to say she said in a low furious
voice im not talking to you any more

  she drew away till there was a space
of about six feet between them and
marched on briskly towards the aster-
oid looking straight ahead

  channok had to hurry to keep abreast of
her he watched her in the starlight for a
few moments from the comers of his
eyes he probably shouldnt have used that
term-the half-pint did look good and
mad i

  tsk tsk he said disturbed

  peer said nothing she walked a bit
faster channok lengthened h i s stride
again

  whos my nice little girl friend he
inquired wheedlingly

  shuddup growled peer

  she climbed into the asteroid ahead of
him and disappeared while he sealed the
locks the control room was dark but
he felt she was around somewhere he
switched on the power and the instru-
ments familiar dim pools of green and
pink gleamings sprang up in quick se-
quence like witchfire quivering over the
control desk perhaps it wasnt an excep-
tionally beautiful sight but it looked home-
like to channok like fires lighting up on
a hearth

  well lets see you handle this take-
captives of the thieve-star	

off he invited the shadows around him
briskly this time there werent any moun-
tains nearby to worry about

  you handle it peer said from behind
his shoulder its my turn to laugh

  she did too a few minutes later-loud
and long after hed got over the first
shock of narrowly missing the mound
channok gave a convincing imitation of a
chagrined pilot and indignantly blamed the
asteroid   

hed guided them halfway out
of the nameless system when she
came behind the control chair in the dark
wrapped her arms in a stranglehold around
his neck and fondly bit his ear

  cut it out channok choked

  just the same stated peer loosening
her grip a trifle youre not so smart like
santis is

  im not eh

  no said peer but santis said you
would be some time that channoks go-
ing to make a real spacer he said just
give him a chance to catch on 

  well channok muttered secretly flat-
tered well hope he was right

  and anyway said peer i love
you just as much

  well thats something too channok
admitted he was beginning to feel very
much better

  and guess what ive got here peer
said tenderly

  what

  a nice soapy cloth for what you said
when you saw the first ghoul so just
open that big trap right up now channy
he couldnt tell in the dark but it
tasted like shed taken the trouble to mix
something extra foul into the soap lather
too

  and after youve stopped spitting bub-
bles said crew-member peer who was
switching on all lights to observe that part
of the business ill tell you what i saw
on the mound

  channok shuddered

  if you dont mind peer he suggested
soapily lets wait with that till were a
lightyear or two farther out

nick pappas hired-klller from callisto was strictly out for pap-
pas-out for number one as they used to say and now those
fools in the vanishing spaceship thought that number was up

the cabin whirled around them    the gun fell free   

blind play

nick pappas had just

crossed to the instrument panel of	

the tang chuh-chihs lifeboat m

when he heard a sound behind him he chan	is

turned quickly	

he had left the airlock between the	-

lifeboat and the ship open that had been

blind

play



stupid he realized but it was too late to
correct it now one of the tangs two
other crew members was approaching
down the corridor just beyond the air-
lock if he saw the doors slide shut now
hed be immediately suspicious that would
leave pappas inside the lifeboat and be-
fore he could drain enough fuel from the
ships tanks into the lifeboats the other
two could have the airlock cut open

  he still had a chance to hide-but be-
fore he could propel himself to the other
end of the lifeboat out of sight arne
birkerod appeared at the other side of
the open airlock

  birkerod smiled pappas stood still
gripping the pilots seat in front of him

  hello arne said pappas i was just
checking over the-

  good morning nick-or good even-
ing if you like lets go up to the control
cabin and see garcia

  for a very brief moment pappas con-
sidered although the tang was in free
fall he was very conscious of the weight
of the gun concealed inside his jacket he
might use it now but the sound would
bring garcia better to bluff it through
the other two might not be suspicious
yet and in a pinch he had the advantage
that they werent armed sure he said
and pushed himself across to where birke-
rod stood

  after you said birkerod much more
politely than usual

pappas smiled uncertainly he planted
both feet against the side of the air-
lock opening then jumped off he floated
down the ships corridor to where it took
a sharp bend there he grabbed a rung of
a ladder bolted to the corridor wall

  birkerod had pushed off harder than
pappas had he arrived at the ladder at
the same time after you he said again

  pappas saw at the end of the long cor-
ridor ahead the open door to the control
cabin he pushed off in that direction

  yusuf garcia was in the ships pilots
seat garcia was half brazilian and half
malagasy his eyes had a strong green
tint which looked strange against the deep
brown-black of his face pappas had al-

ways been a little afraid of him and the
present situation didnt help that any
there was a gun in garcias hand

  birkerod followed pappas in taking a
seat facing garcia what did you find
yusuf he asked casually

  well arne i havent finished check-
ing up on our little conjecture the cal-
culator over there is still working on it
but while i was waiting i looked through
our friend pappass locker you may al-
ready have noticed what i found he
waved the gun where did you find our
friend by the way

  birkerod smiled first place i looked
  the lifeboat

  yeah

  what was he doing

  nothing i think i know how our little
conjectures going to turn out though
he turned to pappas who had followed
the exchange tensely cyou know nick
my father was a fellow-countryman of
yours back on earth

  countryman

  thats right he lived just north of
winnipeg my mother was a canadian
too both of them were in the second batch
of colonists that left for callisto but it
doesnt mean much to call you a canadian
any more does it garcia and you and i
were all callistans now

  sure said pappas wondering

callisto a cold world a small
new world and a cold world and in-
credibly distant from the planet that had
evolved its settlers

  in the thirty years since the explora-
tion of jupiters satellites had begun cal-
listo had had a very different history from
the rest on ganymede a hundred or so
engineers had been working all that time
on the tremendous task of raising the satel-
lites mean temperature to the point where
an atmosphere could be provided and open-
air cities and farms built in which earth-
men could live the smaller satellites had
been largely ignored but it had been
found that callisto had large deposits of
ore of such quality that in spite of the
tremendously long haul required to car-
ry anything from there to the inner plan-

stories

ets it was worth while beginning mining
operations up went the insulated airtight
domes out came the colonists down went
the mine shafts -

  it was a hard life crystalline rock was
cut by machines at the mine-faces and by
the time other machines had brought it
up the shafts to the surface-level in the
domes it had become amorphous and
powdery its crystalline structure destroyed
by being heated to twenty degrees below
zero centigrade when you repaired ma-
chinery below the surface you wore sixty
kilograms of spacesuit earth weightand
a failure of any item of equipment or a
fumble by any member of your crew might
mean sudden death the walls of the dome
shut you in from the sky for the vacuum
out there was death too when you did get
up to the observatory to see the sky you
saw jupiter weirdly streaked with bril-
liant color-if your dome was on the side
of callisto toward jupiter otherwise you
looked across twenty million kilometers of
vacuum to the nearest star

  it was a hard life and no life for a
lone wolf there were no homestead farms
to be settled by lonely pioneer families
callisto was a sterile place and to keep
life going there at all men had to work to-
gether cooperation was a lesson earth
civilization had learned only after thou-
sands of years of oppression and war a
lesson that had to be learned before men
could cross space and a lesson that was
very difficult to forget on callisto at
least for most people

  rita and cliff belden had control of the
trade between callisto and the inner plan-
ets it didnt start as control though the
way it began was this once the colony
had been well established its operation
was left completely up to the callistans
who shipped as much of their goods to
earth as they could manage and requis-
itioned as much food and supplies from
earth as they needed-which was really
the best way the inner planets could not
very well take part in the planning of
callistos activities since there was no
radio contact and the trip took over two
months by freighter even when the rela-
tive positions of the planets in their or-

bits was most favorable one freighter
shuttled back and forth between no 
dome on callisto at one end and any of
several inner-pianet ports at the other
rita and cliff belden were the two calhs-
tans whose job it was to run that freighter

  the little colony was absolutely de-
pendent on the supplies they brought this
fact was obvious to everybody but the
beldens made a deduction from it which
was unprecedented on callisto they could
threaten to withhold the supplies and
thereby force the rest of the colonists to
agree to whatever they asked-provided
they could make the threat stick they
made the attempt on one of their trips
back from earth they put the ship into
an orbit around callisto instead of land-
ing and announced they would not land
until their henchmen on callisto were in
control

  and the henchmen did a thorough job
of taking control all the details were
taken care of they quickly seized the
radio transmitters that maintained con-
tact with ganymede they confiscated all
the reserves of spaceship fuel they could
find they clamped down as tightly as they
could on communiation between the
domes then they started keeping a close
check on every tool that could be used as
a weapon there was just one place they
slipped up their search for fuel wasnt
good enough

  the people of no  dome pooled the
fuel they had hidden from the beldens
they seized from the beldens guards the
domes tiny spaceship which had been
assembled n callisto and which had never
been intended to leave the jupiter sys-
tem  and they sent the ship off for venus
with garcia and birkerod aboard venus
was the only possible destination with
the planets positions in their orbits as
they were then to reach earth or mars
would have taken either more fuel than
they had or much more time than they
could spare

  as it was the trip took eight months

  on venus there was no hitch garcia
and birkerod went to the liaison office in
kreingrad as planned and were provided
with the tang chuh-chih with a load of
bund play



supplies-and with niok pappas a for-
mer callistan who wanted to return there
they followed the liaison offices sugges-
tion and took pappas aboard

were au callistans now birke

  w rod repeated i wonder nick
how did you happen to leave callisto in
the first place just felt like visiting good
old saskatchewan i doubt it lets see-
you left before that business started with
the beldens didnt you

  pappas licked his lips nervously gar-
cia answered for him yes about ten
months before according to what they told
us on venus

  yeah birkerod mused you know
the beldens of course

  yes said pappas of course i came
to earth pn their freighter

  not their freighter garcia put in
callistos freighter which they were op-
erating its only more recently that its
become their freighter

  birkerod smiled and went on its in-
teresting mr pappas that you left cal-
listo about the time the beldens plans
must have been taking shape i wonder
why you did

  pappas ignored the question a moment
before the red signal light had flashed on
above the calculator set in the opposite
bulkhead the computations had been fin-
ished on garcia and birkerods little
conjecture

  garcia who was closest to the ma-
chine filled in the silence lets find out
what the calculator has to say it may
clear things up a little

  there was a row of spring-clamps set
in the bulkhead next to him for holding
objects stationary while the ship was in
free fall garcia put his gun in one of
these slipped out of the safety belt that
had held him in the pilots seat in spite
of the lack of gravity and turned to the
calculator

  pappas sprang not toward garcia-
but toward the side of the cabin that would
have been the ceiling if there had been an
up he snatched his gun from his jack-
et

  something crashed into pappas spun

him around birkerod had jumped too
hitting him hard in midair

the cabin whirled about them he
felt birkerods powerful grip around
the hand which held the gun simultane-
ously they reached the ceiling pappass
head hit metal with a crack the gun fell
free weightless the two of them wrestled
desperately

  suddenly birkerod pulled loose and
jumped away pappas found himself alone
in the middle of the cabin drifting slowly
from the pilots seat

  in the pilots seat garcia was again sit-
ting calmly his gun leveled birkerod had
the other gun there was silenoe while
pappas reached the bulkhead pushed back
to his seat and belted himself in

  garcia said suppose i try answering
some of these questions when arne and
i left callisto the beldens learned our
orbit and high-tailed in to the inner plan-
ets with plenty of fuel they arrived be-
fore us and got you their agent on the
job you got yourself included in our re-
turn trip on the tang then you calculated
an orbit for us that would run us smack
into earth at a relative velocity of thirty-
odd kilometers a second

  the next thing was to divert the fuel
from the tangs tanks to the lifeboats
and take off yourself in the lifeboat that
would have left us in a collision orbit
with no fuel to pull ourselves out of it

  not such a good plan nick you
should have planned just to kill us both
as soon as the tang was in space youd
have had a better chance that way your
overeagerness to compute our orbit just
didnt look natural

  no listen pappas protested feebly
i didnt calculate a collision orbit i-
sorry said garcia thats what the
machine just finished checking for us the
orbit were on meets earth dead center
and it wouldnt take us to callisto even if
earth wasnt there arne-whatll we do
with this character

  birkerod smiled i like the suggestion
you made when we discussed it before

  i was just joking

  no i think its the best idea he


planet stories

turned to pappas who flinched in spite
of himself look nick the beldens have
no chance of winning on callisto no
chance men had to learn to cooperate be-
fore they could get to the planets at all
and by this time theyve learned good and
thoroughly the individual whos out for
himself is an anachronism you and the
beldens-a hundred years ago youd have
felt right at home then everybody was
out for a fast buck as they used to say
in this century everybody works together
and darn near everybody likes it that way

  but nick the beldens are still dan-
gerous they cant win but they can hold
up the development of callisto for years
and make the callistans plenty miserable
in the process the inner planets wont in-
terfere their policy for years has been
this callisto is so far away that its their
concern how they run things well send
them supplies theyll send us minerals
and thats that

  so the people of callisto have got to
lick the beldens this ship is absolutely
essential because its the means of break-
ing the beldens monopoly we have to
get to callisto and when we get there
well be in the middle of a pretty critical
situation the tang will be just as essen-
tial to the beldens as to us for the oppo-
site reason

  therefore garcia put in we cant
afford to have you around

  what are you going to do pappas
murmured

  to you said birkerod well we
cant take you with us we dont want to
kill you if we can help it we cant turn
you loose in the lifelxdat even if we keep
most of the fuel because we may need the
lifeboat on callisto theres one thing
left

  if its all right with yusuf were go-
ing to put you altogether completely on
your own youre not going t be working
for anybody else not even for stinkers like
the beldens youre going to be all by
yourself and youre going to have to do
a good job of looking out for yourself
not for anyone else just for nick pap-
pas-number one as people used to
say were not going to give you a word

of advice either if we did you wouldnt
be independent enough how does it
sound yusuf appropriate

  garcia smiled sounds about right
arne maybe im too angry at the beldens
to think straight but it sounds like a pret-
ty appropriate way to handle mr pap-
pas hell be all on his own and if he
doesnt work things out just right-hell
get the most spectacular finish any indi-
vidualist could ask for

nick pappas hung weightless in
interplanetary space

  ten meters away floated the tang
chuh-chih one side of it glared white in
the sunlight the other side was jet black
visible only as a shadow across the stars
it floated there motionless very close to
him but he knew he didnt dare to try
to reach it because it was going to start
accelerating any second

  the faceplate of pappass spacesuit
fogged slightly he moved a hand inside
the suit adjusted the humidity control
when the faceplate had cleared he saw
that the tangs rockets were already fir-
ing

  the ship still floated there within shout-
ing distance if there had been an atmos-
phere but now from its jets there ex-
tended long perfectly straight streaks of
shimmering blue-violet it seemed to pap-
pas as though he was drifting slowly par-
allel to the ship in the direction of the
jets pie shook his head to get rid of the
illusion he was remaining perfectly still
the ships hull was sliding past him when
the jets were abreast of him they cut
off he watched the ship receding rapidly
now a minute or so later there were two
short blasts on the steering jets pappas
realized they were swinging the ship
around so he wouldnt be caught in the
rocket blast then the main jets started
up again

  pappas followed the ship with his eyes
as long as he could distinguish it-which
wasnt long then he was alone

  not only were there no walls around
him there wasnt even anything under his
feet there was nothing anywhere

  so this was what all that talk added
blind

play



up to pappas thought they simply set
me out here in the middle of the vacuum
to stay until the suits food and air give
out

  he thought he might as well make him-
self at home he checked over the suit
it was nicely equipped in addition to
standard items there were several things
strapped onto the back of the suit on the
outside which pleased him until he rea-
lized how little difference they made
there was a reel of light strong cable
with magnetic grapples which could be
clamped onto it there was a hand reac-
tion motor the size of a stillson wrench
and ten containers of fuel each the size
of a fountain pen there was a large mir-
ror for signaling also for the same pur-
pose there was a powerful highly direc-
tional searchlight he checked the cells
which powered it they were low but he
knew they were charging at that moment
from the sunlight falling on them the
searchlight would work for what that
was worth

  so much for his suit next where was
he his position couldnt be given in lati-
tude and longitude because there wasnt
anything for it to be latitude and longi-
tude on he was somewhere between the
orbits of venus and earth the direction
of the sun he could tell by glancing at the
arm of his spacesuit and seeing where
the sunlight fell-the sun was behind him
and to the right and a little downward

  as for the earth that would be the
next brightest body in his sky he craned
his head in all directions searching then
he took out the hand reaction motor and
gave a blast to start himself spinning so
he could search in the directions he hadnt
been able to see in before even the short
blast he used made the motor tug at his
hand and started the universe whirling
around him frighteningly he turned the
control on the motor down as low as it
would go then pressed the button several
more times finally he had canceled out
most of his rotation and the milky way
was wheeling calmly about him he got
himself oriented again and after a short
time had identified earth which was close
enough to appear as a blue-green disk

earth a thought suddenly struck
him the tang-had been heading
straight for earth when it had let him off
he was still going exactly in the tangs
former orbit he would reach earth
there was one more thing he should
check-yes he had a parachute it was
on the back of his spacesuit underneath
the gear hed investigated before now if
he could land safely he was all set birke-
rod and garcia must not have thought of
this

  one thing still bothered him he had
been headed for earth when he was put
off the tang but had anything happened
since to put him off course how about
those times hed used the reaction motor
to set himself spinning well the sev-
eral small blasts would probably not have
had any net effect on his direction of mo-
tion and if they had there wasnt any-
thing to be done about it but the single
strong blast at the beginning-he could
remember which constellation hed been
facing at the time where hed held the
reaction motor and how strong a blast
hed given that meant he could give an
approximately equal blast now in the op-
posite direction this he did being care-
ful to aim directly away from his center
of gravity so as not to start spinning
again

  now he should be back on course he
figured assuming that is that hed ever
been off the small thrust of his reaction
motor applied for such a short time
might not be enough to make any appre-
ciable difference as to where he ended up
he didnt bother trying to calculate it

  nothing to do now but wait he spent
the time thinking about what hed do
when he got to earth it was hard to fig-
ure hed had a racket on earth for the
year-and-a-half after the beldens brought
him there everyone had assumed he was
doing something important to callistos
welfare and all hed had to do was go
through the motions now he didnt know
it was probably true that the beldens
were through with the tang chuh-chih
arriving on callisto the odds were against
them

  hed have to find something else pap-
	planet

pas decided this whole belden business
was pretty provincial anyway and as for
birkerod garcia and those people-i
pappas dismissed callisto from his
thoughts completely there would have to
be some angle on the inner planets

  after several hours of thought on the
subject he took stock of his situation
again the disk of earth was a little
larger he thought but not enough so
youd notice it he pulled the semi-opaque
visor over his faceplate and went to sleep

e slept for ten days

not earth days however when pap-
pas went to sleep the sun was behind him
he thought he had eliminated his rota-
tion but actually he was tumbling head
over heels extremely slowly thus for
him the sun rose between his feet and
set directly above him

  the eleventh of these sunrises woke
him he stayed awake because as soon
as he flipped his visor up and looked
around him the earth caught his eye it
was much closer he did not know how to
measure its angular diameter so he
couldnt calculate his distance from it even
approximately but it looked enormous

  how long had his nap lasted the
spacesuits chronometer was running its
minute hand indicated  its hour hand
 its day hand  that would have told
him how long hed slept if hed read the
chronometer before he went to sleep but
he hadnt all he knew was that hed slept
much longer than hed expected and long
enough to get painfully stiff

  in any case hed covered a lot of dis-
tance as much as the tang would have
covered in the same time he realized he
was approaching earth pretty fast

  too fast he added aloud nervously
hed have to decelerate before he got
there or the parachute wouldnt do him any
good now was it time yet to start decel-
erating if he directed the hand reaction
motor in the wrong direction now could
it cause him to miss earth he guessed
not the planet looked so close any small
sidewise push he gave himself could
hardly hurt once he killed his speed
earths gravitational field would gather

stories

him in

  pappas took out the reaction motor us-
ing low power he turned himself till he
faced earth the planet seemed to have
swelled just in the time since hed waked
up he set the reaction motor to full pow-
er grasped it with both hands held it in
front of his chest and pointed it straight
at earth then he pressed the button and
held it down

  the force of the hand jet pushed in at
his midriff made his legs and head swing
forward well that was okay as long as
they didnt get into the exhaust he
stopped blasting a moment to get a better
grip on the reaction motor then fired con-
tinuously occasionally he would find hed
started himself spinning then hed shift
the motor just a trifle to keep himself
facing the planet he kept the button firm-
ly pressed down and the cylinder in his
hands sent a continuous jet of intense blue
toward earth when the first fuel cart-
ridge was exhausted he put in the sec-
ond and kept it up

  twice he stopped for a food pellet and
a little water the rests were welcome
his arms and chest were stiff and aching
but he didnt rest long because he was
getting really scared now he was sure
he was dangerously close to his destina-
tion and his speed hadnt been cut enough
the continents and oceans of earths day
side were clearly visible and grew notice-
ably larger as he looked at them

  he now thought of the direction he was
going as down he thought of himself as
jailing

  something bothered him america had
not been in sight a while ago but now he
could see a corner of brazil appearing at
the edge of the disk of earth did that
mean he was passing by earth instead of
falling straight at it no he realized in
a moment it just meant earth was rotat-
ing for he could see that the sunset line
the line between night side and day side
had not changed its apparent position on
the disk

  no he was still falling and he was
falling too fast

  a suspicion began to form that birkerod
and garcia had anticipated this and
bund

suddenly terrifyingly he thought of what
garcias last remark might have meant

  still theyd said there was a way he
could save himself and the only way he
could think of was to break his fall he
had a certain quantity of fuel to do it
with and he was using it he was using
it for all it was worth no matter how
much his body ached with fatigue if
those two on the tang had figured this
all out ahead of time then they must
have left him enough fuel to avoid being
killed otherwise they might as well have
shot him on the tang okay if he had
enough fuel hed use it all

one after another the fuel
cartridges burned out pappas longed
for another rest but he didnt dare take
one now he kept firing and still the
earth kept growing larger and brighter
below him finally there was no more
fuel

  after a short breather pappas took the
reaction motor detached it from the cord
which bound it to his spacesuit and flung
it downward with all his strength then
he did the same with the mirror the
searchlight and the reel of cable it was
all he could do

  then there was an instant when he saw
where he had gone wrong he had not had
enough fuel to do what hed tried to do
that was clear by one look at earths

play	

face which still grew alarmingly fast be-
low him and he could probably have fig-
ured it out before but there had been a
way which would have given him some
chance he should have used his fuel not
in a hopeless attempt to decelerate but in
deflecting himself so he would miss earth
he would have passed by earth relatively
close hed have passed fast but not too
fast to signal with his mirror to earths
several satellites natural and artificial the
spaceports on those satellites kept twenty-
four-hour watches for signals of distress
when they saw a faint blinking light they
would send out a ship which would try
to locate its source they were good at it
too and if hed kept his mirror spinning
they might have picked him up

  but he hadnt thought of it it had
never occurred to him that even when he
was alone as thoroughly alone as anyone
can ever be his life could depend on doz-
ens of other people hed thought only
of reaching safety by himself and see-
ing only the one possibility hed played it
blindly

  there was that instant of sickening real-
ization then a little later came an instant
when earth ballooned out grotesquely be-
low him suddenly filling most of his field
of vision and he saw lakes islands des-
erts he felt all over him an abrupt final
flash of heat and nick pappas became a
meteor

the bulkheads of the
mighty battleship rocked with the
song welling from five thousand
throats as the young eager voices swelled
into the chorus of the spacemans
hymn vice-admiral jack harrigan felt
a lump grow in his own throat captain
mike obrien short muscular and de-
finitely irish joined the admiral at the
balcony hatch together they looked down
upon the huge ships auditorium

  its a long long way to the milky
way   the chorus rose fell faded
and died

  harrigan nodded to obrien and the
two men matched strides down the pas-
sageway

  something on your mind jack
obrien asked

  oh i dont know mike i just got
to thinking about the old days i guess
hearing those kids singing the force is
all glory to them color ceremony power
flitting around the galaxy like this cream
of the crop they are and every last one
of them fought to get in the force but
i wonder how theyd face up to the other
side of this business 

  combat  obrien screwed up his face

  yeh boy combat like we saw with
our backs to the wall and nine-tenths of
the galaxy howling for our hearts blood
wonder if theyd change their minds
about the force- he jerked his thumb
back towards the auditorium- if it came
again  



five thousand green space-cadets manning
the mighty albion on their shake-down
cruise heard that grim message from hq
war with xanfu return immediately to
terra base which posed a problem   
for lurking in starry battleground some-
where between earth and the doom-ship
was half the xantu fleet

  dunno mike shrugged maybe old
fitzsimmons wondered about us the same
way when we went on our shakedown
cruise we were a sad bunch ill admit
but we didnt pan out too bad did we
jack

  the two officers had reached the obser-
vation deck the milky way stretched 
hazy filament across the heavens harri-
gan drew a long breath hooked his
thumbs in his belt and smiled

  no mike not bad at all if i do say
so it was rugged while we were going
through it i suppose but things have
been quiet for so long now    damn
it we did have fun didnt we mike
mike grinned crookedly fun is right
remember the time shorty michaels
caught those two xantu ships flat-footed
behind the coal sack

  yeah blew em to hell and back
and found out later they were the two
strongest ships in the xantu fleet if they
had seen him first    brother he shook
for a week after they told him

  mike roared with laughter battle wa-
gons and shorty with a destroyer

           a blinding blast and four billion square
           miles of space flashed into daylight  
-planet stories-may


	pluvet

  and liow about that time the gang of

zith stinkers ambushed us on sirius v   
were they surprised when their water-
pistols didnt kill us they didnt know
that water isnt quite as fatal to a terran
as it is to a zith

  yeah obrien said and ill never
forget the smile on cap martins face as
he sprayed em with the ships fire hose

  well the admiral said sobering if
youd seen the pitiful remains in their
slave camps on sirius vii the way cap
and i did   he shook his head slowly
we should have bounced a couple duo-
dec bombs off their home planet and on
xantu too finished the job right

  the captain gazed down at his shoes
we might get the chance yet any news
lately

  not much just the usual rumblings
from the dark nebulas but i agree with
hq that the xantu are at the bottom of
it without a doubt you never know when
those varmints are going to start trouble
thats the reason for all this hush-up pre-
paration were going to be ready at the
drop of a helmet if anybody wants to
rassle

  smart move by hq for once mike
said never hurt to be ready for   

  a communications orderly saluted
smartly

  pardon sir hq double urgent

  harrigan took the flimsy from the or-
derly and scanned it quickly his face
went slack good lord obrien hear
this dark nebula forces simultaneously
attacked rigel patrol post and capella ii
settlement  hours personnel annihil-
ated fleet headed by xantu elements
headed sector i return to base imme-
diately

  sector i sol-alpha centauri-sirius
sector mike whistled and shook his head
theyll cut us off before we can reach
terra

  they will if we dont get a move
on the admiral snapped and we cant
fight with a green crew gotta get these
kids back to terra

  harrigan leaped to the audio his or-
ders were short and sharp

  drive room joe full speed home
boy the bubbles busted wide open

stories

   quartermaster wilson prepare to is-
 sue battle suits

   central give me the system thanks
 he cleared his throat all hands hear
 this a state of war exists between the
 solar federation and the dark nebula
 league we will attempt to reach terra
 base before being cut off by the enemy
 fleet however just in case we will be
 ready battle stations

the next few hours were
hectic ones especially for the few
seasoned officers aboard the battleship
albion the albion was a fairly new
ship she was fast heavily armored and
carried the latest guns three facts which
harrigan hoped would save them from
disaster he realized that hq had had
to break radio silence to notify them of
the sudden outbreak of hostilities but he
also knew that the enemy had undoubt-
edly intercepted the message plotted the
albion course and sent a half-dozen of
their fastest ships in hot pursuit thats
the way the dark nebula league liked
to fight six to one harrigan figured that
he just might be able to outrun them
but if the league ships did manage to
cut them off from terra    well he
hated the idea of fighting that bunch of
cut-throats with a crew of green kids
ordinarily new spacemen were distribu-
ted among crews of seasoned men at a
ratio of about one in ten to be in top
fighting condition the albion should carry
four thousand regulars and four hundred
greenies there were five thousand men
on board one hundred and fifty old line
officers fifty newly commissioned officers
and forty-eight hundred terran young-
sters fresh out of ground school

   the officers had done their best to whip
 the crew into the semblance of a fighting
 unit if a fracas did develop they might
 squeeze through if the kids could follow
 orders but in battle things happened al-
 most too fast to be covered by orders
 a man had to think for himself

   harrigan found himself staring through
 the forward screen wishing that three or
 four thousand hardened space-marines
 would suddenly materialize out of thin
out of the dark nebula	

air obrien came steaming up he sat
down beside the admiral lit a cigarette and
said phwooee

  right you are harrigan answered
things sure popped didnt they

  and how think we ought to prowl
guess so were going to watch things
mighty damned close till we hit base bet-
ter check the gun-banks and by the way
mike who had the controls when that
order came in

  young chap named mcdaniels

  and his navigator

  rose why

  have them report to me when they
come off theyre to be congratulated for
getting us away fast and right if the rest
of the crew picks up as fast as those two
well make out ok lets have a look at
those banks

the albions eight gun-banks span-
gled the ship from nose to tubes
like stripes on a watermelon each bank
was divided into a b and c sections fore
aft and center forty-eight men and two
officers manned each section the atomic
cannon in the nose were fired only by
the ships master gunner a sardonic ex-
pert named irvington

  at number six gun-bank harrigan and
obrien entered section c hatch o-
briens mouth fell open along the cat-
walk behind the gun emplacements proper
men lounged and leaned one slept sev-
eral were smoking and most of them had
thrown back their helmets of the forty-
eight three had their eyes on the finder
screens

  attention harrigan roared and fifty
men jerked erect like puppets on a string
get your helmets up and your eyes on
those screens and keep them there until
youre ordered off this isnt a shake-
down any longer this is war he turned
to obrien whos in charge here
lieutenant sanderson

  leave the ensign in charge and have
sanderson report to the bridge at once
harrigan stooped through the hatch and
mike see that the word is passed along
to the remaining gun-crews damned if
jh see a repeat of this

  yes sir mike answered and turned
toward the nervous lieutenant report
to the bridge mister and prepare to be
chewed

sanderson managed a weak yes sir
  

  harrigan was pacing the bridge when
mcdaniels and rose came in stood at
attention and saluted crisply

  the admiral returned the salute relax
gentlemen i called you here to commend
you both personally for your fast clear
thinking under the stress of emergency
cool-headedness under strain is taken as
a matter of course in the space forces
but in this case your actions served as an
example to an inexperienced crew and are
therefore doubly appreciated by the offi-
cers of this ship sit down

  the two men took seats and harrigan
relaxed behind his own massive desk i
was with your father at cadet school
mcdaniels and later at the battle of
canopus where is the commander now 
mcdaniels short and pudgy answered
proudly he took command of polaris
base i just before we left on the cruise
sir

 oh

  the kid doesnt know yet harrigan
thought if the force cant stem the
league attack damned quick old mc-
daniels and his men will be the expen-
dibles in this scrap but the kid sitting
before him was so eager and obviously
proud of his father that the admiral hadnt
the heart to tell him the true score

  sir rose piped up are you the
same officer harrigan that dad mentioned
during the first campaign he was mas-
ter navigator on the old cometeer 

  i certainly am harrigan smiled
broadly  red rose was the best navi-
gator i ever had he could plot you half
way around the galaxy and land you in
your barracks just in time for supper
how long has it been now six years
seven 

  rose looked at the floor seven sir
he was hunting kalabs on callisto when
the landslide caught him

  im sorry deeply sorry


planet stories

footsteps sounded in the pas-
sageway and the lieutenant sander-
son came in followed closely by obrien
the lieutenant tucked his cap under his
elbow smoothed back his thick hair and
saluted

  harrigan gazed at the man for a long
moment

  lieutenant perhaps the seriousness of
our circumstances has not impressed you
fully but the albion carrying this in-
experienced crew stands in imminent dan-
ger of being overwhelmed by the league
fleet or at best being cut off from terran
base therefore i think it    oops
harrigan had knocked his water pitcher
to the floor the plastic didnt break but
water splashed sanderson jumped back
convulsively his face white obrien mo-
tioned an orderly to mop up the mess
and the admiral went on you are a
seasoned junior officer sanderson your
record is excellent otherwise some fonu
of punishment would be in order i
shouldnt need to repeat that it is your
duty to keep your crew on the alert until
we are out of danger dismissed

  the lieutenant saluted and turned to
leave

  oh sanderson one more tiling har-
rigan rose and walked around the desk

  yes sir

  the admiral faced the lieutenant and
before the dumbfounded eyes of rose
mcdaniels and the orderly very delib-
erately drew his service blaster and shot
sanderson dead center between the eyes

  mcdaniels gulped rose jumped up
trembling the orderly let his mop fall
with a clatter obrien winked at harri-
gan

  great hell youve killed him rose
found his voice

  that i have that geptlemen har-
rigan pointed to the corpse is a zith

  an immediate babble of whys and
how do you knows filled the air

  look the admiral motioned and the
men gathered around the corpse harri-
gan stooped ran his fingers through the
thick black hair and came up with two
fleshy antenna-like appendages about four
inches in length which sprouted from the
skutt an inch or so above the hair-line

on the zith home planet their religion
requires that the head be cleanly shaven
and these antennae are a source of pride
but when a zith wishes to pass for a
terran he allows his hair to grow and
as long as the antennae are kept flat he
has a fair chance of going undetected
its one of the oddities of the universe
that the zith and terran so unlike in
temperament are to the eye unlike only
in this small way but in terran com-
pany most ziths acquire the nervous habit
of continually running their hands over
their hair to make sure that the antennae
are well hidden

  but a lot of terrans have the habit
of smoothing down their hair rose ob-
jected isnt that pretty thin evidence to
shoot a man by if youre not sure

 r	obrien broke in but yotl

       notice that the admiral said the
antennae were the only difference notice-
able to the eye theres another more im-
portant difference the chemical make-up
of the zith body is such that water reacts
violently on contact with it producing
what corresponds to severe bums usually
resulting in death the admiral and i
both noticed sandersons nervous habit
down in the gun bank a while ago the
pitcher incident a few minutes ago proved
to us that sanderson was not a terran
you men noticed how he shook and paled
when the water splashed near him

  then this isnt sanderson at all mc-
daniels asked his dark eyes wide with
wonder

  our records indicate that a lieutenant
vern sanderson left aldebaran ii about
three months ago to assist on the albion
shake-down cruise my guess is that the
real sanderson met with foul play some-
where along the way and this    thing
   was substituted the league knew
that war was coming they also knew
that the federation has lately installed
the new dyer gun and is in the process of
installing the bergesson hyper-drive in
its capital ships this critter was prob-
ably one of many sent to get those secrets
with them victory for the league would
be assured

  but why kill him why didnt you
out of the dark nebtjla



take him prisoner and find out what he
knew 

  for just one damned good reason
harrigan answered these boys are tele-
pathic over short distances-the antennae
have something to do with that if i hadn-t
taken him by complete surprise he would
have notified his pals if any on this ship
and if there should happen to be a dozen
or a hundred of these babies on board
we really would be in for it obrien ar-
range a watch on the mess hall have all
hands who do not take water with their
meals reported you and chief scott will
have to call them in one at a time and give
them the acid test

  obrien went off to arrange the mess
hall watch and harrigan sat down heav-
ing a great sigh behind his desk well
gentlemen he said you have seen the
enemy or at least half the enemy

  yes sir rose responded but what
about the xantus sir i-weve never
seen one of them

  the admiral shuddered inwardly i
hope you never do he confessed all
the wretched memories of two galactic
campaigns swept over him again a
xantu looks like nothing more nor less
than a beer barrel on skids with a cauli-
flower for a head eight independently
focussing eyes one for each of the tenta-
cles that sprout from the middle of the
chest get one of those monkies behind a
gun bank and youll swear you have a
platoon facing you harrigan lit a cig-
arette forked smoke from his nostrils

  the xantus dont do too much of the
actual fighting though back in the early
days of space conquest they teamed up
with the ziths  i imagine because the
xantus have a terrific technical culture
but are few in number relatively speaking
and the ziths arent great on technology
but have the manpower and too their
home systems are only a few light-years
apart so far the partnership has worked
out very well for the dark nebula league
the xantus providing the brains and the
ziths the muscle they are both ancient
races and very probably their plans for
the conquest of this end of the universe
would have gone nicely if they hadnt run
up against the solar federation led by

terra we stand smack across their path
it has come to the point now where its
us or them absolutely   

after the sanderson episode was
settled harrigan suddenly felt
drained and exhausted and retired to his
quarters while he slept obrien chief
scott and his men rounded up four more
zith spies who were immediately executed
and unceremoniously dumped into the
rocket chambers on the double-check a
fifth was discovered cowering in the cap-
tains life boat and he soon followed his
brothers the great ship plowed through
the ink of space and the only sounds were
the muffled throbbing from the rocket
banks the steady hum of the chronometer
and the clicking of the audio relay

  at  hours the alarm gong clanged
raucously harrigan was struggling into
his trousers as obrien stuck his head
in the door and shouted jack theyve
cut us off

  the captain explained the situation hur-
riedly as they sprinted toward the bridge
port watch just spotted em three o-
clock low in an arc theres only seven
of them but apparently theyve taken
polaris base and cut us off from sector
i

  a series of muffled thuds was heard
and suddenly a succession of electric blue-
white flashes from outside the ports turned
the dimness of the passageway into in-
tense eye-straining brilliance

  hot hell we must have got us one
harrigan roared and the two men broke
into a run

  in the powerful bridge screens they
could see the great cloud of smoke hang-
ing in the void where the league ship
had been hit and coming through it
several more of the grim pursuers occa-
sionally a beam of ripping ravaging energy
would lick out towards the albion but
the slim fingers of death fell shorter of
their goal by the minute

  well mike breathed in relief we
can outrun them but what now

  better set a course for antares iv
harrigan advised the maintenance de-
pot there can install the hyper-drive in
a few days and we can make it back to


planet stories

terra then regardless of what the league
holds

       

  as soon as the albion was safely out
of range of the league ships the two
officers were joined on the bridge by mas-
ter gunner cliff irvington they discussed
the narrow squeak for a few minutes at
length irvington punched out liis cigar and
confessed i could stand a drink

  ten minutes later they were seated in
harrigans spartan quarters over a bottle
of good terran irish whiskey and a fla-
gon of jovian blongah irvington downed
an heroic shot of the jovian mixture shiv-
ered howled and grabbed for the pitcher
of water which the orderly had placed
on the small table

  of all the chicken drinkers obrien
chaffed one little swig and hes halfway
under the table watch this son and learn
from a master of the aht whereupon
the captain poured a water glass full of
the volatile brew and swallowed it without
batting an eye

  nuts cliff grunted i have to stay
off the stuff for months at a time you
birds on the bridge can swill from one
side of the galaxy to the other but ive
got to watch my nerves and how about
that night in venusport when i had you
two guys reeling the night before we got
our commissions

  harrigan stifled a belch only an idiot
could drink that ook and stay on his pins
what was it now oh yes thunderbolt
cocktail two parts terran vodka one
part irish whiskey gin three raw eggs
nutmeg and a jolt of martian faylee cos-
mos  they say it made good xocket fuel
in a pinch

  obrien sat up glass in hand why
dont we mix a batch right now

  dont see why not harrigan flipped
the audio switch stores hanson send
a man up with formula thirteen will you
when the supplies arrived a few min-
utes later the three men indulged in an
orgy of mixing and much testing and
when the contents of the huge bowl met
their rigid specifications sat around it and
reminisced about the early days in the
force

  the three might easily have personified
the solar federation space force harri-
gan the organizer par excellence tall lean
and tanned by the radiation of a thousand
suns obrien the admirals life-long
friend squat and muscular-the fatherly
but deadly irishman who had hated the
league with all his powerful heart since
the day dim in time but not in memory
that the xantus had murdered his parents
on sirius iii in the first campaign and
irvington one of the truly fabulous char-
acters in the federation the man who
could reputedly hit a black basketball at
three million miles with an energy gun
who flunked out of pilots school and
turned gunner and who annually spent
his leave mining in the solar asteroid belt
and had become the richest man in the
force

  these men led the albion on its ques-
tionable course into the future human
and therefore prone to human failings
to be sure but wise in the ways of space
they were too and aware of its terrible
dangers

  at long last when the ships clock stood
at  hours the party broke up ash-
trays were piled high the magnificent
punchbowl was empty irvington and o-
brien left together and harrigan col-
lapsed on his bunk

  in his dreams he roamed the narrow
streets of mars center watched the pale
reed-like dancing girls sway their sensuous
bodies before the open-mouthed federa-
tion cadets and heard the far-off haunt-
ing desert music he walked through the
fairy cities of zithobar where the fragile
ethereal architecture belied the sadistic
temperament of the inhabitants and he
cruised the tainted stratosphere of the
xantu planet that dark and sinister world
whose peoples enjoyed nothing more than
heaving terran prisoners one by one into
the mouths of roaring volcanoes

anaton the federation base on an-
tares iv was six days at full blast
without hyper-drive after the round of
hectic activity surrounding their escape
from sector i officers and crew alike
found the uneventful trip restful but bor-
ing obrien played endless games of soli-
out of the dark nebula



taire irvington slept and harrigan
planned anaton was the biggest federa-
tion base in sector ii and the hyper-
drive was there he just hoped that the
base itself was there yet at  hours
on the sixth day antares shone like a
great red eye and they were three hours
out of base antares iii swung slowly
past and harrigan alerted the crew

  they didnt have long to wait obrien
had just stacked his cards away when
the starboard watch howled and three
xantu ships screamed across the albion
bow almost on collision course harri-
gans brow wrinkled as the tail ship
dropped back to engage the albion and the
other two fled these were not the usual
xantu tactics irvington coolly got the
black craft between his sights there was
a whoosh and a blinding blast and four
billion square miles of space flashed into
daylight the albion quickly overtook the
two remaining ships and gun-banks three
four and five riddled one of them it
slowed spun and became a lifeless drift-
ing shell

  but the pilot of ship three was no fool
he suddenly swiveled his ship boomed
off at a tangent and as the albion whipped
by his gunner caught her full in the
tubes with a full charge from the stern
guns now it was the albions turn to
spin end for end but as the xantu craft
spun into his sights for a fraction of a
second irvington tripped the atomic can-
non again the bolt ricochetted off the
xantus bow and the ship slowly split
down the center like an over-ripe melon
from the bridge harrigan counted three
life boats deserting the mother ship and
he watched the gunners vainly try to pick
them off but they were too small a target
and they quickly merged into the sanctuary
of darkness

  he buzzed obrien lets get down
to drive quick they got that xantu blast
dead center

  the drive section was a shambles men
in weird asbestos suits and masks stag-
gered through the smoke and fumes with
the broken bodies of the rocket crew that
had been caught in the explosion harri-
gan brushed at angry tears as they car-
ried joe merrick-the officer in charge-

past them and laid the charred body beside
the others merrick had been with him
through both campaigns and now the bit-
terness within harrigan turned to grim
resolution at length thirty-seven men
were counted out of action permanently
the admiral turned solemnly away

  think wed better set her down on
iii obrien asked quietly

  guess so mike we can take her down
on anti-grav and maneuver with the bow
jets and then slowly this puts us
out of the war you realize that   
yeah and we cant even holler for
help or theyll swarm in on us like a pack
of harpies

  i dont know about that mike those
boats that got away will probably alert
other elements of the league fleet as to
our location its only a matter of time
anyway so we might as well break radio
silence and try to get some federation
ships here first itll be a race but its
the only chance weve got

  radio room sent the sos and rang
back the bridge almost immediately mes-
sage away sir but our receiver was
knocked out by the blast we get no ac-
knowledgment on sos

  oh great harrigan groaned thats
all we needed

  maybe we could make anaton on the
bow jets obrien offered

  doubtful besides we dont want to
chance being caught in space with the
albion in this shape if my guess is any
good those three ships were part of a
fleet which has just attacked anaton and
by now the base is probably a smoking
hole in the ground no point in going to
something like that

it took superhuman maneuvering
and quite a bit of luck but at last the
scarred battleship came to rest in partial
hiding at the foot of a cliff wall on the
rugged boulder-strewn surface of an-
tares iii space directory termed the
planet earth-type diam  atmo-
sphere breathable for terrans for a period
not to exceed twelve hours

  harrigan had the portable dyer guns
arranged in a semi-circle at advantageous
spots behind boulders up to one mile from


planet stories

the albion in case the survivors of the
league ships might set their boats down
nearby and attempt a coup over land the
albions own boats carried out patrols in
the hope of locating the enemy before the
enemy located them

  for sixteen hours after the landing
everything was absolutely quiet and then
as relief gun-crews slogged out the main
hatch to take their positions at the port-
ables all hell broke loose

  a short range explosive rocket shell arched
perfectly into the hatch and exploded with
a deafening roar scattering the relief
crews like ten pins and slamming the two
ton hatch cover clean off its swivel pins
the three league boats with devastating
surprise zoomed in low and fast over
the outlying gun positions spraying a trail
of reezi powder which was ignited by
their rockets the countryside went up in
a swirl and a flash another explosive
rocket struck the albion amidships before
the crews got the more cumbersome fixed
guns into firing position

  the lightning-fast boats were too small
and swift to be speared by anything save
a lucky shot back and forth they raked
the almost helpless battleship the attack
waned momentarily as one of the black
boats was caught and instantly charred by
cross-fire from the albion one and four
banks the remaining two changed tactics
roaring in over the big ship past the top
of the cliff only to spin back hit and
run

  five of the albion patrol boats skittered
home only to be caught in the fray and
immediately knocked down three more
met the same fate and a fourth was dodg-
ing desperately for its life when harri-
gans eyes popped wide open with amaze-
ment a pencil-like silver destroyer es-
cort bearing the insignia of the federa-
tion forces fell on the league boats
from zenith position and in a screaming
twisting dive blasted one and rammed the
other into flying rubbish

  the silver ship climbed a few miles
vertically to see if the field had been prop-
erly cleared flashed down and dusted to
a stop beside the albion harrigan stepped
over the smoking bodies in the main
hatchway and dropped to the ground o-

brien sprinted to join him but before
they could reach the other ship an officer
leaped from a belly-lockand walked briskly
towards them

  he snapped a salute admiral harri-
gan and the albionf he asked

  right lieutenant harrigan smiled
wearily youre very welcome

  lieutenant sanderson sir third fleet
attack arm i was supposed  
sanderson obrien roared

  yes sir i was assigned to the albion
sir but it took me ten weeks to walk
halfway around pluto from where the
ziths dumped me and catch a ship to
terra base i take it they dubbed one of
their beasties in for me

  they sure did harrigan answered
but there wasnt much harm done i
killed you on the bridge lieutenant
oh sanderson looked puzzled for a
brief moment then smiled oh thats
good

  whats the score now obrien asked
well sir the third attack fleet is
standing off anton now you have prob-
ably guessed that part of a league fleet
attacked the base we picked up a few
survivors but damned few then we
picked up a weak distress signal from
this area and admiral brands had us
check on it

  good thing he did harrigan admitted
and now lieutenant if you will be so
good as to radio for a tub to pick us up
i will be most happy to leave this planet
yes sir at once sanderson saluted
and ran for his ship

three hours and a few odd
minutes later the transport tub ava-
lon settled its ponderous bulk beside the
albion and the slow transfer of the living
and the dead began one hundred and
fifty-five bodies were slated for burial on
terra another sixty were missing whiffed
into gas by league guns

  harrigan sank deeper into gloom as he
removed the ships log and helped obrien
check the men off the albion at last the
loading was completed the avalon hung
for a moment on its anti-gravs and har-
rigan and commander johnson in charge
out of tbe

of the tub looked down on the battered
remains of the great craft

  better come to the bridge and sit
johnson said softly

  on the bridge he poured harrigan a
stiff drink and cautioned swallow that
and get ready

  harrigan complied puzzled no sooner
had he placed his glass on the table than
a small but virile mule kicked him in
the stomach

  suffering    what was that he
gasped

  johnson smiled hyper-drive appar-
ently tech hasnt got the bugs worked
out yet but its good enough for me only
four hours to terra

well well harrigan mused he rose
and looked at the swirling grayness outside
the ports same deal on the other end
yeah a little wrench in the gut but
you get used to it

  harrigan said well well again and
sat down

  admiral johnson hesitated no of-
fense now you understand but i have
been wondering what the albion was doing
way out here on antares iii i under-
stood that you were coming into terra
from the other side of sector i when
the fracas started

  we were but when the league took
polaris base and cut us off we had to 

  took polaris base the league didnt
take polaris base they had a dozen or
so cruisers in that area but they didnt
tackle the base didnt even make a par
at it

  harrigan slowly dropped his head into
his hands

  oh my god he moaned and i lost
two hundred men on a bad guess i de-
serve to be broken to a spaceman third
class for this he jumped up and paced
the bridge great guns what a fool i
am polaris intact and i risk a ship-load
of green men on a bad guess this washes
me up in the force thats for damn sure

  oh i dont think so admiral john-
son smiled in fact i think that   

  i dont give a damn what you think
commander the force is no place for
fools pm done and harrigan slammed
off the bridge towards his quarters

dark nebula	

  johnson smiled faintly and poured him-
self a drink

it was a tired and  bedraggled admiral
who stepped off the avalon four hours
later into the sunlit bustle of terra base i
he felt pride well up in him at the sight
of the powerful base the battlewagons and
cruisers and squat tubs some with their
guts spread on the steel docks waiting for
the drive installation crane winches
clanked and howled welding torches
flashed and many-wheeled trailers sped
about with ponderous equipment but the
activity was not frantic it was efficient
and orderly

  he turned for a word with obrien
who was now puffing down the gangway
when a bright young spaceman first
stepped up and saluted with a grin ad-
miral garrisons regards to admiral har-
rigan and captain obrien and would
they report to hq at once

  well here it comes mike

  guess so mike agreed gloomily
why are all these baboons so happy
he indicated the clustered groups of
spacemen who regarded them smilingly
as they passed and talked excitedly among
themselves

  dunno maybe they like the thought
of admirals and captains getting chewed
down

  they paused briefly outside the door
marked

adm garrison gg

port admiral

  obrien shrugged here goes nothin
inside the tall balding man behind the
desk jumped to his feet with a grin jack
mike boy you two guys certainly beat
anything i ever saw talk about your
heroes   

  cut it george harrigan growled
you dont have to rub it in

  rub what in great caesar hasnt
anyone told you yet you guys won the
war thats all

  yeah on the seat of our pants at
antares iii obrien muttered

  but im telling you damnit garri-
son came around the desk and clapped


planet stories

them   the shoulders those league
ships you brought down were heading for
home with the hyper-drive secret and
you stopped them

  slow and stunning realization dawned
on the two officers obrien gave a long
low whistle and sank in his chair harri-
gan broke into a slow grin

  what a deal garrison rubbed his
hands what a deal you guys will get
promotions out of this or my name isnt
george garr  

  but what the hell happened harri-
gan demanded

  like this garrison explained three
league ships picked up spies just off
anaton they had the hyper-drive papers
then they threw a duodec bomb into the
base and high-tailed the albion was the
only federation ship of any size left in
commission in the area you got them
just before the last league ship went
down it beamed a message to zithobar
which we intercepted so the third attack
arm swung over quick to see what the
trouble was then we got your sos
and went after you before the league

could get back for a little of its well-
known vengeance

  now what the devil  harrigan
rubbed his chin grinning is the war
over then

  not altogether but its just a matter
of mopping up now and fixing zithobar
and the xantu planet once and for all
the third and seventh attack arms are
completely equipped with the drive and
the second is just about ready to roll
brother are those babies surprised when
we pop out of nowhere into the middle
of their formations and burn them down
before they can aim a gun    but if
they had hooked onto the drive secret it
would have been all day for the federa-
tion garrison threw back ljis head and
roared with laughter you birds   
with a green crew- he held his sides-
with a tub full of greenies you win the
war and by accident yet oh lordie
he sat down to catch his breath

  well    ill    be   a    harri-
gan shook his head

  yeah ill be one too obrien mut-

   gag-cartoonist bill garrigan sat down and deliberately put on paper
   the ugliest most gruesome damn critters he could imagine then he
   found out he wasnt imaginingi

garrigans bems

there were six letters in

bill garrigans box but he could
tell from a quick glance at the en-
velopes that not one of them was a check
would-be gags from would-be gagmen
and nine chances out of ten not a yak
in the lot

  he carried them back to the adobe hut

two ih-armed three-headed creatures emerged    ob o bill sold   
garrigans beifts	

sat down and twisted liis legs around the
legs of the kitchen chair before the rickety
table which doubled as a place to eat and
his drawing board

  it had been a long time since the last
sale and he hoped even though he didnt
dare expect that thered be a really salable
gag in this lot miracles do happen

  he tore open the first envelope six
gags from some guy up in oregon sent
to him on the usual basis  if he liked any
of them hed draw them up and if they
sold the guy got a percentage bill garri-
gan looked at the first one it read

 guy and gal drive up to
 restaurant sign on car
 reads herman the fire
 eater through windows
 of restaurant people eat-
 ing by candle light

 guy oh boy this looks
 like a good place to eat i

  bill garrigan groaned and looked at the
next card and the next and the next he
opened the next envelope and the next

  this was getting really bad cartooning
is a tough racket to make a living in even
when you live in a little town in the south-
west where living doesnt cost you much
and once you started slipping-well the
thing was a vicious circle as your stuff
was seen less and less often in the big
markets the best gagmen started sending
their material elsewhere you wound up
with the left-overs which of course put
the skids under you that much worse

  he pulled the last gag from the final en-
velope it read

 scene on some other pla-
 net emperor of snook a
 hideous monster is talk-
 ing to some of his scien-
 tists

 emperor yes i under-
   stand that youve devis-
   ed a method of visiting
   earth but who would
   want to with all those
   horrible looking humans
   living there

bill garrigan scratched the end
of his nose thoughtfully it had possi-
bilities after all the science-fiction mar-
ket was growing like mad and if he
could draw these extra-terrestrial crea-
tures hideous enough to bring out the

gag-

  he reached for a pencil and a piece of
paper and started to sketch out a rough
the first version of the emperor and his
scientists didnt look quite ugly enough
he crumpled up the paper and reached for
another piece

  lets see he could give each one of the
monsters three heads each head with eight
protruding goggling eyes half a dozen
stubby arms hmmm not bad very long
torsos very short legs four apiece front
ones bending one way back ones the
other splay feet now how about the
face outside of the eight eyes leave em
blank below the eyes a mouth a big one
in the middle of the chest that way a
monster wouldnt get to arguing with him-
self as to which head should do the eating

  he added a few quick lines for the
background he looked upon his work and
it was good maybe too good maybe
editors would think their readers too
squeamish to look upon such terrible mon-
strosities and yet unless he made them
as horrible as he could the gag would be
lost

  in fact maybe he could make them even
a little more hideous he tried and found
that he could

  he worked on the rough until he was
sure hed got as much as could be drawn
out of the gag found an envelope and
addressed it to his best market-or what
had been his best market up to several
months ago when hed started slipping
hed made his last sale there fully two
months ago but maybe theyd take this
one rod corey the editor liked his car-
toons a bit on the bizarre side

  bill garrigan had almost forgotten the
submission by the time it came back al-
most six weeks later

  he tore open the envelope the rough
was there with a big red ok lets have
a finish scrawled to one side of it and
with the initials rc beneath


planet stories

  hed eat again

  bill made it back from the post office in
double time brushed the odds and ends
of food books and clothing from the table
top and reached for paper pencil pen and
ink

  he wedged the rough between a milk
can and a dirty saucer to work from it
and he stared at it until he got himself back
in the frame of mind hed been in when
hed first roughed out the idea

  he did a job of it because rod coreys
market was in there with the best the only
one that gave him seventy-five bucks a
crack of course some of the really top
markets paid higher than that to name-
cartoonists but bill garrigan had lost
any delusions of his own grandeur sure
hed give his right arm to hit the top but
it didnt seem likely to happen and right
now hed settle for selling enough to keep
him eating

  he took almost two hours to complete
the finish did it up carefully with card-
board and made his way back to the post
office he mailed it and rubbed his hands
with satisfaction money in the bank hed
be able to get the broken transmission
fixed on his jalopy and be on wheels again
and hed be able to catch up fractionally
on his grocery and rent bills to boot
only it was a shame that old r c wasnt
quicker pay

  as a matter of fact the check didnt
come until the day the issue containing
the cartoon hit the stands but in the
meantime hed made a couple of small
sales to trade magazines and hadnt ac-
tually gone hungry still in all the check
looked wonderful when it came

  he cashed it at the bank on his way from
the post office and stopped off at the sage-
brush tap for a couple of quick ones
and they tasted so good and made him
feel so cheerful that he stopped at the
liquor store and picked up a bottle of
metaxa he couldnt afford metaxa of
course-who can-but somewhere along
the line a man has to do a reasonable
amount of celebrating

once home he opened the bottle of
precious greek brandy had a couple

of slugs of it and then settled his long
body into the chair propped his scuffed
shoes on the rickety table and let out a
sigh of pure contentment tomorrow hed
regret the money hed spent and hed prob-
ably have a hangover to boot but tomor-
row was manana

  reaching out a hand he picked the least
dirty of the glasses within his reach and
poured a stiff shot into it maybe he
thought fame is the food of the soul and
hed never be a famous cartoonist but
this afternoon at least cartooning was giv-
ing with the liquor of the gods

  he raised the glass toward his lips but
he didnt quite make it his eyes widened

  before him the adobe wall seemed to
shimmer quiver shake then slowly a
small aperture appeared it enlarged grew
widened suddenly it was the size of a
doorway -

  bill darted a reproachful look at the
brandy hell he told himself ive hardly
touched it his unbelieving eyes went bade
to the doorway in the wall it could be an
earthquake in fact it must be what
else-

  two six-armed three-headed creatures
emerged each had three heads and each
head had six goggling eyes four legs a
mouth in the middle of-

  oh no bill said

  each of the creatures held an awesome
respect-inspiring gunlike object each
pointed it at bill garrigan

  gentlemen bill said i realize that
this is one of the most potent drinks on
earth but so help me two jiggers couldnt
do this 

  the monsters stared at him and shud-
dered and each one closed all but one of
its twenty-four eyes

  hideous indeed said the first one to
have come through the aperture the
most hideous specimen in the solar sys-
tem is he not agol

  me said bill garrigan faintly
you but do not be afraid we have
come not to harm you but to take you into
the mighty presence of bon whir iii
emperor of snook where you will be
suitably rewarded

 how for what wheres-snookv
 will you please ask questions one at a
garrigan rems



time i could answer all three of those
simultaneously one with each head but i
fear you are not equipped to understand
multiple communication

  bill garrigan dosed his eyes youve
got three heads but only one mouth how
can you talk three ways with only one
mouth 

  the monsters mouth laughed what
makes you think we talk with our mouths 
we only laugh with them we eat by osmo-
sis we talk by vibrating diaphragms in the
tops of our heads now which of your
three previous questions do you wish an-
swered 

  how will i be rewarded

  the emperor did not tell us but it
will be a great reward it is our duty
merely to bring you these weapons are
merely a precaution in case you resist
and they do not kill we are too civilized
to kill they merely stun

  you arent really there bill said he
opened his eyes and quickly closed them
again ive never touched a reefer in my
life nor had d ts and i couldnt
suddenly get them on only two brandies
-well four if you count the ones at the
bar

  you are ready to go with us

  go where
  to snook

  wheres that

  the fifth planet retrograde of sys-
tem k---gm space continuum
-j ht-

  where with relation to here

  the monster gestured with one of his
six arms immediately through that aper-
ture in your wall are you ready

  no what am i being rewarded for
that cartoon how did you see it

  yes for that cartoon we are
thoroughly familiar with your world and
civilization it is parallel to ours but in a
different continuum we are people with a
great sense of humor we have artists but
no cartoonists we lack that faculty the
cartoon you drew is to us excruciatingly
funny already everyone in snook is
laughing at it are you now ready 
no said bill garrigan

  both monsters lifted their guns two
clicks came simultaneously

ccyou are conscious again a
x voice told him this way to the
throne room please

  there wasnt any use arguing bill went
he was here now wherever here was and
maybe theyd reward him by letting him go
hack if he behaved himself

  the room was familiar just as hed
drawn it and hed have recognized the
emperor anywhere not only the emperor
but the scientists who were with him

  could conceivably it have been coin-
cidence that he had drawn a scene and
creatures that actually existed or-
hadnt he read somewhere the theory that
there existed an infinite number of uni-
verses in an infinite number of space-time
continuums so that any state of being of
which one could possibly think actually
existed somewhere  hed thought that had
sounded ridiculous when hed read it but
he wasnt so sure now

  a voice from somewhere-it sounded as
though from an amplifier-said the great
the mighty emperor bon whir iii leader
of the faithful commander of the glorie
receiver of the light lord of the ga-
laxies beloved of his people

   it stopped and bill said bill garrigan
the emperor laughed with his mouth
thank you bill garrigan he said for
giving us the best laugh of our lifetimes
i have had you brought here to reward
you i hereby offer you the post of royal
cartoonist a post which has not existed
before since we have no cartoonists your
sole duty will be to draw one cartoon a
day

  one a day but wherell i get the

gags

  we will supply them we have excel-
lent gags each of us has a magnificent
sense of humor both creative and appre-
ciative we can however draw only repre-
sentationally you will be the greatest man
on this planet next to me he laughed
maybe youll be even more popular than
i-although my people really do like me
i-i guess not bill said i think
id rather go back to-say what does
the job pay maybe i could take it for a
while and take some money-or some
equivalent-back to earth

  the pay will be beyond your dreams o
	planet

avarice you will have everything you
want and you may accept it for one year
with the option of life-tenure if you so
wish at the end of the year

  well- bill said he was wondering
just how much money would be beyond
his dreams of avarice a devil of a lot he
guessed hed go back to earth rich all
right

  i urge you to accept said the em-
peror every cartoon you draw-and you
may draw more than one a day if you
wish-will be published in every publi-
cation on the planet you will draw royal-
ties from each

  how many publications have you
over a hundred thousand twenty bil-
lion people read them

  well bill said maybe i should try
it a year but-uh-

  what

  howll i get along here outside of
cartooning i mean i understand that
physically im hideous to you as hideous
as you are to-i mean i wont have any
friends i certainly couldnt make friends
with-i mean-

  that has already been taken care of in
anticipation of your acceptance and while
you were unconscious we have the great-
est physicians and plastic surgeons in any
of the universes the wall behind you is
a mirror if you will turn-

  bill garrigan turned he fainted

one of bill garrigans heads sufficed
to concentrate on the cartoon he
was drawing directly in ink he didnt
bother with roughs any more they werent
necessary with the multiplicity of eyes that
enabled him to see what he was doing
from so many angles at the same time

  his second head was thinking of the
great wealth in his bank account and his
tremendous power and popularity here

stories

true the money was in copper which was
the precious metal in this world but there
was enough copper to sell for a fortune
on earth too bad his second head thought
that he couldnt take back his power and
popularity with him

  his third head was talking to the em-
peror the emperor came to see him some-
times these days yes the emperor was
saying the time is up tomorrow but i
hope we can persuade you to stay your
own terms of course and since we do
not want to use coercion our plastic sur-
geons will restore you to your original-
uh-shape-

  bill garrigans mouth in the middle of
his chest grinned it was wonderful to be
so appreciated his fourth collection of
cartoons had just been published and had
sold ten million copies on this planet alone
besides exports to the rest of the system
it wasnt the money he already had more
than he could ever spend here and the
convenience of three heads and six arms-

  his first head looked up from the car-
toon and came to rest on his secretary she
saw him looking and her eyestalks dropped
coyly she was very beautiful he hadnt
made any passes at her yet hed wanted
to be sure which way hed decide about
going back to earth his second head
thought about a girl hed known once back
on his original planet and he shuddered and
jerked his mind away from thinking about
her good lord shed been hideous

  one of the emperors heads had caught
sight of the almost-finished cartoon and
his mouth was laughing hysterically

  yes it was wonderful to be appreciated
bills first head kept on looking- at
thwil his beautiful secretary and she
flushed a faint but beautiful yellow under
his stare

  well pal bills third head said to
the emperor ill think it over yeah ill
think it over

beyond depth to it and the jewels spar-
kling at its rim were a deep aquamarine
which seemed to transmute the sun-glow
into shimmering bands of starlight

  i could have told stee that such mir-




planet stories

  rors by their very nature were destruc-
  tive when a man carries a hopeless vision
  of loveliness about with him when he
  lives with that vision night and day he
  ceases to be the undisputed master of his
  own destiny-

  shes alive jim steve said a wom-
an dead fifty thousand years a woman
from a civilization that flourished before
the dawn of human history

  take it easy steve i warned the
martians simply knew how to preserve
every aspect of a mirrored image say
howdedo to her if you like press your
lips to the glass and see what happens
but dont mistake an imitation of life for
the real thing

  an imitation of life steve flared
man she just smiled at me shes aware
of us i tell you

  sure she is her brain was mirrored
too every aspect of its electro-dynamic
structure preserved forever by a science
thats lost forever get a grip on yourself
steve

 i was hot and tired and dusty my
throat was parched and i didnt feel much
like arguing with him but i had my rea-
sons for being stubborn

  men have found martian mirrors and
gone mad i said dont take any chances
steve we dont know yet what its rigged
with why not play it safe a thousand
cycles of direct current should melt it
down

  melt her down steves eyes nar-
rowed in sudden fury why it would be
murder

steve got up and brushed sand
from his knees he held the mirror up
so that the red martian sunlight caught
and aureoled the splendor of a face that
offered a man no chance of help if he
ever let go

  a pale beautiful face the eyes fringed
with long dark lashes the lips parted in
a mocking smile a living image capable
of mercurial changes of mood unnatural-
ly still one moment smiling and animated
the next

  one thing at a time i thought dont
drive him too hard

 some men have carried them about

for years i said but just remember
what falling in love with an image can
mean youll never hold her in your
arms steve and compulsions can kill

  shes alive as flesh-and-blood is alive
he said glaring at me

  easy steve

  i could see that i was going to have
trouble with my stout-hearted buddy cap-
tain stephen claymore

  he could have stared at a mountain of
gold unmoved he could have knelt with
a wry chuckle and let a handful of dia-
monds trickle through his wiry bronze-
knuckled hands in utter contempt for
what diamonds could buy on earth

  he could have thrown back his head
and laughed at wealth at glory at any-
thing you want to name that men prize
highly on earth but a beautiful woman
was a temptation apart a beautiful
woman-

  steve grabbed my arm look out
tom he cried watch it

  the bullet whizzed past like a heat-
maddened insect steve leapt back and i
flattened myself

  the attack was no great surprise when
people take up a new way of life when
they pull up stakes and go striding into
the sunrise strife paces after like a raven-
ous hound red tongue lolling when the
first colonists from earth swarmed into
the crumbling martian cities a good third
of them ended up in stony desolation with
their hearts drilled through

  they danced to riotous tunes calling
for louder music and stronger wine and
they fought savagely to set up little king-
doms of tyranny eighty feet square

  everywhere anarchy reigned and hag-
gard-eyed desperate men crouched be-
hind smoke-blackened ruins and held off
other men as greedy as themselves they
fought and died by dozens by hundreds
their minds inflamed by the quickly-made
discovery that the martian cities were
vast treasure troves

  you had to go prospecting you had to
search and when you found your own
shining treasure you didnt want to share
it with any man alive

  steve had his gun trained on the wall
ahead when he ducked down at my side
lake of fire



    yes sir i whispered half to myself
 this is going to be rough

   they asked for it steve said

   his gun roared twice

   from the wall ahead came a burst of
 gunfire in reply

    if they think theyre going to get this
 mirror away from me-

    i looked at his grim sweat-beaded face
 ill help you fight for it i said

   so nice of you he grunted

   then maybe youll have sense enough
 to bury it face down in the sand

 guns went off thirty feet direct-
 ly in front of us red sand geysered
 up granite cracked and splintered you
 could feel the awful heat of the blazing ex-
 change of bullets

   i could see faces between the chinks
 malignant faces moving from peep-hole
 to peep-hole like scavenger birds hopping
 about in the desert

   i was aiming at one of the peep-holes
 when steve groaned and sagged against
 me his gun ann sagged and i could see
 that a bullet had pierced his shoulder high
 up

   im sorry tom he whispered
 hoarsely i was careless damn it
 never mind steve i said

   now theyll close in and get you
 better take my gun you can use two
 guns

   i wont need two guns steve i
 said im walking into the open with my
 hands raised

   youre crazy he breathed his eyes
  on my face were outnumbered five to
 one theyll drop you the instant you
 step out from behind this wall

   my gun was hot and smoking i smiled
 and tossed it to the sand

   ill be back in a minute and fix up
 that shoulder i said

   youll be walking to your death he
 said theyve been trailing us for days
 hoping wed stumble on something they
 must have seen me pick up that mirror
 they trailed us because they thought
 we looked experienced rugged i said
 they thought we were following a map
 they just havent got what it takes to go

prospecting for themselves theyre hyen-
as of the desert steve

  all right-hyenas that means they
wont respect a white flag if you walk
out with your hands raised theyll burn
you down before youve taken five steps

  i steadied my helmet and unloosed my
collar so that i wouldnt feel cramped

  dont worry steve i said

  i knew they saw me the instant i
stepped out from behind the wall

  the silence was ominous and i could
feel their eyes upon me hot and deadly

  i didnt raise my hands it didnt seem
quite right to let them think i was seek-
ing a truce a man may be a fool to play
fair with killers but something made me
change my mind about raising my hands

  id give them their chance-ten sec-
onds i wouldnt try to bargain for those
ten seconds by walking toward them un-
der false colors id just trust to luck
and-

steve had never seen the weapon i
held in my palm it was a tiny elec-
trostatic accelerator tube capable of flexi-
ble high precision control of ions with
energies up to twelve million electron-
volts

  it was a simple thing-and unbeliev-
ably destructive it made no sound at all
but ten seconds after i clicked it on the
desert directly in my path was glowing
white hot

  just a glow white dazzling for an in-
stant then a dull rumbling shook the
ground and the wall opposite blackened
and crumbled the heat was like a blast
of incandescent helium gas from a man-
made sun

  i turned and walked back to where
steve was lying

  i didnt want to do it that way i
said but i had no choice it was them-
or us

  steve seemed not to realize we were
no longer in danger there was fear in his
eyes and he was staring at me as if id
just returned from the dead

  in a way i had a man may die fifty
deaths while counting off ten seconds in
his mind

  ill give you something to help you
	planet

sleep steve i said

  it didnt take me long to dress and
hind up his wound he winced once or
twice but he never took his eyes from the
mirror

  you promised to bury it face down in
the sand i said

  he looked at me you know better
than that he said i promised nothing
of the sort

  its like falling in love with a ghost
only worse i said

  thats where youre wrong theres
nothing ghostly about her

  i mixed him a sleeping draught using
the little water we had left

  in five minutes he was snoring i pried
the mirror from his fingers and propped
it up against a rock so that he could see
her face when he woke up

  then i stretched myself out in the sand
kicked off my shoes and stared up at the
sky the sun was just sinking to rest and
there was a thin sprinkling of stars in the
middle of the sky

  the stars seemed cold and immeasur-
ably remote

  would it work out

  could it possibly work out was i
sticking out my neck in a gamble so big
it was like attempting to pierce the sun
and hammer out a new humanity on a
great blazing anvil heated to millions of
degrees centigrade

  i laughed alone with my thoughts
nothing dared nothing gained what does
a man gain by striking bargains with the
mouse in himself

i awoke in the cool dawn the morn-
ing mists had rolled back and the ted
desert looked almost beautiful in the sun
glow

  steve was sitting up staring at the
mirror the light shifted suddenly and i
could see the radiance which smouldered
in the depths of the glass

  i got up walked to the wall and peered
over steves shoulder the girl was look-
ing at him her face so beautiful it fairly
took my breath away it was as though
after a lifetime of wandering shed found
the only man in the world for her

  her face was bright with sympathy

stories

with compassion for steve but steve sat
slumped in utter dejection his eyes burn-
ing holes in his face he didnt even look
up when i spoke to him

 she knows tom he whispered
hoarsely she turned pale when that bul-
let hit me she was relieved when you
dressed the wound shes been watching
over me all night like an angel of mercy
youll need her more and more i
said you know what the end will be
steve complete hopelessness in an empty
room

  he stood up his face savage

  i never asked your advice he ground
out im not asking it now

  ive got to save you steve i said

  i love her do you hear i dont care
what happens to me

  i picked up the mirror before he could
guess my purpose i swung about and i
brought that rare and beautiful object
down on the rock steve had been sitting
on

  there was a splintering crash a crack-
ling burst of white flame

  steve gave a great despairing cry he
stood for an instant staring down at the
shattered fragments of the mirror then
he came at me like a charging bull his
eyes bloodshot

  i clipped him lightly on the jaw
thats all i wanted to know steve
i said thanks pal

  i looked down at him lying in a
crumpled heap at my feet

  i was glad he hadnt fallen on his
wounded side he was plenty sturdy and
he came from a long-lived family and i
didnt think a little clip on the jaw could
hurt him i hoped hed forgive me when
he woke up that was important because
i thought a lot of steve

 when youve been to mars when
youve fought your way through the red
and raging dust storms and labored
beneath the naked glare of the sun and
juggled with men and ships and supplies
like some tremendous herculean figure in
the morning of the world youll never
really feel at home on earth youll see
the world of ordinary men and women as
a vision of lilliput too small to be measur-
able in terms of human worth youll be
lake of fire



lost and helpless blind and staggering
beneath the weight of a memory you cant
throw off a memory of bigness too much
bigness integrated into your every fiber
as much a part of you as the beating of
your heart

  youll lurch and over-reach yourself
youll never feel at home on earth never
really at home youll find a way to come
back to mars

  i smiled down at steve

  so steve had come back to go prospect-
ing like an ordinary greed-driven man
and only i knew he was one of the scant
dozen great constructive geniuses who
had made possible mans conquest of
space

  he was an engineer a physicist and-
a man in need of a partner so id just
stepped up and introduced myself tom
gierson who knew every square foot of
mars for my purpose one earth name
was as good as another and tom gierson
had a sturdy ring

  hard-bitten toni gierson bronzed by
the harsh martian sunlight as much at
home in the desert as the sturdy little
spiked plants that thrust their way up
through the parched soil when the spring
begins to break

  steves finest achievement was years
in the past but he was a young man still
with a young mans need of a woman as
great as himself to share every moment
of his waking life that woman was wait-
ing for him but i had to be sure that hed
really go berserk if i smashed the glass

  i was sure now

  i raised my arm jid out of the ruins
the martians came

steady hands lifted steve up
and a hushed silence ringed steve
round

  azala i said where is she-

  then i saw her she was advancing
straight toward me through the glare of
sunset on desert sand a shining eagerness
in her eyes the girl of the mirror young
and straight and alive her hair the color
of red sand and sunset glow her eyes twin
dark stars

  she paused before me and raised her
eyes in questioning wonder

       tua iet in thrilling ad-
venture and fast-action stories read
fiction house magazines

look for the bulls-eye on
the covers   

two complete

  science-adventure books
    indian	planet

sheena	football

jungle	baseball

two complete detective books
two western books
two western action books

  go to him i said he will never
love another woman i can promise you
that

  she ran to steve with a little glad cry
and fell to her knees beside him i wanted
to break through the circle and slap steve
on the back and wish him all the hap-
piness on mars the first earthian to wed
a martian and it was tremendous and i
wanted to tell steve-

  but how could i tell him that martians
had numerous ways of watching earth-
ians the very best being mirrors which
were really two-way televisual instru-
ments how could i tell him that the alert
martian women had all been trained to
watch and observe earthians day and
night and all the while the earthians
thought they were carrying about with
them in beautiful jeweled artifacts of a
dead culture the living images of their
hearts desire

  steve was awake now and sitting up
straight and the image was warm and
alive in his arms but how could i make
steve understand i had a wild impulse
to say id change places with you if i
could steve shes just about the cutest
kid i know

you get to thinking that way when
	planet

youve mingled with earthians around
desert campfires studying them as youd
study a new neighbor who comes knock-
ing at your door the neighbor you fear
at first and are never quite sure of until
you really get to know and like him

  you see we had so much to offer one
another a young race constructive
brawling shouting its defiance to the
stars and an old race imaginative sensi-
tive heirs to a civilization on the wane
but needing just a few steves to make it
young and great again

  id picked steve because he was one of
the shining ones of earth id known from
the start that persuading him to wed a
martian woman would take plenty of
doing

earthians are funny that way
love to them is a complex thing a
web that has to be skillfully woven right
from the start beauty alone isnt enough
you have to say to them youll never
hold that woman in your arms cant you
see how hopeless it is

  then the iron goes deep if a love flies
straight in the teeth of despair and comes
out all right in the end it will be as strong
as death

  so id arranged for steve to stumble
on the mirror to pick up that two-way
televisual circuit into a very special para-
dise for two and id opposed and warned
him just to make sure hed think of him-
self as a man facing hopeless odds to win
through to an undying love

  on the other side it was easier azala
had fallen in love with steve before we
put her on the other end of that televisual
circuit but seeing him wounded and in
need of her had turned it into what earth-
ians call a great love

 perhaps earthians would someday
smash the aura that had flamed about the
heads of the martian rulers for fifty thou-
sand years

  id done my best to smash it i had gone
simply and humbly among earthians

stories

seeking a fresh wind to trundle the cin-
ders of a dying culture

  i dreamed of martians and earthians
standing equal and strong and proud
hands linked in friendship cemented by
bonds of kinship separated by no gulfs
such as now yawned before me separat-
ing me from steve

  i wanted to shout good luck steve
azala youre good kids and you deserve
the best

  then i remembered that steve was
nearly forty not quite a kid by earthian
standards but looking at azala i was
pretty sure that steve still had his best
years ahead of him

  i	wanted to go up to him and shake his
hand for the last time but now the hands
of my people were tugging at my should-
ers stripping off the earthian garments
id worn so long with scant respect for
my desire to be as human and regular as
the next guy

  they got the suit off and then i saw
the old familiar cloak purple and billow-
ing out with shimmering star images and

i	sltuddered a little because i knew id
never really feel at ease wearing it from
that moment on

  they got me into the cloak and they
bent down and straightened the stiff im-
perial folds and i was suddenly bored and
deathly weary

  a chill wind from the stars seemed to
blow over me but i stood straight and
still and allowed them to fasten on the
cloak the great glowing jewel id worn
from childhood

  steve saw me then he was sitting up
very straight his hand on azalas
tumbled red-gold hair and i heard him
say holy smoke

  i	stared down at the jewel blazing and
shuddering and shivering in the desert
air and i shut my eyes tight wishing for
the first time in my life that it did not
proclaim me tulan sharm the glorious
one temporal ruler of the seven cities
before whom the stars bowed

dalo stephensons finger wcrs just starting to mow tho button   

the bryd

the bryd was awakened

with a rude jolt it didnt even
have time for a mental yawn some-
thing- terrible was going on in dale stev-
ensons mind and the turmoil there made
the bryd most uncomfortable it shook
off the lethargy of its long sleep it knew
instinctively that dale stevenson was
about to get in trouble and make his mind
unsuitable for the bryds occupancy

  the bryd sighed these humans were

so unstable so impulsive the bryd took
a look around

  they - dale stevenson and he - were
not on earth they seemed to be in space
somewhere  miles from earth well
well so men finally were breaking the
shackles of gravitation the bryd became
a little more interested

  but dale stevenson was reaching for a
button that would fire a rocket to position
the mirror and bum a path across the



being immortal the bryd was a very wise and
resourceful thing-but even so the problem
of saving dale stephenson was a dilly so much
had to be done in one-fourth of a second
	planet

biggest city in europe hey what was
going on here anyway 

  the bryd had about a quarter of a
second to do a lot of research what was
dale stevenson doing up here what
had he done with himself in the twenty-
four years since the bryd had curled up
in the boys cozy four-year-old mind and
settled down for a long nap

  the bryd could have stayed dales
hand for a while but the bryd very much
believed in minding its own business it
didnt like to interfere with humans that
was policy so it decided to get busy it
had a quarter of a second to find out things
and decide what if anything to do about
them certainly it couldnt expect to stay
comfortably in a mind as upset as dale
stevensons  so it got busy

the first thing to do was get
oriented the bryd took a quick look
around dale stevenson doctor of phy-
sics was in charge of this sun-station
which was a man-made island in space
some three miles in diameter the rim of
the island was composed mainly of a steel
framework like the rim of a wheel with
little cabins at various intervals to house
a power plant various controls rocket
berths repair shops and living quarters
for the sun-stations crew

  the center area of the sun-station was
a giant mirror three miles across made up
of thin sheets of metallic sodium fastened
to a skeleton of wire nets the sodium was
very light in weight and being in airless
and heatless space was inert also it was
highly reflective

  the whole business was kept at a point
approximately  miles from earth
where earths gravitational attraction ap-
proached neutrality and where the entire
space-station could be maintained in a
given position or moved at will with a min-
imum expenditure of energy

    technically the station was owned by
night sun inc along with nearly a hun-
dred others around earth and this par-
ticular station no  was under con-
tract to furnish illumination at night over
paris france by staying out of earths
shadow and reflecting sunlight on paris
during the night

stories

  management of such a station involved
many mathematical factors in distance tri-
angulation with paris velocity and angula-
tion and control of the curve of the mir-
ror normally this was a parabolic curve
but it was constantly varied with other
factors to produce the desired degree of
illumination

  no  was under the sole control of
dale stevenson who had been psych-
tested and certified by the united nations
licensing board

  that made the bryd feel a little better
it looked as if he had made a mistake
twenty-four years ago but it also looked
as if the licensing board had been fooled
within the last year for dale certainly
was getting ready to cause a lot of trouble
in paris he could actuate the controls to
expand or contract the rim of the station
and thus vary the focal length of the so-
dium lens and if he should actually con-
centrate the suns rays in a small area he
could draw a flaming path of ruin through
the center of paris

  reluctantly the bryd checked again and
found that that was exactly what dale
stevenson was about to do the bryd won-
dered why it groaned humans were al-
ways up to something why couldnt they
relax so the bryd could rest

  the bryd had been so happy back in
-or lets see was it up in 
this was  that was when bob
whats-his-name and that cute girl had
landed on pluto and given him a chance to
get away the long lonely eons in plutos
absolute zero had been quite monotonous
to the bryd which was nothing but pure
energy but which certainly had its feelings
after almost a third of a billion years ma-
rooned on pluto it had sometimes almost
wished it had not been so adventurous in
its youth and hopped that stray comet as
it had swept by its home on arcturus

  for it had tired of the comet and jumped
off on pluto and then had discovered it
didnt have enough range of its own to
get from pluto to another planet then
it was that bob and alys had come along
on their round-the-system honeymoon and
the bryd had hitched a ride to earth un-
known to them for it was pretty darned
lonesome by that time
the bkyd

  it lived very happily with them until
they got old and then it decided to go back
in time to  there it found a nice
friendly mind in joe talbott and after it
saved joe from blowing up the lithium
mountain and half the earth with it it
had settled down to snooze in joes mind
and hadnt awakened until joe died of old
age then the bryd had hunted a nice
stable mind and had finally picked dale
stevenson who was four years old and
had curled up for another long quiet
snooze but now it was only twenty-four
years later and dale was in a bother

the bryd went deeper into dales
mind to see what was going on dale
was worried about something in fact he
had worried so much it had upset his normal
mental balance it seemed to have started
back about twenty years ago a few years
after the bryd had entered dales mind

  it seemed that dales parents had been
killed in an atomic blowup and dale
eight years old had been taken care of
by his older sister

  dont you worry dale she had told
him stoutly ill take good care of you
and ill buy your clothes and your school-
books and everything you wont have to
go to a home i wont let them take you

  thats what dale had been scared of
-going to a home he was happy with
marillyn she took good care of him and
somehow managed to keep the authorities
from finding out that a thirteen-year-old
girl was supporting a small boy

  dale had understood all those things
later when he started to the university
and they became curious about his back-
ground he realized then what she had
done

  ill remember all those things he told
her in the first fullness of young matur-
ity and his sudden realization of her loy-
alty youve practically devoted your life
to me i appreciate it youll see he said
embarrassed in this new knowledge but
humbly grateful

  he got a chance to show her for six
months after his graduation while he was
being trained at station no  he in-
sisted that she should come to visit his
new post marillyn never had ridden a



rocket because she was afraid of them
but she recognized the honor he was con-
ferring on her for very few persons but
employees had ever set foot on a sun-sta-
tion she agreed to go dale arranged pas-
sage then she was severely injured in the
take-off

  dale was devastated he called in spe-
cialists consultants diagnosticians

  dont worry about it he said ill
take care of everything youll be all right
in no time

  but she wasnt she was badly crippled
paralyzed from the waist down and she
became pitifully thin

  dale spent most of his salary on her
doctors told him it was useless nothing
could help that a part of her brain cells
had been destroyed and could not be re-
built that she might live fifty years but
she would always be helpless

  dale refused to believe it shes got to
get well he said it isnt right-after all
the things she did for me when she was
just a kid and should have been skating
and dancing and going with boys she was
working to keep me from going to a home
shes entitled to some fun now

  but she didnt have a chance her re-
covery would have been contrary to all
medical experience

dales salary grew until he was
getting twenty-five hundred a month
but most of it he spent on marillyn-
largely against her wishes

  dale i wish you wouldnt insist on
trying every new-fangled cure that comes
along i know what the situation is i can
read i know i wont get well i cant
when that brain-tissue is destroyed its
gone forever you go out and have some
fun please

  but dale worried but stubborn said
do you remember that winter you sold
papers on the street so i could have skates
and a sled do you think i can forget
that

  i didnt mean it to become a burden to
you she said softly

  he smiled it isnt a burden im do-
ing these things because i want to-be-
cause i want to see you active and pretty
again ill do it too youll see next
	planet

month youre going to the spa at carls-
bad

  she tried to dissuade him but next
month she was bundled up and carried to
the train to go to prague

  it was in prague that dale met ann
wondra last daughter of a long line of
polish nobility ann was dark-haired
quick-eyed and she could laugh in a way
that warmed a mans blood at any rate
she wanned dale stevensons

  they went hunting together they ate
dinner together they rode together they
visited marillyn together and after they
came away from marillyn in her wheel-
chair ann said when he stopped the car
on the top of a high hill in the moonlight
from where they could see her ancestral
castle youre determined that she shall
get well arent you dale

  of course he said

  what will you do if she doesnt
he refused to consider that she will
he said confidently

  by that time dales arms were tightly
around her so for that matter were
anns around dale

  you are quite sure ann said cautious-
ly-

  i suppose he said in an abrupt hum-
bleness its a fixation by now its some-
thing i recognize as a problem and the
best way to cure it is to cure marillyn
when i go out on a party or when i am
extravagant it nicks my conscience be-
cause marillyn made all these things pos-
sible for me in the first place

  it isnt your fault that shes an inva-
lid is it

  not directly no although she didnt
want to take that trip however i dont
think its that as much as it is the feeling
that if i get too much interested in other
things i might neglect her-that is i
might be somewhere else doing something
for fun just at the time when the oppor-
tunity would come to get her cured do
you see what i mean

  i think so she said gently

  for instance he went on very much
concerned with making her understand if
i should spend a lot of money on other
things-say for instance that i should
marry you and wed build a home and all

stories

-that would take a lot of money and ft
would make me unconsciously less eager
to find a cure for marillyn because deep
down id know i might not be able to pay
for it

  ann drew back in her arms her black
eyes reflected the starlight dale what
did you say  did you say if i should mar-
ry you

  he looked back at her uh-huh
youve never even said you loved
me

  he kissed her very tenderly on the
lips i do he said

  then they kissed so fiercely that the
bryd listening in solely to get an angle
on this whole business got excited and
very nearly got stuck crosswise in the time-
stream

but two weeks later dale
went to his post on sun-station no
 and started making paris days last
all night six months later he was back for
a visit and marillyn said id like to go
home dale after all youve done your
part and much more and this isnt help-
ing me its pleasant and all that but it
wont make me walk i could go to the
sanatorium in florida and it would be
just as pleasant and much less expensive
then you could pursue a normal course
of life

  dale pretended to bristle what do you
mean by that

  marillyn smiled ann is in love with
you dale she visits me often and you
should see her eyes sparkle when we men-
tion you dale will you see her tonight
maybe i will he said but there wont
be any marriage until you are well
youve been apart six months now
marillyn said softly maybe if you see
her you will change your mind

  ann would be a wonderful wife she
was much like marillyn-dark-haired
quick-moving dignified but warm affec-
tionate and loyal his wife would have
to be loyal of course like marillyn that
was essential

  he hired a car that afternoon and drove
out to the castle to surprise ann he
reached the grounds just before dark so
he parked the car on the hill where ann
the bryd



atd he had been that last night maybe
she and he would walk back there later

  he started to walk through the grounds
and when he reached the flower garden it
was almost dark he walked along the cin-
der-path by the roses then cut across the
grass he heard murmuring voices and
a moment later he saw ann walking in
the garden with her was a man and his
arm was around her the man stopped to
snap off a rose he turned to ann with
a graceful almost feminine gesture and
she smiled then with elaborate and
intimate motions he pinned the rose in her
hair

  dale was hurt he went bade quietly to
the car of course he had not asked her
to marry him but then he had mentioned
it-and couldnt she be loyal to his mem-
ory dale was filled with unexpected jeal-
ousy

  after a restless night he had just about
rationalized the entire situation he knew
the scene in the garden did not necessarily
mean anything he would phone ann
mention last night and of course she
would explain then he picked up the
morning telepaper from london and read
in the gossip column that ann wondra
the polish beauty might soon announce
her engagement to georges raoul du-
mont son of the french ambassador
dale was stricken-

  and was still in that state of mind the
bryd saw when a man came to his hotel
room that afternoon you are in charge
of sun-station no  over paris i be-
lieve

  this was very interesting to the bryd
because it saw that the man was cleverly
masked with a plastiform shell that did
not at all appear to be a mask

  yes dale said glumly

the mans eyes looked specula-
tive he glanced at the telepaper on
dales bed and the bryd figuratively
speaking-for of course the byrd was
nothing but pure energy-opened its eyes
for the bryd knew the mans thought
and was astonished to learn that dale had
been closely watched for some time fol-
lowing the scene in the flower garden the

item in the telepaper had been esperially

arranged to produce a certain reaction in
dale stevenson without ann wondras
knowledge

  you know of course the man said
that france is about to disturb world peace
by invading spain

  dale sat up and frowned no i didnt
know it

  it is true the man said watching him
intently

  why are you telling me

  the man cleared his throat significantly
you might be in a position to save the
world from an atomic war

  dale stiffened you must know he
said coldly what my position is i am in
the employ of the united nations and
any attempt to control my actions is coer-
cion and the penalty is death

  the man did not back away he moved
closer and his eyes became black points
of force the bryd saw that the man had
mental powers unusual for that period of
earths history

  look at me dale stevenson

  dale fought against it but the mans
will was powerful dales resistance weak-
ened the mans eyes never wavered from
dales he moved still closer and spoke
in a low tone our information is that
france will drop atomic bombs on spains
principal cities at three a m one week
from today suppose-just suppose-that
some other nation-some nation powerful
enough to do so-should be in a position
to warn france at two-thirty that france
would not be permitted to attack suppose
this warning were backed up with a show
of force to prove the warning meant busi-
ness

  isnt that the job of the u n 

  the mans face was only inches now
from dales the bryd shivered in its
figurative boots this man was a master
hypnotist only they wouldnt call him a
hypnotist in these days theyd call him a
psyche-man psyche-control was much
more powerful than hypnosis psyche-con-
trol touched the moral inhibitions which
hypnosis never had been able to do

  dale was lost in the end he agreed
for a cash-on-delivery fee of one hundred
thousand dollars to concentrate his sodi-


planet stories

um mirror beam on paris at two-thirty
of the morning designated and thereby
with a smoking path of fire and ruin help
the other nation to warn france that she
must keep hands off spain

  perhaps dales jealously of georges
raoul dumont had a bearing on the agree-
ment

dale had been so much under
the foreign agents influence that he
had not considered the ethics of the idea
at all until time to press the button that
would concentrate the sun-energy into a
consuming column of fire the time was
now    and it was only now with the
hypnosis just beginning to wear off at the
edges that he found himself wondering
vaguely about angles of the situation that
previously had not occurred to him

  who was the man who had talked to
him whom did he represent why
hadnt he gone to the u n if he knew
so much

  but then it was true as the man had
said-if france planned to start dropping
atomic bombs at three oclock it would
be too late to appeal to the u n dale
didnt like frenchmen anyway

  altogether the bryd concluded dale
stevenson was pretty muddled up in liifi
mind the man needed a rest but that
could be worked out later right now his
finger was on the firing-button and the
psyche-control though weakened was
pushing him to finish the job

  oh dear these humans certainly could
muddle things

  the bryd decided to have a look at ann
wondras mind and there it got some-
what startled for anns which previously
had been all warm and cozy as toast was
very low indeed she was looking at a
snapshot of dale and it wasnt even a
very good picture but it exhilarated her
and at the same time it depressed her be-
cause she wanted dale but couldnt have
him

  ann was sitting cross-legged on a thick
rug drinking darjeeling tea and talking
to her mother

  im glad m dumont has gone back
home she said and the bryd noted that
there wasnt any jump in her blood-pres-

sure when she mentioned georges name-
well not much anyway

  hes very handsome said her mother
knitting busily the old ladys blood-pres-
sure jumped more than anns

  but he isnt as nice as dale steven-
son

  my sakes ann i hope you dont grow
to be an old maid mooning over that
tongue-tied-

  mother ann got to her feet she
was long-legged and clean-limbed the
bryd approved of her it could imagine
by now what she had done to dales mind
it didnt see how it had slept through it

  so the bryd took a quick transition
back to america and had a look at the
mind of the doctor who took care of
marillyn stevenson the physician was
having lunch with a consultation expert

  you know the doctor said fingering
a manhattan-i dont know what to do
about young dale stevenson hes still
trying to cure his sister

  maybe theres a reason

  sure theres a reason he has this
feeling of gratitude and loyalty and all
thats all there is to it but hes butting
his head against the infinite inertia hes
spending two thousand a month on that
girl-and the worst of it is she doesnt
want him to she knows what the score
is and shes resigned to it

  well loyalty is a wonderful thing but
i suppose it can go too far and over-
shadow reason especially in the young is
there any chance at all for the girl

  no possibility progressive degenera-
tion of the brain tissue he tossed off
the manhattan and the bryd shuddered
-it preferred martinis itself the only
thing would be a miracle and you know
how scarce they are in the medical world
he smiled they both smiled the bryd
mentally snorted who were they to laugh
at miracles  they thought they were pretty
damn smart didnt they

  the bryd decided it had better look in
on marillyn

it found her in a glassed-in porch
of the sanatorium with her reclining
chair facing south and the sun pouring
down through the magnolias the bryd
the bryd



liked this every tiling was restful and
peaceful and pleasant-

  but something was wrong as hell in
marillyns mind

  she had a small bottle of something in
one hand under the light blanket and she
was lying back running over everything
in her mind dale loved ann and ann
loved dale but they couldnt get married
because of dales exaggerated sense of
duty

  marillyn didnt want to keep them apart
she could adjust herself to a very pleasant
life in a place like this but dale wouldnt
let her as fast as he could save some
money hed dream up some new scheme
to get her cured

  well marillyn reasoned she wasnt of
any use to anyliody why should she stay
in dales way the bryd was puzzled
what did she think she could do

  she had the little bottle under die blan-
ket she was thinking a few drops of
that and-the bryd was positively flabber-
gasted the girl was getting ready to kill
herself the bryd probed into her mind
for an instant and discovered that she
wasnt being a martyr and had no com-
plexes she was just trying to straighten
things out for dale and ann

  oh beans thought the bryd if hu-
mans werent the dumbest beings ever it
watched marillyn raise the bottle to her
lips it simultaneously took the form of a
nurse standing there at marillyns side
and marillyn gasped and said oh nurse
i didnt know you were there

  i am said the bryd in its best con-
tralto voice did you wish something
miss

  the hand with the botde of poison fell
back under the blanket no i didnt call

  may i move your chair out of the sun
miss 

  it isnt in the sun marillyn said

  the bryd raised its eyebrows it did
some quick work on the wind and there
was the sun shining steadily through an
opening in the magnolia trees

  perhaps it is too bright said marillyn
if youd just move it over there-

  the bryd was delighted in the process
of moving the chair it got its figurative
hands on the bottle and disintegrated it

then it said miss dont you think you
will get well

  marillyn said calmly resignedly
theres no chance none whatever when
brain-tissue is gone there is nothing med-
ical science can do they cant build tis-
sue you know

  oh said the bryd

  only a miracle said marillyn and
miracles dont happen in medical science
the bryd almost snorted aloud oh
they didnt hey it-

  the head nurse came striding up
her leather heels clacking on the tile floor
miss- she looked puzzled who are
you anyway she demanded ive never
seen you before

 these women maybe the bryd was
getting peevish in its old age but why
couldnt people mind their own business
for a change

  it resolved itself into a doctor and it
was gratified to watch the head nurses
eyes shoot open

  madam the bryd said in its best
baritone were you addressing me

  i- the head nurse swallowed no
sir i-i beg your pardon sir she re-
covered slightly have i seen you be-
fore sir

oh bother details details hu-
mans wouldnt be happy if they
werent tied up in details all the time the
bryd dematerialized and went inside the
sanatorium by the simple process of flow-
ing through the spaces around the nuclei
of the atoms in the wall then on second
thought it went back and erased some mem-
ories from the mind of the head nurse
then it took marillyn through the wall
into the sanatorium it went into her mind
and did some repair work that would have
amazed the finest brain surgeons on earth
in a few months marillyns paralysis
would be gone and she would be well and
happy miracles did they say welltheyd
asked for it

  the bryd was somewhat irked with it-
self for having interfered-but it had

stories

jbeen for the best

  it got on a tight beam and went bade
to sun-station no  dale stevensons
finger was just starting to move the but-
ton there was maybe a fiftieth of a sec-
ond left

  the bryd carefully implanted the
knowledge of marillyns cure in a comer
of dales brain and sat back to await re-
sults but in the next hundredth of a sec-
ond there was no response dale still was
about to turn the sun on paris

  so the bryd now thoroughly disgusted
implanted the knowledge of anns love
in another corner of dales mind and then
to its astonishment had to jump fast to
get out of the way

  did that ever get results dale held his
finger he got up and rubbed his forehead
a moment then he went to the radio-
phone get me the u n police head-
quarters in london he said

  he stood there beating his brains to
figure out what had gotten into him so
the bryd just felt around and erased a
few memories and everything was all
right then the bryd climbed into its fav-
orite cozy spot in dales mind the  spot
was still wann and snuggly it began to
settle down - but then it remembered
something

  it got up it went back to earth and
hunted up the minds of the men who
were flying atom-bombs over france the
bryd knew by now of course that france
herself had never had any atom-bombs

  the bryd went into the minds of the
foreign fliers and sent them back to drop
the atom-bombs on their own cities after
all they had those bombs and they ap-
parently were the kind who wouldnt be
satisfied until they could drop them the
bryd dusted off its hands and headed wear-
ily for sun-station no  it hoped for
many restful years ahead with dale and
ann

  if it didnt get them the bryd thought
disgustedly it had better try to hitch a
ride back to pluto at least it had had
rest and quiet there
the problem was simple-or rather simply stated zoya lar-tui
must keep those nasty aggressive little earthmen from discov-
ering the location of his home-star

a short story by h b fyfe

as ullo dah-gow waddled
into the section communications
chamber on yaradir second planet
of zillor two of his four walking tenta-
cles stuck slightly on a nearly dry spot
fire and dry sand he swore at the

technicians cant you two even keep the
footing decently moist

  without waiting for an answer he made
his way to the row of shallow mud tubs
before the television screen the opera-
tors aimed eyestalks at each other finally

yado nol-moz as junior rose and went
to the wall controls of the conditioner

  the assistant supervisor was relieved to
see a thin sheet of water creep across the
floor he never knew when yado or viri
nol-rin might choose to ignore him

  which comes of old ahnu loading this
section with his nephews he thought bit-
terly forgetting that in his own office he
already had a list of his own relatives pre-
pared against the day when he should
succeed to the post of supervisor of co-
lonial scouting for sector 

  the slap-slap of tentacles in the corri-
dor announced the arrival of his superior
ahnu nol-yev entered and lowed his
thick body into the choicest of the mud
tubs which ullo had prudently left free

  now whats this urgent message he
demanded pointing one eyestalk at ullo
and fixing the other upon the screen above
viris broad bony head

  a request for orders from scout zoya
lar-tul answered viri assigned to
   let me see    system ll--

  did we have any report on that sys-
tem asked ahnu

  yado produced the tape of a preliminary
report and placed it on the speaker the
list of facts rolled out number of plan-
ets   number with sufficient water for
colonization    number of intelligent
species-one on third planet    native
nomenclature-star sol own  planet
earth others   and so on

  all right wheezed ahnu i remem-
ber now get hold of    whatsisname   
zoya

viri manipulated his keys and knobs
the brief delay before an answering
image appeared on the screen irritated ah-
nu the loose coppery scales around his
thick neck glinted with iridescent high-
lights as he puffed out his air-sacs

  dessication he snarled we bridge
all those light-years with subspace waves
for his benefit and he cant be alert enough
to-got him now viri 

  the technician snapped the tip of a
gripping tentacle in assent another yara-
dirian looked out at them from the screen

  this one had obviously been roughing

it his scales were lubricated by only a
minimum film of moisture and he wore
space harness on the lower part of his
body

  to keep his ivalking tentacles wet ullo
realized he hasnt so much as a drop of
ziater on the floor of that dive

  zoya lar-tul announced viri

  stated simply said ahnu bluntly
what is your trouble

  stated simply great one answered
the scout i am in imminent danger of
detection by natives of this system

  ullo stiffened in his mud tub he heard
the slurp as the supervisor splashed more
mud upon the oozing floor

  how is that demanded ahnu his
throat again beginning to expand majes-
tically

  i fail to see replied zoya in what
manner i could have avoided it great
one the natives earthmen in their own
speech have just discovered an inefficient
form of our own interstellar subspace
drive they have gone exploring

  might have knozvn it thought ullo just
when fm working up to a top rank too

  it sounded bad should they be unable
to think zoya out of his predicament it
might well mean new personnel all around
ullos only satisfaction was that ahnus
relatives would be discharged before his
own resignation was given him to sign

  ahnu controlled himself

  give me a picture of your situation
he commanded

  to begin with great one i chose to
study the natives from a distance as is
usual i left my subspace ship on the larg-
est satellite of their sixth planet which
has several other moons and a beautiful
set of rings that-

  kindly touch bottom ahnu cut him
off i am not interested in a local travel-
ogue 

  even so great one with my short-
range rocket i then established this base
on the seventh moon of their fifth planet
only this moons smallness and insignif-
icance has so far prevented by discovery

  they listened to the rest of the story in
an uncomfortable silence that was broken
only by an occasional squishing of mud
open invitation



as one or another stirred uneasily

  zoya lar-tul had observed the earth-
men as well as other bodies in the system
for a quarter-revolution of his chosen fifth
planet at the time of his arrival the na-
tives had reached their own satellite but
he judged that they would be long in or-
ganizing successful flights to the planets

  i translated some of their broadcasts
and learned that this was their great cur-
rent project naturally however i was
unconcerned and contented myself with
obtaining specimens for my researches by
brief discreet trips here and there

ullo snapped his tentacle tip quietly
in assent he remembered from his
history the dreadfully long period of his
own races expansion throughout the sys-
tem of zillor these earthmen however
seemed from zoyas report to possess cer-
tain advantages their requirements of air
and water were moderate and more easily
stored in a space vessel if they had dis-
covered a form of subspace drive they
might be energetic enough to pop up in
the vicinity of zillor some fine day

  you will imagine my amazement con-
tinued zoya when i heard one of their
broadcasts announce that a ship had
reached their fourth planet and another
the second-

  ahnu blew out a long bubbling breath
all this is doubtless interesting he
snorted but what is the immediate emer-
gency 

  the image of zoya aimed both eye-
stalks rather deliberately at the supervi-
sor

  they reached and passed this group
of satellites he hissed out do i make
clear my dilemma great one

  he waited while ahnus neck swelled
dangerously just before the explosion he
continued

  should they discover me they will also
find the specimens i have collected ex-
cept the choicer ones stored on my sub-
space vessel for transport home this is
what i mean-

  zova reached out to touch a button and
the scene changed to what was evidently

-planet stories-may

the dissecting laboratory of his base be-
hind a transparent bulkhead hung several
sorts of carcasses in various stages of
dismemberment ullo suspected that the
storeroom was simply left at the tempera-
ture of the moons surface

  very well exclaimed ahnu as the
scout reappeared you seem to be operat-
ing a sort of butcher shop with some of
the most ugly specimens ever seen what
about it

  ullo felt sorry for the scout even he
-indeed as he saw by the twitch of their
eyestalks even the technicians-had real-
ized the problem zoya patiently explained
forbearing to mention that his instructions
were laid out by ahnu

  if you will refer to descriptions in my
preliminary report great one you will
see that certain of the specimens are earth-
ttiett themselves should their explorers
discover them i have reason to believe
they would le resentful it is my opinion
that they are a belligerent race

  ahnu was silent for a moment

  well    yes    that is possible he
admitted

  it would appear he continued in an-
other moment that you must either aban-
don your base or dispose of your speci-
mens if as you say the earthmen have
so soon reached your vicinity

  zoya waited ullo stirred in his tub
  if i may suggest great one-
  yes

  i believe he should destroy his sub-
space ship

  what

  i am inclined to agree zoya lar-tul
put in

amazed ahnu waited for ullos
reasons encouraged by such consid-
eration the latter went on

  if these earthmen are already on their
way to the ringed planet they will un-
doubtedly stop first at the largest moon
-where zoya has left his main ship
and will likely discover it there ah-
nu agreed reluctantly

  and from that point continued ullo
they will discover both our location in
space and the interstellar subspace drive
	planet

in its finished form after that they can
get at usf

  the opposite extreme of my dilemma
confirmed zoya

  silence ordered ahnu let me
think

  all of them-supervisor assistant tech-
nicians and the image on the screen-
considered the situation gloomily the
government of yaradir would take a dry
view of having to combat an invasion
should one develop from this the race of
yaradir because of their personal require-
ments and life conditions were not as nu-
merous as most of the races they had
found in their explorations the great dis-
tances between their colonies and the grow-
ing number of these were due to the com-
parative rarity of the type of planet that
suited them

  can you reach the ship in your local
rocket in time to escape in it asked
ahnu after all subspace ships are cost-
ly if we leave a deserted base what can
they find out

  it is possible admitted zoya doubt-
fully but risky

  what do you mean

  they may intercept me on the way for
their ships are faster than my rocket they
may even catch the big ship before i gain
enough speed to shift into subspace drive
for all we know interrupted ullo
forgetting his place they may be able
to keep up with you even then

  ahnu bubbled angrily at the idea but
they all were silent for another unhappy
period of cogitation

  perhaps admitted ahnu in the end
you will have to destroy the subspace
ship but only in the last extremity

  i could blow it up from space if i get
within range

  not so fast that ship is a major item
in the budget ahnu told him angrily
the first thing is to try to get aboard
unseen and return to pick up what you
can from your base

  and if these eartfanen are nearby
ullo asked

  then zoya must forget the base and
escape with the ship which is the main
thing

stories

  but if they have already found it
inquired zoya

  all right all right then destroy it
and you had better start immediately un-
less you wish to find such action neces-
sary somehow-here one eyestalk was
deflected rather pointedly toward ullo-
somehow too many mouths always speed
up the clocks

  ullo did a little neck-swelling himsel
at this example of bias

  just because he couldnt get my job for
his youngest brother he thought resent-
fully serve him right if id resigned
whered he be if i didnt stick here to
push his snout into the obvious every time
he slides over itt

  yes repeated ahnu complacent at
having found his solution that is what
you must do if anything goes wrong
you can still use your rocket to return to
your base

  which i hope sighed zoya to find
undisturbed

at that ahnu fell silent after a
tense moment he heaved himself
around to direct both eyestalks at ullo

  well he wheezed have you no
suggestions in case he does have to des-
troy the subspace ship

  ullo twirled one tentacle tip in the
mud of his tub until he collected a sticky
blob this he flipped away with a snap of
the tentacle he derived a slight satis-
faction from the splat against the far wall

  we must try to preserve one of his
collections of information he said it
would entail considerable expense-not to
mention time-to replace zoya and repeat
the scouting

  ahnu shifted his position irritably ul-

lo	saw that his reference to expense had
been a shrewd blow the supervsor
snorted and bubbled but finally conceded
that much and gestured for ullo to con-
tinue

  so it would be unfortunate if he should 
succeed in regaining his big ship only to
return to his base and find it occupied by
exploring earthmen

  what do you suggest then

  he should try for either the base or
open invitation	

the ship and arrange to destroy the oth-
er if he can remain undetected for a short
time at the base he can dispose of his
specimens after forwarding a report on
them if he gets to the ship safely why
leave behind any clues at all

  after considerable wheezing and puf-
fing it was agreed that zoya should take
a chance on having his base discovered
while he was away but provide for the
eventuality by arranging a bomb that
would be set off by the approach of any
strange ship he admitted that he already
had one keyed to be safe only after cer-
tain signals from his own rocket he had
only to hook it up

  if you do have to return advised
ullo clean out your dissecting room and
then make friends with the earthmen
give them some story of being cast away
and ask help in building a new ship

  you mean    install our kind of drive
without their knowing

  exactly said ahnu taking to the
idea then just drop out of sight some
fine day and leave them wondering which
way you went

  at this point viri made bold to request
that zoya leave the televisor at the base
operating with a continuous view of the
main chamber as now shown he began
to explain that he wanted to be sure not
to lose contact but ahnu had heard
enough he cut viri short by climbing
out of his mud tub

  that settles it then he summed up to
zoya if you are forced to destroy the
subspace ship report from the base wfren
you return and are ready to contact the
natives otherwise report from the ship
he waddled out of the communications
chamber without ceremony followed by
ullo dah-gow

the next day the latter was kept
busy with the many reports of arid
planets he had to file in order to justify
the expenses of exploration

  he always leaves explaining the budget
to me he thought

  he did however snatch time to put a
copy tape of the last installment of zoyas
preliminary report on the speaker having

felt ill at ease for not being completely up
to date at the previous evenings confer-
ence

  halfway through a listing of sociologi-
cal and psychological observations ullo
stiffened he ran the tape through again

  hed better get to that ship he
wheezed to himself they sound like a
nest of trouble-makers-resourceful ag-
gressive just the sort to burst into this
system some sweet day and tell us yara-
dir is their colony

  he ripped the tape out of the speaker
and hurried along a dank corridor to ah-
nus office not even pausing at his favor-
ite spots to rub against the cool dripping
walls he found his chief relaxing in an
adjoining chamber by submitting to a mas-
sage

  not now complained ahnu at the
first mention of earthmen wait till we
hear from zoya i want to enjoy having
my scales oiled in peace

  ullo spitefully dropped the tape into a
pot of scale-grease on the way out but
dutifully returned to his work

  late one night however he was re-
minded of the scout in system ll--
the emergency buzzer beside his sleeping
pool awoke him with an urgent summons
the number on the screen beside it indi-
cated the communications chamber now
reserved for zoya lar-tul

  still dripping ullo pumped down the
corridor encountering his chief at the
last turn ahnu was irritated

  what can they have spoiled now he
demanded as if he suspected ullo of hav-
ing had a tentacle in it it was a per-
fectly simple arrangement

  perhaps something unexpected came
up suggested ullo

  what could be unexpected it was ut-
terly simple said ahnu explosively if
he beats them to it he renorts from the
ship otherwise he destroys it and goes
back to report from his base

  he slap-slapned irately into their des-
tination wondering audibly why he had
to come down here and direct peoples
eyestalks for them

  because great one replied viri nol-
rin a trifle more abruptly than was con-


planet stories

sistent with proper respect for ahnus po-
sition the televisor at zoyas base has
gone dead

  what why if you cant keep in
communication-

  there isnt any communication inter-
rupted viri

  ullo saw that the operator was deeply
disturbed to interrupt-actually inter-
rupt-ahnu nol-yev even if one was
his nephew

  that is why if you will remem-
ber viri went on i insisted zoya leave
his signal in operation the chance that
his base would be approached by a strange
ship sooner than we hoped and blow up
so the bomb went off said ullo

  it must have and by the figures zoya
gave me before he left he is long long
overdue at the subspace ship

  well what of it demanded ahnu
it merely means he will have to report
from the ship when he  if he  if
they dont-

  he snorted and wheezed into silence

ullo traded stares with viri then
he looked at yado who wore an
equally unhappy expression on his wide
risage

  are you sure he would have reached
the ship before now ahnu demanded
completely

  the supervisor swore feelingly using
some of the bleakest and driest terms ullo
had ever heard the gist of the diatribe
was the delay and expense

  now it may be yaras before we get
his data

  how do you mean asked ullo

  its obvious isnt it he must have
had to destroy the ship but before he
got back some prowling earthmen set
off the charge at his base that leaves him
with only his rocket dont you see what
it means

  perhaps not said ullo

  why hell have to make friends with
those things from earth and get help
building a new ship until then well have
to classify his report pending

  he sloshed watery mud about as he
heaved himself from his tub impatiently

ullo aimed an eyestalk at each of the
technicians keeping them silent until ahnu
had waddled indignantly from the room

  i knew we didnt cover all the alterna-
tives that night said ullo feelingly
how could we be so dry inside the skull
how could we

  he certainly doesnt like the delay
commented yado

  delay snorted ullo then he asked
is that what it means to you too

  viri and yado fidgeted under his stare

  i keep wondering if zoya reached the
ship said ullo

  they stared at him

  say it this way then if zoya reached
the ship

  viri sighed

  i suppose we may never find out what
really happened he said

  i believe i would really rather not
ullo told them preparing to leave listen
in to a complete copy of the preliminary
report zoya sent and you will see what
i mean

  his scales were too dry and needed an
oiling he told himself but he knew it was
more than that which sent the shudder
through him and there were billions of
them

  what shall we do asked viri

  i dont know what good it will do
said ullo pausing in the doorway but
you might make your wills personally i
intend to apply for transfer to some colony
lving in the opposite direction from this
sol record of us and a ship to reach us
-we might as well have sent them an
invitation

he remembered their unhappy
eyes two yaras later when the regu-
lar bulletin tapes sent out to the colonies
reported ahnus dismissal ullo applied
for a post at a more distant colony

  after one yara at the new post the
monthly tapes from yaradir were inter-
rupted everybody complained about the
service

  everybody but ullo

  he commandeered a subspace ship and
moved on

  but not    far    enough   
      it was the story behind the biggest story on mars-how
 fate had grimly reckoned with the rockhead rastol-but

dateline mars

by richard wilson

scott warren snapped
off the vision screen and sat down
in front of his typewriter through
the glass side f the building he could
see the lights of the celebrations whose
sounds he had just silenced he lighted
a cigarette and started to type out the
final edition of today on mars for trans-
mission by interradio to the new york
bureau of the galactic news service he

started the news roundup

 iopa mars-gn-events on
mars were at a snailspace today the
midpoint of the traditional three-day
landing day holiday  

  scott rolled the paper up in the car-
riage of his typewriter and jagged a line
through what he had written four days
in the same sentence might get past
the night desk but the new york bureau




planet

stories

chief would send him a memo about it in
the morning

  he started again

      landing day celebrations on
mars are at their midpoint tonight with
both earth people and natives   

  he xed out natives and substituted
martians remembering the memo hed
got about that

      both earth people and martians
forgetting their political and physical dif-
ferences to take part in planetwide car-
nivals business houses government offi-
ces and stores have been closed down since
friday and pleasure is king the two
great cities on mars-iopa and senalla
-are ablaze with light from their desert
outskirts to the quarter-mile-high govern-
ment buildings that mark the center of
each parades speeches 

  scott snubbed out his cigarette shoved
his chair away from the desk he looked
out over iopa toward the government
building spotted in searchlight rays from
all sides of the city it was bad enough
writing this stuff-bad enough grinding
out a routine night lead to be later dic-
tated to interradio for transmission across
space to earth simply because the news
schedule demanded two daily mars round-
ups-

  but it wasnt even the truth

he truth was that both earth
people and martians were observing
landing day with the usual fuss-but that
it was all a big masquerade the oldtime
distrust of terrestrials that had come with
the first spaceship was still there it had
never been completely wiped out the
only ones being taken in were the people
back home who knew nothing about mars
except what they were told by people like
scott warren and who usually saw it
only as a red pinpoint in the sky if the
weather happened to be right

  when he got to thinking this way scott
warren felt more like a propagandist for
world government than a newsman-the
chief of the mars bureau of galactic
news he wished he could tell them the
truth a truth not dictated by policy some
day hed write a book that was what all
newsmen said wasnt it tbe truth would

have gone something like this

  the distrust martians have for earth
people - yes that includes you dear
friends of the reading listening and view-
ing audience-wasnt completely wiped out
even when world government corrected
its first monumental blunder oh yes
wg has made blunders and the first
was a whooperdoo ladies gentlemen and
prodigies a whooperdoo of the first order
a dilly whose details still are skirted when
we talk about it because theyre very
very embarrassing

  the first spaceship you see dealt nat-
urally enough with those who had seemed
to be the rulers of mars if not the duly
elected representatives of the pee-pul and
so did the earth emissaries who followed
these martians in the welcoming party
were a crafty race stockily built with over-
sized heads like granite hard-bargaining
and double-crossing rockheads we called
them and still do underestimating them

  as our politicians point out with pride
there has been no colonization of mars-
as such not even despite the cries of the
imperialists back home and there has
been no war you will remember although
for a while it was touch and go

  among the first to come from earth
were the world government commissions
ce a-exploration and assessment
ced-economic development cii-
industrial integration chw came later
-health and welfare and so did cie-
information and education

  it all worked very smoothly mars
you remember was the goal of space-flight
for half a century ever since the pioneer
hop to the icy rock of the moon and the
planning commission had it all set up in
advance from martian relations right
down to war planning top secret in the
if necessary category

  but earth muffed it and good the
rockheads of mars who met the space-
ship and whose delegations worked with
the earth emissaries were intelligent peo-
ple true-but they were the fascists of

mars what world government didnt
know and couldnt have known was that
there had been a military revolution on
the red planet a short ten years before
the first spaceship landed and that in that
dateline mars	

revolution the democratic government of
the planet was overthrown and its lead-
ers killed or banished

scott warren took an imaginary
sip of water and paced up and down
his imaginary lecture platform he pointed
a finger at his imaginary classroom

  the big shots of wg had found out
about it of course it didnt take them
too long only about two years went by
before they were convinced of what had
happened and they had had suspicion of
it long before but it took wg twenty
years to do anything about it twenty years
mind you when the average lifespan of
a martian is forty

  of course there were reasons good
sound diplomatic reasons in the first
place it would have been embarrassing to
act sooner there had been such hoopla
and ballyhoo during the first negotiations
with the rockheads so many grandiose
statements and telepix of interplanetary
amity that to have confessed then would
have been diplomatic suicide-or so they
thought so the fiction had been main-
tained not only maintained but magnified
and distorted

  so bad did the distortion becqme that
the people back home had almost no ink-
ling of the difficulties in negotiation of
the many concessions earth had to make
to mars totalitarian rulers they didnt
know how many insults the earth envoys
had to swallow or of the innumerable
conferences that ended in deadlock because
of the rockheads impossible demands-
demands made to impress their own sub-
ject people with their might-or of the
wg investigators who were imprisoned
because they had stumbled across some
particularly noisome secret of the corrupt
martian government

  scott was getting quite wound up he
was pointing a finger again when the door
opened his finger paralyzed in midair

  the thing that entered was taller than
he the entire upper half of it was a face
an idiotically-grinning white-toothed face
its eyes were outlined in black and its
lips were an oversized red a caricature
of a womans face with a great mass of
blonde hair coiled fantastically above

  what the hell said scott

  the figure bent forward and the huge
mask came off

  hello scott a girl said

  my terrestrial aunt said scott
ylia

  she was a martian the daughter of
one of the subcommissioners of her gov-
ernment ylia wasnt pretty by any earth
standard she had the big head of her
race the stocky body and the flat face
but she was esteemed by the martians as
attractive as far as looks count on that
planet

  why the mask asked scott i didnt
think you went in for all this brothers-
together nonsense

  everybodys masked tonight she said
meaning all the women i had to see you
and i thought id attract less attention if
i wore one too

  scott knew what the masks represented
they were brought out every landing day
and worn in the streets for the traditional
celebrations the masks were all of wo-
men-earth women few earth women
had come to mars but earths advertising
had come as soon as the planet was opened
to trade and with the ads had come the
art which hadnt changed in centuries a
pretty face it was reasoned-if there was
any reasoning-ought to sell as much soap
or cigarettes on mars as it had on earth
hence the masks representing earths
greatest contribution thus far to the cul-
ture of its neighboring planet-advertis-
ing and the female face

  whats up ylia scott asked
were having a meeting sort of and
father would like you to come if you
can

  why sure he said when is it
anytime you get there you see youre
sort of part of it

  will there be anything i can use in the
roundup scott asked theres nothing
in it so far except color stuff on landing
day it has to go off in a few hours
youre the newsman ylia said why
not come and see

  good enough he said

  theres something father would like
you to bring with you

  i dont usually carry a gun said
	planet

scott but i guess i could scrounge one
up if i had to

  nothing like that i think you have
what he needs right in your files the
green arrow affair you do have it dont
you 

  of course we have copies of all the
stories on it that galactic sent out i can
dig them up in a couple of minutes

  no said ylia not that part of it
what we want is the information you
didnt send out

  oh said scott

the green arrow was the name
the news services had given a guer-
rilla leader whod spearheaded the resis-
tance movement against the rockheads be-
fore world government had got around to
any definite action the name came from
a chalk symbol he had left behind him after
each raid or foray around the green
arrow had rallied a handful of partisans
who had not been content with wgs
slow and not-so-sure methods of deposing
the rockhead regime they were men of
ideals and more than that of action
somewhere in the desert below syrtis had
been the arrows headquarters all the
punitive expeditions of the rockheads had
failed to find him no one had known who
he was on the rare occasions that an
arrow man was captured no amount of
torture could get a single secret from him

  the damage the green arrow did to
the rockheads was negligible in its over-
all effect but he had been more than a
night raider-hed been a symbol to the
people in the rockhead yoke that some-
one was actively on their side there was
a tremendous lift in spirit each tima the
arrow hit a rockhead target and for days
thereafter people in the community where
he had struck-and in others too-
were more cocky and less cooperative than
the rockheads thought they had a right
to be the arrows raids sparked slow-
down movements and some sabotage and
evoked rockhead reprisals against guilty
and innocent alike some of the reprisals
were cruel-so cruel that they would have
deterred a less determined man-but the
green arrow was not to be swayed he
remained-even after he was captured and

stories

executed-a symbol of liberty in a land
which had not tasted such a blessing for
years

  galactic news had covered the green
arrow story from start to finish gn
gave it the full treatment despite threats
from the rockheads and the denial to it
of certain newsgathering facilities more
than that scott warren got permission
from gns new york headquarters to
send a man out to interview the arrow
the reporter got through where all the
anti-partisan forces of the rockheads had
failed and interviewed the arrow in his
desert headquarters that interview was
the journalistic beat of the year-and was
highly embarrassing to the rockheads
shortly thereafter the reporter was ar-
rested by the rockhead secret police and
it took all the influence of world govern-
ment to have him released the name of
that reporter was george mercer he was
now covering the martian parliament for
galactic news

  there had been more in mercers story
than had been made public however be-
fore galactic broke the story it went with
it to wg a high diplomatic official there
in the interests of security asked gn to
withhold one fact and galactic agreed
as things turned out it was nothing wg
hadnt known but something in the nature
of a politico-military secret it was the
name of the green arrow

scott warren knew what the
name was but it meant nothing to
him he got mercers original story out
of the files-it had once been kept in a
safe-and put it in an inside pocket

  this used to be classified material
he said to the girl its not any more i
dont know why you want it

  ylia smiled are you ready to go

  he nodded she put the grotesque mask
on again and the two of them left the
building

  ylias father was kring a sub-commis-
sioner of commerce in the government of
president murain the news services had
begun the custom of transliterating mar-
tian names into pronounceable english the
wg language and wg itself later
adopted it murain was a symbol of
dateline mars	

world governments diplomatic triumph
as earth chose to regard it for two dec-
ades the dirty political game of collabora-
tion with the rockheads had been played
-although it was on such a high level
that diplomacy was considered the proper
word it ended finally with free elections
-the first since the military coup

  the elections were the result of wgs
long psychological siege against the rock-
heads the men from earth played on
the vanity of the complacent dictators un-
til they believed they could be the peoples
choice voluntarily it was a masterpiece
scott had to admit-but a masterpiece of
striped-pants double-cross on the one
hand the earthmen pumped up the egos
of the rockheads and on the other they
smuggled the democratic leader s- those
who still lived-out of their desert siber-
ias and let them talk to the people in
thousands of small indoor gatherings

  the people anywhere-whether its in
iopa or middletown-are smart if they
have the facts these people went to the
polls and booted the rockheads out it
was close and there was some violence
when wg watchers arrested repeaters
from the rockheads machine but the
dictatorship went down in a relatively
peaceful manner the democratic coup
evoked a singing story from scott war-
ren who was then newly-assigned to the
post of mars bureau chief the story won
him a journalistic prize

  the election also provoked a counter-
revolution by the rockheads which had
to be put down by world governments
police trooos that was another story and
it won scott a rest leave on earth-which
he cut short to get irack to the news beat
which he found strangely he had an un-
accountable hankering for

  and so democratic government returned
to mars and everything was dandy-for a
while

scott and ylia pushed their way
through the celebrating crowds the
big grinning masks of earth women were
moving chaotically idiotically all around
them spotlights which were partly heat-
lamps played over the threng in their
many colors coloring and wanning the

night scene musicians in outlandish cos-
tumes circulated in groups of three or
four their reedy tunes conflicting and
yet mingling in a pleasing semi-harmony

  most of the crowds were martians but
here and there a party of earth people
was taking part in the gaiety in the warm
glow of one big spotlight an earthman
was dancing with a martian girl her
mask and his fantastic steps parodying a
popular terrestrial ballroom team

  suddenly there was an intrusion into
this scene of celebration from a side street
into the main square which scott and ylia
were now going through there came a
knot of people they came on slowly
about a dozen of them their steady prog-
ress in contrast to the aimless carefree
motions of the rest their faces were seri-
ous and the group held both martians
and earthmen they were young-old faces
young in age but old in their apparent
contempt for the scene all round them
the group remained close together not
costumed and when a reveler pulled at
the sleeve of one in invitation to join a
chain dance he was pushed away brusque-
ly almost angrily when the group reached
a well-lighted position near the center of
the square its members formed them-
selves into a tight circle they pulled signs
from beneath their tunics and thrust them
up then began moving in a shuffling lock-
step chanting discordantly they were
pickets-serious almost fanatic young men
of two planets bound together in their
cause their signs read down with the
earth imperialists democracy not
mockery what are you celebrating-
colonization  and so on

  they chanted the same things out of
unison so that their voices created a
nerve-tingling atmosphere of unrest they
shouted defiantly yet not looking any-
where but at the neck of the man directly
ahead in the revolving picket line reds
picket landing day fete scott said to
himself thinking in headline terms

  there was tension now among the cele-
brants in this part of the square this was
not a time for problems or for thinking
about them and those who had gathered
to have fun were being robbed of their
spree
	plajvet

  abruptly a martian stepped up and in
a quick motion wrested a sign from one of
the pickets he ripped it up and danced
on the pieces the picket whose sign had
been snatched made no protest aside from
a look of surprise and a frown he stayed
in ranks and the circle continued to go
round

  cheers went up and other revelers
pressed forward the marchers tightened
their ranks and took firmer grips on their
signs the martian who had snatched the
first was now conferring with others be
motioned to a group of silently-standing
musicians and they took up a tune the
music was rousing and patriotic and
some costumed martians went into a wild
snake dance with apparent good humor
but with telling effect they drove into the
circle of pickets and split them into two
groups in the scramble several more
signs were trampled underfoot more rev-
elers joined the attack and the pickets
were split again until they were widely
separated and all their signs were gone
their unity lost they disappeared in the
crowd

  the musicians switched to a gayer tune
and there were cheers and laughter the
martian who had grabbed down the first
sign was hoisted into the air where he
bowed his over sized head grinning

  the interruption of the fun was ended
and without violence scott and ylia moved
on

but scott knew the picketing had
been only one manifestation of a smol-
dering problem there was truth in those
signs and the people knew it they just
hadnt wanted to be reminded of it now
and besides most of them didnt want
their thinking done for them by the left-
wingers who proclaimed the right of the
people but too often in history had aborted
the very rights they spoke of so feelingly

  the limited democracy the people now
enjoyed had been hard-won it was not
perfect they knew and they suspected
that there was corruption here and there
either in their own government or in wg
but the martian people had had a belly-
ful of violence the force used by the
rockheads just lately overthrown in a

stories

peaceful election was fresh in their minds
and they were willing to go along for a
while with president murain-at least to
give him a chance

  they trusted murain he was one of
them but scott was aware that murain
himself was too trusting the martian
president was a grateful man and his
gratitude had made him less suspicious
than a politician should be

  where the rockheads had driven hard
bargains with earth murains represen-
tatives drove none at all they trusted
their deliverers-the men of wg-to do
the right thing and the earthmen some
of them were doing the right thing-but
for themselves

  where the martian democratic govern-
ment had once lost to the fascists through
force it was now losing to friends who
were rooking it in a perfectly legitimate
businesslike way the commission on ex-
ploration and assessment had now become
known off the record as a  e-assess-
ment and exploitation the business and
industries which should have made the
martians prosper-which should have giv-
en them the schools and housing they had
been robbed of by the rockheads-these
had their profits skimmed off and sent to
earth the martians had their freedom
now true but they couldnt eat it or build
with it

  ylia pulled at scotts sleeve they turned
down a side street and at an old stone
house that seemed as ancient as mars it-
self she led him through an archway and
into a court she knocked at a door and
when it opened took off her ridiculous
mask and entered beckoning scott to fol-
low

they entered a room that was
low and wide furnished with a mix-
ture of earth and mars styles including
some of those chairs which are geared to
martian dimensions-oversized headrest
and between closelv-spaced arms a seat
that a plump terrestrial either had to
squeeze into or avoid

  of the three people in the room scott
recognized two kring ylias father and
toby black a wg investigator whose
real job was known to only a few and who
dateline mars



posed as a sales manager for a construc-
tion firm the guise enabled him to be
places where the presence of a wg rep-
resentative would be unwelcome here
possibly the other martian in the room
looked familiar but scott couldnt place
him

  scott shook hands with kring and let
himself be introduced to toby although
theyd had many a drink together in the
press club bar and in less respectable
places

  and this is mr rastol kring said
of the familiar-looking martian-

  then scott remembered two days ago
president murain had decided on a man
to fill the job of commerce minister in the
martian government a post vacated
through the death of a cabinet member
murain had offered the job to rastol
scott had no idea what had prompted the
offer he felt sure that murain hadnt
acted of his own free choice pressure
must have been brought on hint appar-
ently it was a concession he felt it nec-
essary to make-a sort of horse trade with
some powerful leader in parliament to
get an administration bill through all
scott knew now that he remembered was
that rastol was a rockhead not an overt
one true there was no blood on his hands
as far as anyone could prove but rastol
had been a power in the totalitarian gov-
ernment lately voted out possiblv murain
could find no one else for the job rastol
had ability of course but he also had a
tinge if not a definite odor

  he had been brought to trial under a
wg indictment but had been acquitted
of complicity in any of the really unsavory
doings of the rockhead regime some had
said it was lack of evidence but news-
men covering the trial had a strong sus-
picion that several prosecution witnesses
had been given bank accounts and ras-
tol went free

  and now murain was offering him the
big commerce job-one that held the purse
strings of a fair share of the martian
budget the post would give rastol the
power to spend to let contracts to make
loans and parcel out a tremendous amount
of business that money could go to help

the economy of mars back on its feet or
it could be pork-barreled into the coffers
of firms whose ties with the rockheads
had been only nominally broken

  rastols acceptance of the job not yet
forthcoming and his confirmation in it
by parliament would be a kick in the
teeth to martian democracy the reason
for this off-in-the-corner landing day
soiree became a little clearer - although
scott still was unable to figure out why
hed been invited

  scott shook the hand rastol extended
and said something noncommittal most
martians looked almost alike to earths
eyes except for their sex differences but
rastol was distinctive he was corpulent
a thing most martians were not and he
was hairless which also was unusual his
skin was whiter than that of most of his
planetmen and he had no neck to speak
of if scott had been a caricaturist hed
have drawn rastol as an egg

  ylia had left the room she came back
now with a tray and served drinks scott
took one of the small pottery cups and
told himself he mustnt drink more than
two of them they contained a syrupy
blue liquid with the kick of a rocket-ex-
haust

  kring raised his cup to the repub-
lic he said they all sipped their drinks

  ive asked you here kring said for
a purpose i should not have chosen land-
ing day if it had not been important some
of you have very generously broken other
engagements or left your work- he
bowed to scott-to be here

  rastol spoke in a low resonant voice
it is an honor to be asked to your home
mr kring

  the mister was something earthmen
had brought mars before the rockheads
set up their semi-feudal system had had
no such term of address

  kring bowed again i am especially
happy that you were able to come mr
rastol because what i have to say should
be of particular interest to you he
turned to toby black you mr black
are interested in construction of course
and mr warrens news service has an
interest in something similar-reconstruc-


planet

stories

tion so we are well met

  scott didnt know what this preamble
was leading to but he wished kring would
get on with it he did

  mr warren kring went on may
also have a news story of some value
you see before mr rastol leaves this
room tonight he will have announced that
he cannot accept the post of minister of
commerce in the murain government

astol didnt move except for
a narrowing of his eyes then he
said carefully indeed 

  kring smiled a little yes he said i
think mr rastol will find that his private
affairs are of such a demanding nature that
he will be forced regretfully to decline the
honor tendered by president murain
rastol said evenly i hesitate to differ
with my gracious host but it would seem
to me that an individual might be con-
sidered to know his own affairs better
than another

  i am sure said kring that no one
knows your affairs better than you mr
rastol

  scott looked at toby black who had
leaned forward in his chair as if trying to
see the significance of it all scott knew
that toby knew as much about rastol as
anyone and probably more toby was one
of half a dozen men who were permitted
to ride the private elevator to the private
office of the director-general of world
government

  rastol looked at a timepiece on the wall
and rose from his chair i am afraid i
must say good night i had hoped to be
better company but i have just remem-
bered an appointment

please sit down mr rastol said
kring we have much more to discuss
rastol moved toward the door ylia
stepped in front of it she had a q-gun in
her hand

  i am quite proud of my daughters
marksmanship said kring she is the
equal of any soldier at hitting a target at
short range she never misses by so much
as a hair

  rastol sat down

  he sipped his drink and appeared to

relax be good enough to tell me he
said why you think i would be so lack-
ing in a sense of public duty as to reject an
assignment to which my government has
called me

  the answer is simple said kring
the murain government is not your gov-
ernment your allegiance is to the totali-
tarian movement

  i think the public record will show the
falsehood of that statement said rastol
the trial to which i was so cruelly sub-
jected proved just the opposite you will
recall that the verdict was one of ac-
quittal

  only said kring because some wit-
nesses were bribed-and others were mur-
dered

  rastol smiled thinly your proof
kring smiled also of that none i
admit but we have proof of other things
-things without value in a court of law
perhaps but which may persuade you to
retire to private life for your tranquillity
of mind

  produce them said rastol

  he was a cool one scott had to admit
then the newsman realized that kring was
looking at him

  mr warren he said if you will be
so kind and he held out his hand

  scott gave him the papers he had
brought from the office he had no idea
what bearing they had on the situation
now being unfolded

  kring broke the seal on the envelope
and opened it he looked through the
news reports-those which had been used
and those which hadnt finally he found
what he was looking for

  you have heard of the green arrow
kring asked rastol

  of course a bandit and outlaw who
achieved some notoriety what of him
you may not have heard said kring
that his real name became known to
myself and some others who cared to ask
after it was no longer a guarded secret
his name was acton 

  kring looked closely at rastol the big
martian gave no flicker of recognition
a not uncommon name said rastol
acton was the name of your son was
dateline mars



it not

  there was silence in the room krings
fcyes looked steadily into rastols ylia
stood at the door her gun no longer point-
ing at the guest but down at her side
toby black was stopped with a cigarette
halfway to his lips

  scott raised a hand to brush away what
he thought might be an insect on the back
of his neck there was nothing there it
was part of the tension

  kring spoke again was not acton the
name of your son and did he not fight
against you and the things you stood for
rastols eyes went from one to another
in the room he made no other movement
even his breathing was not apparent at
length he said

  yes acton was my son

k rings breath came hard as if
he had been holding it

  then rastol added but what of that
really gentlemen this is a most ridicu-
lous performance to bring me to this
house to threaten me with weapons and
with words and to produce mysterious pa-
pers with the flourish of a wandering mys-
tic-this is childish i must ask you to
excuse me i have an important letter to
write president murain

  what will the letter say

  it will say that i accept humbly yet
with pride that i have been chosen the
position of minister of commerce in the
government to which i owe allegiance and
wish to serve to the best of my poor abil-
ity

  allegiance kring spat the word
you speak of allegiance who have never
known it to anything decent and honor-
able you blaspheme the memory of your
sons great deeds when you use the word
neither my son nor any creature that
crawls on the ground has any bearing on
my decision your threats and blackmail
are unworthy of you mr kring and if
you persist in this farce or seek to use
your information publicly i shall be forced
to make a noisy and patriotic speech which
will look incongruous in my biography but
which will have the stupid public applaud-
ing from the galleries i shall say that as

an older man i believed in gradual change
and that no man was happier than i when
mars became a republic under the aegis
of world government i shall say if i am
forced to that of course i had publicly
deplored the activities of the man called
the green arrow but that i was in good
company for did not mr murain-then
not yet president murain of the republic-
to-be-also plead for peaceful methods of
achieving freedom and urge his followers
to shun violence and if someone is so
unfeeling as to mention that acton was
my son could not my impatience with his
activities have been in reality a fathers
fears for the life of the boy he had loved
from the cradle oh i shall make them
weep mr kring and your petty plan will
come to nothing furthermore i shall de-
mand your resignation as a sub-commis-
sioner of commerce and i have little doubt
that i shall receive it

  you are an excellent man with a
speech said kring that i admit but
there is more which you pretend not to
know

  is there

 much more you may or may not
choose to recall-druro

  rastol chose to say nothing druro had
been one of the blackest marks against the
rockhead regime it was the name of an
infamous concentration camp in which
thousands of prisoners had died of malnu-
trition and overwork and thousands more
had been put to death because of their
political views

  i can tell you something about druro
said toby black i was there as a guest
of your government-the rockhead gov-
ernment is the one im talking about ras-
tol not the one you claim youre sudden-
ly so fond of

  toby put out his cigarette and leaned for-
ward his thin face got hard

  kring is a gentleman even when hes
dealing with a louse rastol but im no
diplomat im just a hardheaded old trader
from earth and maybe some people think
my language is crude but i say what i
think and i dont like you and your kind
usually i dont mix in politics-my busi-
ness is construction i started when i was


planet stories

a young squirt and built things with my
hands and they got calloused now i sit
in a fine office and scoot around in a fine
air-car and other men do the dirty work
but thats honest work the dirty work i
cant stomach is your kind rastol and since
ive got the chance to undo some of it
or maybe prevent some more of it i asked
kring to let me speak my piece

  scott could easily have been persuaded
if he hadnt known better that world
government investigator toby black was
just that rockribbed businessman-with-a-
conscience that he was pretending to be

  toby went on the reason i saw dru-
ro the way mighty few people saw it was
that somebody slipped up druro was also
a factory town and there was room there
for a new plant god knows you had enough
slave labor to make it damned profitable
so i was invited by your rockheads to
look over parts of the town so my com-
pany could make a bid on building the
plant they wanted but i saw more than
you fascists intended rastol im an old
country boy and i get up early one day

i	got up earlier than those gorillas who
were supposed to tag around with me to
keep my nose clean and my nose got good
and dirty rastol the stench of druro is
still in it i got out and talked to the peo-
ple in town and the people had plenty to
tell me about that camp just over the hill
some of the people i spoke to had been
inside it and they knew what they were
talking about

  an interesting anecdote mr black
rastol interrupted but i must confess
that i see no relevance

  toby lighted a cigarette and spat out
the smoke the relevance is coming right
no i heard a lot of different things about
druro from a lot of different people but
one of the things i heard over and over
again was the same it was the name
the man whose signature sent those thou-
sands to their death i dont have to tell
you rastol what that name was you
sign your letters with it every day

yu can prove nothing
x snapped rastol his compostire jolt-
ed for the first time it would be your

word against mine and why snould any-
one believe you

  thats true said toby theres no
proof after i heard of your acquittal i
got good and mad about it and i made a
special trip to see if i could find some of
those people id talked to back then-to
get affidavits if they wouldnt testify in
person to get new evidence but you and
your rockheads did a good job all right
you practically wiped out druro there
wasnt a soul left who would testify against
you or any other fascist

  you see you have no proof

  no said kring no proof that would
be good in court but everyone in this
room now is convinced of your guilt that
must be a terrible burden on your con-
science if i were you i should welcome
this opportunity to make some slight
amend i appeal to you mr rastol to de-
cline the post of commerce minister
rastol laughed you appeal you beg
this is the weakness of your system you
yourselves are so weak that your govern-
ment cannot be strong i know now that
the threats against me tonight all were
psychological even that q-gun in your
daughters hands you would not shoot
me it is against your principles fortu-
nately i have no principles and after i
have become commerce minister there will
be others like me in the cabinet and then
it will not be long before mars again has
the kind of government a planet like this
needs now i am going-and if any of
you decides to remember any of this in
public i shall deny it and then who do
you think will be believed

  stand aside young lady i am leaving
  rastol got up from his chair

  this wasnt scotts show but he spoke
up anyway it looked as if everything else
had failed

  he said i have quite a story here
rastol i havent been taking notes but
they say i have a stenographic ear
rastol whirled on him use it and
ill sue you and galactic news service for
libel and everything else in the statutes
ill deny everything and produce two wit-
nesses for every one of yours youre not
dealing with an amateur young man and
dateline mars



now i say good night you fools

  kring moved to stand beside his daugh-
ter there is yet more he said we
had hoped to spare you this although i
know now that our concern for your feel-
ings was misguided

  there is no more said rastol you
have bluffed and you have lost he
whipped his hand through the air stand
aside i am going

  stay said a new voice

  rastol turned slowly at the end of the
room opposite the door some hangings had
parted through them from another room
had come a tall cloaked martian a young
man rastol looked at him under a wrin-
kled forehead

  who are you he asked

  hello father said acton

  rastol peered across the room his face
seemed to come apart it went slack
seemed to turn gray

youre dead cried rastol this is
a trick a disguise turn up the lights
acton stepped forward to within a foot
of the older man look well he said
is it a disguise

  but youre dead i know youre
dead i-

  yes father i should be actons
eyes were steady but without hate they
looked hurt and pitying i was at druro
and you signed the order for my execu-
tion yourself it was carried out you
thought and the last witness against you
was stilled you thought

  the young man threw back his cloak
he had no left arm they took me for
dead the q-rays burned away my arm
and i fell with the others i was buried
among the corpses but my friends found
me later there wasnt much life in me
but they nourished it and i am here
no screamed rastol its not true
its a lie

  he wavered away from his sons gaze
and half fell into a chair

  you deny it said acton come well
tell the people they will decide well

go to the great square and ask them
whom they believe-rastol or the green
arrow

  no said rastol no    no

back in the galactic news service
bureau scott warren came to the
last paragraph of today on mars he had
written his quota of words about landing
day and the speeches and parades and car-
nival he had a story bigger than any of
this of course but he couldnt use it
toby black asked him not to not yet

  rastol had declined actons challenge
to go before the people there in krings
house under the hard eyes of his son
rastol had written a letter to president
murain and signed it

  the rest would come later it took time
to get the legal wheels in motion to pre-
pare a genocide case but although world
government moved slowly sometimes it
did move in two months or three or six
rastol would be indicted and tried and
this time there would be no doubt of the
verdict in the meantime   

  scott wrote elsewhere on mars these
things happened fire broke out in sen-
alla driving fifty persons from their
homes no one was injured but damage
to the apartment house block was exten-
sive  a collision between two air-cars
sent three persons to the hospital in iopa
with critical injuries  a sandstorm
blowing across the desert  miles north-
east of iopa has cut communications with
the town of ramor    and rastol de-
cided against accepting the post of com-
merce minister which had been offered
to him by president murain rastol said
he was honored by the offer but that the
pressure of private affairs made it im-
possible for him to accept

  scott warren typed  at the end
of his copy and sent it off to inter radio
for transmission to earth he resigned
himself to the possibility that the night
desk in the new york bureau would cut
out his last paragraph to save space

by e hoffman price

the solicitude of lindas

voice the seductiveness of her per-
fume her very presence as they
sat in the artificial twilight of the domes
of venus tempted him to abandon his
plan to sail at once for terra venture
among the savage terrestrians and get
possession of that enormous ruby they
called the fire of skanderbek

  linda was long legged and supple



earth was a world of murdering
savages bleak and desolate con-
taminated by deadly radioactiv-

stubbornness-and a rash prom-
ise made in fury - could have
brought him back to that perilous
birthplace of man

stories

waisted with dark eyes and gold-bronze
hair and very white skin her cheek bones
were just sufficiently prominent to keep
her face from being too regular and there
was a perceptible dusting of tiny freckles
which accented the irregularity adding a
piquant touch these were natural and a
rarity that had existed only in fable for
the past six-hundred years for the glow-
lamps and the occlusive venusian atmos-
phere seemed to combine to make the
freckle almost impossible however though
the cosmeticians had driven the board of
science frantic until they had devised a
process for artificially imitating lindas
unique flaw this distinction had not spoiled
her

  never mind what i said last night
linda pleaded we were all angry you
and gil and i no sense at all

  but i promised verrill said stub-
bornly which helped-a little-to sustain
himself against backing down from the
rash venture for which he had not a bit
of taste

  he had an angular face narrowish
with the bony structure well accented his
nose was prominent his hazel eyes were
intent and impatient he was lean muscu-
lar and all in all just the sort of venu-
sian to go on such a crazy venture-yet
he didnt like the idea at all now that he
had had time to consider

  lets forget it all craig rubies arent
important enough the one gil brought
me from that trading post of terra isnt
-wasnt-

  verrill said sourly thats what makes
me feel so foolish about it he brought
you a souvenir and i grabbed it from you
flung it into the lake and pasted him
what for

  oh craig who cares gil was lording
it over you i was too smug and pleased
with the gift to realize how far he was
going oh all right of course you were
wrong but what of it

  verrill shook his head i fairly shouted
myself into it

  i dont want you to go

  i know you dont but too many of
our friends were within sight and hear-
ing of the whole mess sooner or later
their attitude would make you unhappy

about a man who talked big and then
backed down

his insistence widened lindas
eyes the civilized venusians were
always ready to take the sensible the ex-
pedient way had they been otherwise
had they not been the descendants of sen-
sible terrestrian ancestors they would
have been included in the devastation
which had left all but small and widely
scattered patches of terra uninhabitable
for the past seven-hundred years rather
those who today were venusians would
have been struggling savages scraping out
a living in some uncontaminated area

  verrills was an almost terrestrian
stubbornness something primitive and ata-
vistic very much like that queer quirk
which made some venusians return to
their native earth to set up trading-posts
where they bartered with the barbarian
tribesmen for tobacco and wines spices
and jewels and perfumes all manner of
luxuries which venus did not offer

  linda made her final appeal leaving
all this to scramble around in that ter-
rible waste and desolation-oh do be sen-
sible

  her voice and the kiss that followed it
made verrill at once aware of what gener-
ations of venusians had taken for granted
he looked across the gardens and the
lake and up at the prodigous span of gird-
ers the original purpose of the structure
had been to house a military outpost that
was to have outflanked a comparable one
on luna in the years just before the
war engineers and scientists had been
sent from terra to build those enormous
domes plastic-sheathed and air-tight to
exclude the raging dust-storms and the
overwhelming concentration of formalde-
hyde which made up most of the natural
venusian atmosphere rather than rely on
any system depending upon chemically
prepared oxygen they had established gar-
dens orchards fields of plant-hfe which
liberated sufficient oxygen to maintain the
required balance

  tins was to have been simply a garri-
son according to plan it wonld have
played a decisive part in the final clash
for terrestrian supremacy meanwhile
exile from venus	

there had coine to be little difference be-
tween the rival dictatorships except in the
wording of their slogans the anglo-capi-
talist bloc had borrowed all the kinds and
twists of regimentation of the rival bloc
the difference finally became one of flavor
rather than principle

  a cool-headed few in command of the
venusian garrison had seen that neither
side could win that there would be only
mutual and total destruction the warfare
became more and more atrocious and the
anglo-capitalist bloc drifted further and
further from the sort of organization that
the venus garrison in no immediate dan-
ger could contemplate defending with en-
thusiasm thus when one day the lunar
base radio complained of attack by sui-
cide-ships and then went abruptly silent
the venusian base which might have been
expected to cry geronimo and leap
into the holocaust instead underwent a
short and violent revolution in which the
ardently military were disposed of then
stubbornly intending to survive chaos and
idiocy the venus base folded its hands
and sat out the fatal clash that ended the
war and virtually the whole of terrestrian
civilization with it   

  after several centuries the venus coun-
cil risked an exploration party to terra to
see whether the globe was becoming fit for
human habitation again large areas had
of course through natural processes be-
come decontaminated there were scat-
tered colonies of survivors-farmers
herdsmen hunters armed with clubs
spears and other primitive weapons con-
tact was made communication struck up
trade-of considerable importance to both
--established and after the ten years
wliich this took the venusians were left
with very little inclination to colonize ter-
ra life under the domes was comfortable
with controlled climate law and order
science and art comfortable civilized and
sensible while terra-

  be a sensible venusian was what
linda meant dont go looking for trou-
ble when you can do better without dont
be a typical terrestrian

  the whole clash of the previous night
had been silly irritated by gil dawsons
giving linda a ruby as a souvenir of his

official inspection-tour of the council-
controlled terrestrian trading-posts ver-
rill had flung the trinket into the lake
after a brisk fracas in which dawson had
finally wearied of getting up only to be
knocked down again verrill had shouted
to linda and to most of venus that hed
get her a mans-sized ruby the fire of
skanderbek she thoroughly outraged had
told him and dawson that by heaven
shed not be the prize either of a brawl
or a souvenir-finding contest to make it
good she had concluded by telling verrill
that hed be far better occupied if he got
the venus council to assign him to one of
the committees for improving the living-
standards of the terrestrians and won
the fire of skanderbek as a token of
their gratitude

   but however earnestly she besought him
to forget it all verrill was just as unhappily
determined to go through with it i cant
back down dawson will surely take a
crack at stealing the fire himself-and
that would make it tough for me and for
you

   oh let the fool try she cried des-
perately hed never come back from the
territory of those wildmen

   verrill shook his head he might come
back even though i did give him a trounc-
ing hes anything but a clown you
wouldnt accept the fire of skanderbek
if he offered it-but hed give it to some-
one else and then-well a lot of women
do dislike you theres nothing i can do
except to beat him to it

  and so verrill went to do as he had
to do

the space-freighter veered
from her course only a little instead
of landing in the sun-blasted plain at the
foot of the mountains into which verrill
was to go she launched a crew-boat which
took him to the trading-post at the foot
of barren limestone bulwarks

   dawson was not at the post but while
a head start was a happy omen verrill
knew that it had its limits since his plan
to ingratiate himself with the barbarians
until he could seize the fetish-ruby and
return to the post involved so much time
that the gain of hours or days meant little
	planet

  ingratiate himself-steal the fire of
skanderbek-and get out-infinitely sim-
pler than lindas suggestion probably an
utterly impossible one of deserving it fin-
ally as a gift his first look at the bearded
mountaineers convinced him that no
amount of do-gooding could ever move
them to gratitude

  those lounging in the compound of the
fortified trading-post wore homespun pants
and sheepskin jackets they fairly clanked
with trade daggers trade pistols and trade
hatchets some carried trade muskets and
some had the new repeating rifles their
tanned and hairy faces and bitter eyes
made it plain that looting and robbing
brawling and mayhem and murder were
their very breath of life

  they spoke the international language
which had developed sufficiently to come
into common use around  ad eng-
lish while a nightmare of contradictions
to baffle a foreigner had offered these ad-
vantages next to chinese no other lan-
guage was so free of inflections and it
could so readily assimilate all manner of
foreign words thus since the tone-deal
occidental had not been able to master the
simplicities of chinese or other mongo-
lian tongues the asiatics had taken up
english with which had been blended
arabic urdu malay and a good deal of
western european and while seven cen-
turies of venusian isolation had made the
speech of the people of the domes diverge
from the original international terrestrian
verrill had not too much difficulty in
making himself understood

  this black bag he told a group of
the caravan men will interest ardelan
-thats your chiefs name isnt it let
me go into the mountains with you to talk
to him

  youre crazy a craggy faced fellow
with drooping moustaches and hard blue
eyes told him levelly you think im
crazy

  verrill laid out three daggers he picked
one up jabbed it into the top of a table
cluttered with heaps of goatskins dried
apricots raisins and bags of coriander
seed he bent the weapon until the grip
touched the table top he released it it
snapped straight up with a fine high

stormes

pitched spang he plucked a dagger from
the mountaineers belt drew the other wea-
pon from the table and slashed them edge
to edge

  he cut shavings from the mountaineers
weapon then he stropped his own blade
on the palm of his hand for a couple of
strokes and next ran it along his arm the
hairs toppled as he cut them free there
was no drag at all the edge was so keen

  mine are not trade daggers he said
bet you the three that ardelan will listen
to me and not throw me out

  the terrestrians eyes gleamed what
do i put up for a bet

  a pair of those boots youre wearing
put my knives in your belt now if i lose
my bet theyre yours if i win youre
welcome to them anyway

  so the caravan men fitted him out with
garments and boots like their own and
verrill went into the mountains with them

ii

the trail snaked along
precipices and wound past narrow
hidden valleys at the foot of a cliff lay
the shell of a space-cruiser which had been
telescoped from its original six-hundred
feet to a bare two-hundred though much
of the nose had melted from the impact
against the rocks gnarled oaks and juni-
pers reached up from a riven seam of the
shell the metal had not rusted it was
merely tarnished to a slate gray it was a
mine of such metal as could have furnished
all manner of implements for the terres-
trian s-but they did not know how to
exploit it

  finally verrill was looking down into
narrow upland meadows where sheep
grazed there were barley patches his
eyes felt as though they were full of
sand the snow-white glare from cliffs
and the dust which rose in yellow puffs
at every step made the way a torment
for one accustomed to the paradisiacal
clime of the venusian domes

  each days march brought the donkey-
caravan within sight of alternate trails
guarded by mud-brick towers where armed
men were stationed to watch the moves
of hostile neighbors the return even
exile from venus	

without pursuit would be dangerous

  at last they came to ardelans mud-
walled houses huddled on a rocky shelf
which overhung a fertile valley the settle-
ment was surrounded by a wall of earth
and stone and had escaped contamination
because no one would have bombed a
 foot range of limestone peaks ex-
cept by mistake

  when the trading convoy filed into the
tangle of flat-roofed houses which sur-
rounded a hard-packed central square wo-
men children and dogs came out each in
full voice the procession kept straight
on toward the entrance of a two-storeyed
building half the ground-level was a
stable the rest a courtyard where arde-
lan and a handful of armed companions
lolled under an awning of black goat-hair

  terrestrian faces were no novelty to
verrill but this time being a stranger
among them-instead of merely a specta-
tor seeing a handful of them half defiant
and half uneasy in the strangeness of a
trading-post-he saw what he had never
before noticed they tended toward height
and ranginess prominence of nose angu-
larity of face yet behind this likeness was
a shadow-pattern of racial differentiation
there were differences of flavor rather
than of outright form the flare of a nos-
tril the shape of an eye the fullness or
thinness of lip-a thick necked one here
and there suggested that generations back
there had been among his ancestors a
blocky mongol from central asia

  the guards instead of presenting ver-
rill explained him as though he had been
some trade article ardelan listening stud-
ied his visitor with entire impersonality as
he might have scrutinized a basket of fresh
ripe apricots to see how they had endured
being hauled so far

  whats in the bag he demanded
abruptly

  medicine i am a doctor

  what for people die anyway

  a doctor verrill explained conceal-
ing his dismay is not to keep people from
dying he is to make it more agreeable
for them until they finally have to die
ardelan addressed his henchmen the
answers summed up to this that if noth-
ing much ailed a man hed get well by

himself and if something really incapac-
itated him it would of course be something
so serious that he could not last long at
the best

  ardelan digested this wisdom then
asked verrill can you make knives like
these you gave that man

  i am a doctor not a blacksmith
  can you make guns or cartridges
  no

  can you fight

   verrill glanced uneasily about as though
ardelan might be on the point of select-
ing an opponent to test the strangers
claims and having read verrills face
ardelan snorted and not waiting for a
reply demanded then what are you good
for

  to treat the sick verrill repeated
with growing sense of futility to bind
wounds to set broken bones

  look at us weve done very well

  i can do better

   cant work cant fight good for noth-
ing but doctoring bad as a priest lock
him up i want to think this over
the guard hustled verrill and his
medical case into an empty granary they
slammed the door and rolled a boulder
against it it made no difference whether
or not he could shove the door open
there was nowhere to go if he did get
out he could not find his way back to
the trading-post except over the way which
his escort had brought him a guarded
way

in the half-gloom verrill noted
that the wall had been cracked by
earthquakes these cracks gave him hand
and toe holds to climb up until he could
catch the rough-hewn timber which sup-
ported the roof of brush and clay lying
on the crown of the wall he could look
out through rifts in the roof

  herdsmen were driving their flocks in
from distant slopes others drove donkeys
laden with brush verrill was appalled by
the ever present evidence that terrestrian
life was a matter of digging scratching
and enduring the elements the stark emp-
tiness of the sky worried him he was ac-
customed to the perpetual twilight and
impenetrable clouds of venus
	planet

  well away from the settlement and
outside the wall was a small squatty cube
with a small tower at each corner the
structure was backed up against an over-
hanging cliff and was unapproachable ex-
cept from the walled town the precipi-
tous ending of the shelf guarded the white-
washed cube more surely than if it had
been within the town wall

  the open doorway was so large in pro-
portion to the structure itself that sur-
mise made verrius pulse hammer that
must be the shrine where the fire of skan-
derbek was kept

  toward dusk drums rumbled and trum-
pets of rams horns bawled hoarsely men
carrying tightly bound bundles of brush
marched in procession toward the white-
washed cube and chanted as they went
when they came to the place they filed
in each coming out with his faggots ablaze

  they returned to their houses before
long verrills captors brought him a bowl
of mutton stew and leathery cakes of
bread they couldnt have cooked this
stuff so soon he reasoned it must have
been cooking all the while on fires already
lighted that procession was fire worship

  he sat there a long time after he had
licked the gravy from his fingers a
shocking business meat so plentiful that
it was fed to a prisoner and yet the bar-
barians knew nothing at all about cookery

  the town swarmed with flies vultures
perched on the walls and watch-towers
watting to clean up the garbage and offal
flung from the houses the community
well had a nasty taint from surface drain-
age from the stables verrill after a bad
nights sleep spent the morning deciding
that when pestilence did break out he
would need his medical supplies for him-
self

  the women shapely and graceful gath-
ered about the well to fill the earthenware
jugs they carried balanced on their heads
they chattered mainly about the outsider
giving most emphasis to his looks though
devoting certain speculation to his possible
usefulness and probable destination

  kwangtan they all agreed wants
him killed or sent away

  from what he could piece together from
the various relays of women he overheard

stories

verrill concluded that kwangtan was the
keeper of the shrine and that medical
practice was the monopoly of old women
who cooked up herbs these potions plus
kwangtans incantations kept the com-
munity in health

  the drowsy silence of midafternoon was
broken by an hysterical screeching and
screaming before verrill could arouse
himself from the stupor of half suffoca-
tion the door was jerked open and sev-
eral men pounced for him

  you with the medicine work for
you bring the black box

they hustled him to a houss
where several old women were shak-
ing and back-slapping a boy of three or
four the kids mother one of the few
redheads in the colony was wailing at a
pitch that made verrill shiver a beetle-
browed young man with a wiry beard
squatted on the floor looking helpless ah
he did was repeat get kwangtan and
no one paid him any heed at all

  at the sight of verrill one of the old
women laid the child on a sheepskin
spread on the floor the childs face was
gray his lips were bluish his eyes bugged
out he wheezed agonizingly it made
verrills skin twitch just to see the littte
fellows losing battle for breath he was
slowly choking with all voices suddenly
stilled at verrills approach the sound
became all the more ominous

  in his utter perplexity and dismay ver-
rill hoped that what he heard was the
death-rattle which would relieve him of
the task about to be forced upon him the
absence of kwangtan the holy man told
him the story that wise fellow was not
going to lose any prestige by tackling some-
thing he could not handle

  whats wrong verrill asked with
a show of assurance

  youre a doctor the kids father
snarled do something

  he swallowed an apricot seed the
childs redhaired mother said its stuck
we pant shake it out hes choking get it
out you blinking fool

  the kids father drew and cocked his
pistol the dry click chilled verrill to the
heart he remembered an old story of an
exile from venus



emergency operation at a trading-post the
yarn had given the venusians quite a thrill

  ardelan stalked in he nodded his
approval of the man who had a pistol
trained on the doctor stranger do not
make any mistakes kwangtan has warned
us

  verrill had a raft of venusian specifics
for just about every known ailment he
had counted however on nothing of the
sort which now confronted him-had
looked forward simply to giving the sav-
ages pills and swabbing them with anti-
septics as he knelt he fumbled helpless-
ly with the instruments in the case

  do this right ardelan said or he
shoots

  verrill loaded a hypo with a local an-
aesthetic the glint of metal and the sud-
den end of the childs gagging as the in-
jection stilled his struggles nearly cost ver-
rill his life ardelans big hand knocked
the pistol out of line as it blazed and the
slug scorched verrills cheek and pounded
a chunk out of the wall

  hes not dead the chief said not
yet

  a splash of antiseptic

  then nerving himself verrill made a
slit in the throat there was not much
blood he got the apricot seed free with
haggling jabs he took a coupk of stitches
he taped and bandaged

  then shoulders sagging he settled back
trying to keep from toppling to the floor
the kids lips were no longer bluish he
was breathing freely at last he blinked
cried out and reached for his throat

  hes brought him back to life the
redhead cried and snatched up the boy

verrill crumpled he toppled
and sprawled he was however con-
scious and when he heard what the moun-
taineers were saying he realized that had
he done it intentionally he could not have
done better than collapse

  one said hes left his body for awhile
to fight off the devils so they wont come
back to hurt the kid

  verrill muttered and mumbled until sa-
tisfied that his act had been up to their
expectation he sat up again he faced a
pistol but this time it was presented butt

foremost

  take it doctor its yours the kids
father said

  and now kwangtan the fire priest
joined the group

  his deep-set eyes blazed fiercely his
face was sunken his hands were like
parchment drawn over bones he wore
white pants and a white shirt his beard
and his shoulder-length hair were white
for a moment verrill thought that the
old fellow was a veteran of the war his
age made him fantastic in a colony where
men over forty were scarce and those
over fifty rarities though old women
were more than plentiful

  verrill declined the gift of the pistol
give it to the holy man he said i did
not come here for pay

  then he went with ardelan to sit un-
der the black awning where the chief set-
tled disputes and planned raids on neigh-
boring tribes

excellency verrill pointed out hold-
ing a pistol at a doctors head is no way
of making sure hell help the patient
you are a stranger you might have
killed him with a curse

  he was already nearly dead

  but he was still alive and you might
have finished him

  he must have known id do my best
still if the boy had died that clan
would have lost a fighting man so your
clan had to lose that is our law

  is that why kwangtan wouldnt help
not at all hes not a stranger and if
the women who were working oh the boy
had kept at it until he choked to death
no one would have hurt them theyre not
strangers

  the quicker i get out of here the
better

  ardelan permitted himself to smile
once you are no longer a stranger doc-
toring will not be so dangerous

in

as ardelans reserve
thawed out verrill pressed him with
questions your men talk about nothing
but raids on your neighbors flocks and
about feuds havent you enough sheep
	planet

  doctor you know how to save lives
but you know nothing at all about living

  ardelan pointed toward the gateway
which opened from courtyard to the square
half a dozen women high-breasted and
long-limbed were gossiping at the well
their wild gracefulness was blood-stirring
verrill contrasted them with the studiedly
elegant ladies of venus and with linda
particularly

  we have enough sheep and enough
women the chief explained the sheep
dont make trouble the women do if
my men are not to cut each others throats
they must have outside enemies to keep
them busy or the jealousies of their wives
would prod them to too much competition
with each other

  thinking back to his quarrel with gil
dawson verrill had to concede ardelans
point and principle and then he got back
to the perils of being a stranger the fol-
lowing day he proposed let me take
part in the fire ceremony of an evening
in that way i wont be a stranger so long

  the chief got up presently and clapped
his hands a retainer came forward with
two horses they were hammer-headed
shaggy roman-nosed and with fierce
eyes the saddles were sheep-sldn pads
there were no stirrups

  verrill said excellency you ride ill
walk

  they set out for the shrine meanwhile
half a dozen horsemen came in from the
other end of the shelf one overtaking
verrill and the chief slowed down enough
to exchange a hail and then pressed on
before they came to the shrine the rider
had finished his business with kwangtan
and was leaving

  he circled wide to avoid an encounter
this made verrill uneasy the man was
dust-caked sweat-drenched and sagging

 ardelan frowned more trouble
thats one of the outpost guards i wish
i could have just the right amount of
raiding and no more

  he might have told you what it was
about

  he will at the sunset council but
kwangtan has to dip his long nose into
everything first or he makes trouble

  they got the news in a hurry

stories

  standing in the entrance of the shrine
kwangtan cursed his chief and the doctor
as well get that fellow out of here hes
come to steal the fire of skanderbek and
youre a fool for allowing him around
here

  ardelan endured the cursing until he
had a chance to ask have you had an-
other vision holy one

  the man who just rode up told me
what i had already learned from the fire
gods this verrill has promised the ruby
to one of his women

  who said that verrill demanded

  one of your own people who fly down
from heaven one called dawson at the
trading-post dawson talked about you to
our men and to our neighbors

  you stick to your own business ar-
delan interposed quietly he will stick
to his he is an outlaw from his own peo-
ple naturally his enemies try to harm
him

  the snarling saint listened he and ar-
delan eyed each other what unspoken
thought passed between them was beyond
verrills guessing yet it must have had
force for kwangtan offered no objection
when ardelan said verrill come in with
me and bow to the flame

the interior of the shrine was
much larger than the front had sug-
gested this was because of a grotto in
the overhang of the cliff from a rift in
the natural shelf of rock came hissing jets
of fire they wavered varied blending
into each other and separating again

  behind the low barrier of flames was a
monstrous ruby uncut yet a perfect hexa-
gonal crystal with edges clean and sharp
this was not from any alluvial deposit
else the faces would have been dulled
and the edges chipped

  whether or not the stone had been
polished verrill could not even surmise
at all events this was a ruby that had
come from the original matrix the rocky
birthplace of gems it collected all the
wavering light transformed it and poured
it back again transmuted into living red
the crystal seemed to pulsate with a life
of its own

  the beauty and the splendor made ver-
exile from venus	

rill picture the fire of skanderbek against
lindas white skin-and the wonder of it
must have showed in his face rather than
the resolve to have the gem at any cost
for kwangtans radiant hostility softened
perceptibly verrill imitated ardelans
gesture and bow and the two withdrew
from the shrine

  i dont doubt said ardelan once
he was in the saddle and verrill tramp-
ing alongside that youd steal it if you
oould get out of here with it dont try
it maybe i could-but probably i could
not-save your life

  youd not try any too hard

  you are wrong the chief countered
earnestly slitting that kids gullet and
not hurting him was something id never
heard about maybe you can be useful
around here

  not with what kwangtan thinks of
me

 it really depends on the women-
though quite a few of the men believe in
the fire god

  you dont verrill said boldly
though you do wonder a lot about fire
that comes out of a rock with no fuel

  i dont wonder as much as you think
theres a place far away from here where
a blaze like that comes from the ground
sometimes when a camp fire is built too
near it but the wind whisks the flames out
and then theres nothing but a smell
verrill had by now revised somewhat
his notions on savages then why do you
put up with that wild-eyed fanatic
ardelan smiled indulgently you peo-
ple from the outside know many strange
things how to come down from the stars
how to make guns but the few of you
ive talked to are dog-ignorant when it
comes to people the fire god is something
our neighbors dont have it makes us
stick together better and keeps us from
fighting among ourselves arent any of
your people smart enough to have gods
verrill answered with feigned humility
i came to teach you people a few things but
it seems i can learn something then it
will be a fair exchange

  the next day he had ardelan send a
courier to the trading-post the man car-
ried an order for a consignment of medi-

cal supplies to be sent from the venusian
domes via the next freighter there was
also a letter for linda telling of the suc-
cess of his first operation and of dawsons
first move to make trouble but gil was
a bit late he wrote id already got in
pretty solid that wont keep him from
trying something else he must have talked
a good deal before he left if you hear any
gossip as to what he planned to do or how
he intended to do it be sure and write me
the details from all ive seen of terra so
far they should have bombed it even more
than they did one well-organised dome is
worth a dozen earths but the natives
dont seem to mind a bit 

kntife and gunshot wounds
and fractures verrill reasoned
would make up most of his practice sur-
gery that is in its engineering aspect
rather than as a corrective of ailments
and the centuries fortunately had worked
to keep his task from being utterly beyond
a well-educated layman whereas in the
twentieth century there had not been more
than two or three specifics there were
now ten times as many it was a matter
of taking the proper bottle just as in an-
cient times one had reached automatically
for quinine the primitive specific against
malaria

  meanwhile what had been his prison
became his home and his dispensary dur-
ing his wait for the shipment from venus
he instituted a garbage-disposal program
he condemned the shallow well and had
them build a wooden flume from a spring
high up on the mountainside each radi-
cal move however had to wait until a
cure he had effected assured him of suf-
ficient momentary popularity to enable
him to kick an ancient unsanitary practice
overboard

  then one night came a furtive sound
at his door as thoftgh someone were try-
ing to enter by stealth a cold shiver
trickled down his spine though he doubt-
ed that the fire priest was coming to dis-
pose of him there was all too much
chance that kwangtan had convinced one
of the tribe that carving the stranger
would in the long run be beneficial de-
spite the warning and verrills readiness

stories

for whatever might be creeping up he
had his moment of terror however well
he handled himself he could not win-
for if he killed an intruder there would
be a blood feud

  groping in the dark he found a length
of firewood he had to end the matter by
knocking the other out before he could
come to grips to make it a finish fight
stealthily he skirted the wall he heard
the soft mumble of the leather-hinged
door as it dragged the hard earth a sliver
of moonlight reached into the darkness
barefooted verrill made no sound as he
evaded the widening streak of light a
patch of shadow broke it a dark shape
edged into the gloom verrill measured the
distance he gathered himself

  he had to make sure whether there was
only that one or whether others had
joined he held his breath until his pulse
hammered in his ears the motion at the
door had stopped he was afraid to ex-
hale-

  and then he breathed again

  the one who approached had long hair
which mirrored red glints she had shifted
enough for the moonlight to outline the
curve of cheek and throat and hint at the
smoothness of shoulder and ripeness of
breast the arms were white and slender
her stalking motion was beautiful even
in the obscurity

  there was a whisper of sandals and of
breath she was then of a sudden close
against him and seemingly not at all sur-
prised it was as though she had expected
him to be precisely where they met in the
darkness he must have dropped the cud-
gel for at the first touch of her he was
stroking the sleek red hair and with the
other hand tracing the curve of waist and
back

  she snuggled closer and he said fa-
lana as though touch and taste and smell
had identified the girl as surely as sight
she was falana the aunt of his first pa-
tient she wore the shapeless crude gar-
ments of the tribe yet it was as though
there were neither homespun nor even a
wisp of air between them

  falana had no words to waste as she
found his mouth in the darkness there
was nothing to explain when he stepped

back and further into the gloom she was
close as ever and as if seeing in the
darkness she seemed to know exactly
where he spread his sheepskin mat-

  she did know or else he must have
remembered

  when falana finally got around to talk-
ing with words she did not tell him how
she had admired him from first sight or
that his surgery had been marvelous she
said ill bring my things over in the
morning and yawned contentedly and
snuggled closer

verrill spent a restless night be-
ing intensely occupied in telling him-
self over and over again that venus was
a long way off and that whatever hap-
pened on terra did not really count un-
less as a result he became embroiled in
feuds on falanas account and to such an
extent that he would be unable to make
off with the fire of skanderbek

  well before dawn falana went to the
door to get a small bundle she had left
lying at the jamb before verrill knew
what was happening he got his first whiff
of breakfast cooked in his own home

  eating with neighbors falana ob-
served must have been awful and you
never know who might poison you
watching falana patting oat cakes into
shape and baking them on a hot rock he
began to see her as a very pleasant reality
though he could not help but go long-
faced when he considered how he had
without doubt inherited a few dangerous
animosities as well

  she must have read his thought for she
said its much better this way verrill
you havent more than maybe one-two-
three enemies on my account but as long
as you lived alone doctoring all day while
most of the men are out with the flocks
theyd all be suspecting and hating you
there was nothing to explain to arde-
lan the chief seemed to have been ex-
pectiag something of the sort falana
he said to verrill probably didnt get
around to telling you this but you can
either send her home or else take her to
the fire temple to get kwangtans bles-
sing then you wont be a stranger any
mere and youll get along better
exile from venus	

  that very day falana and verrill knelt
jjefore the altar of living flame and passed
their joined hands quickly through the
fire this time verrill got a good look at
the shrine as kwangtan blessed them

  he likewise got a look at the surround-
ings he noted kwangtans cell hewn out
of the limestone cliff he noted the cairns
of rock raised aljove the grave of each of
kwangtans predecessors having sized up
the situation he decided that his next move
would be to ride a circuit of ardelans
territory to treat those tribesmen who
rarely if ever got to town by becoming
acquainted with all the trails he would
have a better chance of escaping with the
fire of skanderbek

  too bad he could not take falana along
she would be a sensation back home the
most skilled cosmeticians of the venusian
domes could not begin to duplicate fa-
lanas glowing red-bronze hair

iv

by the time medical sup-
plies and equipment arrived-and al-
so a message from linda who was thrilled
from having heard of his good work among
the barbarians - ardelans mountaineers
had begun to accept verrill as a man and
not a mere medico his efforts to ride
their half-tamed horses time and again
picking himself up from where they had
thrown him to mount and try again
amused them enormously and gave them
a comfortable feeling of superiority-and
evoked a degree of respect

  to make his escape with the fire of
skanderbek he would have to ride on a
few cattle- and sheep-stealing raids and
so acquire sufficient skill for getting away
with his loot

  it was falana who explained the mon-
strous rubys status as a tribal fetish
ages ago she said the gods destroyed
the world with fire and after the flames
had gone the ghosts of the dead flames
danced over the earth and killed whoever
came near they killed without burning
the ghosts of the fire lived in the earth
and air and water and there were only
small patches where men could live

and there was skanderbek a wise man

who talked to the ghots maybe he
smelled them maybe he could
see what others could not others
say that he had a talisman that talked to
him and warned him where not to go
there are many stories

  skanderbek led his people to these
mountains in time to keep them from
starving or being poisoned he made fire
come out of the rock everlasting fire
over it he hung the fire stone you now
see he taught us to bow to the fire and
serve it so that when the fire gods stopped
hating mankind the ghosts of the dead
flames would go away the years passed
and there was always further range for
our animals other people came and then
of course there was looting and war

  but skanderbek talked with gods and
devils and so no one could drive us out
of here one day skanderbek said  am
going back to the gods let such and such
a one take my place i have taught him
what to do and what to say to the holy
flame so that fire will never again destroy
the earth and one day wearing a new
body i will come back all this was a long
time ago long before your people came
out of the sky with knives of steel and
with- guns to trade with us

  and now tell me about your gods
verrill

  there was very little to tell falana ex-
cept that science had become had from
the beginning been the god of venus he
was quite too busy reflecting that skan-
derbek a man like himself had undoubted-
ly used a geiger counter and some imag-
ination and had as a result become a
god

  he was thinking also of lindas letter
she had not been able to give him much
gossip about dawsons plans to oppose
him since dawson had left without hav-
ing done much talking but he inferred
from what she did -write and from stor-
ies ardelans tribesmen brought from the
disputed frontier that a venusian was
living with the neighboring tribe giving
them rifles to take the place of their trade
muskets this suggested that dawson was
taking the simple and direct approach
coaching his protectors in the art of more
efficient figwng so that as the dmiax of
	planet

an eventual raid into ardelans almost
inaccessible fortress dawson could seize
the fire of skanderbek and make off with
it in the confusion

  whatever verrill intended to do he
would have to do it quickly

he went to the shrine and asked
kwangtan where is the grave of
skanderbek 

  skanderbek the priest said contemp-
tuous of ignorance is not buried he
went back to the gods now go and stay
away

  i have heard a story like that ver-
rill retorted among my own people
there are old books ancient before skan-
derbek was even dreamed of and it is
written always how one leader or another
went ack to the gods not dying as other
men died but we know better a man
dies and his bones remain

  kwangtans eyes sharpened and changed
he seemed to be asking himself whether this
might not be one of those times when the
wise thing was to make an ally of an
enemy and verrill was at the same time
thinking lies are the foundation of all
priestcraft and ive got this one searching
the foundations

  verrill said if a man found the bones
of skanderbek he could build a shrine
there for the gods of death men serve
most what they fear most

  which of us fears death the priest
challenged we are fighting-men

  my patients act otherwise verrill
blandly countered then skanderbek
had no wings his bones can not be far
from here the bones of skanderbek will
give a light like a glow-worm or a fire-
fly wherever they are lying they will be
easily recognized any herdsman would
know if he found them

  verrill was gambling on the probability
that skanderbek leading a group of ter-
restrians to safety had exposed himself
overmuch to the deadly radioactivity more
so than any of those he led whether there
had been sufficient to make his bones ra-
dioactive until they would glow either
then or now was an open question but
kwangtan was of the line of priests who
create and maintain a tradition the blend

stories

of knowledge and falsehood that keeps
their craft alive and their privilege secure
kwangtan would surely have enough of
that blend to set him wondering and in
his own interests

  it was time to leave and nodding con-
tentedly verrill left rightly assured that
the old devil would lose no time hunting
the bones of skanderbek lest someone else
find them first and set up a rival shrine
he would have to hunt by night and
alone the nights were cold and the trails
dangerous

  a few nights later verrill went out
high on the rimrock to lurk in a perilous
perch overhanging the shrine he saw
kwangtan momentarily outlined by the
light that came from the grotto the priest
was making for the spring and then
climbing higher apparently he was going
out by a secret way for a concealed pur-
pose well satisfied verrill climbed down
out of the bitter cold wind which whined
eternally about the limestone buttresses
unobserved he went down again into the
shelter of the ledge and to the house where
falana was asleep

  she no more perceived his return than
she had his departure

before many days had passed
verrill was busily probing for bul-
lets suturing sword slashes and setting
bones when the fighting men he had
salvaged were well enough to be about and
looking for more trouble ardelan con-
fessed that he had entirely revised his no-
tions on doctors and that gave verrill his
chance to say ill go along the next time
theres a raid i could have saved that one
who died on the way

  ardelan shook his head there is a
personal enemy of yours among our neigh-
bors i cant take any chance of your being
killed or captured

  youre making a priest of me ver-
rill said mockingly living on the fat of
the land and taking none of the risks
youve made that for yourself arde-
lan retorted and speaking of priests
youll have one for a patient

  hows that

  kwangtan is coughing a lot hes fail-
ing rapidly we had always thought he
extle from venus	

 would live forever

   verrill shrugged hes old so old he
 hasnt much time left hed rather die a little
 sooner than admit that there is anything

 i	could possibly do for him letting me
 treat him would be casting serious reflec-
 tions on the fire god how was the raid-
 did it pay

   pretty well all around

   a few more sheep and some more work
 ifor me

   more than that ardelan corrected
 theres a nice looking valley but its al-
 ways been deadly poisonous from the
 beginning weve never used it that
 tranger that dawson must have found
 out that the curse is no longer on the
 soil theyve been using it for their flocks
 well its ours it always has been so we
 ran them out

   theyll come back

   of course they will but with enough
 raids well discourage them and then
 we can send some of our own people to
 hold it permanently build a settlement
 verrill had heard talk of all this but
 not in such clear terms now having got it
 from the chief he could take notice and
 he was prepared

   your oldest son will live there ver-
 rill surmised to represent you

   ardelan nodded good experience for
 him against the day of my death when
 he will rule the tribe

   thats been worrying you

   ardelans brows bristled and his eyes
 went fierce worrying aliout the day of
 my death-what do you meau

   i meant worrying about your sons tak-
 ing an exposed outpost

   its good experience for him

   its worrying you the next son is six
 years younger

   the chief grimaced hes a reckless
 young fool and a show-off like i was
 at his age and i dont think he has my
  luck

   next time theres a raid verrill
 promised ill go it will be good for all
 your men not just for him in case he is
 wounded it wont look as though youre
 favoring your son

   ardelan grumbled something- midway be-
 tween throat and beard and gave verrill

 a gesture of dismissal verrill knew when
 to stop pressing a point and he knew
 also that further words had not been

needed

  in this he was right he rode out with
others who went to reconnoiter the dan-
gerous valley and there was no objection
he rode well his presence was good for
the morale of the raiders and while he
caught no sight of dawson he won pres-
tige from supposedly having come to the
frontier camps to get a shot at his enemy
actually he rather hoped that he would
not have any such chance to settle the
feud  it would be much more satisfac-
tory to have dawson witness his return to
venus with the fire of skanderbek

  and of an evening when he was at
home with falana she would sit with him
as he watched venus hanging low over
the rimrock white and splendid she was
finishing her term as evening star and the
sight of that far-off globe made him more
than homesick it accentuated his feeling
of remoteness and of exile and at the
same time made him uneasy and uncom-
fortable as though he and his terres-
trian redhead were somehow under lindas
eyes

  and he was afraid lest falana read his
thoughts the longer he stayed the harder
it would be to leave for in spite of his
having come with fraudulent intent he
had done enough good to these barbarians
to have become attached to them

  meanwhile the sooner venus lecame
the morning star the better he would like
it

v

t last came the night
when he felt sure that kwangtans
search for the bones of skanderbek had
become such a fixed habit that the priest
would be ranging further and further afield
leaving the shrine unguarded for an ever-
lengthening period the length of kwang-
tans absence was the measure of verrils
head-start

  as he set out for his goal he said to
himself when the ola devii misses the
ruby and then hears im gone hell likely
	planet

play foxy and cook up a yam about my
having taken it back to the gods he
couldnt be so dumb as to admit he was
out wandering when he should have been
guarding the shrine    ive done a rea-
sonable number of other miracles since i
brought falanas nephew back from the
dead  so if hes smart hell invent an-
other miracle and that will make it nice
for falana  

  and so all at ease he rode boldly from
the walled enclosure the guards assuming
he was going out on a case settled back
after greeting him and drew their sheep-
skin coats closer about them

  nearing the shrine he left his horse in
the shadow of a limestone ledge to
proceed afoot he had to make sure that
kwangtan was actually away

  stealthily he made the most of rocks
and shadows to cover his advance the
gurgling overflow of the spring combined
with the whining of the wind to make a
curtain of sound he was quite near the
spot from which unseen he could look in
and see if kwangtan was there when he
heard a disturbance which gave him all the
answer he needed

  kwangtan was not abroad hunting a
dead mans bones he was instead choking
gasping for breath in his struggle he
knocked down some pottery judging from
the clatter

  the sounds and the way the old man
had been scrambling about by night ex-
ploring ravines and caverns exposing and
overtaxing himself told the story he had
come to the end of his crooked rope

  this was perfect it had worked far
better than verrill had anticipated just
sit and wait for silence and the finish

  but another ingredient took effect ver-
rills own long-sustained pretense of being
a doctor drove him forward against his
best interest after two paces taken in a
helpless daze he was no longer compulsion-
driven and bewildered he ran and with
his kit he had brought it with him from
force of habit as much as for making a
show for the benefit of whomsoever he
might encounter along the way to the bor-
der

  as he knelt beside his patient verrill
concluded that kwangtans heart had been

stories

cutting up tricks though with exposune
and worry other complications might have
set in he got his vials and his hypo and
set to work

  of a sudden he knew that he was not
alone with his patient startled he glanced
about

falana was in the doorway and with
her two of the guards they held her
by the arms she had a bundle of some-
thing wrapped up in a shawl her face
showed only impatience and annoyance
at their stupidity their faces were stttl
changing the growth of understanding
and the accepting of a new idea had not
yet erased suspicion

  the sight of the trio gave verrill the
story before any could speak falana
sensing what he planned had packed up
a bundle and had set out after him and
the guards even though not getting the
entire point had suspected that the doctor
was up to the very trick of which he had
been accused falana had from the start
been a hostage at least a bond sufficiently
strong to guarantee his good behavior
thus the sight of her apparently preparing
to follow him into the night had aroused
all the suspicions which his work had
lulled

  falana said the poor fellows half
starved verrill and shivering from cold
let go of me you blockheads-hes busy
and ive got to give him a hand

  she plopped her bundle on the floor
brought out a small pot and set to work
heating water over the sacred flame

  if you dont like it get some brush
she told the guards and ill stop the sacri-
lege

  blinking owlishly they obeyed

  when they returned to kindle a fire on
the floor she had dried meat in the pot
here hold this she directed and tak-
ing a heavy cape from the bundle she
blanketed the patient next she drew the
shawl about his head and shoulders what-
ever else she may have had in the bundle
verrill did not know for she had very
deftly wadded the odds and ends into a
shirt and had tucked the lot under the
priests head for a pillow
exile from venus



  when kwangtan responded to treatment
and regained consciousness he did not
have any idea as to what had happened
or why people were gathered about him
but he swallowed some of the broth fal-
ana offered him

  the guards explained the doctor
knew you were in trouble

  falana nodded he awakened suddenly
and told me to follow when i had this and
that gathered together the gods talk to
him now that youve had your fill of
snooping suppose you go on about your
business 

  they went leaving verrill and falana
to sit up with the priest until he was out
of danger

  within the hour verrill could have rid-
den off with the fire of skanderbek in-
stead he made apologies to himself he
could not rob a patient or even collect his
fee before he had really earned it

several days passed and word
of verrills having heard the voice of
the gods and so having gone to the shrine
in time to save kwangtan gave him an
enormous boost in prestige he had the
priest at least halfway on the road to re-
covery when a courier brought news of
another outbreak on the border he hesi-
tated to leave his patient and decided to
wait until the warring tribesmen made
actual contact as nearly as he could ana-
lyze the report both sides were still
scouting skulking maneuvering into posi-
tions suitable for the seizure of or the de-
fense of the valley tfoat ardelan claimed
as his own

  there would not be a serious clash un-
til both sides had completed their infil-
tration whereby each planned to catch the
other off guard and so precipitate a panic
the result of which would be relatively
few casualties and a great deal of loot
in the form of stampeded or abandoned or
lost animals

  these barbarians verrill told himself
had a warfare far more civilized than had
been that of the war and also a lot more
sensible-there was a result to show for
the effort exerted and a profit instead of
a mutual loss

  he decided to stay with his patient and

then by dint of hard riding join arde-
lans son when there was immediately im-
pending need

  falana said youre making a mistake
now is your chance

  just that way with no build up at all
and she was right for he needed no ex-
planation of her meaning he knew all of a
sudden that she had tuned in on all his
unspoken debates with himself he and
kwangtan were supposed to be able to
talk with the gods that was pure non-
sense the gift was largely a feminine
monopoly falana undoubtedly knew all
about linda instead of merely about the
venusian domes

  verrill answered i cant rob a patient
if he dies or gets well then it will be dif-
ferent  

  falana shrugged and for no apparent
reason moved a bundle wrapped up in a
cape suit yourself verrill but you are
letting your luck wear thin if you want it
this way though ill be ready whenever
you are

  you were all ready the other night

  of course and when the guardsmen
caught me i was scared silly i dont
know what would have happened if that
old devil hadnt been at deaths door now
is your chance  it wont ever be
better

  falana was right so very right yet
verrill balked he mounted up with his
medical kit and with a pair of pistols
thrust into his sash

  he was worried and worn down tend-
ing to kwangtan and within reaching dis-
tance of the ruby had been difficult worse
yet there was the problem created by
falana whenever he convinced himself
that once back in the venusian domes he
would forget the terrestrian girl his argu-
ment went into reverse and he knew that
regardless of distance the bond could not
be broken in fact then pursuing the
endless debate from its other alternative
neither could he remain an exile from
venus and stay away from linda by any
choice of his own

  and all this went with him oppressing
him as he rode toward the new valley
which would so enrich ardelans people
	planet

verrill was still well
short of his destination when he
heard a rider behind him a horse blowing
and wheezing ridden nearly to death yet
carrying on he wheeled about it was
falana who had overtaken him

  you little idiot go back home

  i wont

  you will and now

  yes if you carry me back

 whats the idea you know im com-
ing back and you know theres a lot of
trouble ahead where im bound for
im going anyway

  and then her horse collapsed verrill
had no magic to restore it to life now i
cant go back she announced conten-
tedly as though she had foreseen this de-
cisive detail

  she mounted up and rode behind him
from time to time verrill halted and
cocked an ear thus far he had heard no
firing he had seen no signal fires on the
crests that were dark against the stars
the way became harder and until moon-
rise difficult to pick

  when the first half-glow whitened the
limestone slopes and the high snowcaps
the mountain world became a maze of illu-
sion and shifting glamour

  finally verrills horse sniffed the air
and would have whinnied had he not
checked him in time as he paused he
wondered whether falanas presence the
night he had saved kwangtan would be
sufficient precedent for her accompanying
him into the field or whether instead
suspicion would be aroused

  he had reined in at the edge of a deep
shadow before he could make up his
mind falana said turn around and
see-ive got it

  as he twisted about the horse shifted
moving out of the shadow and into light
strong enough for him to see the ruby she
had in her hand it collected enough of the
glow to pulse and flame s though in its
own right one good look he got and then
she had knotted it again into the end of
her scarf and thrust it securely between
her breasts

im going with you to the home of the

stories

gods falana said and if they your
people dont like me they can do what
they want with me but im going

  however she had made away with the
gem there would be the devil to pay when
kwangtan missed it his exclamation of
dismay made her add he wont make
any trouble he smothered under his
sheepskin robe

  verrill preferred not to ask whether she
meant that the invalid had himself done
this accidentally or whether aroused by
her prowling his protest had been stifled
quickly and silently by a solid armful of
a woman who knew precisely what she
had to do to save herself instead of being
horrified by a very logical suspicion he
dismissed the query for in either event
he had no longer any choice concerning
falana she had made the bond so strong
that wherever he went he would take her
there was no more clash between him and
dawson the bond that had attached him
to linda had been cut whether by
smothering the fire priest or merely rob-
bing the fire god falana had done well
for herself

  after a silence he said theres some-
one just ahead my horse scented them
whoever they are they may have caught
some sign of us you get down and wait
the sight of you is likely to make the
outposts think im leaving the tribe and
now is no time for suspicion

  i know another way around and out
falana said a hard trail but we can
make it

  whoevers ahead up there might start
wondering all i have to do is go ahead
and identify myself and then go my way
 you can make some excuse for coming
back this way she said and slipped to
the ground ill wait

he rode on at a walk ten to one
falana had smothered kwangtan not
out of malice but simply because he would
have kept her from following verrill since
verrill could not reject her he had to
accept the act as his own however heavy
the burden he shrank from the very sus-
picion of the deed and at the same time
his eyes were tear-blinded from realization
of her devotion so much more reckless
exile from venus	

than any venusian womans could have
been

  a horse whinnied verrilts mount an-
swered and before verrill could hail the
dimly-discerned rider revealed when he
rounded a sharp curve he knew that this
was an ambush the recognition between
horses had come because the animals ahead
had been stolen from ardelans herd

  despite his disadvantage knowledge
came before he had made himself too
good a target

  that split-second sensing gave him a
chance with his pistol he spurred in
shooting a wild shot grazed him the
enemy stampeded as though from the sud-
den fear that they had tricked themselves
it was as though his boldness had con-
vinced them that he had a large party at
his back

  in half a dozen hoofbeats he was
through one horse was down and strug-
gling something thumped into the ravine
far below there was a brief shower of
rocks and the diminishing clatter of hoofs

  only two had lain in wait and one was
bound for home

  verrill reined in sharply and called to
falana she answered and knowing it was
all over came toward him at a walk

  verrill was badly shaken falana know-
ing that he would be was giving him a
welcome moment to himself this was his
first taste of combat

  the enemy sprawled among the rocks
groaned and cursed as though shock had
until that moment held him unable to make
a sound this was something familiar to
verrill for in his way he was now a doc-
tor in fact--a man was a man whether
friend or enemy and this one being a
man he had wounded evoked his re-
sponse more readily than had kwangtan

  verrill dismounted the man in the sha-
dows mumbled and choked the mans
horse lay dead and approaching his own
handiwork shook verrihs composure
worse yet he should not dally no telling
who might have heard the shots who might
be hurrying to the scene but he could not
abandon a patient though this might be-
come a dangerous business with the fire
of skanderbek taken from the shrine-

-planet stories--may

  three sounds blended verrill under-
stood each but too late

  now see if youll get the ruby the
patient challenged triumphantly and fired

  venusian accent and intonation pistol
blast and then as dawson unwounded
bound up to take verrills horse came the
third sound falanas cry

  her approach afoot had tricked daw-
son she was on him from the rear be-
fore he sensed his danger he swayed he
choked and he would have flung her aside
but for the knife with which she finished
him stab and slash and he was dead be-
fore she could crawl free of him to go to
verrill

  dawson living with the enemy tribe
had learned raiding tricks and had known
how to tempt an enemy by offering hope
of plunder by feigning a mortal wound
he had played the game as his brothers in
raiding would have played it and at the
most he could not have hoped for more
than a horse and the weapons of the sup-
posedly greedy and reckless one whose loot
hunger had driven out ordinary caution
moonlight on verrills face had given
dawson his moment of triumphant recog-
nition-and then sudden death which he
might otherwise have avoided

  the irony of all this passed through
verrills mind during the moments which
elapsed before he could recover sufficiently
from shock to speak teeth chattering
from the deadly chill which took hold of
him he said physician heal thyself

  he knew he was beyond mending he
knew also that he had long drawn-out
hours of agony ahead of him falana knew
without being told that she would soon
be alone that she would never loard the
long gleaming shell on the take-off ramp
of the trading-post to go with him to the
home of the gods since he was shivering
she wrapped a shawl about him and wait-
ed for him to tell her what else to do

the shift of the moon
thinned the shadows that had tricked
first one and then another of those who
had met in that rocky angle verrill point-
ed to the kit and told her how to load the
hypo he had done this himself many
times for those he knew he could not
	planet

save they lasted just as long but avoid-
ed consciousness and pain this had won
him esteem and now he was to learn how
good his work had been

  his vision began to play tricks and his
memory also but he was sure that the
white orb shimmering rising from behind
a distant crest was venus beginning her
term as morning star seen through that
thin mountain air venus was an expand-
ing splendor and memories danced mem-
ories of linda blurred with the memories
of all other venusian women per-
fumed and sleek and all bejewelled they
were shapes of the mind rather than a
semblance to the eye for at the same
time he saw clearly where he was and
who was beside him and he was glad
that it was falana

  falana peeled off her jacket and blouse
she cut a long strand of hair and despite
the biting wind that lashed her from
shoulder to hip she shaped a loop using
two long hairs to suspend the fire of
skanderbek from about her throat

  she knelt posed by sure instinct head
flung back and the monstrous ruby all
ablaze against her white skin the lower
end of the six-sided crystal barely dipped
into the shadow of her breasts

  the venusian images of memory were
blotted out and with them the great white
orb as well falana became all women in
one yet remaining all the while wholly
herself

  verrills face or her own instinct told
her when to end the tableau she slipped
into her jacket and went into the shadow
beside him she caught him in her arms to
pillow him better than had the rocks and
the saddle-bags that had oftened them
and then verrill went on his long road
and entirely content for he had in his
way done with the fire of skandertsek
as he had planned

  not long after sunrise a handful of
ardelans men came along from the new

stories

valley they had routed the raiders some-
where they told falana there had been
several shots which had alerted them

  the shots verrill fired they conclud-
ed having seen and understood from the
face of things

  she gave them no time to wonder about
her presence he wa going to stay for
days and days with the people ardelan was
sending into the new valley i made him
take me with him so i was here when he
killed his enemy the one with whom he
had a feud

  despite their grief at losing their doc-
tor the mountaineers forgot none of their
ways methodically they took the gear
from the dead horse and stripped the dead
enemy leaving nothing but vulture bait
and among the things they found in his
clothes was the fire of skanderbek

  the gods told verrill falana said
but not all and not in time only enough
to send him where he would meet the
thief

  they studied his face and one said it
is clear that the gods welcomed him when
he took their road

  later ardelan himself joined them he
heard he saw and then he said we will
bury verrill by those others who have
guarded the fire of skanderbek he saved
many lives for us as skanderbek did in the
old days

  and this was done with no one won-
dering at kwangtans death some said
that the spirit of the priest had guided
verrill to overtake the looter falana heard
the legend grow and could not tell what
ardelan really thought whatever his
thought the chief kept it to himself until
days later he said to falana verrills
son will be a great man among us to
watch the fire of skanderbek and teach
us the way of the gods

  which seemed reasonable enough to
falana who had command of more
miracles than any man

  i am writing this for the same reason every-
body else writes to the visicrapper that one
prime reason is - aw hell everybody knows
what it is  i want an original as bad if not
worse than any other gutter-rat that lowers
himherself to the grimy station of science-
fiction fan in order to grab the votes i
gotta write a piece of shining prose that will
catch the eye

  i gotta compete against all the big-name fans
who have a higher education than  lousy years
in a podunk h s i gotta make sure i offend
no fan i will not say i am glad that for once
an ish of p s is not polluted with ray
bradbury  i will not say i hate the guts of
the blue pencil that will consign this paper to the
furnace are blue pencils allowed to vote and
flaming oblivion i will not say i wish all the
loud-mouthed blue pencil here who slam
dianetics would soak their heads in a barrel of
portland cement

  instead i gotta think up a angle which is
new i cannot say i dont want an orig there-
fore making all the crapper-parasites voting for
me to get one i cannot screw up my typer keys
so they jerky outy misspelly wordy because
thats been did afore i cannot send in a paper
done up with big math because i dont know
the tenth place logarithm table by heart andor
know how to do binomial quadratics thank you
l ron h

  while i waste paper i is endeavoring to
think which statement in itself is a gigantic laff
or six

is lin carter a male or female that seems
	planet

to be a big little question i settle all l c is
a neuter thar by blue pencil here

  i once had a pet martian male and female but
they got to digging in heavily on my larder of
editors and i fed them to jim the fish my
understudy in the art of cooking editors to please
the palate i have jerome the bixby on my shelf
only he dont know it do you j b drexel

  i is sorry i said-no i didnt say that yet
by blue pencil here did i oh by the way i
and i have a fanzine in the making it is to
be called fan fairy whooopsl blue pencil
back there the price is to be very cheap for
fan fairy only one editor a copy got any
old editors laying around in the closet gathering
dust

  describe yourself cherry bombl i got you
pegged as a guy who dont know a mashie from
a racket and i dont mean the editor racket or
anchor man you is very lazy you has a dozen
gross secretaries and six old wore-out fans as
eunuchs you has a wife and loves her as much
as you do your  secretaries you spend your
time making big slashes acrost letters wit your
blew pencil

  i warn all fanzine men not to fail sending me
ito copys of no fanzine if they sees this in printte
which i doubts make a deal wit cha bixquick
if you print this i will give you back paul
paynes left arm all that was left after jim the
fish dined

  i will quit this before jim the fish gets vicios
how the hell ya all spell vishus and gnaws on
bixbys head which of course is the soup-bone

  but before i close the door for another 
monthy id like all fanz who are interested in

dear editor

  well i know i am going to make a lot of fans
happy and yourself as well i spotted the latest
planet on the newsstand and couldnt bring my-
self to read it so in all fairness i cant write any
more letters to the magazine

  for years planet has been in a rut and i
bought it mainly because it amused me to see the
names the fans called me for knowing a little
more about history than they did after you took
it over i thought there might be a change but
you have dropped back into the slump

  your authors seldom know anything about
their subjects they will mention a known law
of science and blithely contradict or misuse it
they do not even know simple arithmetic and
contradict their own stories if they use history
they know nothing about it they attempt to use
psychology without the least understanding of
what makes people tick

  it doesnt make any difference what the sub-
ject is they are absolutely ignorant of it as a
result most of the stories stink your readers
make fun of westerns yet the majority of west-
erns are better written and better plotted than

stories

most science-fiction stories perhaps you had
better hire a bunch of western writers

  you have to read the stories you purchase
and if you dont care to take the trouble to in-
sist that your authors write better stories or fix
up the ones they have written then i dont care
enough to buy the magazine

  i really like science-fiction-and have ob-
tained a lot of pleasure in the past from it so i
hope i will not be absent too long

  lastly to those fans who have landed on me
for stating facts a six-year-old child ought to
know you have not defeated me but i see no
profit in discussing anything with people who
cannot remember a news-event over a twenty-
four hour period and who instead of digging up
facts to confront you land on you with such cries
as nazi communist bigot blasphemer you
have profaned the sacred name of roosevelt
and the like

  and i used to believe that fans read science-
fiction because they liked to think

  hm    id be interested to see enough specie
fic examples cited to cover that sweeping accu-
sation of ouclorial idiocy always willing to

dear editor

  i hope what mr chabot says isnt true but i
guess that it wont happen to me since im not
 years old yet anyway i like the january
issue very much

 the witch of the demon seas
was real thrilling the only thing i did not like
about it was that there was too much love in-
trest i am not interested in love intrest

 tiger by the tail was also very good
i like that kind of story very much

  i didnt like task to luna i didnt un-
derstand it

  poison planet was real scary i had to
read it twice to finally get the ending but i
liked it very much the picture was real good
too

  i didnt like safety margin very much
i dont think it was fair for bremner to kill mc-
call

 martian nightmare was real auful
dont print any more like that

  i wish you wouldnt have such sexy girls on
your covers i have a very hard time getting
my mother to let me buy planet with those
covers sometimes she make me tare the covers
off

  about which was the best letter i think mr
blishes was the best he writes a very good
letter

 next raoul d kyne and after him mr
chabot

  i hope a lot of people do send me things i
really love to get a lot of mail

                               yours truly

p s this is the first time i ever wrote to a

qff    to dinner that is

los angeles calif

dear jerome

  in the past couple of years that i have been
reading planet stories ive found that very
few of the fans classic epistles come from los
angeles being a stalwart angeleno i aim to
make your predominantly new york readers
realize that you also sell your mag on the western
side of the continent

  knowing your insane hatred for lengthy let-
ters increased costs of paper and ink no doubt
tavish macbixby ill come directly to the point
of this letter-the stories unusual what

 win-poison planet

  superb excellent moving realistic fine plot
well written also the illo was terrific just look
at poor mcbrides face and all those other can-
nabalistic slobs brooding around out there going
insane i heh heh and no happy ending  goot
goot

 place-martian nightmare

  gad what gore well written enjoyable but
the plot was slightly weak for example if
everyone was at war when did they have time to
have babies hence in time new soldiers also
why so many spare parts for only fifty oligarchs
ponder lads they lived hard-ed

 show-guest expert

  tough decision but i guess the unusual twist
in the plot noses out-

 fourth-witch of the demon seas
good reading but these sword-science fiction
stories are getting much too common in planet
two in this issue alone stuff like that belongs
in jungle stories or something on that line
let me congratulate vestal on his fine art in this
one though especially the inside illo on pages
 and  man that guy is good

 fifth-task to luna not bad but a
stale plot

  sixth-safety margin novel but for
some reason it did not make the grade for me

 seventh-tiger by the tail this
is deserving of last place plot too stereotyped
and action too slow its only the action anyway
that holds a story of this type together

  now lets talk about the cover a favorite sub-
ject with me snarl very colorful only trou-
ble is that i cant tell it apart from the others
that planet has featured in the past couple
years they all look alike this one is supposed
to illustrate witch of the demon seas
right you realize of course that it doesnt
oh well why change your policy just because of
me

  la vizi generally good but wow some of
those lengthy scientific discourses reads like a
medical journal

  so im through my beefs have been registered
under planets colossal file marked b thats
not for bixby either you vain fool i shall
now step into my space cruiser the venus ii
and embark on my journey to my ships name-
sake i hope to be in time for dinner bye now

dear bix

  the world is thundering to ruin around me
there are a million jobs and twenty-eleven letters
to be written but i got to find out something
how come i get a card from your subscription
dept saying my sub is out and a new sub cost
 i ask you how come you is bi-monthly
now  times a year    you still cost the same
old happy  so  x  makes  or it did
when i went to school honist i did i studied
at home but still i went you better look into
this  oh say is maureen garthwaite still
around the office or did paul take her with him
i came near winning her in place of a mcwil-
liams drawing once i still think paul was
greedy   

  while here i might as well mention that the
current issue was pretty fair  it got a 
average rating on my - rating scale better
than average    the two lads that lifted you up
there were anderson and oberfield both of
whom are very good at characterasation   
tiger by the tail was as complex a story
as your senior compedators could ask for and it
looked right good here id rate anderson the
best new writer of 

  poison planet used an old setting for
a rather grim new twist    well not new
its as old as the thin coating we call civilization
but it isnt used in the pulps very much i think
he did an exalect job too there were no falce
hero or the rest of the corn that usual fills yours
and most of your compeditors stories stories
about starvation come a lot closer home to every-
one than stories of battles with far galaxcies   
more please

  also a short bow to bryce walton for his
good story

  as for the letters id say the best were by
carter ganley and chabot

  the exchange on dianetics is probably the
best fight the viz has had in months i person-
ally have seen this all run over so many times by
local fans that it didnt excite me but for the
mag it is good im a fairly quite wate-an-see-
er there are many things about it i find inter-
esting but the actions of hubbard and those
working under him does a lot to undermind any
fath one might have in the subject lets face it
so california is famed as the land of the crack-
pot and the cultest and hubbard is using all the
tricks in the game it is really tobad if diane-
tics is a fake becouse the world needs something
like it as a friend pointed out more and more
people throughout the world are feeling the need
for some sort of mental tharaphy few of them
can afford  an hour for a good psychoanal-
yist so if they could plug down their  take
the book home and work on each other it would
be great fath can do a lot of things fath is
doing a lot of remarkable things becouse i
havent seen dianetics do anything yet

  ramon van rensburg must really be hard up
for magz if he is still getting copies with my
letters in them ive been so tied up with clubs
like young fandom an org for the new
fans that i havent had time to write if i
didn t review planet every two months at
lasfs i dont know if id get time to read
it even
	planet

oh    tell kyne that while ackerman is
one of my good friends i dont think he is the
cutest thing in fandom there are sarvel that
come to mind but there is a certen assistent edi-
tor of one of planets smaller compeditors
namely bea mahaffey that isnt so bad right

this morning much to my chagrin

i found the planet stories in

i parted with my twenty cents

expecting-as he who soon repents
a foolish act-to find it lost
but lot i find the coin was tossed
upon the counter for a cause

i give to you my great applause
rtis fine tis great your mag at last
my careful scrutiny has passed

the art is fair-its even good

i liked the tales you knew i would

story one was safety margin

tiger olose behind was bargin

followed next by guest expert
and task to luna now the dirt

the witch she stunk on this ill swear

the same for waltons dull nightmare
the planet poison little better-
though not as dry still not much wetter

the vizigraph was quite superior

why must it stay at your mags posterior

i read it first as so do all

but have to all the pages maul

to reach the second letter there

im sure by now im in your hair

ill now commence with my bouquets

for gibson stewart ganley-rayyys

of david english ill say nothing

i fear that now your mouth is frothing

for if you werent insane before

this poem has made you that or more

this work will not in print appear

you see dear ed you wouldnt dare

dear jerry

  informality thats what i like reckon as how
since this is the first time i have had the temer-
ity to address you i should get more formal
but i note the correspondents whose letters you
print are invariably pleasantly friendly albeit
usually a little whacky-perhaps that is why i
drummed up the necessary intestinal fortitude
to relieve a long standing frustration by address-
ing an editor on equal terms of course recent
close attention to the cup that cheers may have
something to do with it    huh 

  i gather from a perusal of the vizigraph of
the jan ish that ps has gone into a bi-monthly
production  is this actually so whazzat
whereve i been how come i didnt know about
that well i ben oot in a furrin land part of
this summer-i think the folks thereabouts called
it californy or some such stf name-and i never
could screw up the necessary courage to walk
down the streets with such fine examples of art
work under my arm yeah i think i saw one
maybe two copies-guess i just didnt know the
right bookstores drug stores or what have you
if it is true however that ps has come into the
fold of bi-monthly mags i have but one thing to
say shabashl

  a little while ago-i think it was in  or
thereabouts-i read my first issue of ps the
one containing the tale about transplanted egos
called if i recalj correctly which i may not
survival and since then i have been an avid
ps fan and an equally fanatic antogonist to
those who would reduce to nothing but a lot of
scientific mumbo-jumbo the fair field of stf
i to be perfectly frank read stf for relaxation
and as an escape and i like full well the psychic
distance engendered by immediate recognition
of the locus of a story being far away and im-
possible such stories as rebel of valkyr
tiger by the tail and the already men-
tioned survival have a definite place in stf
for me the pure adventure in a strange locale is
one reason why i like ps so well if i feel in
the mood for science i either go to a science
fanatic or one of the stfs specializing in science
when i feel in the mood for adventure with a
good spice of imagination which is nearly all
the time i go to ps or one of two or three
other good stfs depending on which one i can
get that i have not already read there is no
feeling as despondent as that of wanting desper-
ately a new ish of stf to read going expectandy
to the store and finding nothing but well-thumbed
and already-read copies stariug with a sort of
wistful expression at one   

  since every reader well almost that writes
you-all seems to have to have a try at evalu-
ating the stories i suppose i must make a stab
at it i thought all stories in vol  no  ish
were good with the exception of guest ex-
pert  it left me with the feeling the martian
failed to live up to the agreement otherwise it
was quite well done i liked tiger by the
tail especially but then thats true of all the
rest oh well reckon i am too easily pleased
to be a critic but then i dont pretend to be one

  see ya agin somewhere sometime somehow

tale of woe

                             brooklyn n y

dear jerome

  i really dont know if i should call you dear
as my husband might object if this ever reaches
print but be that as it may here is my tale of
woe my husband is a science-fiction fan of the
first magnitude he clutters up our bedroom our
living room and our kitchen with old magazines
some of which he claims go back as far as 
he loves them more than me had i known this
before i married him i assure you that would
have been one wedding that never would have
come to pass but dont get me wrong-i
love my husband and there are times i believe
he loves me now i wonder if you think i
have you pegged as a mr agony character and
am telling you should i leave my husband and
elope with his magazines  no nothing like
that

  i perchance decided after js long years that
i would try-by try i mean read-one of the
mags so when my husband sent me down to the
store to purchase all the latest mags yours was
amongst the rest-and i asked if i might read
one he was very nice about it alright you can
read it but dont fold the cover-hold it straight
-be careful not to rip it etc etc- so taking
my life in my hands i proceeded to open the
jan  issue the first thing i read was the
vizigraph and i was completely taken aback
my thoughts were what is this a reincarnation
of joe millers joke book is this where all the
aspiring groucho marxes unload their material
at your expense and then i turned to the
stories after reading them all the one i liked
best was task to luna and i guess here is
how i would rate the rest

 -guest expert -poison plan-
et -tiger by the tail -witch
of the demon seas -martian
nightmare -safety margin

  i dare now to sneak amongst my hubbys
vaunted collection ugh and read a few more of
of your swell planet stories so i will close
now and look forward to the future with planet
stories both future and past

                        very truly yours

                     mrs mitz schwartz

hubby a thing or two thanks again

this guy pops his face onto the gum machines
mirror

  naturally i am very curious to know who this
schlumpf is as i am not a character who makes
a practice of associating with just any kind of
schlumpf but i dont ask any questions as the
most you can get from asking questions along
broadway is a reputation for asking questions

  turning i behold a shaggy individual dressed
in the weariest sort of cast-offs look bum-
i begin

  ah he cuts in then you do not recognize
me how fickle are the fingers of fate he
straightens himself slightly and arches an eyebrow
to the sky i am skin-skin remedy the great-
est stfan of all timel

  skin-skin rem- i chokes

  yes he smiles as a slight-of-hand t artiste
might smile at a bucolic hick i am mel

  well needless to say when  know who this
schlumpf really is i am taken quite back he is
skin-skin remedy the famous stfan who is
called skin-skin not because he is skinny but
because he is double skinny he is a sad-looking
schlumpf i feel sorry for him and i ask him
where he has been all these years since he retired
from the occupation of being a full-time fan

  all it is a sad story he groans to begin
with i have known neither father nor mother
they both died years before i was born my aunt
who was extremely cruel raised me on science-
fiction pulps and i grew up the lonely and un-
wanted child that i am to-day here he leans
over and drips large salty tears on my shoulder

  when i was only  my aunt passed away in
a fit of apostrophe and left me alone in the huge
world i was already the top stfan of the day
but i realized sadly that i must retire somehow
i had to make money in order to live

  by this time i must admit grudgingly that i
am crying also and i tell skin-skin to go on
with his heart-breaking narrative

  i decided he said to become a science-
fiction writer i retired to the sands of the sahara
and there i studied and applied myself so that
some day i might write stories

  good godl i cried lost in admiration

  he spits thrice to boot he resumes i
have revised the koran here is my version
you will notice that i have ripped out pages
 and  it is better that way he thumbed
to the spot and sure enough these pages were gone
i could see he was a great writer

  and now i have returned i have written
science-fiction and i have been published skin-
skin reaches into his pocket with his indif-
fcrently-cleaned right hand and pulls out a copy
of your mag planet stories which is coin-
cidentally dated january  i wrote this
he says modestly

  naturally i will admit i was taken back and i
ask him if he wrote it all letters and every-
thing skin-skin blushes somewhat and replies
that he did its quite simple really he says
i took another issue and changed the names
and places

  but now to finish my saga i made twenty-
three cents for writing this and with this accumu-
lated wealth i will again sally forth into the
sahara there to sit and ponder and think i
have already made many thousand inventions
from natures bounteous supply of materials my
prize creation the ultime lens with which i am

stories

able to view the secrets of the universe is
made entirely from gravel he spat again and
i realized that skin-skin remedy was truly a
great man

  the next day the sun shines brightly and i
ambles up broadway but cannot find my bosom
pal skin-skin so i naturally assume dear editor
that the great man is off once more and that
somewhere in the world even now he is sitting in
the middle of his great inventions preaching
from his revised koran thinking smiling and
spitting

more on dianetics   

dear mr bixbv

  i have noted with interest the five columns of
vizigraph you have given to letters from
wickham and blish on the controversial subject
of dianetics it seems only fair that some
additional space be granted to a person who
has studied dianetics under mr hubbard in his
los angeles school i attended the first course
in professional auditing in this area and by dint
of hard work graduated with one of the rather
rare certificates from the hubbard dianetic
research foundation i mention this so that you
may be assured that i have some experience in
the field and perhaps investigate some of the
following information

  in reference to mr wickhams letter

  	if certain things happen consistently and
laws can be formulated or discovered which
adequately explain this consistency and extra-
polating from these laws new laws can be
postulated which subsequently prove to be valid
where is the tmscience  the assertion that ron
hubbard lias dim awareness of what constitutes
science is your cross to carry and certainly not
his to disprove

  	i have worked about  hours with
dianetic processes and of this time much has
been spent with persons who know nothing of
dianetics or dianetic terms some of these have
been    year old children my observation
is that i get better results with a person who does
not know whet reactions are to be expected

  	hubbard will admit readily that much work
leading toward the basic discoveries and formu-
lation of dianetics was done by others but he
does not admit that they made the discovery of
the reactive mind as different from the subcon-
scious in that it contains only data recorded dur-
ing moments of pain and unconsciousness and
is the sole source of aberration in the human
mind he does not admit that others evolved
dianetic techniques

  and now mr blish

  i am truly sorry to hear james blish say in
capital letters that only experienced
persons should experiment with dianetics i do
agree that only those persons who are well versed
in the processes of the field should experi-
ment but feel that such a statement is poten-
tially misleading to many people through my
experience i have found tliat anyone is capable
of using dianetics if he will do three things and
these are

  	study carefully and thoroly the theories
and techniques as described in the book with the
elimination of the one to seven count by merely
the vizigraph

saying- close your eyes and avoiding using
random repeater technique	 

  	follow the rules closely and not mixing
the techniques with other methods and ideas

  	stick to it not giving up for success will
surely come to those who persevere

  in conclusion i find the question where is
the evidence  have evidence for i have worked
with dianetics using the above three rules do
you have evidence and if not why not you
can get it the way i did

                           thank you

robert l sewell

                          new york n y

dear jerry

 i am already familiar with the claims for
dianetics which mr sewell makes including the
claim of the possession of evidence they are the
same claims as those made by mr hubbard and
his associates i do not find them any more con-
vincing coming from mr sewell than i did when
i first encountered them i wish some one person
associated with dianetics would actually come
forth with some of this evidence they all claim to
liave

  as for mr sewells three rules i regret to
say that i find them a poor substitute for scien-
tific method mr sewells rules tell me a good
deal about his concepts of validity however i
should like to remark also that perseverance in
a half-understood activity leads more frequently
to catastrophe than it does to success

dear editor 

  up until now i havent been a consistent reader
of planet stories since in my opinion it defi-
nitely was not one of the better sf publications
but after reading your first bi-monthly issue i
have revised my rating of your magazine it now
is unquestionably on the rise and if you can con-
tinue to turn out yarns of the quality that were in
the big november issue there is no doubt in my
mind that planet will soon be right up there with
very best sfs on the market to tell you the
truth i wondered why planet decided to go on a
bi-monthly basis when as a quarterly it was turn-
ing out material of inferior quality t decided to
buy the first issue call it a hunch and i certainly
was pleasantly surprised

  the november issue of planet contained one
of the finest stories i have yet read in tliat publica-
tion it was namely c h liddells deeply mov-
ing carry me home this story unsung and
unheralded as it was took me completely by
surprise unless i am badly mistaken this tale
bids fair to become a real planet classic and
would be a worthy addition to one of the many
sf anthologies now appearing on the market

stories

putably the best story in november planet but
there were others of exceptional qualitrouid merit
allen k langs machine of iclamugra
ran second to liddells classic and jay drexels
cargo to callisto along with fox b
holdens sidewinders from sirius
were stories of better than average interest

  i never did get around to reading fredric
browns original mitkey but frankly after all
the buildup  was rather disappointed with mit-
key rides again it was not an uninterest-
ing talc by any means but i guess i expected too
much after all the ballyhoo

  macdonalds final mission was a fair
little yarn but in coppels the last two
alive you diverted back to the old aram
looked up at the naked girl before him lewd type
of story i realize there are many readers who
love that kind of literature but i am not one of
them if i were i would read demaupassant and
boccaccio instead of science fiction which to me
is a high form of literature and should be treated
with dignity and respect

yours truly

                               irving slavin

   thanks for the kind words irving and we look
 forward lo more of the same from bridgeport
 but since tvhen is de maupassant lewd or boc-
 caccio for that matter-ed

sirs

   this is an open letter to the editor and fans of
 your magazine that has needed to be written for
 quite some time my subject is the work of ray
 bradbury i have been actively collecting rays
 stories in all fields and publications and have
 talked to him at length on several occasions in his
 studio so i feel that i may speak with some au-
 thority on his work

   let me begin by pointing out that ray bradbury
 is a very conscientious craftsman who takes a
 great deal of time on a story-as long as six
 month oh a short and he has been working four
 years on his major novel which by the way is
 semi-fantasy the fans who have complained of
 his repetition in theme have merely to look to the
 masters in the arts most of the great symphonic
 composers began with a major theme and built
 variations on that theme in the ensuing move-
 ments in the fields of writing and painting this
 also holds true all of our modern-day giants
 have used the same theme time and again de-
 veloping its varied hues and colorations to ac-
 cuse ray bradbury of cheap repetition of selling
 the same story over and over is extremely stupid
 and ill-informed

   since ray has begun to sell more of his work
to the slicks there are those grudging fans who
give vent to their frustrated envy in the form of
petty attacks on bradbury written for both pro
and fan zines they complain that his science is
inaccurate that he dwells morbidly on death and
that his conceptions of life are twisted and dis-
torted let ns examine these points 

   bradburys science is neither accurate nor in-
 accurate-it isnt science at all he uses other
 worlds as does an actor use a painted stage tq
the vtzigraph



project his ideas and emotions a bit more purely
and imaginatively than he could do on a realistic
footing he writes of mood and impressions of
the irony the humor the sadness and the fragility
of human existence 

  certainly he writes of death it is basic we are
bom we eat we sleep we live and we die death
concerns every living being human or otherwise
on this planet why not examine its many-faceted
face and not cringe behind a mask and pretend it
isnt there bradbury explores death as did the
late max brand explore strength in its pure phys-
ical form it is his privilege and it is neither
morbid noi distorted let the shallow superficial
fan seek elsewhere if he lacks the literary under-
standing to appreciate bradbury

  ray pays special care to the harmonious over-all
effect of each story he wastes no words building
his ideas and dialogue toward a chosen climax
each element is taken into account and not the
least of these is the title ray believes that the
title of a story should not conflict with its content
he keeps them strong and direct now in the case
of death wish his title was the blue
bottle and death by rain was the
long rains you the editors changed them
both and in the case of the former ruined the
story by revealing all in the title other mags have
made the same mistake-and it is a mistake to
change an authors title when he has considered
it as a key in the effect of his story

  but enough of critical comment-planet has
printed some great work by ray bradbury and
deserves praise on this count stories like mil-
lion year picnic zero hour pillar
of fire forever and the earth
asleep in armageddon etc were first
introduced to readers through your pages and
since have been reprinted in various forms

  a lot of readers may have been wondering just
what their boy has been up to of late and whether
or not he intends to desert the field of fantasy
well the answer to that is a decisive no he
recently sold the screaming woman to
flair no plug intended mr editor-just a
news note and the post recently ran one called
the world the children made as
to his future plans he has a hat-full

 the martian chronicles his last
book is undergoing screen adaptation with ray
lending a hand m-g-m and other studios are
anxious to film stories of his and the new york
agents are begging him to do a play he is now
seriously considering - and the moon be
stillas bright as well as way in the
middle of the air as prospects for the
stage his next book a collection of short stories
will not be published until march  he calls it
the illustrated man and it will contain
a couple of yarns from planet as well as at least
two or three brand new tales never before pub-
lished he showed me the cover jacket which he
had designed himself and a mock-up of the in-
terior contents his other book of stories frost
and fire wont appear until after march it
is thought that a short fantasy novel called the
fireman will appear as the lead with his two
novelettes from planet filling in the remainder-
a rewritten version of creatures that
time forgot and pillar of fire

  he is also working on two other books-a col-
lection of bits from his boyhood impressions of
illinois and a book set in mexico utilizing his

 novelette the next in line as an end piece
 to be blended nto the novel but perhaps the most
 interesting news to the general fan is that he is
 tentatively scheduled to edit a pocket collection
 of little known fantasy tales by writers well-
 known in the realistic fields-hemingway stein-
 beck etc bradbury reads widely enough in other
 fields to bring to light some unusual stories

   as to his regular short story work lie has an
 original coming out in an english publication soon
 and he told me of a new story he is working up-
 the shop of mechanical spiders-
 which is something to look forward to

   i hope the above data may bring his readers up
 to date on his activities i would like to hear from
 any other bradbury collectors at any time thanks
 for this opportunity of getting a few things ironed
 out in print wishing you much success in the
 future with planet i am

sincerely

 dear mr bixby

  im lost i never thought the day would come
  when i would spend half-a-dollar to send my
  sentiments per air mail to any science fiction mag
  but its happened and taint so bad neither

  well lets take a look at the ish

  cover as usual

 the last two alive dont you think
 this theme is a bit overworked even coppels
 fine writing seems to have taken a nosedive in
 this one

 carry me home liddell at his best i
 liked this one very much

 mitkey rides again  although i dont
 usually like this kind of stuff it was well-written

 sidewinders from sirius very very
 nice indeed

 machine of klamugra i liked this
 one too

 cargo to callisto tm sticking my
 neck out but its a bradbury-ish kind of story
 better than any ive read by the bright-eyed
 boy

 final mission to think that johnny
 would do that to us oh well it was a very short
 story anyway though it seems to me you could
 easily have left it out nothing would have been
 missed and la vizi could have profited by the
 space adding up you turned out a very nicely
 rounded issue mr bixby suh very very nice in-
 deed - but then one is rarely disappointed by
 planet

  what happened to lin carter this ish i kinda
  look forward to reading his letters yeah ive
  found out he aint a her

  reckon thats all for now
