 i am but half-way through your
 course and am certain that i have
 saved my company many times
 the cost of the course and raised
 myself fn the shareholders estima-

 its immediate practical application
 and i do not hesitate in saying
 your course and the personal at-
 tention you give is invaluable to
 the practical man in any business
 where chemistry plays a part you
 may use this letter and my name
 and address to the furtherance of
 your good work

 some people measure success in
terms of money and others in degree
of knowledge and culture chemistry
is the one uncrowded profession today
that offers both america always a land
of amazing opportunities is especially so
now in the field of applied chemistry in-
dustries have developed within eight years
more rapidly than the output of trained men
to conduct them every big industry needs
chemists and there is a real demand for them
immediately

earn a bigger
salary from now on

good chemists command high salaries

i

not only are there boundless opportunities for amassing wealth in
chemistry but the profession affords congenial employment at good
salaries to hundreds of thousands who merely follow out its present
applications these applications are innumerable touching intimately
every business and every product in the world the work of the chemist
can hardly be called work at all it is the keenest and most enjoyable
kind of pleasure the days in a chemical laboratory are filled with
thrilling and delightful experimentation with the alluring prospect of a
discovery that may spell fortune always at hand to spur your enthusiasm

  you can make yourself independent for life by unearthing
  one of chemistrys undiscovered secrets

do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire your imagina-
tion and make you want to sail the uncharted seas in search of treasure and
adventure and then you would regret that such things were no longer
done but that is a mistake they are done-today and every day-not on
desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout your own coun-
try quietly systematically the chemist works his work is difficult but
more adventurous than the blood-curdling deeds of the spanish main in-
stead of meeting an early and violent death on some forgotten shore he
gathers wealth and honor through his valuable contributions to humanity

alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented dynamite made so many millions that
the income alone from his bequests provides five s prizes every year for the advance-
ment of science and peace herman frasch who showed how to extract sulphur built
up a huge fortune c m hall the chemist who discovered how to manufacture aluminum
made millions through this discovery f g cottrell who devised a valuable process for
recovering the waste from flue gases james cayley who showed how to save enormous
losses in steel manufacture l ii baekeland who invented bakelite-these are only a
few of the men to whom fortunes have come through their chemical achievements

you can learn at home

to qualify for this remarkable calling requires specialized training formerly it wag
necessary to attend a university for several years to acquire that training but thanks
to our highly perfected and thorough system of instruction you can now stay at home
keep your position and let us educatc you in chemistry during your spare time even
with only common schooling you can take our course and equip yourself for immediate
practical work in a chemical laboratory

easy monthly payments

you dont have to have even the small price of the course to start you can pay for
it in small monthly amounts-so small that you wont feel them the cost of the course
is very low and includes everything even the chemistry outfit-there are no extras to
buy with our course our plan of monthly payments places a chemical education within

extravagant fiction today

cold fact tomorrow

facts outfictioned

 bv hugo gernsback

s	we read the average scientifiction story par-
ticularly of the class where the hero is sending
power by means of some impossible ray and
does other probably impossible and certainly
extravagant things we sometimes are apt to
smile and marvel at the audacity of the author
vve take it good-humoredly however because we know in our
souls that such things will never come about as a matter of
fact many people who read such stories are prone to vent
their exasperations-and frequently in  uncertain manner

  on the other hand i maintain that the average fiction writer
now seems entirely too tame and will have to draw a great
deal more on his imagination if he is to keep going the
reproach of the present day fiction writer ten years hence prob-
ably will be ridicule not because he overshot the mark but
rather because he undershot it considerably and so our present
day reader snorts with disgust at the once incredible exploita-
tions of jules verne and h g wells written years ago since
then science and progress have caught up with both wells
and verne to an astonishing degree what was audacious fiction
then is so much a reality today that some of their writings
no longer make good reading but actually sound commonplace
and trite

  many writers in the past have written about the queer and
so-called impossible effects to be had with future unknown
rays and unknown waves but none of these authors probably
was prepared to write of the absurdities which now have
become facts in a current issue of radio news there will
he found an article entitled high-frequency magic in the
radio laboratory these astounding experiments were made
recently by no less than the research scientists of the general
electric company at schenectady a new vacuum tube has
made it possible for the first time to combine ultra-high fre-
quencies with high power hitherto available only for the longer
wavelengths the new tube works on  kilocycles 
meters with a power of  kilowatts and when the tube
begins to operate the following are the altogether astounding
things that happen

  men who work near the apparatus immediately notice a
distinct warming effect although nothing touches them the
human temperature is increased to nearly  degrees fahrenheit
in about fifteen minutes the experiments were discontinued
when the body heat reached that temperature mind you the
room temperature stayed the same-the air was not heated a
sausage was placed in a glass tube hung from the end of the

receiving aerial and in a few minutes the sausage started
steaming showing that it was being cooked yet no metal ever
torched it with a similar arrangement cookies have been
baked and water boiled without any metal near them an apple
was baked from the inside out without any perceptible heat
to bake it as a- matter of fact there was no heat around the
wire of the aerial itself an incandescent lamp pulled from
its shipping carton the first time lighted to its full brilliancy
without wires or a socket touching it

  stranger yet a copper bar lying on the floor heat-blistered
the hand that picked it up although the metal was-and re-
mained-cold in other words you actually do burn your
fingers from a cold metal which is at room- temperature

    a neon tube suspended in the room without anything
touching it lights up to its brilliant characteristic red glow
merely when someone touches it with his hand electrical
meters in adjoining rooms run wild and electrical instruments
at a distance are twisted or broken making all scientific
measuring work in the vicinity of the operating tube impossible
here then we have in a small way the beginning of a tre-
mendously important art and even the scientists who performed
the experiments are loath to predict to what actual use the
new power tube may be put evidently we have not as yet
scratched the surface of this particular subject there is no
doubt in anyones mind who witnessed these important experi-
ments that power by radio is already here and while the be-
ginnings are modest no one dares to foretell its possibilities
five or ten years hence because the wildest expectations of
today will no doubt be exceedingly tame a few years hence

  only three short years ago in the december  issue
of radio news i wrote an editorial entitled power by wire-
less and i remember a number of letters from scientists and
engineers who wrrote me some rather uncomplimentary letters
and pointed out to me that the things which i had said were
impossible and would never come about yet they are here
now and in a way have exceeded my predictions of that time
to be sure what we do in the laboratory is not immediately
done on a large and practical scale but it is usually found that
what can be accomplished in the laboratory sooner or later
will be done on a large scale after more is known and more
has been learned in the art that was the case with radio
itself when hertz made his original experiment it was the
case with the telephone it was the case with the electric light
and it was the case with the dynamo which furnishes the
power and with many others

four dimensional

robberies

by bob olsen

             author of four dimensional surgery etc

u arc told that more than a billion
worth of bonds arid other valuables
olen within a tew weeks from safe
boxes throughout the united states
 realize how imperative it was that
the criminal responsible for these stupendous robberies
should be apprehended as quickly as possible

  the true state of affairs never became generally
known of course had even the slightest inkling of
the tremendous and far-reaching effects of the thefts
leaked out to the public it would undoubtedly have
caused the most disastrous panic ln the history of the
world

  you can easily imagine what would happen if it were
suddenly discovered that a safe deposit vault-which
has always been universally accepted as the one and
only place where valuables may be stored with abso-
lute safety - was no longer immune from theft
though this fact was known only to a few persons
that was exactly the situation that obtained at the
time i learned the truth about the great safe deposit
robberies

  that i happened to be drawn into this extraordinary
case was as fortuitous as some of the other preposter-
ous things which had happened to me within the pre-
ceding few months

  possibly you already know about the hyper-forceps
which i constructed under the direction of professor
banning the eminent authority on four dimensional
mathematics with this device it was possible to
grasp an object and by moving it through the fourth
dimension lift it from in-
side a closed receptacle
without in any way disturb-
ing the container it was
designed specifically for re-
moving gallstones and for-
eign substances from within
a persons body without
cutting the patients skin

  you will recall that it
was during an attempt to
perform an operation of this sort that the hvper-
forceps was caught by some mysterious cosmic force
and was snatched into four dimensional space drawing
with it the bodies of doctor paul mayer and his patient
professor banning thanks to quick thinking on the
part of doctor mayer with a slight amount of assist-
ance from me a tragedy was averted and the two
wanderers into hyper-space were brought safely back
to our three-dimensional world

  one might reasonably suppose that a harrowing ex-

 	four dimensional surgery published in the february
 issue of amazing stories

perience like this would suffice to deter professor ban-
ning from any further inclination to experiment with
the mysteries of four-dimensional phenomena but such
was not the case he insisted that he was pledged to
devote his entire sabbatical year to the development of
four-dimensional surgery and other practical applica-
tions of hyper-spacial theory and nothing-not even
the risk of annihilation-could induce him to deviate
from his plans

  however he did consent to take a protracted vacation
-an indulgence which he had not enjoyed for over six
years it was characteristic of the man that he chose
to visit england france austria and norway chiefly
for the reason that in each of these countries there was
an eminent scholar who had done original work in
developing four-dimensional mathematics

  this left me with little to do although i was still
under contract to assist professor banning and doctor
mayer for the remainder of the year i offered to
cancel the agreement and even urged them to release
me but this they declined to do professor banning
insisted that as soon as he returned from abroad he
intended to resume his experiments in the practical
applications of four-dimensional mathematics and that
he would need me to help him carry out the mechanical
details of his work

  i was told to take two months leave of absence on
full pay professor banning gave me permission to
use his books including one of the most complete
libraries on hyper-space that has ever been assembled
and suggested a course of reading for me but he did
not insist on my doing this
in fact it was left entirely
up to me to decide how i
should occupy myself dur-
ing his absence

  up to this time my ex-
periences with four-dimen-
sional devices had in some
respects been rather unfor-
tunate yet i could give
them credit for putting me
in close touch with these internationally famous men
namely william sidelberg professor banning and the
two mayer brothers

  it was about a month after professor bannings de-
parture that great man number five appeared on the
scene he was none other than william dern head
of the great detective agency that bears his name

  two gentlemen in the lobby to see you was the
phone message i received from the clerk in the win-
chester hotel

  taking it for granted that they were reporters i
said send them up

 ff course you will remember the preceding story by bob
  olsen in which acquaintance was made with the four
 dimensional hypcr-lorccps in this story we learn a lot
 more about the fourth dimension a good deal of which is
 probably new to most of our readers our author has a
 knack for handling a subject that usually is only understood
 by mathematicians in such a way that it becomes plain and
 understandable on its face to all of tis


with both hands the man manipulated the handles of the instrument until the jaws seemed to melt right into the thick steel
walls of the vault after a few seconds of probing he withdiew the jaws of the hyper-forceps between them dangled a tin
box which had been drawn right through the locked door of one of the safe deposit compartments




amazing stories

  after introducing himself dern presented his com-
panion who turned out to be timothy clancy one of
derns most experienced lieutenants

   dern a polished gentleman of forty-five dressed in
faultless taste did not look at all like the conventional
detective of fiction and the movies clancy came much
closer to the commonly accepted idea of stealthy
steve the six-eyed sleuth lie wore a derby hat
tilted over one eye and was constantly chewing on a
long black cigar during the subsequent weeks that i
associated with clancy i rarely saw him without his hat
on and a cigar in his mouth yet never once did i catch
him with his stogie lighted he was one of those dry
smokers who chew an unlighted cigar until it looks
as if it had been laundered in the family washing ma-
chine and run through the wringer when it became
too macerated to hold comfortably in his mouth he
would throw it away and start mangling a fresh one

   i must confess that i got quite a turn when i learned
the identity of my visitors not that i had anything on
my conscience but i have heard so much about inno-
cent persons being framed or otherwise caught in a
net of circumstantial evidence that i couldnt help won-
dering just what crime i was suspected of having
committed

  instead of setting me at ease the opening words of
the great detective only served to accentuate my anxiety

  i suppose you know all about the big safe deposit
robberies dern began

   li an attempt to cover my nervousness with badinage
i answered im like will rogers-all i know about
crime is what i read in the papers to tell you the
truth i havent been interested enough in these rob-
beries you speak of to read more than the headlines
in that case id better give you some of the details
youll need to know them in order to get what were
driving at for instance it may interest you to learn
that the total value of property which we know has been
stolen from safe deposit vaults during the past three
weeks-probably by one person-amounts to over a
billion dollars

   a billion dollars stolen by one individual in three
weeks i exclaimed why thats inconceivable 
sure sounds fishy i have to admit but neverthe-
less its true and for all we know the amounts we
have been able to check up may be only a small frac-
tion of the sums that have been taken without the
owners knowing about it as you probably know a lot
of people dont go near their safe deposit boxes except
two or three times a year when interest coupons on their
bonds fall due and since the banks cant open the
boxes until the customers call in person theres no
way of knowing how much more may have been taken
from boxes which have not been opened recently
but what have i to do with all this i interposed
im coming to that in a minute first let me give
you the high lights of the case so far as we know
the first of the safe deposit robberies happened at the
utility national bank of milwaukee not so far from
here youll notice

 started to ask him if he meant that for an
   insinuation but he hurried on

  except for an accident it might not have become
known for some time after it happened we have rea-
son to believe however that one of the robberies at
the milwaukee bank was discovered the same day it
happened

  it started with the finding of a life insurance policy
for ten thousand dollars in the waste-basket inside the
vault the man whose duty it was to unlock the boxes
for patrons discovered it just before closing time he
took it immediately to the clerk in charge of the safe
deposit counter who went through his records and
found that the man whose name was on the policy had
not opened his box for over a month he got the cus-
tomer on the phone and told him his policy had been
found in the basket the next morning the owner
opened his safe deposit box and found it absolutely
empty approximately twenty thousand dollars worth
of bonds had been removed from the box

  within the next few days several other renters re-
ported thefts aggregating about half a million dollars

  we were called into the case at the very outset so
we were able to get a complete record of everything
that had happened to date

  at first it looked like an inside job maybe youve
heard of a similar series of robberies that happened in
los angeles about three years ago we hung that on
the bank employee who had the job of opening the
customers boxes

  of course you know how a safe deposit vault is
run  he digressed

  to tell you the truth i do not since i never
owned a bond or anything else worth safeguarding i
havent had occasion to familiarize myself with the
procedure employed in a safe deposit vault

  maybe id better explain it then when you rent a
box you get two keys which are duplicates and are the
only ones in existence that will open your box even
the company that installed the vault is not able to
make a third key that will fit your lock if you lose
one key you can have a duplicate made from the other
one but if both keys become lost at the same time the
only way to open your box is to force the door which
is a long hard job this destroys the old door and
necessitates installing a new door with a new set of
keys

  ordinarily when you first rent a box you would
put one of the keys on your key-ring and if you hap-
pened to be married you would hand the duplicate key
to your wife so if you got drowned at sea or disap-
peared she could open the box the bank keeps on
file a card with your signature and that of your wife or
other person authorized to open the box

  before you are allowed to enter the vault you
have to sign a slip in the presence of the attendant and
this slip is compared with the signature on file if
someone happened to find or steal your key the only
way he could use it would be by forging your signa-
ture while the bank employee is watching him-a thing
which is extremely difficult if not impossible

  as an additional precaution each box has two key-
holes one for your private key and the other for a
master key kept by the bank neither key alone will
unlock the box but when both the banks key and yours
the great four dimensional robberies



are turned in the lock the door of the compartment
opens the valuables are contained in a tin box which
may be removed and taken to a table in the middle of
the vault or in case a customer wishes privacy he
may go into a small room or closed booth adjoining
the vault

   when the attendant unlocks your box he immedi-
ately removes the banks master key but leaves your
key in the lock on replacing your box you close the
door and turn the key thus locking the compartment
so you see that while the banks key is needed to
unlock the door only your own key is needed to lock
it is all that clear

   i assured him that it was lie continued thus

  the method used by the bank employee in los
angeles was so simple that its funny no one ever had
thought of it before he would notice the customers
that were in the habit of taking their valuables into
one of the private booths and staying there for some
time when as it frequently happened the vault was
unoccupied while one of these customers was going
through his papers the bank attendant would remove
the customers key make a wax impression of it and
quickly put it back in the lock again

   from this wax impression he would file out a
duplicate key and the next time he was alone in the
vault he would open the patrons box and rifle it of
its contents after which he would lock it in this way
he lifted about a hundred thousand dollars worth of
bonds but we set a trap for him and finally landed him
in jail

   a confidential report of this case was sent to the
president of every bank in the country and practically
all of them adopted the rule of requiring all customers
who left the vault to take their keys with them that
rule was being enforced in the milwaukee bank at the
time the big robbery took place there so the wax
impression scheme could hardly have been used an-
other thing that made us give up the idea that this was
an inside job was the fact that the only person who
was in a position to pull anything of this sort was the
man who had reported finding the insurance policy
naturally if he were a thief he would have known
better than to throw the policy in the waste-basket and
even if he had been such a dumb-bell he certainly
would not have reported it to the bank officials

   at that we put the poor guy through the third
degree and checked up on his private life and the
amount of money he had been spending but we couldnt
get anything on him

   just about this time five other banks-four in chi-
 cago and one in detroit-reported similar robberies
 and we knew at once that the jobs were being pulled
 from the outside and that we had to deal with one of
 the cleverest and most dangerous crooks that ever
 lived

   but surely you dont suspect me i blurted out

   dern grinned and clancy laughed out loud

   say kid the latter chuckled didnt you hear the
 chief say that this guy is one of the cleverest and
 most dangerous crooks that ever lived you dont
 think that picture fits you do you 

   oh i see what you are driving at you dont think

im clever enough to be a crook i said in rejoinder

  clancy opened his mouth for a comeback but dern
cut him short shut up clancy and let me do the
talking

   to me he said dont mind him im sure he didnt
mean anything by that crack then with a twinkle in
his eye he again addressed his assistant you know
clancy sometimes these college guys are smarter than
they look remember the dautremont case if it
hadnt been for the accurate description of the crooks
which a california professor doped out of an old pair
of overalls wed never have caught those birds

  but to answer your question he resumed of
course we dont suspect you i dont mind telling you
though that we did check up on you-just as a measure
of precaution but since you have not been outside of
winchester for over three months you have an iron-
clad alibi and a clean bill of health the reason we
came to you is that you are an expert on the fourth
dimension

   i protested im afraid you have been misinformed

i know a little bit about hyper-space but hardly enough
to be called an expert

   but didnt you invent some kind of jigger for taking
out a mans gizzard without opening him up

  you mean the hyper-forceps but it wasnt my
invention i merely helped professor banning work
out the mechanical details of his idea furthermore
since it was just a forceps or device for picking up
articles and had no cutting edges it could be used only
for removing unattached articles like foreign substances
and gall-stones

   nevertheless you may be able to help us perhaps
we are on a wild goose chase but we have learned that
in tracking criminals we cant overlook even the most
insignificant clew or the most improbable possibility
if you know what i mean

  our coming to you was suggested by a newspaper
story in referring to the lack of any satisfactory
explanation of the series of robberies the reporter said
the robber must have worked through the fourth
dimension

all i want to find out from you is whether it would
actually be possible for anyone to remove the contents
from a safe deposit box without opening the door
as easy as shooting fish i assured him i could
do it myself with the hyper-forceps

   the hell you could

   this was from clancy

  excuse me mister clancy said dern in a sweet
tone of voice but suppose you try keeping your ears
open and your mouth shut then turning to me
please pardon the interruption you were just say-
ing that with the hyper-forceps you could remove the
contents of a safe deposit box without opening the
door would you mind explaining just how this aston-
ishing thing could be done 

   not at all simply by moving it through the fourth
dimension are you familiar with the fundamental
principles of hyper-space

   im afraid not although i have read the two maga-
zine stories which you wrote on the subject

  so did i the unsuppressible clancy butted in


amazing stories

and when i got through reading them i knew a
darn sight less than when i started

  both dern and i got a huge kick out of that

  im sorry my stories didnt get over but perhaps
i can explain the fourth dimension in simple every-
day language-so even mister clancy can under-
stand it

this brought a chuckle from dern and a grunt
from clancy

  every object we know of has three dimensions
i went on we call these dimensions length width
and thickness for purposes of measurement we
always consider these dimensions to be at right angles
to each other thus i picked up my fountain pen and
two pencils and held them in my hand in such a posi-
tion that they intersected each other at right angles
now if mister clancy will loan me one of those long
cigars which he has in his pocket ill attempt to show
you what is meant by the fourth dimension

  clancy gave me a stogie and i placed the end of it
at the intersection of the three other objects

  all i have to do is place this cigar so it is at right
angles to the pen and the two pencils but is not in the
same straight line with either of them and the stogie
will represent the fourth dimension

  lets see you do it  challenged clancy

  i dont claim that i can do it one reason why i
cant is that neither of these objects comes anywhere
near being like a line which would have neither width
nor thickness but only length however i can draw
a picture showing what a cube would look like if it
were extended into four dimensions mathematicians
call such an object a tesseract or hyper-cube it is what
youd get if you moved a cube having a volume of one
cubic inch for a distance of one inch in the direction
of the fourth dimension and while im about it ill
illustrate my point still further by drawing a picture of
a three-dimensional transparent glass cube as it looks
from a point directly above it i picked up a piece of
paper and drew these two sketches

    four dimensional cube	three dimensional glass

or tesseract	cube as seen from directly

                                                   overhead

  of course you understand that this is drawn in
perspective and for that reason it looks somewhat dis-
torted to anyone who is not accustomed to looking at
four-dimensional objects to get the idea youll have
to use your imagination the small cube in the center
is really exactly the same size as the outer cube its
somewhat similar to the effect you get when you look
straight down on a three-dimensional cube made out of

transparent glass what you seem to see is a square
with a smaller square inside it and with the corners
of the two squares connected with diagonal lines yet
you know perfectly well that in reality both of the
square faces are equal in size and the four lines which
look diagonal are really perpendicular

  you also know that the four figures grouped around
the center square which look like trapezoids are in
actuality squares

  its exactly the same sort of effect you get from my
picture of a tesseract youll have to imagine that the
lines connecting the corners of the inner cube with the
corners of the outer cube are perpendicular to all three
edges of each of the cubes which they intersect these
lines form the edges of four more cubes exactly equal
in size to each of the other two cubes and grouped
around or through them

  if youll count the various parts of the tesseract
youll see that it is bounded by six cubes twenty-four
square faces thirty-two edges and sixteen corners
simple enough isnt it 

  simple as mud grunted clancy

  you follow me dont you mr dern i asked the
great detective

  well i may lie a few jumps behind you but if youll
travel a little more slowly and give me time maybe
ill catch up with you

  let me try another line of attack i suggested
one of the best ways to grasp the possibilities of four-
dimensional space is to make comparisons between
three-dimensional objects and those having only two
dimensions

  for instance suppose i make a two-dimensional
glove out of paper of course paper has three dimen-
sions but the thickness is so small compared to the
other two dimensions that we may consider the paper
to be two-dimensional in character

  i picked up a pair of scissors and quickly clipped out
a bit of paper shaped like a glove then i drew on
another sheet a crude figure of a paper doll with the
palm of both hands showing

  youll notice that this paper glove fits only the
right hand of the doll and no matter how i slide it
around on the paper i cant make it fit the left hand
but if i pick it up and turn it over through the third
dimension it becomes a left glove and no longer fits
the right hand in the same manner if your right-
hand glove were turned over through the fourth dimen-
sion it would fit your left hand you mustnt confuse
this with turning the glove inside out which would
expose the rough unfinished inside part when in-
verted through the fourth dimension your glove would
look just the same with the smooth finished surface
outside but would have the thumb and fingers in such
positions that they would fit the other hand

  heres another comparison see this rubber band 
it was cut from an old inner tube notice that it is
rough on the inside and smooth on the outside with-
out breaking or injuring it in any way i can twist this
circular band through the third dimension so that now
the rough surface is outside and the smooth one is
inside

  the same thing can be done with a tennis ball
the great four dimensional robberies



by twisting it through the fourth dimension without
breaking the ball in any way it could be turned inside
out so that the outside surface would become the inside
and vice versa do you comprehend what i mean

  i guess so dern hesitated

  sounds goofey to me growled clancy

  as i understand it i continued you are inter-
ested principally in knowing how the contents of a safe
deposit box can be removed without opening the door

  thats exactly what i would like to know

  i can illustrate that with this plain rubber band or
ring to a two-dimensional being or flatlander this
would be an impregnable safe deposit vault in order
to obtain access to it hed need a door in the side since
it would be impossible for him to climb over the edge
of the ring however if he happened to get hold of a
specially constructed pair of pliers he could without
leaving his two dimensional world reach over the top
of the ring through the third dimension and remove all
the contents

  the hyper-forceps which professor banning and
i made is nothing more nor less than a pair of pliers
or tongs that will operate through a fourth dimension
with it i could easily remove the contents of a safe or
closed box without opening the door

  and where is the hyper-forceps now dern de-
manded

  locked in a drawer at our workshop on the hos-
pital grounds

  would you mind letting me see it

  id be glad to

  the hospital was but a short distance from my hotel
so the three of us walked over to the workshop in which
doctor banning and i had constructed the hyper-
forceps

  we had always kept the instrument in a locked
drawer of a cabinet where our delicate tools were
stored there were only two keys to this drawer i
had one and professor banning had the other

  when i placed my key in the lock i was surprised
to find that the drawer was already unlocked know-
ing the extreme care which both professor banning
and i exercised whenever we handled the iiyper-
forceps i could not believe that either of us had
neglected to lock the drawer with a feeling of dread-
ful premonition i opened the drawer

  it was empty

  dern examined the lock h-m-m-m just what i
thought the lock has been sprung with a screwdriver
and the bolt pushed back in place as crazy as this
four-dimensional applesauce sounds it looks as if we
are on the right track after all

if anyone had suggested that i was to become an
operative for the william dern detective agency
i should have told him he was either drunk or out of
his mind-but thats exactly what happened

i dern talked me into it

 he pointed out to me that since it was now quite
apparent that the crook who was perpetrating these
stupendous robberies was using the hyper-forceps
and since i was the only available person who knew
how the instrument looked and was operated my assist-

ance was indispensable the tremendous seriousness
of the crimes and the dangerous and far-reaching effects
they were having were also imparted to me in terms that
left me almost gasping for breath

  the stuff thats been printed in the papers-bad as
it sounds-doesnt come within a thousand miles of
describing the real state of affairs dern told me
they wouldnt dare to publish a tenth of the actual
facts

  just think what it means to have the security of all
the worlds safe deposit vaults suddenly destroyed a
man might as well put his valuables in an open soap
box and leave it on the street with a help yourself
sign on it as to put them into a safe deposit box
these days

  did you know that all the insurance companies
have already announced that they will no longer insure
the contents of safe deposit vaults without charging
rates that are far in excess of the income which a bond
owner can get from his securities

  i tell you the bankers and other financiers are des-
perate they have their backs against a wall it
wouldnt take much to throw every bank and business
house in the country into bankruptcy thats how im-
portant it is that we catch this crook before he does
damage that can never be repaired

  the upshot of it all was that i agreed to cooperate
with dern in every possible way with the understand-
ing however that as soon as professor banning re-
turned i was to be released from duty

  in order that i might work in harmony with the rest
of the organization i was delegated to team with
clancy who was in active charge of the case

  after we had become better acquainted clancy and
i got along famously he grudgingly admitted that
in matters pertaining to science and mechanics i had
just a shade the better of him but when it came to
skill in tracking the elusive criminal to his lair i
couldnt help handing the solid gold handcuffs to
clancy

  his method was simple enough as soon as it was
established with reasonable likelihood that the criminal
was rifling the safe deposit boxes by means of the
iiyper-forceps it was easy to figure out just how
he would operate his first move would be to rent a
box for himself since that would be the only way he
could get inside the vault he would make frequent
visits to the vault until he happened to strike a time
when he was all alone then with the aid of the
hyper-forceps he would remove the contents of three
or four boxes putting the bonds and other valuables
which could easily be converted into cash into his own
box and carrying the worthless papers away in his
pocket on his first robbery he had made the mistake
of throwing an insurance policy into the waste basket
this error was never repeated

  since we knew that our quarry was numbered among
the renters of safe deposit boxes in the various banks
which had been robbed the next logical step was to
obtain from these banks copies of all new signature
cards which had been made out between the last time
i had seen the hyper-forceps and the date the rob-
bery was discovered in each bank


amazing stories

  from this assortment of signatures it didnt take
a handwriting expert long to pick out the cards which
had been signed by the same person naturally the
crook had used different names in each of the places he
had visited but the tell-tale slant and shape of certain
typical letters gave him away

  facsimile copies of all these signatures were repro-
duced in large quantities and were sent to the safe
deposit departments of every bank in the united states
and canada with instructions to watch for signatures
similar in character one thing that helped us most
was that the robber for obvious reasons had always
rented one of the largest boxes available which was
sufficiently unusual to attract attention

  it wasnt long before we picked up a hot scent we
received a wire from one of the largest banks in salt
lake city stating that a box had just been rented to a
man whose signature was identical with one of those
on the warning sheet evidently he had become so
careless and cocksure that he would never be discov-
ered that he had even used the same alias as on one
of the previous robberies

  without waiting even to pack a grip clancy and i
boarded an airplane which had been kept in readiness
for just such a call and hopped off to the land of the
latter day saints

  we landed- at woodward field at about two oclock
in the afternoon and immediately went to the bank
upon presenting our credentials we secured permis-
sion to keep the vault open after the regular business
hours under clancys direction two workmen made
a few changes in the scenery

  he selected one of the small private booths located
almost directly opposite the entrance of the vault and
had two concealed peep holes put in the door at the
further end of the vault there were already two large
mirrors clancy instructed the workmen to install four
more mirrors on the portions of the walls not occupied
by the doors of safe deposit compartments

  when this was done he went into the doctored
booth and looked through each of the peep holes while
 moved from one part of the vault to another

  o k he finally said i can see you now no
matter where you stand as long as youre inside the
vault

  he also had wires run from the booth to the clerks
counter with a small signal light arranged in such a
way that when the clerk pressed a button with his foot
the light would flash  inside the booth this was to
be our signal that the suspected person was about to
enter the vault

  as soon as the bank opened on the following morn-
ing clancy and i took our positions inside the booth
but it was not until about fifteen minutes before clos-
ing time that the little light flashed on clancy and i
immediately put our eyes to the peep holes and waited

  the man who accompanied the bank attendant into
the vault was a tall well-built prosperous-looking man
of about thirty-five after going through the cus-
tomary routine of inserting each of the two keys
opening the door and drawing the tin box part way
out of the compartment the bank attendant withdrew
and left mr suspect alone in the vault

  he took his box to the table in the center of the
vault and pretended to examine a few papers in
reality he was stealthily looking around to see if
anyone else was at the counter preparing to enter the
vault apparently satisfied that he would not be inter-
rupted he picked up his box and carried it to his
compartment

  it happened to be in a front corner out of sight
of anyone standing in front of the vaults entrance
but we could easily see his reflection in one of the
mirrors

  placing his box on the floor he reached in his breast
pocket and drew forth a peculiar-looking article resem-
bling a physicians forceps with two sets of handles

  the hyper-forceps i whispered to clancy

  he nodded to indicate that he had understood me

with both hands the man manipulated the han-
dles of the instrument until the jaws seemed to
melt right into the thick steel walls of the vault after
a few seconds of probing he withdrew the jaws of
the iiyper-forceps between them dangled a tin box
which had been drawn right through the locked door
of one of the safe deposit compartments

  working with nervous haste he removed -the papers
from the pilfered box and stuffed them into his own
box then by using the hyper-forceps again he
forced the empty box right through the closed door
of the compartment into its place

  once again he returned to the table in the center and
finding the space in front of the counter still unoccu-
pied he returned to the corner and started to per-
form the same operation on another box

  it wras then that clancy rose and signaled for me
to follow him

  have you got your gun  i whispered

  sure but i wont need it with this bird it turned
out that his boast was a bit premature

  without making a sound we opened the door and
tiptoed into the vault just as the thief was removing
the second box from its compartment

  clancy laid his hand on the crooks shoulder and
pronounced the conventional formula youre under
arrest

  the hyper-forceps together with the safe deposit
box clattered to the floor

  with the quickness of a rattlesnake the criminal
reached back and grasped clancys neck between his
clasped hands at the same time bending forward in
such a way that he heaved the detectives body over his
shoulder and threw him to the floor of the vault
clancy passed out

  then the thug turned to me

  before i could make a move to defend myself he
dealt me a terrific blow in the pit of my stomach i
crumpled like a deflated balloon and sunk down on top
of the stolen safe deposit box

  though the pain wras frightful i still retained con-
scioustress i was horrified to see the thief take from
his pocket a wicked-looking clasp knife which snapped
open with an ominous click

  he was quite close to me and he must have thought
that i was out of the picture completely for he was
the great four dimensional robberies



directing all his attention to clancy who was just
coming to as i tried to brace myself so i could sit up
my hand touched the hyper-forceps

  singular isnt it how rapidly ones mind sometimes
works in times of dire emergency almost instinc-
tively i grasped the handles and an instant later i
had caught the robbers hand in its jaws with equal
rapidity i manipulated the device for moving the jaws
into the fourth dimension

  though i had fully anticipated what would happen
the result was none the less astounding the knife and
the hand holding it instantly faded from sight together
with the upper portion of the mans body from the
waist down however he was still in plain sight

  clancy was just struggling to his knees his eyes
opened so wide that i could see fully half an inch of
white eyeball on all sides of the pupils with a limp
and bedraggled cigar still hanging from his blue lips
and his mashed derby cocked over one eye he cer-
tainly was a remarkable sight

  my gawd he gasped theres nothing left of
him but a pair of pants

  dont worry i assured him his legs are inside
the pants and ive got the rest of him on the end of
the hyper-forceps he sure is a tough egg maybe
youd better tie his legs together before i pull the top
part of him back again

  clancy got up and approached the weird-looking
half-body he had no sooner come within range than
one of the legs shot out and dealt him a resounding
kick on his shin

  you blankety-blank son of a blank clancy swore
no pair of pants can kick me in the shin and get
away with it whereupon he brought one of his
square-toed shoes in vigorous contact with the seat of
the aforementioned pair of pants

  i felt a tug on the hyper-forceps which almost
pulled me off my feet

  go easy clancy i yelled if you dont want me
to get jerked into the fourth dimension youd better lay
off those trousers and as for you you dirty crook i
dont know whether you can hear me or not but unless
you want to commit suicide youd better quit struggling
and give up if you once get loose from the grip of
this instrument youll never be able to get back to earth
again

  he must have heard and understood because he im-
mediately quieted down and submitted to having his
feet tied together with clancys suspenders as soon
as this was accomplished i pulled steadily on the hyper-
forceps and when the right hand came into view clancy
slipped his handcuffs over the wrist and wrenched the
knife from its grasp a moment later we had drawn
the rest of the thiefs body back into three-dimensional
space

  he turned out to be a former assistant in the x-ray
laboratory at the maver brothers hospital evidently
he had learned about the hyper-forceps from snatches
of conversation lie had overheard at winchester and
had conceived the idea of stealing it and using it for
criminal purposes

  in his pockets and his luggage we found over a hun-
dred safe deposit keys all conveniently labeled with the
names and locations of the banks to which they be-
longed with the aid of these keys we recovered all
the stolen property except for a few thousand dollars
in cash which he had spent for expenses

  i he four-dimensional thief is now in the peniten-
tiary he has been found guilty on enough counts to
keep him in jail for the nextthousand years

  as for the hyper-forceps we decided it was too
dangerous an instrument to leave in a flimsily locked
drawer it now reposes in one of the most modern
theft-proof non-pickable safe deposit boxes in a bank
known only to three persons doctor paul mayer has
one of the keys and i am holding the other to give to
professor banning as soon as he returns from abroad

 octopus cycle

hi irvin lester and fletcher pratt

 here was a long uneasy swell on the sur-
 face of the indian ocean as though some-
 one were gently rocking the floor beneath
 it and a hot moist wind blew against the
 face of walter weyl ab am bsc
 as he stood against the rail of the pudgy little mes-
 sageres maritimes steamer wondering whether he
 would dare to chance a spell of seasickness by lighting
 a well-cured pipe for the fourth time that afternoon

    it was hot-and off to the west tamataves houses
 gleamed white and blistering against the green back-
 ground of the madagascar jungle blued by the dis-
 tance away to the north the coastline stretched
 illimitable it would be another day at least before the
 steamer arrived at andovorata and walter weyl ab
 am bsc would be able to get at the heart of the
 mysterious occurrences that had brought him there

    his mind traveled back to the letter from his friend
 of college days raoul duperret now on french gov-
 ernment service in that mysterious land-madagascar
 he saw it again before him the characteristic french
 handwriting the precise french phrasing

     alas we cannot pursue these investigations
 through lack of money to you then my friend i
 appeal to you belongs permit me to say that combi-
 nation so rare of the talent for scientific investigation
 and the means to pursue it

 to you also will appertain
 the credit for any discovery

    let me in detail tell
 you of what we know

 diouma-mbobo is a chief-
 tain of the blacks in the
 southern part of the island
 who have never been res-
 cued from cannibal prac-
 tices he is as far as we
 know a man who rules by
 law and is of a truthfulness

 thus when he accused the
 tanosy who are the next

 tribe to him of stealing people and eating them we
 took measures and did not too much believe the denials
 of the tanosy but diouma-mbobos people continue
 to disappear and when the commandant sent a whole
 company of senegalese to preserve order they still
 disappeared what is still more distressing is that
 some of the senegalese also disappeared and save but
 a solitary rifle or two found in the jungle no trace of
 them remains

  there is some fear in the island and we are in dan-



 ger of losing our grip on the natives for we cannot at
 all explain these disappearances nor prevent them the
 commandant says send a battalion of chasseurs but
 it is my belief that a battalion of chausseurs would like-
 wise fail and i send for you for i believe the agency
 that destroys men thus is not human no human would
 neglect the rifles

   as you know madagascar is a country apart we
have here the giant spiders large as bats the lizards
large as sheep and  not a single snake all our ani-
mals are outre impossible even and what if one more
impossible than all   and thus it is to you my rich
american friend i appeal for myself and my country
it had offered precious little real information that
letter but enough to have caused walter veyl to drop
a learned monograph on the ammonites of the upper
cretaceous and hurry across ten thousand miles of
ocean with microscopes rifles and all the equipment of
the modern scientist to the aid of his friend

   the sun went down suddenly as it does in the
tropics and the sea was purple darkness all at once
the lights of  amatave twinkled away behind and were
blotted out off to the west was only the menacing blot
of the huge island forbidding and dangerous in the
gloom weyl sat musing by the rail listening to the
hushed voices of a couple of men in the bows

   forgetting his dinner be-
 low he fell into a half-doze
 from which he was sud-
 denly awakened by a sense
 of approaching evil defi-
 nite yet which could not be
 located he looked about
 lazily the southern cross
 hung brilliant in the sky
 there was no other light but
 the flare of portholes on the
 water and no sound but
 the slap of waves against

amazing stories

feet behind him in front was the blackness of the
bows out of which emerged a panic-stricken man who
charged against him babbling incoherent french and
bore him to the deck as he went down he caught a
glimpse of two waving prehensile arms like lengths of
fire-hose silhouetted against the sky

  somebody ran past him the deck leaped into illumi-
nation as lights were switched on and he picked him-
self up to see-nothing the bows were empty there
vas a babble of conversation

  where is ferentini

  what is the trouble

  who is there

  there was confusion stifled by the appearance of
the captain a eupeptic little man in a blue coat and a
tremendous moustache which swept his shoulders this
uproar-what does it mean he said let the sailor
dugasse come forward

   a big basque obviously panic-stricken and with roll-
ing eyes was shoved into the light tell us the reason
for this demanded the captain

  ferentini and i he gasped we were talking so
in the bow one two big arms like a gorilla seize him
by the neck the chest and zut he is gone i strike at
them but he is gone

  assassin said the captain briefly confess that
you quarreled and you threw biin over

  no no he was taken i swear it by the holy
virgin i swear it

   put this man in the lazarette you marulaz and you
noyon there will be an investigation take his knife
away from him

  his knife is gone monsieur said one of the sea-
men who had stepped forward to take charge of the
sailor dugasse

  without doubt he stabbed the other put him in
irons was the captains succinct reply as he turned to-
ward the cabin and his interrupted dinner

  walter weyl stepped forward i think the mans
story is true he offered i think i saw something
myself

  permit me to inform you monsieur that i am the
commandant of the vessel remarked the eupeptic cap-
tain with the utmost courtesy there will be an in-
vestigation if the man is innocent it will do him no
harm to spend a night in the lazarette and again he
turned away

   dissatisfied but realizing that he could do nothing
weyl walked tow-ard the bows to see if he could find
any trace of the strange encounter there was noth-
ing but as he was about to return and go below his
foot struck something which on investigation with a
flashlight proved to be the knife of the sailor dugasse

  the blade was wet and as he picked the weapon up
there dripped slowly from it a pale greenish oleaginous
liquid totally unlike human blood with this bit of
evidence in his hand he started thoughtfully for his
cabin

chapter ii

two days later the friends sat under the giant
mimosa in whose shade raoul duperret had
built a little cottage on the height overlooking
andananarivo a table had been dragged outdoors and

was now piled with a miscellaneous collection of instru-
ments papers and microscope slides

   weyl leaned back in his chair with a sigh and lit his
pipe

  let us see what we have after all this study he
said check me if i go wrong diouma-mbobos
people and about a dozen of the senegalese have dis-
appeared mysteriously so did the sailor ferentini on
the boat that brought me here in no case was any trace
found of the man after he disappeared and in the cases
on the island when anything was found it was always
a knife or a rifle

   ihis report he ruffled the papers from one of the
senegalese says that he saw his companion jerked up
into a tree by a huge black rope but when he rushed
to the tree he could see nothing it was late in the
evening now this account agrees singularly with that
of the sailor dugasse-and moreover if natives were
responsible for the disappearances they would at least
have taken the knives if not the guns

  therefore i consider that the disappearance of
ferentini the senegalese and the natives was due to
the same agency and that the agency was not human
and therefore i think the tanosy and the sailor du-
gasse although he is still in jail should be acquitted

  duperret nodded a grave assent

  but i am sure it was nothing supernatural i saw
something on that boat duperret and the senegalese
saw something moreover there is dugasses knife
i have analyzed that liquid which dripped from it it
is blood indubitably but blood different from any i
have ever seen it contains a tremendous number of
corpuscles of a new character not red but greenish
yellow and the liquid in which they float is similar to
that of all other bloods more than anything it re-
sembles the blood of an oyster which is impossible as
oysters do not lift men into trees therefore i accuse
some hitherto unknown animal of these deaths

  but what kind of an animal are we dealing with
weyl went on without paying any attention to an in-
terruption from duperret evidently a very swift and
formidable one it killed ferentini in a few seconds
it dragged a powerful senegalese who was provided
with a rifle off with equal swiftnessand the stabs of
dugasse were as futile against it as the rifle of die
other black boy

  in both cases the attack came from above and i
am inclined to think since we were attacked some dis-
tance off the coast and the natives some distance inland
that the animal possesses extraordinary mobility-prob-
ably wings this would make a bird of it which is
impossible because of the blood therefore making the
whole thing absurd    but in any case the hunt for
this animal or animals for there may be more than
one will be a dangerous business

  all is decided then  asked duperret very well
let us depart i am eager for action my friend and
he stood up stretching his muscular frame toward the
towering tree

  done said weyl

  he rose you have some influence with the military
authorities you of the civil arm if the matter were
put to the commandant in the proper way do you sp-
the octopus cycle



pose we could get an escort i need not conceal from
you that this big-game hunt is likely to be a serious
business any animal that devours live men  
i the commandant and i were at st cyr together
replied duperret he will doubtless appoint a lieu-
tenant and a demi-company of african chasseurs to
assist us

chapter iii

 a week later found them with a dapper french
 lieutenant dubose by name making the best of
  insufficient pup tents and canned french sausage
 by a dank slow stream a few miles out of fort dau-
 phin around them lay or squatted a perspiring group
 of black soldiers in the uniform of the chasseurs
 dafrique while round them again further from the
 sun of the white mens presence were as many natives
 equally sable of hue and with no uniforms at all these
 were the guides lent by diouma-mbobo silent and
  somewhat scared men for that portion of the jungle
 had earned a bad reputation from the repeated disap-
 pearances

 i weyl was annoyed if we only knew what we were
 looking for and where to find it he said to duperret
 that evening but here we are three days out with our
 labor for our pains hunting for one animal in this
 jungle is like the old needle and haystack saying
 il yes and im afraid for the guides the french-
 man had answered theyll desert unless they are
 given something to do

  night found them as restless as the guides weyl
 woke to a sense of something impending looked out and
 saw only the calm sentries speaking in low tones as
 they encountered each other at the end of their rounds
 he felt reassured and dropped off into another hour or
 two of slumber punctuated by fierce dreams woke
 again and saw a moonlit shadow on the flap of his tent
 raoul  he called softly

    the frenchman bent and entered

    he was fully dressed

  nerves keep you awake too said weyl ive
 been awake before but everythings quiet but why
 are you dressed 

    i have a premonition also i hear something im-
 usual you hear that strange whistling no you
 would not you are not used to jungle noises to me
 it is very much to notice something   and he
 looked at his friend who though in a strictly unofficial
 manner was recognized as commander of the expedi-
 tion shall we rouse the soldiers he questioned

    theyll need sleep if were to march all day weyl
 answered

    but i am thinking we will not need to march how-
 ever- raoul was about to dismiss his feeling as a
 fancy and threw another glance over his shoulder
 through the open tent flap

 	in an instant he was on his feet almost tearing the
 tent from its pegs a half cry escaping his lips that
 caused weyl to leap up beside him seizing the revolver
 that lay by his hand

    three four half a dozen snakelike arms mysteri-
 ous in the moonlight hovered for an instant over the

 heads of two sentries who had met at the edge of the
 trees and before they had comprehended their danger
 before they could be warned they were gripped lifted
 from their feet and their cries stifled before they
 reached the gloom of the branches fully ten feet above

   weyl with a horror such as he had never felt be-
fore seemed to clutch at his throat fired rapidly into
the tree something dropped with a crash of leaves a
veritable chorus of whistlings and swishings rose
around the camp and in the tents and along the sentry
line there were sudden lights and activity shouts of
qui vive aux armes and the thick note of sc
hastily blown bugle as its owner was roused from sleep

   men ran from their tents to stand gazing raoul
shouted the american its here the machine gun
and pistol in hand in his sleeping garments he dashed
for the tree

   he glanced up a subdued rustling gave no clue to
its source nothing to shoot at but oiit of the tail of
his eye he caught a glimpse of motion among the giant
ferns and the peculiar whistling again became audible

   he turned and was suddenly conscious of an insane
disbelief in his senses what he saw resembled noth-
ing so much as an enormous umbrella standing ten feet
high on stiltlike but prehensile arms while at the point
where they gathered a huge bulbous head rose and fell
rhythmically as the thing emitted that singular high-
pitched whistle there was something unspeakably
loathsome some touch reminiscent of putrefaction and
decay about it

   ailarm like a huge snake lifted from the ground
and swung aimlessly about under the leaves abruptly
another animal the duplicate of the first in all respects
came from behind a tree to join it and the two despite
their clumsy form and lurching uneven movement be-
gan to advance toward him with a rapidity that ivafci
astonishing

   weyl awoke to the necessity of flight he racediack 
 toward the camp where lieutenant dubose aroused
 by the shots and cries and aware that something was
 impending had formed the senegalese in a rough
 slanting angle of a line the men facing the jungle
 while behind them diouma-mbobos natives crouched
 in frightened curiosity

   the american turned as he reached the line be-
hind him into the clearing with an odd semblance of
order came a half-dozen a dozen twenty of those ter-
rible umbrella-like shapes moving deliberately but cov-
ering the ground as fast as a man runs

   a shot was followed by an order a bugle note and
the irritating crash of the volley which shaded into the
rattling drum of the machine guns when his eyes
again became used to the dark after the flame of the
rifles weyl saw that the giant shapeless beasts were
moving forward as swiftly and imperturbably as be-
fore had all the shots missed 

   another volley collapsed into a frantic and spasmodic
 burst of firing as no effect was visible on the hideous
 shapes that came on swiftly

   weyl aimed his revolver carefully at one bobbing
head and the shot was drowned in a crashing chorus of
 fire the beast came right on he was dimly conscious

 	of shooting again and again in a kind of frenzy at those


amazing stories

horrible bulby umbrellas that kept coming closer dim
figures of horror in the green moonlight huge and im-
pregnable towering over the little group of humans
who shouted and cursed and fired impotently

  one man half maddened even ran forward waving
his bayonet and was gathered gently up by two of those
big arms as a child might be picked up by its parent

   a thrill of wavering ran down the line one or two
men threw away their rifles when suddenly right at
their feet one of the monsters collapsed there was a
chorus of whistling and they moved backward ap-
parently without turning as rapidly and silently as they
had coiine   

   a feeble cheer rose from the senegalese a cheer that
was silenced instantly for a glance revealed that half
the hastily formed line was missing the men gone as
completely as though they had never been

   weyl was aware that he had been clicking an empty
pistol that his throat was dry that duperret sat at his
feet his face in his hands seemingly without power of
motion senegalese and natives frightened to the verge
of madness babbled like children all around him the
iron voice of dubose rose

   silence my children

   out in the clearing before them was no sign that men
had battled for their lives save one ugly loathsome
shape that sprawled on the ground and twitched feebly
in the gloom	

chapter iv

the survivors of that unbelievable one-sided bat-
tle dragged themselves back-into fortdauphin
five days later one man was violently insane
tightly bound and as for the rest it seemed that only
remnants of sanity remained the emoticjnal blacks
had almost collapsed under the strain and nothing but
incoherent gibberings could be extracted from them by
the soldiers who cared for the exhausted weaponless
starving and almost naked remainder of the trim com-
pany of chasseurs who marched out with drum and
bugle only a fortnight before

  weyl begged off from an- immediate report to the
commandant and went to bed where he slept the sleep
of exhaustion for twenty hours on end and duperret
did likewise

  weyl woke vastly refreshed and with the horror
that had been dragging at his mind relieved though
with such a feeling of weariness as he had not known
since college football days the black boy at the door
obligingly brought him the latest newspapers now not
quite a month old and he re-established his touch with
the world of men by reading them over the tiny break-
fast of coffee and rolls which was all the fort physician
would allow him

   an item in one of them caught his eye and caused
him to sit up in his chair with a whoop of joy that
brought a scandalized glance from major larivet the
white-moustached old alsatian who was in command of
the fort and a grin from duperret the first since that
dreadful night of the attack

   the item in bad french was a translation from the
bad english of a new york newspaper telling of

weyls departure for madagascar it was filled with
the exalted pseudo-science of which hewspapers are
fond and contained much ingeniously sketchy biographi-
cal and geographical data but its appeal was obvious

   the american leaned forward over the- cups

   does your fort boast a typist he asked lieu-
tenant dubose has probably already told you of the ter-
rible experience we have had i am anxious to make
my report on it through the newspapers

   monsieur said major larivet gravely he died
an hour ago by my side i know nothing but that i
have lost many men from my command

   so    said weyl all the more reason i should
make my report in writing i need not conceal from
you the fact that we are facing a danger which threat-
ens not merely fort dauphin and madagascar but the
entire world

   i here was incredulity on the majors face but he
replied courteously my means are entirely at your
service gentlemen

   beginning his report with scicntific exactitude weyl
included duperrets letter noted the sudden midnight
attack on the steamer and went  to the details of the
expedition

       for hours after the attack he wrote we
were unable to get anything like control out of the
chaos in the camp i think another attack of these un-
speakably loathsome umbrella beasts would have
brought complete panic certainly hardly any rifles but
duperret s and my own would have met them

   we could not hope to escape by an immediate dash
for the fort though it was less than thirty hours march
away the beasts seemed to be on every side and they
would have every advantage in that jungle where we
would have been instantly swept into the trees by their
swinging tentacles

   fortunately these hideous monsters appeared to
have gathered their fill of human food for the time be-
ing and meanwhile the idea of fire occurred to us
all the wood we could gather without too closely ap-
proaching the trees was collected and heaped in piles
about five feet apart in a complete circle these were
set alight and we huddled in the center of the blazing
ring almost roasted by the heat but feeling infinitely
safei with the coming of day the heat was almost
intolerable but we gained confidence as it became ap-
parent that the beasts would not dare the fire though
we could hear them whistling in the trees

   our situation was bad the supply of wood was
not inexhaustible and that of water was already used
up i am convinced that these beasts are possessed of a
comparatively high intelligence the manner of their
attack the character of the one killed in the battle led
to this conclusion and they were evidently deliberately
laying siege to us with the intention of starving us out
of our refuge

   our rifles were useless and to make a sudden dash
through the lines would certainly involve the sacrifice
of most of those present-perhaps all so we sat down
to plan a way out obviously we had to find a means
to make ourselves immune to their attacks

   i thought i had it when i remembered that no bar-
barian beast or insect would tolerate castor oil des-
the octopus cycle



perate as was our situation the idea of escaping a
deadly and horrible death by means of that homely
remedy made me want to laugh hysterically i remem-
ber duperret watching me trying to smother the urge
looking queerly at me quite obviously doubtful of my
mental balance his speculative and startled glance
added to the absurdity of the thing and  almost lost
my self-control i realized we were all on the edge
of madness

  the idea had of course to be discarded we had
castor oil among our medical supplies but barely
enough to discourage the insects of the tropical jungle
certainly not enough to smear ourselves from head to
foot to keep off those giant monstrosities menacing us
from all sides

  the solution we hit upon finally may not have been
the best but it was simple and like many another did
not occur to us till we were ready to give up in despair
duperret dubose and i had spent the entire first day
of our siege discussing and rejecting ways and means
and we had just about decided that the only thing to
do was to make a concerted dash into the jungle firing
into the trees and trusting to luck and mobility to carry
us through when the lieutenant startled us with a sud-
den leap and shouted something wild something we
did not understand

  we feared for his sanity as mutely we watched
him dashing about furiously from spot to spot in the
clearing tearing up handful after handful of liana grass
and throwing them on the fire

  when however a dense cloud of thick choking
black smoke rolled up and when dubose turned to us
with a triumphant light in his face we understood
dimly what his idea was and in a frenzy of relief sev-
eral of us danced foolishly in a circle about the fire
and its column of smoke

   in a council that followed we decided that our at-
tempt to escape had better be made during the day
since we had all noticed that there was less activity
among our besiegers during the hours whn the heat
was most intense we kept our fires burning then
throughout the night until dawn nobody slept we
were too apprehensive and too busy improvising
torches for our protection during the march the
beasts evidently fearful of the fire remained in their
trees all that night and though they continued to whistle
about us this seems their sole mode of communica-
tion there seemed to be less whistling from the side to
which our smoke drifted this assured us that our
lieutenants plan would work

  at dawn bearing our smoking flambeaux we set
out arms and equipment were useless they were dis-
carded to prevent the panic that appeared imminent
among the men dubose threatened to shoot down any
man who left the formation and to insure obedience
only duperret he and myself were allowed to retain
revolvers

  as we neared the trees there was crowding among
the men but a few sharp words brought them to their
senses we halted just at the edge of the clearing and
duperret and i leading the shivering company threw
our branches down under the trees and piled more wood
on to make a little blaze there was a discernible com-

motion in the foliage above us but we could see noth-
ing when the noises subsided we ventured in a hun-
dred yards or so and built another fire

  this scheme was resorted to at intervals all aiong
our march progress was necessarily slow at some
dark spots where the jungle was thick it was neces-
sary to proceed in narrow files and these were the most
dangerous not only because of the umbrella beasts
but also because of the fright and impatience of the
men

  it was in one of these places that a casualty oc-
curred one of the chasseurs suddenly broke from
the line and ran shouting madly to wave his torch at
a vinous growth hanging from a tree which he must
have taken for a tentacle of one of the beasts pie
stumbled his torch flying from his hand as he fell
his danger jhen evidently deprived him of what senses
he had remaining for regaining his feet he ran not
back into the line but deeper into the jungle we heard
a strangled cry in a few moments that was all none
of us dared to leave the company to bring him back

  another time a man went raving mad and made a
violent attack on dubose before he could be caught
he stabbed that brave man twice in the breast

  now as to the animals which attacked us i had
one before me for some sixty hours though with little
opportunity to examine and none at all to dissect it
my observations though somewhat scanty lead me to
the conclusion that we are dealing with a hitherto un-
known member of the great mollusk family the fam-
ily includes the octopus and oyster neither with red
blood and it wasthe nearly colorless fluid that puzzled
me about the blood of the beast that attacked the ship

  the beast that was killed at the camp had a larger
body than any known member of the family and ten-
tacles at least fifteen feet in length and correspondingly
powerful a protective covering of chitin appears to
have been developed and due to the lack of any internal
skeleton and the fact that the muscles must base on it
this protective covering to its body is of a thickness and
strength sufficient to be quite impervious to rifle bullets
the one we killed had received a bullet full in the eye
which passed through into its brain

  it is this brain that offers the most remarkable fea-
ture of these creatures a brief investigation shows me
that their brains are certainly larger than those of any
animals except the big apes and probably as large as
those of the lower races of man this argues an in-
telligence extremely high and makes them more than
ever dangerous since they can evidently plan acts and
execute them in concert

  they have eight tentacular arms covered on the
lower side with the usual cephalopod type of suckers
the center of each sucker being occupied as in some
species of octopus by a small sharp claw the thick-
ness and therefore the muscular strength of these arms
is enormous it is no wonder men proved utterly
powerless against them

  i am unable to say anything about either their
method of breeding or what device they have arrived at
for breathing air probably some protective covering
keeps the gill-plumes moist as in the crayfish making
access to water at times necessary


amazing stories

  in the face are two very large eyes capable of see-
ing well in the dark and located directly in front of the
large brain the mouth consists of a huge beak razor-
edged there are no teeth add this formidable beak
to their extraordinary powers of swimming their swift
progress on land their giant strength and their great
intelligence and it becomes evident that the human race
is faced with a great peril

  there is nothing whatever to prevent these animals
from swimming the ocean or attacking the greatest city
one of these beasts could kill a hundred people in an
hour and hardly any weapon we possess would be of
the slightest use   

  as he wrote weyls mind was again filled with the
terror of that mad march through the jungle with the
umbrella beasts whistling on every side and his
imagination shuddered at the picture of london or new
york under an invasion from those grim madagascar
jungles all business stopped every door barred the
octopuses triumphantly parading the streets breaking
in here and there and strangling the last resistance of
families cowering in corners powerless against the in-
vulnerable and irresistible animals here and there
some squad armed with dynamite or some other weapon
more powerful than rifles would offer a brief resist-
ance but they too would go down in time civilization
throttled and in its place a ghastly reign of ani-
malism   

chapter v

major larivet was inclined to skepticism
over weyls report in a brusque but kindly
way he had suggested that it be delayed

    till you have had time to think it over perhaps
when the effect of vour experience has-ah-worn
off-

  weyl gazed at him in astonishment at this sugges-
tion but he was to remember it forty days later

  meanwhile there was nothing to do but wait till the
report reached the outer world and some echo of it in
the form of men aeroplanes scientists with their in-
struments and death dealing concoctions arrived to wipe
out that terrible blot and during the waiting even
major larivets skepticism vanished under the pressure
of events

  the octopuses as weyl called them had confined
their raids to isolated districts up to the time of his
expedition but now acting apparently upon a well-
formed plan they became bolder and began a syste-
matic extermination of every native in this part of the
island

  three days after the return of the expedition a
native runner dashed in half-crazed with fright to re-
port a twilight raid on a whole village from which
hardly a soul escaped as the days drew on this
ominous news was followed by such demonstrations of
the power and intelligence of the octopuses as confirmed
weyls darkest fears

  a village on the coast was attacked and the natives
taking to their clumsy boats to escape the terror by land
found themselves no less helpless on the water the only
news of the dreadful event coming from some native

who had gone there and found only a circle of empty
huts

   alarm of panic proportions spread like wildfire
among the malagasy and in a stream that became a
torrent they poured into fort dauphin for protection

   daily the reports of depredations showed that the
octopus terror was spreading and coming nearer and
major larivet found himself faced with the problem
of feeding several hundred hungry and frightened
natives with means wholly inadequate

  the climax came with the arrival of four men or
rather shadows of men who babbled that they were
the last of the great tribe of the tanosy fighters to
the core instead of flying they had stood out in battle
array against their antagonists the result had been
unspeakably horrible-they had seen their comrades
torn to pieces before their eyes and the women and
children hunted down

   it was while things were in this state that the little
tin-pot mail boat arrived with its cargo of supplies and
european newspapers

   weyls heart rose as he marched off to his quarters
eagerly with the papers under his arm but it sank
like lead when he and duperret opened journal after
journal in quick disappointed perusals

   not one they perceived took the matter seriously
weyls phrase umbrella beasts had been seized
upon by humorous commentators with gusto rolled on
their tongues and spun off their pens to tickle the ribs
of readers of serious acceptance there was not a sign
the general tone of the papers was one of howling de-
rision it was suggested that weyl had gone crazy
that he was a publicity-mad mountebank but the more
usual spirit of the papers was that of the french wit
who blared weyls umbrella beasts inseparable
companions for that rainy-day walk no one acquainted
with the dictates of fashion can afford to dispense with
this novel combination of household pet and protective
implement

   and the cartoons    

   weyl looked up from the papers to meet duperrets
glance there were actual tears in the frenchmans
eyes

   it seems to be up to us said weyl after a mo-
ment well-i am not a rich man as it is reckoned i
in america but i can command a considerable amount
of money and can borrow more i will write a cable-
gram to be sent off immediately and have every cent
spent for materials to fight this thing

  together they composed the carefully worded mes-
sage to weyls assistant in the laboratory in new york
and together they took it to the dock and delivered it
to the captain of the boat with the most urgent instruc-
tions to send it the moment he arrived at andovoranbo

chapter vi

not long after daybreak the american was
roused from his sleep by a confused shouting-
under the window hurrying into his clothes
he dashed out to see the little mail boat wallowing i
crazily off the jagged rocks that guarded the entrance 
to the harbor her funnels silent and smokeless within
the octopus cycle



ten minutes she was right among the breakers pounding
in the surf but there was no sign of officers crew or
lifeboats

   it was late in the afternoon before he could secure
 a native dhow to get out to the wreck when he
 stepped on the slanting deck of the wrecked boat weyl
 found what he had feared there was no one on
 board-only a blood-stain here and there

   every man in the settlement was quite capable of
 visualizing what had happened writhing black-grey
 tentacles reaching up out of the midnight sea the
 swarming of hide-
 ous bodies over the
 ship relentless grop-
 ing arms searching
 out the screaming
 seamen the fatally
 prehensive embrace
 of repulsive flesh 

   that very night
 fort dauphin re-
 ceived notice that it
 was under close
 siege a mile out on
 the northeast beach
 two natives were
 taken by an octopus
 that came unexpect-
 edly out of the water
 on them and on the
 oppsite side of town
 a soldier was pur-
 sued along the sand
 right up to the walls
 of the fort later
 the report ran in that
 one of the sentinels
 on the west side had
 disappeared

   but neither weyl
 nor major larivet
 was quite prepared
 for the bold attack
 on the fort two days
 later

   twilight was just
 blueing the edges of
 the jungle a quarter
 mile from the bas-
 tions of the fort and
 the three white men were smoking gloomily over their
 coffee when a shot and a shout from the sentry brought
 them to their feet

   they hastened to the bastion out of the jungle in
 the same regular military order they had preserved on
 that fatal night of the first attack came the octopuses
 huge ugly heads bobbing above undulating tentacles
 below

   larivet with a gleam in his eyes at being at ast
 able to come to grips with the enemy snapped sharp
 orders as the artillerymen swung the two seventy-
 fives into position duperret and weyl watched
 breathlessly heedless of the wild cries of alarm that

issued from the natives who had seen the octopuses

  the mouth of the gun swung down slowly an
order brief motions the crash of the discharge and
right in the center of the advancing line a terrific burst
of flame and dust

  an octopus staggered stumbled with wildly flailing
arms and flopped inertly to the ground

  crash the bright flames from the two guns
mingled and in the flare of the explosions three more
of the monsters went to oblivion they were not
there was a ray of hope

  weyl found him-
self cheering franti-
cally he felt a pres-
sure at his shoulder
and saw a couple of
natives beside him
their courage re-
vived the black ar-
tillerymen worked
like mad they could
not miss at that
point-blank range

   all down the octo-
pus line were gaps
and the wounded
beasts strove to right
themselves they
wavered broke and
in disorderly flight
headed back into the
jungle pursued by
the avenging shells
of the seventy-fives
till they had passed
from sight

  the natives were
crowding about
shouting with emo-
tion and hurling
epithets after the re-
treating monsters
they were saved-at
least for the time be-
ing

   but the conference
of the three white
men that night was
grave

  we have not
really accomplished very much said weyl except
to show them that we have weapons against which they
are not invulnerable i dont think they will attempt to
rush the fort again but they are terribly intelligent
they may try a surprise attack at night or from the
sea or may even give us a regular starvation siege
no they will not soon approach your guns again
agreed duperret but what are we to do if they at-
tack the town from the other side the fort surely
cannot hold all the people you have here

  gentlemen said larivet gravely in that case we
can only do our duty i shall have one of the guns
moved to the other side of town meanwhile we can

invulnerable then

amazing stories

do nothing but wait till someone comes to help us
  or until we go to them from weyl

  duperret paled slightly and stood up i offer my-
self as a messenger he said i will take a dhow out
if i am attacked well i know where to shoot them-
in the eyes i-

  no raoul no said weyl let me try it it
would be simply-

  he was interrupted a native servant entered ex-
citedly

  him one piece boat in town said the black white
man comes

  boat white man queried larivet puzzled a
chcery voice in the doorway answered him i say is
anybody here it said and in marched an extraordi-
nary figure of a man

  a large sign saying englishman could not have
stamped his race more effectively than his expression
of cheerful vapidity his clothes were white sci-tpu-
lously clean and meticulously pressed and in one hand
he bore what looked like a small fire-extinguisher he
extended the other toward weyl

  youre weyl arent you he said mulgraves
my name henry seaton mulgrave earl of mul-
grave and pembroke and all that rot at your ser-
vice

  of course i remember said weyl cordially you
gave that extraordinary paper on the myxinidae be-
fore the british association ah that paper allow
me he said and translated into rapid erench for the
benefit of larivet to present the earl of mulgrave
one of the most distinguished of living scientists
there were bows a drink offered and accepted and
the visitor carefully placing his fire-extinguisher in the
corner curled his lanky frame up in a chair

chapter vii

 eriously though yknow mulgrave said
after finishing his whisky and soda if it hadnt
been that i was a bit in the doldrums at the
time your report came out i believe i would have
joined the rest of the world in thinking you somewhat
-er-balmy despite your excellent reputation but
i needed a cruise anyway and came on the chance there
was something in it sort of a sporting venture dysee
it did seem quite a bally cooked-up sort of mess the
way those journals played it up yknow

  weyls nod of understanding was followed by an in-
quiring look at the queer contrivance the englishman
had placcd in the corner

  flammenwerfer mulgrave answered the silent
query germans used em in the war superior bit
of frightfulness shoots out fire and really quite
effective even against your bally octopuses i assure
you

  but weyl exclaimed you cant possibly-

  oh yes i have mulgrave smiled the ruddy
animals hadnt the decency to wait for a proper intro-
duction and paid us a visit on the morgana-my yacht
yknow-just outside the harbor t fancy when we
got through with them they were rather scorched
morgana was war-built and has steel decks so we

didnt mind putting the flammenwerfer to work
against them weve got whats left of one stretched
out on the deck others got away

  weyl breathed a sigh of relief and thankfulness that
this casual englishman had come prepared how easily
the mail boat disaster might have been duplicated he
shuddered

  well then part of our horrible problem seems to
be solved thanks to your foresight mulgrave at
least we have a means of wiping them out but heres
the difficulty it will take years killing them off one
by one as well have to do with your pump gun i tell
you they infest the whole island thousands of em
theyre increasing and multiplying faster than we
could possibly kill them off thats the only way i
can explain this recent outbreak they were few enough
in number before this to remain in obscurity except in
isolated districts and known only to ignorant and super-
stitious natives weyls forehead creased in perplexity
and worry if they keep on-well theyll need the
whole globe and that means only one thing man
will have to get off it to make room for them theyre
powerful enough and intelligent enough to have their
own way about it too dont doubt it unless-
mulgrave evidently did not share weyls anxiety
though he did not seem to underestimate the danger
ill finish that last sentence of yours weyl although
ill admit things are a bit worse than i had thought
but meanwhile lets look over our resources and try
to find out a bit more about the nature of the beast
were up against the post-mortem of that lamentably
deceased visitor on the morganas deck ought to tell us
something of his weak points do you want to go out
there now 

  with chairs tilted back against the cabin of the mor-
gana the three men regarded the sundown sky in a
moody and depressed silence their dissection of the
octopus killed by mulgraves pump-gun had added little
to their knowledge of the anatomy of the menacing
brutes save a confirmation of weyls hypothesis that
their breathing while on land was conducted by means
of the same gills which supplied them with oxygen in
the water protected like the lobsters by a covering
of chitin

  mulgraves chair scraped on the deck well lets
get back ashore he said cant do any more now i
fancy unless they decide to stage a party for us this
evening

  it comes down to this then said weyl continuing
the conversation which had been abandoned with the
end of their anatomical researches fire or some kind
of guns heavier than the ordinary service rifle are the
only things that will do any particular good

  have you thought of gas my friend asked
duperret

iiuh answered weyl shortly airplanes chemi-
cals and what about all the men on the island-for
we should have to cover it all with gas to be of any use
the time is rather short too i fancy chirped
mulgrave how long will provisions last

  not long agreed duperret moodily a week or
perhaps a little more

  then within seven days or at the most ten we
the octopus cycle



must concoct a plan and put it into force-a plan that
will wipe out god knows how many of these unearthly
enemies of the earth it must be extermination too
for if one pair were left to breed    im more than
half convinced that the thing is hopeless yet i dont
like to show the white flag these are after all only
beasts super-beasts it is true but the equals and heirs
of man i hate to believe it

   but my friend you forget the force of mere num-
bers said duperret so many rats could easily over-
power us guns and all from mere lack of time to kill
them as fast as they came on comparative values as
of man and beast are insignificant

 weyl nodded a pessimistic agreement

  theres only one chance he said if we could
find some way to attack them in the water-they must
go there to breed at least and i fancy they must make
periodic visits to the water to wet their gill plumes in
addition

chapter viii

   t was three days later

       another octopus attack on the little fort had
met with a bloody repulse and a score of the great
bodies lay at the edge of the jungle in varying stages
of decomposition where they had been blown to extinc-
tion by the swift shells of the seventy-fives a con-
ference was in progress on major larivets verandah
a conference of beaten men

   as a last resort duperret was saying there is the
open sea and mulgraves yacht

  why as for that weyl answered it wouldnt
hold a tenth of us even crowded to the rails besides
leave those natives behind damn it they trust us
it would hardly be cricket said mulgrave what
of the mail steamer arent they apt to send someone
to look us up when she does not appear 
i not even yet is the boat due at andovoranto said
major larivet and there is the time for the news to
reach andananarivo    the lack of news to them will
be but a token that we have pacified the tanosy and are
in need of nothing

  yes duperret agreed i know these officials
they are aware of something unusual only when they
have seventeen dossiers each neatly tied in red tape
and endorsed by the proper department head my
friends we are alone

 which means weyl continued that we have about
a week more to live before the food runs out or they
overwhelm us and then-good-by world of men
there was a little silence broken only by the sound
of mulgrave puffing at his pipe it was ended by a
shot and a shout from one of the sentries at the western
side of the fort the signal of another attack

   during that night the great octopuses twice fought
their way down to the fort and twice were repulsed
though the second effort longer and more violently sus-
tained than the first only ended when mulgrave called
in the crew of his yacht and their flammenwerfer

   as the following day drew on the unrest in the jungle
about the army post became more pronounced major
larivet duperret and weyl worn with lack of sleep

kept vigil by the little counterscarp listening to the in-
numerable whistlings and rustlings so near to them
while the soldiers and natives visibly shaken were
difficult to keep in line

  when evening came it seemed as though the octo-
puses had concentrated their forces for a great drive
the whistlings had increased to such a volume that
sleep was nearly impossible and as soon as the sun
went down the movements of dark forms could be ob-
served where the animals were silhouetted against the
sky along the beach

  the first attack came half an hour later it was a
sporadic outburst apparently consisting of only three
or four individuals and these were quickly dispersed
or slain by a few bursts from the seventy-fives but
it was followed by another and another the numbers
of the attackers ranging all the way from three to fifteen
or twenty unlike the previous attempts on the fort
they were frenzied and unorganized as though the
directing intelligence behind them had suddenly failed
immune to fear the living octopuses came right on
through the hail of fire and died at the foot of the
rampart or dashed over it even to be wounded to
death by bayonets fixed on long poles with which the
black soldiers reached and stabbed frenziedly at eyes
and softer parts

  once during a lull in the combat the commandant
and weyl were called to witness a monstrous duel at
the very edge of the fort between two of the hideous
beasts the ungainly creatures locked in each others
tentacles rolled hideously together tearing at each
other with their great beaks till a senegalese reached
over with one of those improvised bayonet pikes and
dealt first one and then the other mortal stabs weyl
felt a singular sensation of nausea

  toward dawn it became evident to the exhausted
artillerymen and their wearied leaders that the octopuses
were now aiming not so much at conquest as at escape
they no longer blundered into the fires that had been
built about the fort and village no longer hurled them-
selves upon mulgraves crew of flame-throwers and
the shells of the seventy-fives they seemed to be
heading for the beach to be striving to reach the water

  and when dawn broke the men in the enclosure
saw a few stragglers from the hideous army at the edge
of the jungle making their way like the others with
ungainly flappings and swishings always toward the
beach it was impossible to watch them without feel-
ing an almost physical sensation of illness of sinking
but what did it mean no one among the harassed de-
fenders of fort dauphin was prepared to say

chapter ix

mulgraves wearied crew had gone aboard
their ship and the white men refreshed by a
few hours sleep and a bath were discussing
the question i am of the opinion weyl was de-
claring that they have certain periods when they must
wet their gill-plumes again and last nights disturbance
represents one of those periods if we could only at-
tack them at such a time-

dr brittlestones method

 by samuel m sargent jr

author of the telepathic pick-up

hen dr aro brittlestone came through
the door of my inner office i had the im-
pression of a bull charging in at me brit-
tlestone was an inch or two above six feet
in height big boned and big framed his
skeleton would have delighted the eye of a bone special-
ist or so i imagined from the outer appearance of the
man this structure carried a maximum of flesh and
a minimum of fat he weighed over two hundred
pounds all solid hard bone and muscle he was a
crudely constructed man from his huge feet to his
coarse black hair and there was a common strain in
him that had been but thinly concealed by his educa-
tion his advent to a society that was above him and
the better environment that success had given him
he had acquired by hard work and driving ambition
an ease of manner and a pseudo-refinement that were
really to his credit

  i had never met brittlestone until the day he entered
my office coming without appointment pushing his
way in past the attendant and a whole roomful of my
patients but i had heard of him long before when
his sanatorium in the mendalato mountains had gained
some fame a fame that had never waned and that
was even now steadily increasing he himself seemed
to be a quite skillful physician and the many who had
come under his care were only too ready to speak a
good word for the sanatorium he catered to the
extremely wealthy i understood but he kept a cer-
tain number of charity cases always some ten or
twenty in the six years that his sanatorium had been
in existence he had i imagine put away quite a sum he
maintained a place in so-
ciety a place he had carved 
out for himself by sheer
force and lavish expendi-
ture he was known in his
circle i believe as gener-
ous to prodigality yet i
never saw a man who
looked so avidly on money

  the morning i met him
when he loomed so huge in the doorway had promised
to be a particularly busy one for me i glanced up in
annoyance at his abrupt entrance but brittlestone ap-
parently failed to notice my attitude

  dr strang he asked heartily his thick lips parted
in a smile he came to a pause close before me and
gazed down from his commanding height with cordi-
ality in his small eyes im brittlestone of happy
lane in the mendalatoes

  content that this was introduction enough and evi-
dently certain that his name was a familiar one to

me he thrust forth a hand that much grooming had
failed to make attractive after a moment of hesita-
tion i shook hands with him invited him to be seated
and waited questioningly and none too cordially to
learn his mission he dropped into the chair crossed
his legs and puffed once on his huge black cigar this
was the only time that i ever saw him without the
cloak of cultivated watchful dignity that had almost
become a part of him perhaps his lapse into a coarse
self-sufficiency on our first meeting tinged my whole
opinion of him and overshadowed later impressions
that would have been more pleasant

  fine spring were having isnt it he remarked
evidently in no hurry to state his object and uncon-
scious that he was taking up time that i could better
have devoted to my practice thereafter he rambled
on casually upon unimportant subjects until i was in
an excellent murder mood

  but there was a fascination about the man that almost
reconciled me to the lost time and prevented my
brusquely terminating the interview the ruggedness
of him his huge bulk and the stark coarseness of
every feature made a striking ensemble with the veneer
that he had acquired i noted particularly his very
peculiar eyes they were almost hidden by huge under-
lids until they gazed from small slits that scarcely re-
vealed the deadness of the iris and the lacklustre light
of the pupil his carefully trimmed black vandyke
beard was thin so that the outlines of his chin showed
through

  brittlestone as he talked along was studying me
too i had the feeling that from their flesh burrows

those dull-iit eyes were
reaching out taking every
impression of me and stor-
ing them away in an alert
active brain

  whether impressed with
my impatience or rebuffed
by my monosyllabic replies
brittlestone presently lost
his ease of manner and be-
came obviously embarrassed abruptly he rose

  well doctor im afraid ive taken up too much
of your valuable time and i humbly apologize but
when i started up here to see you i had a certain
proposition in mind he hesitated it-well it
really  was nothing vital and hardly warranted my
intrusion something i shall broach to you at another
time perhaps perhaps ill be in and see you some-
time again soon

  do so i replied shaking his hand

  he stood hesitantly a moment seemed about to add

 j t ere is another story by samuel m sargent jr who
 --i comes rapidly ahead as an authority m scientifiction
 the thoughts contained in this story arc certainly not only
 most unusual but the science is extaordinarily good you
 will not know until the final ending just what happened and
 you will find the ending bizarre and amazing enough a
 most excellent story throughout


then i stared in amazement a man lagging of step was circling the room his bands were manacled behind him he was
apparently worn out and now and again he sighed in agony his head was drooping his face lined with fatigue  i saw
that he was held up by a harness that was strapped to his shoul ders and that this harness was fastened to a motor on a high
track on the wall    the man pulled on ward by it was forced to walk continuously




amazing stories

something then abruptly turned away and let himself
out of the side door i stared thoughtfully at the trans-
lucent pane as his shadow left it and i felt somewhat
baffled and curious at his visit then other matters
swept away speculation on the incident

  it came to my mind several days later when i was
called upon to treat one of my oldest and certainly
wealthiest patients james hart the packer mr
hart had for the past year been suffering from digest-
ive disorders and i had repeatedly advised him to go
to a sanatorium but without effect he had never
been inclined to accept advice indeed he had forged
through to his great monetary success on his quality
of flouting it but whereas in the financial world he
had been rewarded for his independence in this case
he paid dearly

i had a call from the hart home i found hart
in bed his face rather anemic his eyes droopy
he smiled up at me feebly and there was a despondent
note to his voice

  although harts social sphere was removed from
mine by some millions of dollars we were close friends
and had been since the years-ago time when i had been
a student of medicine and he had earned his living as
a clerk in the packing house he now owned

  hello tom he said its got me down good this
time same old trouble im afraid the lord didnt
give me a very good stomach

  not at all i returned severely your stomachs
all right or would be if you gave it any chance at all
you wouldnt have had this attack if you had taken
my advice your whole system needs toning up jim
a couple of months at a sanatorium would set you up
as fit as a fiddle all you need are regular hours
regular meals and a proper diet

  and if i dont go

   well if you dont go-im afraid youll be a pretty
sick man jim

  he considered a moment

  thats what doc brittlestone said he returned
i was talking to him yesterday he told me he was
a friend of yours tom fine man isnt he i only
met him a week ago but were good friends already
met him out at the benvo club hes an excellent
golf player he gave me an examination yesterday-
not in a professional capacity-but just when he heard
i was sick you know he agrees that unless i go to
a sanatorium ill be in bad shape he suggested that
i come to his place thats one reason i called you
tom i wanted you to take another look at me and
if you still thought i needed the treatment i wanted
to ask you what you think of brittlestones sanatorium
to the best of my knowledge it is all right if you
wish to go there i replied a trifle stiffly i have
never heard anything against it and i have heard some
good reports upon it you know jim-ive named it
often enough-that i always advise east lake sana-
torium ive recommended it for years and have never
had a complaint on it i know that it is excellent in
every respect i still advise it to you jim but if
you prefer dr brittlestones why as i said i know
nothing against it but the main thing man is to go

to one of them immediately ill guarantee that a
couple of months will work wonders with you

  hart shifted his position and laid his head back
wearily on his pillow

  well ill sleep on it in the morning ill make
arrangements to go to one of them

  content with this promise i left i was somewhat
chagrined at harts having accepted the services of
another physician even though it had been only in a
friendly way while he naturally had the right to
gain all the medical advice he wished and to go tc
any sanatorium he desired still my long connection
with him as family physician and friend gave me i
felt a right to more consideration than i had been
shown  might at least have been apprised before-
hand

   toward brittlestone i felt an increasing dislike he
had in a way abruptly shouldered me aside and taken
a case away under the artifice of a friendly call i had
no doubt that he had deliberately cultivated harts
acquaintance for the purpose of obtaining another
wealthy patient for his sanatorium t remembered his
strange call upon me and wondered what connection
it might have with hart possibly brittlestone had
intended to broach the subject of sending hart to his
own sanatorium but had felt at a loss how to open
the matter with me i felt quite bitter toward brittle-
stone and vastly displeased with hart as i drove back
to my office

  the next morning i received a message from hart
saying that he had decided upon happy lane sana-
torium and would leave town that afternoon what
displeasure i felt at his choice was displaced by satis-
faction that he had at last been prevailed upon to take
proper treatment after all happy lane sanatorium
was fully as good as east lake

  in the following several months i received regular
letters from him each cheerier than the one preceding
four months after he had entered happy lane i
received the following

  dear tom

     i thought i would drop you a line to let you
  know that i shall be back in the city in two weeks
  at most i am feeling better than i have for ten
  years it is all due to dr brittlestone he is
  really a wonderful physician tom and he is
  a wonderful man in every way his kindness is
  unbounded he has twenty charity patients here
  and he attends them all personally he seems
  more interested in them than in the paying pa-
  tients even his ambition is to turn happy lane
  entirely into a charitable institution and he intends
  to do so as soon as he has money enough then
  he may build another place for paying cases he
  is a dreamer and idealist of the highest type and
  a wonderful man in every way besides my grati-
  tude to him for saving me-and he assures me i
  would have been dead in a few months-i admire
  him and like him for his noble qualities

     the sanatorium is situated in a paradise the
  scenery itself is an incentive to health and happi-
  ness i have been-
dr brittlestones method



   it was a long rambling letter with a care-free note
that was remarkable in hart he described his activi-
ties with a zest and buoyancy that made me think
longingly of vacation he had been hunting and fish-
ing and swimming during the past week he had
been on long tramps in the mountains he was a little
complaining about the food brittlestone would not
allow him enough he said and he was always hungry
his letter was filled with such things but the excerpt
i have quoted was that which most interested me i
felt no enthusiasm at his eulogy of brittlestone while
my aversion may have been due in some degree to pro-
fessional jealousy i like to think that it was divination
on my part of his true character whatever the cause

i read that paragraph of harts letter with distinct
displeasure evidently brittlestone had over-empha-
sized the seriousness of harts condition and played
upon the hypochondriac instinct that is in all of us
certainly he had not saved the millionaires life i
began to see why brittlestones patients were so loud
in praise of the sanatorium brittlestone appeared to
me more and more as a wiley money grabber and pos-
sibly even a quack and scoundrel

i was totally unprepared for the shock of the letter
i received ten days later

  dear tom

     probably you expected me to be home by this
   time but i have suffered a setback in health
   the day before yesterday when i rose i felt very
   tired although i had had a good nights sleep all
   that day i felt as tired as though i had been with-
   out sleep for a week yesterday i felt worse
   fatigued than ever so much so that i refused to
   get up i slept all day and night-steadily only
   waking once or twice-but this morning i am no
   better it is nothing serious according to dr
   brittlestone he says that i have auto-intoxication
   from wrong eating but i have eaten only the
   prescribed diet i am worried over my condition

   i would like to have you come up and give your
   opinion as i think dr brittlestone is mistaken in
   his diagnosis and that i may be taking some viru-
   lent disease are these the symptoms of sleeping
   sickness i wish you would come right up i
   suggested this to dr brittlestone and he prom-
   ised to notify you by letter as the telephone here
   is out of order but i thought i would write you
   myself to be sure you would come i am having
   brand mail this as dr brittlestone has forbidden
   my writing any letters or receiving visitors for the
   next few days lie fears that any excitement or
   exertion would be harmful i hope you will come
   up tom as soon as you can get started

                                                    jiart

   harts letter alarmed me greatly such a sudden
lassitude is often the prodrome of some serious dis-
ease at brittlestones diagnosis i scoffed at best
it was  tribute to the efficiency of his institution i
started immediately for happy lane

   it is a good sixty mile drive and i was the better

part of the day reaching the little mountain town of
harkinville then a two hour climb up a winding can-
yon road brought me to happy lane sanatorium huge
towering and white with great green lawns and many
white out-buildings enclosing the extensive grounds
was a high and ornate iron fence

   within the building was entirely of white tile with
spacious gleaming halls that carried the very atmos-
phere of sanitation but as in all things brittlestone
did this whiteness was more an appeal to impression-
ability than a factor toward health white is known
to have a harsh effect on the convalescent system much
more beneficial is some restful color preferably one
liked by the patient the office was magnificently but
tastefully furnished with really beautiful tapestries and
rugs behind a mahogany desk sat a tall lean remark-
ably hard-faced woman she glanced up at my en-
trance and gave me a searching look

  as i approached the desk she informed me with
utter finality that visitors were allowed only upon
thursdays then she returned to her work this
reception incensed me greatly inasmuch as she had
not yet learned my object in calling and since my medi-
cine case must have told her that i was a physician

   this is a professional visit i said with severity
i have a patient here and have received a hurry call
oh that is different she returned she paused
whom do you wish to see

  mr hart will you kindly direct me to his room
you will have to see dr brittlestone first he is
in his laboratory room  i will show you to it
at that moment brittlestone appeared in the door-
way upon seeing me he started slightly and a fleet-
ing look of what might have been alarm or annoyance
crossed his face then he advanced smilingly

   well doctor he said this is indeed a surprise
i had hardly expected you so soon you received my
message then 

   recalling that hart had sent his letter surreptitiously
i nodded

  yes naturally i came at once have you any
theory as to the cause of mr harts relapse

  brittlestone seemed nonplussed for a moment he
studied me sharply

  i must confess no he returned slowly how-
ever i think collapse would be the better word mr
hart seems to be suffering from an excessive lassitude
of course i suspected immediately that he had had
an acute attack of indigestion and later i feared he
might have developed some malignant disease but
i have given him a thorough examination and can say
that he is perfectly sound so i am forced to believe
that he is suffering from over-exertion he did rather
overdo it too doctor against my advice you may be
sure the first day he rose from bed he took a tramp
of many miles i am in error of course in having
allowed him to over-ride me but brittlestone smiled
deprecatively he is a rather difficult man to oppose
come and i will take you to him

  apparently perfectly friendly brittlestone chatted
away as he led me down the wide white hall i gained
the decided impression that he was neither puzzled nor
alarmed over hart that he regarded his ailment as


amazing stories

merely fatigue he was more interested in describing
the sanatorium which he promised to show to me as
soon as i had seen hart before the open door of a
right wing room he paused

  he is in here doctor

  i entered first and as i crossed the threshold i knew
hart lay on his back his face in repose his eyes closed
there was a weariness to his face that was already
slowly fading i had been in the presence of death too
often not to sense it brittlestone seemed to realize
it too there was surprise and alarm on his features
i crossed to the bed and took up harts hand there
was no indication of pulse in his wrist and the flesh
was cold

  what-what- began brittlestone in an excited
voice is he-

  he is dead i returned facing him with an in-
dignation that was perhaps not justified where is
mr brand

  why- brittlestone stepped to the bedside and
seized the dead mans hand then he let it fall why
he must be around ill find him

  he left the room hurriedly his odd behavior and
great agitation struck me as exceedingly strange and
more in keeping with the reaction of a close relative
than with a physician he returned shortly with john
brand harts secretary-lawyer in the meantime i
had examined the dead man carefully and found no
clue as to the cause of his death as brittlestone and
brand entered i was examining the left arm of the
corpse i had found it dotted with the marks of a
hypodermic needle with a brief nod to brand i
pointed these out to brittlestone

  was morphine administered to the patient with your
sanction doctor

  why yes returned brittlestone hastily he was
in frequent pain during the last week he was utterly
unable to sleep at night i was forced to give him a
quieting dose

   was not aware of that i said gazing sternly at
the physician nor did you mention it to me doctor
what was the cause of this pain

rittlestone licked his lips nervously

  i had failed to mention it because i thought
you understood mr harts condition thoroughly he
was subject to violent headaches a symptom of his
frequent attacks of acute indigestion

  i gazed thoughtfully at brittlestone and he avoided
my glance i realized of course that he had lied it
was a clumsy lie too evidently spun on the spur of the
moment but i could see no reason for his falsehood

  you say he was in pain i returned that you
thought he was suffering from headache did you
make no attempt to determine what was wrong do
you administer drugs here merely upon request there
are a dozen hypodermic marks upon his arm had he
not died as he did you were in a fair way to make an
addict of him for you admit that you administered
the drug only this last week

  a dozen  brittlestone evidently surprised stepped
forward and examined the dead mans arm i ad-
ministered it to him but three times

  the nurse i asked where is she

  why brittlestone hesitated she left yesterday
that is the one who has been in attendance the last
month i granted her a two months vacation the
new one-she is around somewhere shall i call her

  no she would be of no aid i replied

  that there was something seriously wrong was evi-
dent but each moment i became more puzzled brit-
tlestones attitude was certainly suspicious and i began
to suspect him of criminal activity and even murder
it left me stunned for a moment the possibility that
hart had been murdered i dismissed the idea imme-
diately for if it was murder what motive could there
be a physician does not kill his patients yet harts
death had been suspiciously sudden and his illness
suspiciously unnatural and brittlestone said he had
suffered intense pain while in his letter to me he had
described himself as only terribly fatigued another
strange circumstance was the absence of any one in
attendance on hart

  as to the hypodermic marks there was no evidence
of death from morphine nor indeed from any drug
neither was death from any known disease indicated
brittlestones confusion concerning the hypodermic
marks was suspicious aisq thought i he had lied
about them but his astoni iment and dismay when
we had found hart dead had seemed genuine

  i was in an absolute quandary the thought came
that it might be suicide perhaps brittlestone had told
the truth and hart had simulated pain in order to
gain the drug but he had not died from morphine
and there were nine more marks on the arm than
brittlestone admitted perhaps hart had bribed the
nurse for the additiofial doses still what was it that
had killed him i could think at the moment only
that he might have committed suicide by injecting an
air bubble into his blood stream though this of course
did not explain his lassitude i faced my companions

  mr hart seems to have succumbed to an excessive
fatigue caused by over-exertion i declared but
these extra ministrations of a drug of some kind raises
a doubt that will justify an inquest will you kindly
notify the coroner doctor

   brittlestones eyes flickered oddly

  certainly he replied and there was an eagerness
to his tone  dislike of course having any question
raised that will reflect on happy lane but in this case
i feel that it is necessary  am sure that mr hart
must have bribed his nurse for added amounts of mor-
phine but it is evident that this did not cause his death
an inquest will establish that he died from natural
causes

  with this formal speech he left the room i took
advantage of his absence to question harts lawyer-
secretary brand informed me that he had been with
his employer constantly during the daytime though he
slept several rooms away

  were mr harts affairs in good shape i asked
did he have any troubles financial or otherwise that
you know of  any serious enough to have preyed on
his mind

  no indeed doctor in fact he was more free of
entanglements than he had been at any time i handled
dr brittlestones method



his affairs there was not even a lawsuit pending
against him

  you had noticed no change in him mentally
no-well he did one thing i personally thought
odd

  and that

  well two weeks ago he drew a will leaving half of
his estate to this sanatorium but it was because of
his gratitude at having recovered his health here that-
was before his relapse you know he told me that
dr brittlestone was working wonders both with his
sanatorium work and in research you know the
doctor has a laboratory here and he spends most of his
spare time in it

i was too overwhelmed for speech without a
word to brand i stepped into the long hallway of
the sanatorium and walked slowly down it i realized
that hart had been the victim of an infernally clever
scoundrel that this brittlestone was as dangerous a
man as had ever walked the earth he had made hart
die a natural death a death due to some mysterious
substance-some poison utterly unknown i thought
of brittlestones laboratory i walked to room 
the door was unlocked quickly entering i found
myself in a well-appointed laboratory replete with
apparatus for physiological research as i stood there
inspecting the room fearful of brittlestones coming
i heard a sound it was the faint footsteps of some-
one methodical weary unvarying it came from the
left of me evidently in the room next i listened for
several moments the person in that room was step-
ping with a measured tread never slowing up never
increasing his pace i noted that there was a door
opening into that chamber and i stepped to it it
was locked with the key in the lock i drew back the
bolt and cautiously opened the door then i stared in
amazement a man lagging of step was circling the
room his hands were manacled behind him he was
apparently worn out and now and again he sighed in
agony his head was drooping his face lined with
fatigue often he half stumbled as though about to
fall i saw that he was held up by a harness that was
strapped to his shoulders and that this harness was
fastened to a motor on a high track on the wall evi-
dently operated by electricity the car made an endless
round of the chamber the man pulled onward by it
was forced to walk continuously

  i leaped forward and removed the straps from his
shoulders with a moan he collapsed into my arms
the bolt continued to traverse the room dragging the
harness after it

  there came a sound from the doorway glancing up
i saw the huge form of brittlestone and farther back
brand without a word brittlestone stepped back
slammed the door and locked it i hearoa mumble
of voices a scuffling sound and the crash of glass a

moment later the door opened again brand came in
holding a revolver his face was red and he was
breathing heavily

  whats all this doctor he panted dr brittle-
stone acted like a madman he tried to shoot me i
had a time getting the gun then he jumped through
the window i guess hes killed hes lying out there
on the cement

   brittlestone we found was dead his skull fractured
in his laboratory we found memoranda that fully
cleared up the mystery of harts death hart had in-
deed died from fatigue

   brittlestone had made discoveries in physiology that
would have been much to his credit had he not turned
them to the nefarious end he did he had long studied
the katabolism of muscular activity and had succeeded
in preparing a serum containing muscle fatigue stuffs
or rather i gathered from his notes the actual poison-
ous principle that induces fatigue among his memo-
randa were several pages torn from a work by angelo
moss the italian physiologist certain passages which
were marked i shall quote

  i have now given a rapid glance at the toxic sub-
stances which are produced in the organism if
these waste products accumulate in the blood we feel
fatigued when their amount passes the physiological
limit we become ill     and so long ago as 
i found that the blood of a fatigued animal is toxic for
if injected into another animal it produces the phe-
nomena characteristic of fatigue    the idea
that fatigue is a kind of poisoning resulting from prod-
ucts derived from chemical changes in the cells is not
new the physiologists pfluger preyer and zuntz
especially did much to establish the basis for this opin-
ion but we are still at the beginning of our researches
and can say nothing as to the nature of these sub-
stances and the question is so complex and so contro-
versial that i shall certainly not attempt to indicate our
present position with regard to it

  the man i had found a prisoner was one of the
charity patients and from him brittlestone had gained
the supply of blood for his experiments he had kept
the man eternally walking allowing him no rest more
than was necessary to keep him alive recently brit-
tlestone had gone farther than the isolation of his
poison from the blood of the wearied man he had
learned to synthesize the poison from organic sub-
stances

  money mad brittlestone had made a business of
playing upon the gratitude of his wealthy patients
gaining mention in their wills and then murdering them
with his serum at least five we learned had met
the same fate as hart but in their cases no question had
been raised

   had brittlestone not killed himself he would surely
have hanged as it was three of his staff were con-
victed as accomplices and sentenced to life imprison-
ment

tale of scheherazade

hy edgar allan poe

author of the facts in the case of m valdemar etc

truth is stranger than fiction-old saying

  avng had occasion lately in the course
  of some oriental investigation to consult
  the  eumcnow isitsoornot a work which
  like the zohar of simeon jochaides is
  scarcely known at all even in europe and

grand vizier or no grand vizier he has not the slight-
est design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his
privileges when therefore the fair scheherazade
insisted upon marrying the king and did actually marry
 	him despite her fathers excellent advice not to do

which has never been quoted to my knowledge by any anything of the kind-when she would and did marry
american- if we except perhaps the author of the him i say will i nill i it was with her beautiful black

curiosities of american literaturehaving had
occasion i say to turn over some pages of the first-

 eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would
 allow

mentioned very remarkable work  was not a little it it seems however that this politic damsel who

astonished to discover that the literary world has hither-
to been strangely in error respecting the fate of the
viziers daughter scheherazade as that fate is depicted
in the arabian nights and that the denouement
there given if not altogether inaccurate as far as it
goes is at least to blame in not having gone very much
farther

  for full information on this interesting topic i must
refer the inquisitive reader to the isitsoornot itself
but in the mean time i shall be pardoned for giving
a summary of what i there discovered

  it will be remembered that in the usual version of

had been reading machiavelli beyond doubt had a
very ingenious little plot in her mind on the night
of the wedding she contrived upon i forget what
specious pretense to have her sister occupy a couch
sufficiently near that of the royal pair to admit of easy
conversation from bed to bed  and a little before cock-
crowing she took care to awaken the good monarch
her husband who bore her none the worse will because
he intended to wring her neck on the morrow-she
managed to awaken him i say although on account of
a capital conscience and an easy digestion he slept
i well by the profound interest of a story about a

the tales a certain monarch having good cause to be	 rat and a black cat i think which she was narrating

jealous of bis queen not only puts her to death but	all in an undertone of course to her sister when

makes a vow by his beard and the prophet to espouse	the day broke it so happened that this history was not

each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions	altogether finished and that scheherazade in the nature

and the next morning to
deliver her up to the exe-
cutioner

  having fulfilled this vow
for many years to the let-
ter and with a religious
punctuality and method that
conferred great credit upon
him as a man of devout
feelings and excellent sense
he was interrupted one
afternoon no doubt at his -----
prayers by a visit from his grand vizier to whose
daughter it appears there had occurred an idea

  her name was scheherazade and her idea was that
she would either redeem the land from the depopulat-
ing tax upon its beauty or perish after the approved
fashion of all heroines in the attempt

  accordingly and although we do not find it to be
leap-year which makes the sacrifice more meritorious
she deputes her father the grand vizier to make an
offer to the king of her hand this hand the king
eagerly accepts-he had intended to take it at all events
and had put off the matter from day to day only
through fear of the vizier-but in accepting it now
he gives all parties very distinctly to understand that

 of things could not finish it

		just then since it was high

tihey tee realise that this story teas written nearly time for her to get up and
 years ago we must marvel at the extraordinary
fertile imagination of poe poe was probably the inventor	strunfe a thing very

of scientifiction  as we know it today and just because little more pleasant than
the story was written almost a century ago certainly docs hanging only a trifle more
not make it less valuable on the contrary it becomes more enteel 
valuable as lime passes it is just as applicable to the mod-  tp l-inp-c rnrinsitv
ern man zvho is mostly in the fog about what goes on 	  t

around him in science today as his predecessors were a ever prevailing  am
century ago	sorry to say even over his

------------------------- -  sound religious principles

                           induced him for this once to
postpone the fulfillment of his vow until next morning
for the purpose and with the hope of hearing that night
how it fared in the end with the black cat a black cat
i think it was and the rat his curiosity was that
much aroused

the night having arrived however the lady sche-
herazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black
cat and the rat the rat was blue but before she well
knew what she was about found herself deep in the
intricacies of a narration having reference if i am
not altogether mistaken to a pink horse with green
wings that went in a violent manner by clockwork
and was wound up with an indigo key with this
history the king was even more profoundly interested


scheherazade relates the thousand-and-second tale to the caliph-being the astounding adventures of sinbad on the fierce monster
of the sea going to strange lands-thus relieving temporarily at least the tax on the female beauty of her land




amazing stories

 thap with the other-and as the day broke before its
 conclusion notwithstanding all the queens endeavors
 to get through with it in time for the bowstringing
 there was again no resource but to postpone that cere-
 mony as before for twenty-four hours the next
 night there happened a similar accident with a similar
 result and then the next-and then again the next
 so that in the end the good monarch having been
 unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his
 vow during a period of no less than one thousand and
 one nights either forgets it altogether by the expira-
 tion of this time or gets himself absolved of it in the
 regular way or what is more probable breaks it out-
 right as well as the head of his father confessor at
 all events scheherazade who being lineally descended
 from eve fell heir perhaps to the whole seven baskets
 of talk which the latter lady we all know picked up
 from under the trees in the garden of eden schehera-
 zade i say finally triumphed and the tariff upon beauty
 was repealed

   now this conclusion which is that of the story as
 we have it upon record is no doubt excessively proper
 and pleasant-but alas like a great many pleasant
 things is more pleasant than true and i am indebted
 altogether to the isitsoornot for the means of cor-
 recting the error le mieux says a french proverb
 cst iennemi du bien and in mentioning that sche-
 herazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk i
 should have added that she put them out at compound
 interest until they amounted to seventy-seven

   my dear sister said she on the thousand-and-
 second night i quote the language of the isitsoornot
 at this point verbatim my dear sister said she
 now that all this little difficulty about the bowstring
 has blown over and that this odious tax is so happily
 repealed i feel that i have been guilty of great indis-
 cretion in withholding from you and the king who

 i am sorry to say snores-a thing no gentleman would
 do the full conclusion of the history of sinbad the
 sailor this person went through numerous other and
 more interesting adventures than those which i related
 but the truth is i felt sleepy on the particular night
 of their narration and so was seduced into cutting
 i them short-a grievous piece of misconduct for which
 i only trust that allah will forgive me but even yet
 it is not too late to remedy my great neglect-and as
 soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order
 to wake him up so far that he may stop making that
 horrible noise i will forthwith entertain you and him
 if he pleases with the sequel of this very remarkable
 story

 hereupon the sister of scheherazade as i have
 it from the isitsoornot expressed no very par-
 ticular intensity of gratification but the king having
 been sufficiently pinched at length ceased snoring and
 finally said hum and then hoo when the queen
 understanding these words which are no doubt arabic
 to signify that be was all attention and would do his
 best not to snore any more-the queen i say having
 arranged these matters to her satisfaction re-entered
 thus at once into the history of sinbad the sailor

  at length in my old age these are the words of

  sinbad himself as retailed by scheherazade- at
 length in my old age and after enjoying many years of
 tranquility at home i became once more possessed with
 a desire of visiting foreign countries and one day
 without acquainting any of my family with my design i
 packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was
 most precious and least bulky and engaging a porter
 to carry them went with him down to the sea-shore
 to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might
 convey me out of the kingdom into some region which
 i had not as yet explored

    having deposited the packages upon the sands we
sat down beneath some trees and looked out into the
ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship but during
several hours we saw none whatever at length i
fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or hum-
ming sound-and the porter after listening awhile
declared that he also could distinguish it presently
it grew louder and then still louder so that we could
have no doubt that the object which caused it was
approaching us at length on the edge of the horizon
we discovered a black spot which rapidly increased
in size until we made it out to be a vast monster swim-
ming with a great part of its body above the surface
of the sea it came toward us with inconceivable
swiftness throwing up huge waves of foam around
its breast and illuminating all that part of the sea
through which it passed with a long line of fire that
extended far off into the distance

    as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly
 its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest
 trees that grow and it was as wide as the great hall
 of audience in your palace o most sublime and munifi-
 cent of the caliphs its body which was unlike that
 of ordinary fishes was as solid as a rock and of a
 jetty blackness throughout all that portion of it which
 floated above the water with the exception of a narrow
 blood-red streak that completely begirdled it the
 belly which floated beneath the surface and of which
 we could get only a glimpse now and then as the mon-
 ster rose and fell with the billows was entirely covered
 with metallic scales of a color like that of the moon
 in misty weather the back was flat and nearly white
 and from it there extended upward of six spines about
 half the length of the whole body

    this horrible creature had no mouth that we could
 perceive but as if to make up for this deficiency it
 was provided with at least four score of eyes that
 protruded from their sockets like those of the green
 dragon-fly and were arranged all around the body in
 two rows one above the other and parallel to the
 blood-red streak which seemed to answer the purpose
 of an eyebrow two or three of these dreadful eyes
 were much larger than the others and had the appear-
 ance of solid gold

   although this beast approached us as i have
before said with the greatest rapidity it must have
been moved altogether by necromancy-for it had
neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck nor
wings like the sea-shell which is blown along in the
manner of a vessel nor yet did it writhe itself for-
ward as do the eels its head and its tail were shaped
precisely alike only not far from the latter were two
the thousand-and-second tale



 small holes that served for nostrils and through which
 the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious
 violence and with a shrieking disagreeable noise

   our terror at beholding this hideous thing was
very great-but it was even surpassed by our astonish-
ment when upon getting a nearer look we perceived
upon the creatures back a vast number of animals about
the size and shape of men and altogether much re-
sembling them except that they wore no garments as
men do being supplied by nature no doubt with
an ugly uncomfortable covering a good deal like cloth
but fitting so tight to the skin as to render the poor
wretches laughably awkward and put them apparently
to severe pain on the very tips of their heads were
certain square-looking boxes which at first sight i
thought might have been intended to answer as tur-
bans but i soon discovered that they were excessively
heavy and solid and i therefore concluded they were
contrivances designed by their great weight to keep
the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their
shoulders around the necks of the creatures were
fastened black collars badges of servitude no doubt
such as we keep on our dogs only much wider and
infinitely stiffer-so that it was quite impossible for
these poor victims to move their heads in any direction
without moving the body at the same time and thus
they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their
noses-a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful if
not positively in an awful degree

   when the monster had nearly reached the shore
where we stood it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes
to a great extent and emitted from it a terrible flash
of fire accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke and a
noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder as
the smoke cleared away we saw one of the odd man-
animals standing near the head of the large beast with
a trumpet in his hand through which putting it to his
mouth he presently addressed us in loud harsh and
disagreeable accents that perhaps we should have
mistaken for language had they not come altogether
through the nose

    being thus evidently spoken to i was at a loss how
to reply as i could in no manner understand what was
said and in this difficulty i turned to the porter who
was near swooning through affright and demanded of
him his opinion as to what species of monster it was
what it wanted and what kind of creatures those were
that so swarmed upon its back to this the porter re-
plied as well as he could for trepidation that he had
once before heard of this sea-beast that it was a cruel
demon with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire created
by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon
mankind that the things upon its back were vermin
such as sometimes infest cats and dogs only a little
larger and more savage and that these vermin had
their uses however evil-for through the torture they
caused the beast by their nibblings and stingings it
was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requi-
site to make it roar and commit ill and so fulfill the
 vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii

  this account determined me to take to my heels
and without once even looking behind me i ran at
full speed up into the hills while the porter ran equally

fast although nearly in an opposite direction so that
by these means he finally made his escape with my
bundles of which i have no doubt he took excellent
care-although this is a point i cannot determine as
i do not remember that i ever beheld him again

   for myself i was so hotly pursued by a swarm
of the men-vermin who had come to the shore in
boats that i was very soon overtaken bound hand and
foot and conveyed to the beast which immediately
swam out again into the middle of the sea

    i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a com-
fortable home to peril my life in such adventures as
this but regret being useless i made the best of my
condition and exerted myself to secure the good-will
of the man-animal that owned the trumpet and who
appeared to exercise authority over his fellows i suc-
ceeded so well in this endeavor that in a few days the
creature bestowed upon me various tokens of its favor
and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me
the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denomi-
nate its language so that at length i was enabled to
converse with it readily and came to make it compre-
hend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world

    washisli squashish squeak sinbad hcy-diddle did-
dle grunt unt grumble hiss fiss whiss said he to me
one day after dinner-but i beg a thousand pardons i
had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with
the dialect of the cock-neighs so the man-animals were
called i presume because their language formed the
connecting link between that of the horse and that of
the rooster with your permission i will translate
washish squashish and so forth-that is to say i
am happy to find my dear sinbad that you are really
a very excellent fellow we are now about doing a
thing which is called circumnavigating the globe and
since you are so desirous of seeing the world i will
strain a point and give you a free passage upon the
back of the beast 

  when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus
far relates the isitsoornot the king turned over
from his left side to his right and said-

   it is in fact very surprising my dear queen that
you omitted hitherto these latter adventures of sinbad
do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining
and strange

   the king having thus expressed himself we are told
the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the fol-
lowing words-

   sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative-
i thanked the man-animal for its kindness and soon
found myself very much at home on the beast which
swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean although
the surface of the latter is in that part of the world
by no means flat but round like a pomegranate so that
we went-so to say-either up hill or down hill all the
time 

   that i think was very singular interrupted the
king

   nevertheless it is quite true replied scheherazade
i have my doubts rejoined the king but pray be
so good as to go on with the story

   i will said the queen  the beast continued
sinbad swam as i have related up hill and down hill
	amazing stories

until at length we arrived at an island many hundreds
of miles in circumference but which nevertheless had
been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little
things like caterpillars

  hum said the king

   leaving this island said sinbad-for schehera-
zade it must be understood took no notice of her hus-
bands ill-mannered ejaculation-leaving this island
we came to another where the forests were of solid
stone and so hard that they shivered to pieces the
finest-tempered axes with which we endeavored to cut
them down 

  hum said the king again but scheherazade pay-
ing him no attention continued in the language of sin-
bad

   passing beyond this last island we reached a
country where there was a cave that ran to the distance
of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth
and that contained a greater number of far more spa-
cious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found
in all damascus and bagdad from the rooms of these
palaces there hung myriads of gems like diamonds
but larger than men and in among the streets of tow-
ers and pyramids and temples there flowed immense
rivers as black as ebony and swarming with fish that
had no eyes 

  hum said the king

  we then swam into a region of the sea where we
found a lofty mountain down whose sides there
streamed torrents of melted metal some of which were
twelve miles wide and sixty miles long while from

    the coralites

   one of the most remarkable natural curiosities in texas is
a petrified forest near the head of pasigno river it consists
of several hundred trees in an erect position all turned to
stone several trees now growing are partly petrified this is
a startling fact for natural philosophers and must cause them to
modify the existing theory of petrifaction-kennedy

  	his account at first discredited has since been corroborated
by the discovery of a completely petrified forest near the head-
waters of the chayenne or chienne river which has its source
in the black hills of the rocky chain

  there is scarcely perhaps a spectacle on the surface of the
globe more remarkable either in a geological or picturesque
point of view than that presented by the petrified forest near
cairo the traveler having passed the tombs of the caliphs
just beyond the gates of the city proceeds to the southward
nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to suez and
after having traveled some ten miles up a low barren valley
covered with sand gravel and sea-shells fresh as if the tide had
retired but yesterday crosses a low range of sandhills which
has for some distance run parallel to his path the scene now
presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate a
mass of fragments of trees all converted into stone and when
struck by his horses hoof ringing like cast iron is seen to ex-
tend itself for miles and miles around him in the form of a
decayed and prostrate forest the wood is of a dark brown
hue but retains its form in perfection the pieces being from one
to fifteen feet in length and from half a foot to three feet
in thickness strewed so closely together as far as the eye can
reach that an egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its wav
through amongst them and so natural that were it in scotland
or ireland it might pass without remark for some enormous
drained bog on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun
the roots and rudiments of the branches are in many cases
nearly perfect and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark
are readily recognizable the most delicate of the sap vessels
and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood are per-
fectly entire and bear to be examined with the strongest mag-
nifiers the whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch
glass and are capable of receiving the highest polish-asiatic
magazine

   the mammoth cave of kentucky

   in iceland 

an abyss on the summit issued so vast a quantity of
ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the
heavens and it became darker than the darkest mid-
night so that when we were even at the distance of
a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain it was
impossible to see the whitest object however close we
held it to our eyes  
hum said the king

   after quitting this coast the beast continued his
voyage until we met with a land in which the nature
of things seemed reversed-for we here saw a great
lake at the bottom of which more than a hundred feet
beneath the surface of the water there flourished in
full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees  c
hoo said the king

   some hundred miles farther on brought us to a
climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sus-
tain iron or steel just as our own does feathers 
fiddle de dee said the king

proceeding still in the same direction we
t presently arrived at the most magnificent re-
gions in the whole world through it there meandered
a glorious river for several thousands of miles this
river was of unspeakable depth and of a transparency
richer than that of amber it was from three to six

to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height were
crowned with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual
sweet-scented flowers that made the whole territory
one gorgeous garden but the name of this luxuriant
land was the kingdom of horror and to enter it was
inevitable death 
humph said the king

   we left this kingdom in great haste and after
some days came to another where we were astonished
to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns
resembling scythes upon their heads these hideous
beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil of
a funnel shape and line the sides of them with rocks
so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly
when trodden upon by other animals thus precipitating
them into the monsters dens where their blood is im-
mediately sucked and their carcasses afterwards hurled

   continuing our progress we perceived a district
abounding with vegetables that grew not upon any
soil but in the air there were others that sprang
from the substance of other vegetables others that
derived their substance from the bodies of living ani-
mals  and then again there were others that glowed
all over with intense fire others that moved from
place to place at pleasure and what is still more won-
derful we discovered flowers that lived and breathed
and moved their limbs at will and had moreover the
detestable passion of mankind for enslaving other crea-
tures and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons
until the fulfilment of appointed tasks  

  pshaw  said the king

   quitting this land we soon arrived at another in
which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such
genius and erudition that they give daily instructions
in the science of geometry to the wise men of the em-

for the solution of two very difficult problems they
were solved upon the spot-the one by the bees and
the other by the birds but the king keeping their solti-

growing at the foot of the rata tree with a plant growing out
of its head this most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels
up both the rata and perriri trees and entering into the top eats
its way perforating the trunk of the tree until it reaches the
root it then comes out of the root and dies or remains dormant
and the plant propagates out of its head the body remains per-

   the corolla of this flower aristolochia cleinatitis which
is tubular but terminating upward in a ligulate limb is inflated
into a globular figure at the base the tubular part is internally
beset with stiff hairs pointing downward the globular part
contains the pistil which consists merely of a germcn and
stigma together with the surrounding stamens but the
stamens being shorter than even the germen cannot discharge
the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma as the flower stands
always upright till after impregnation and hence without
some additional and peculiar aid the pollen must necessarily
fall down to the bottom of the flower now the aid that nature
has furnished in this case is that of the tiputa peimicornis a
small insect which entering the tube of the corolla in quest of
honey descends to the bottom and rummages about till it be-
comes quite covered with pollen but not being able to force its
way out again owing to the downward position of the hairs
which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap and
being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes back-
ward and forward trying every corner till after repeatedly
traversing the stigma it covers it with pollen sufficient for its
impregnation in consequence of which the flower soon begins to
droop and the hairs to shrink to the side of the tube affecting
an easy passage for the escape of the insect-rev p keith

tion a secret it was only after the most profound re-
searches and labor and the writing of an infinity of
big books during a long series of years that the men-
mathematicians at length arrived at the identical solu-
tions which had been given upon the spot by the bees
and by the birds  

  oh my said the king

   we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we
found ourselves close upon another from whose shores
there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in
breadth and two hundred and forty miles long so that
although they flew a mile during every minute it re-
quired no less than four hours for the whole flock to
pass over us-in which there were several millions of
millions of fowls  

  oh fy said the king

  no sooner had we got rid of these birds which
occasioned us great annoyance than we were terrified
by the appearance of a fowl of another kind and in-
finitely larger than even the rocs which i met in my
former voyages for it was bigger than the biggest of
the domes on your seraglio oh most munificent of
caliphs this terrible fowl had no head that we could
perceive but was fashioned entirely of belly which was
of a prodigious fatness and roundness of a soft-look-
ing substance smooth shining and striped with vari-
ous colors in its talons the monster was bearing away
to his eyrie in the heavens a house from which it had
knocked off the roof and in the interior of which we
distinctly saw human beings who beyond doubt were
in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which
awaited them we shouted with all our might in the
hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey
but it merely gave a snort or puff as if of rage and
then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved
to be filled with sand   

  stuff said the king

   it was just after this adventure that we encoun-
tered a continent of immense extent and of prodigious
solidity but which nevertheless was supported entirely
upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer than
four hundred horns  

  the bees-ever since bees were-have been constructing
their cells with just such sides in just such number and at just
such inclinations as it has been demonstrated in a problem
involving the profoundest mathematical principles are the very
sides in the very number and at the very angles which will
afford the creatures the most room that is compatible with the
greatest stability of structure

  during the latter part of the last century the question arose
among mathematicians-to determine the best form that can be
given to the sails of a windmill according to their varying dis-
tances from the revolving vanes and likewise from the centres
ot the revolution this is an excessively complex problem for
ls  other words to find the best possible position at an
infinity of varied distances and at an infinity of points on the
arm there were a thousand futile attempts to answer the query
on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians and when
at length an undeniable solution was discovered men found that
the wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever
since the first bird had traversed the air

   he observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt frankfort
and the indiana territory one mile at least in breadth it took
up four hours in passing which at the rate of one mile per
minute gives a length of  miles and supposing three pigeons
to each square yard gives  pigeons-travels in

amazing stories

  that now i believe said the king because i have
read something of the kind before in a book

   we passed immediately beneath this continent
swimming in between the legs of the cow and after
some hours found ourselves in a wonderful country
indeed which i was informed by the man-anima a-as
his own native land inhabited by things of his own
species this elevated the man-animal very much in
my esteem and in fact i now began to feel ashamed
of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had
treated him for i found that the man-animals in gen-
eral were a nation of the most powerful magicians who
lived with worms in their brain which no doubt
served to stimulate them by their painful writhings
and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of
imagination 

  nonsense said the king

  among the magicians were domesticated several
animals of very singular kinds for example there was
a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood
was boiling water in place of corn he had black stones
for his usual food and yet in spite of so hard a diet
he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load
more weighty than the grandest temple in this city at
a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds  

  twattle said the king

   i saw also among these people a hen without
feathers but bigger than a camel instead of flesh and
bone she had iron and brick her blood like that of the
horse to whom in fact she was nearly related was
boiling water and like him she ate nothing but wood
or black stones this hen brought forth very fre-
quently a hundred chickens in the day and after birth
they took up their residence for several weeks within
the stomach of their mother 

  fal lal said the king

   one of this nation of mighty conjurors created a
man out of brass and wood and leather and endowed
him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at
chess all the race of mankind with the exception of the
great caliph haroun alraschid another of these
magi constructed of like material a creature that put
to shame even the genius of him who made it for so
great were its reasoning powers that in a second it per-
formed calculations of so vast an extent that they would
have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy
men for a year but a still more wonderful conjuror
fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither
man nor beast but which had brains of lead intermixed
with a blade matter like pitch and fingers that it em-
ployed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it
would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thou-
sand copies of the koran in an hour and this was so
exquisite a precision that in all the copies there should
not be found one to vary from another by the breadth

of the finest hair this thing was of prodigious
strength so that it erected or overthrew the mightiest
empires at a breath but its powers were exercised
equally for evil and for good 

   ridiculous said the king

    among this nation of necromancers there was also
one who had in his veins the blood of the salamanders
for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his
chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was thor-
oughly roasted upon its floor another had the
faculty of converting the common metals into gold
without even looking at them during the process an-
other had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire
so fine as to be invisible another had such quickness
of perception that he counted all the separate motions
of an elastic body while it was springing backward and
forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times
in a second  

   absurd said the king

    another of these magicians by means of a fluid
that nobody ever yet saw could make the corpses of his
friends brandish their arms kick out their legs fight or
even get up and dance at his will another had culti-
vated his voice to so great an extent that he could have
made himself heard from one end of the earth to the
other another had so long an arm that he could sit
down in damascus and indite a letter at bagdad-or
indeed at any distance whatsoever another com-
manded the lightning to come down to him out of the
heavens and it came at his call and served him for a
plaything when it came another took two loud sounds
and out of them made a silence another constructed a
deep darkness out of two brilliant lights another
made ice in a red-hot furnace another directed the

to one-ray only but a multiple by  c gives the result
of total darkness in violet rays similar effects arise when the
difference in length is  of an inch and with all other

   the wives and daughters of these incomparably
great and wise magi  continued scheherazade without
being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and
most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her
husband- the wives and daughters of these eminent
conjurors are everything that is accomplished and re-
fined  and would be everything that is interesting and
beautiful but for an unhappy fatality that besets them
and from which not even the miraculous powers of
their husbands and fathers has hitherto been adequate

if they had been annihilated  or  years ago we might
still see them to-day by the light which started from their
surfaces  or  years in the past time that many which
we see daily are really extinct is not impossible-not even
improbable

to save some fatalities come in certain shapes and
some in others-but this of which i speak has come in

the shape of a crochet 

  a what  said the king

   a crochet  said scheherazade  one of the evil
genii who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill
has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies
that the thing which we describe as personal beauty
consists altogether in the protruberance of the region
which lies not very far below the small of the back
perfection of loveliness they say is in the direct ratio
of the extent of this hump having been long possessed
of this idea and bolsters being cheap in that country
the days have long gone by since it was possible to dis-
tinguish a woman from a dromedary- 

  stop said the king-i cant stand that and i
wont you have already given me a dreadful headache
with your lies the day too i perceive is beginning to
break how long have we been married-my con-
science is getting to be troublesome again and then
that dromedary touch-do you take me for a fool
upon the whole you might as well get up and be
throttled

  these words as i learn from the isitsoornot both
grieved and astonished scheherazade but as she knew
the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity and quite
unlikely to forfeit his word she submitted to her fate
with good grace she derived however great conso-
lation during the tightening of the bowstring from
the reflection that much of the history remained still
untold and that the petulance of her brute of a husband
had reaped for him a most righteous reward in depriv-
ing him of many inconceivable adventures

bays to come

  by ji  wells

                   what has gone before

ivres-for that -was the correct stelling for mor-
ris the title had also disappeared in the distant cen-
tury of the future about which this story is written-
being a fitting descendant of a very proper and sensible ancestor
did everything just and proper-according to his time of course
he learned all he needed to learn by means of the phonograph
and continued to get his daily news etc by the same method
the last vestige of romance had been almost completely elimi-
nated everything went on in a perfectly ordered routine
everybody was happy in those days hypnotists were doing
much work

  elisabeth mwres daughter was of a decidedly romantic
bent particularly after she met and fell in love with young
denton a romanticist of the deepest hue although he was a
mere attendant on a flying-machine stage a marriage be-
tween these tivo young people ivas from the fathers point of
view manifestly undesirable especially as he had intended her
to marry bind on a very correct and sensible fellow of good
means and high standing in the community

  a hypnotist finally prevails over elisabeth by a clever ruse
to allow herself to be hypnotised and is made to forget that she
ever kneiv denton or romance and to concentrate her inter-
est on bindon denton heartbroken because elisabeth knows
him no longer goes to the same hypnotist for help there he

inadvertently learns that elisabeth had been hypnotised out of
iter love for him by the same hypnotist and he manages after a
strangely violent struggle to get elisabeth back

  they decide to get married and run away to the country until
elisabeth becomes of age and can get the use of her inheri-
tance tor a few days the deserted country seems an ideal
place and sleeping on the ground in the open is romantic but
the first real rainstorm makes them change their minds a little
and an attack on them by half a dosen shepherd dogs decides
them to retrace their steps back to the city and borroiv on
elisabeths prospects

  for three years they are very happy together with their baby
girl but when elisabeth comes of age and accounts are fig-
ured they learn that the interest on the borrowed money has
eaten up practically all of it and denton must look for a job
some unseen force operates against a successful search they
sell their household goods move into cheaper quarters and even
bring their baby to the creche-a kind of childrens nursery on
an enormous scale finally there is one thing left-the labor
company-an institution which provides a days board and lodg-
ing with an occasional extra penny or hvo-in return for a
days work

  and so one day they are forced to report to this labor com-
pany and don the blue denim of this lowest class of workers

 the stars one may reach upward
ouch resignation whatever the evil
may be but in the heat and stress of
lys work we lapse again come disgust
niger and intolerable moods how
little is all our magnanimity-an accident a phase the
very saints of old had first to flee the world and
denton and his elizabeth could not flee their world no
longer were there open roads to unclaimed lands where
men might live freely-however hardly-and keep their
souls in peace the city had
swallowed up mankind

  for a time these two
labor serfs were kept at
their original occupations
she at her brass-stamping
and denton at his press
and then came a move for
him that brought with it
fresh and still bitterer ex-
periences of life in the un-
derways of the great city

he was transferred to the
care of a rather more elabo-
rate press in the central factory of the london tile
trust

in this new situation he had to work in a long vaulted

room with a number of other men for the most part
born labor serfs he came to this intercourse re-
luctantly his upbringing had been refined and until
his ill fortune had brought him to that costume he had
never spoken in his life except by way of command or
some immediate necessityto the white-faced wearers of
the blue canvas now at last came contact he had
to work beside them share their tools eat with them
to both elizabeth and himself this seemed a further
degradation

  his taste would have seemed extreme to a man of
the nineteenth century but slowly and inevitably in
the intervening years a gulf had opened between the
wearers of the blue canvas and the classes above a

difference not simply of cir-
cumstances and habits of
life but of habits of
thought-even of language
the underways had devel-
oped a dialect of their own
above too had arisen a
dialect a code of thought
a language of culture
which aimed by a sedulous
search after fresh distinc-
tion to widen perpetually
the space between itself and
vulgarity the bond of
a common faith moreover no longer held the race to-
gether the last years of the nineteenth century were
distinguished by the rapid development among the pros-

 v the concluding chapters of this story wells spins a
 most interesting and illuminating tale while we may
 not like all that he has to say about the future it begins to
 look more and more as though he might be right and time
 only will tell whether he was  right when he wrote this
 story those of us zvho contemplate the future as a place
 where none of us will have to work and where we all will
 be glorified loafers are probably due for sad disappointment
 the idea certainly does not seem to be held by wells nor is
 it borne out in modern day by day progress at any rate
 you will follow the story with a good deal of interest

amazing stories

perous idle of esoteric perversions of the popular reli-
gion  glosses and interpretations that reduced the broad
teachings of the carpenter of nazareth to the exquisite
narrowness of their lives and in spite of their inclina-
tion towards the ancient fashion of living neither eliza-
beth nor denton had been sufficiently original to escape
the suggestion of their surroundings in matters of
common behavior they had followed the ways of their
class and so when they fell at last to be labor serfs
it seemed to them almost as though they were falling
among offensive inferior animals they felt as a nine-
teenth-century duke and duchess might have felt who
were forced to take rooms in the jago

  their natural impulse was to maintain a distance
but dentons first idea of a dignified isolation from
his new surroundings was soon rudely dispelled he
had imagined that his fall to the position of a labor
serf was the end of his lesson that when their little
daughter had died he had plumbed the deeps of life
but indeed these things were only the beginning life
demands something more from us than acquiescence
and now in a roomful of machine minders he was to
learn a wider lesson to make the acquaintance of an-
other factor in life a factor as elemental as the loss of
things dear to us more elemental even than toil

  his quiet discouragement of conversation was an
immediate cause of offense-was interpreted rightly
enough i fear as disdain his ignorance of the vulgar
dialect a thing upon which he had hitherto prided
himself suddenly took upon itself a new aspect he
failed to perceive at once that his reception of the
coarse and stupid but genially intended remarks that
greeted his appearance must have stung the makers of
these advances like blows in their faces dont under-
stand he said rather coldly and at hazard no thank
you

  the man who had addressed him stared scowled
and turned away

  a second who also failed at dentons unaccustomed
ear took the trouble to repeat his remark and denton
discovered he was being offered the use of an oil can
he expressed polite thanks and this second man em-
barked upon a penetrating conversation denton he
remarked had been a swell and he wanted to know
how he had come to wear the blue he clearly expected
an interesting record of vice and extravagance had
denton ever been at a pleasure city denton was
speedily to discover how the existence of these won-
derful places of delight permeated and defiled the
thought and honor of these unwilling hopeless workers
of the underworld

  his aristocratic temperament resented these ques-
tions he answered no curtly the man persisted
with a still more personal question and this time it
was denton who turned away

   gorblimey said his interlocutor much astonished
hes a swell

  it presently forced itself upon dentons mind that
this remarkable conversation was being repeated in
indignant tones to more sympathetic hearers and that
it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter
they looked at denton with manifestly enhanced in-
terest a curious perception of isolation dawned upon

him he tried to think of his press and its unfamiliar
peculiarities   

the machines kept everybody pretty busy during
the first spell and then came a recess it was
only an interval for refreshment too brief for any
one to go out to a labor company dining-room den-
ton followed his fellow-workers into a short gallery
in which were a number of bins of refuse from the
presses

  each man produced a packet of food dfenton had
no packet the manager a careless young man who
held his position by influence had omitted to warn
denton that it was necessary to apply for this provi-
sion he stood apart feeling hungry the others
drew together in a group and talked in undertones
glancing at him ever and again he became uneasy
his appearance of disregard cost him an increasing
effort he tried to think of the levers of his new
press

  presently one a man much shorter but much
broader and stouter than denton came forward to
him denton turned to him as unconcernedly as pos-
sible here said the delegate- as denton judged
him to be-extending a cube of bread in a not too
clean hand he had a swart broad-nosed face and
his mouth hung down towards one corner

  denton felt doubtful for the instant whether this
was meant for civility or insult his impulse was to
decline no thanks he said and at the mans
change of expression im not hungry

  there came a laugh from the group behind told
you so said the man who had offered denton the
loan of an oil can hes top side he is you aint
good enough for im

  the swart face grew a shade darker

  here said its owner still extending the bread
and speaking in a lower tone you got to eat this
see

  denton looked into the threatening face before him
and odd little currents of energy seemed to be run-
ning through his limbs and body

  i dont want it he said trying a pleasant smile
that twitched and failed

  the thickset man advanced his face and the bread
became a physical threat in his hand dentons mind
rushed together to the one problem of his antagonists
eyes

  eat it said the swart man

  there came a pause and then they both moved
quickly the cube of bread described a complicated
path a curve that would have ended in dentons face
and then his fist hit the wrist of the hand that gripped
it and it flew upward and out of the conflict-its
part played

  he stepped back quickly fists clenched and arms
tense the hot dark countenance receded became an
alert hostility watching its chance denton for one
instant felt confident and strangely buoyant and
serene his heart beat quickly he felt his body
alive and glowing to the tips

  scrap boys shouted some one and then the dark
figure had leapt forward ducked back and sideways
a story of the days to come



and come in again denton struck out and was hit
one of his eyes seemed to him to be demolished and
he felt a soft lip under his fist just before he was
hit again-this time under the chin a huge fan of
fiery needles shot open he had a momentary per-
suasion that his head was knocked to pieces and then
something hit his head and back from behind and the
fight became an uninteresting an impersonal thing

  he was aware that time-seconds or minutes-had
passed abstract uneventful time he was lying with
his head in a heap of ashes and something wet and
warm ran swiftly into his neck the first shock
broke up into discrete sensations all his head
throbbed his eye and his chin throbbed exceedingly
and the taste of blood was in his mouth

  hes all right said a voice hes opening his
eyes

  serve him - well right said a second

  his mates were standing about him he made an
effort and sat up he put his hand to the back of
his head and his hair was wet and full of cinders a
laugh greeted the gesture his eye was partially
closed he perceived what had happened his mo-
mentary anticipation of a final victory had vanished

  looks surprised said some one

   ave any more  said a wit and then imitating
dentons refined accent

  no thank you

  denton perceived the swart man with a blood-stained
handkerchief before his face and somewhat in the
background

  wheres that bit of bread hes got to eat said a
little ferret-faced creature and sought with his foot in
the ashes of the adjacent bin

  denton had a moment of internal debate he knew
the code of honor requires a man to pursue a fight he
has begun to the bitter end but this was his first taste
of the bitterness he was resolved to rise again but
he felt no passionate impulse it occurred to him-
and the thought was no very violent spur-that he was
perhaps after all a coward for a moment his will
was heavy a lump of lead

   ere it is said the little ferret-faced man and
stooped to pick up a cindery cube he looked at den-
ton then at the others

  slowly unwillingly denton stood up

  a dirty-faced albino extended a hand to he ferret-
faced man gimme that toke he said he advanced
threateningly bread in hand to denton so you aint
ad your bellyful yet he said eh

  now it was coming no i havent said denton
with a catching of the breath and resolved to try this
brute behind the ear before he himself got stunned
again he knew he would be stunned again he was
astonished how ill he had judged himself beforehand
a few ridiculous lunges and down he would go again
he watched the albinos eyes the albino was grin-
ning confidently like a man who plans an agreeable
trick a sudden perception of impending indignities
stung denton

  you leave im alone jim said the swart man sud-

 	toke is an english slang word meaning food especially
 bread

denly over the blood-stained rag he aint done
nothing to you

  the albinos grin vanished he stopped he looked
from one to the other it seemed to denton that the
swart man demanded the privilege of his destruction
the albino would have been better

  you leave im alone said the swart mail see
es ad is licks

clattering bell lifted up its voice and solved
the situation the albino hesitated lucky for
you he said adding a foul metaphor and turned with
the others towards the press-room again wait for
the end of the spell mate said the albino over his
shoulder-an afterthought the swart man waited for
the albino to precede him denton realized that he had
a reprieve

  the men passed towards an open door denton be-
came aware of his duties and hurried to join the tail
of the queue at the doorway of the vaulted gallery
of presses a yellow-uniformed labor policeman stood
ticking a card he had ignored the swart mans hemor-
rhage

  hurry up there he said to denton

  hello  he said at the sight of his facial disarray
whos been hitting you

  thats my affair said denton

  not if it spiles your work it aint said the man
in yellow you mind that

  denton made no answer he was a rough-a laborer
he wore the blue canvas the laws of assault and
battery he knew were not for the likes of him he
went to his press

  he could feel the skin of his brow and chin and
head lifting themselves to noble bruises felt the throb
and pain of each aspiring contusion his nervous sys-
tem slid down to lethargy at each movement in his
press adjustment he felt he lifted a weight and as for
his honor-that too throbbed and puffed how did
he stand what precisely had happened in the last
ten minutes what would happen next he knew
that here was enormous matter for thought and he
could not think save in disordered snatches

  his mood was a sort of stagnant astonishment all
his conceptions were overthrown he had regarded
his security from physical violence as inherent as one
of the conditions of life so indeed it had been while
he wore his middle-class costume had his middle-class
property to serve for his defense but who would
interfere among labor roughs fighting together and
indeed in those days no man would in the under-
world there was no law between man and man the law
and machinery of the state had become for them some-
thing that held men down fended them off from much
desirable property and pleasure and that was all
violence that ocean in which the brutes live forever
and from which a thousand dykes and contrivances
have won our hazardous civilized life had flowed in
again upon the sinking underways and submerged them
the fist ruled

  denton had come right down at last to the elemental
-fist and trick and the stubborn heart and fellowship-
even as it was in the beginning


amazing stories

  the rhythm of his machine changedand his thoughts
were interrupted

  presently he could think again strange how quickly
things had happened he bore these men who had
thrashed him no very vivid ill-will he was bruised
and enlightened lie saw with absolute fairness now
the reasonableness of his unpopularity he had behaved
like a fool disdain seclusion are the privilege of the
strong the fallen aristocrat still dinging to his point-
less distinction is surely the most pitiful creature of
pretense in all this claimant universe good heavens
what was there for him to despise in these men 

  what a pity he had not appreciated all this better
five hours ago

  what would happen at the end of the spell he
could not tell he could not imagine he could not
imagine the thoughts of these men he was sensible
only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy
vague possibilities of shame and violence chased one
another across his mind could he devise some weapon 
he recalled his assault upon the hypnotist but there
were no detachable lamps here he could see nothing
that he could catch up in his defense

  for a space he thought of a headlong bolt for the
security of the public ways directly the spell was over
apart from the trivial consideration of his self-respect
he perceived that this would be only a foolish postpone-
ment and aggravation of his trouble he perceived the
ferret-faced man and the albino talking together with
their eyes towards him presently they were talking
to the swart man who stood with his broad back studi-
ously towards denton

  at last came the end of the second spell the lender
of oil cans stopped his press sharply and turned round
wiping his mouth with the back of his hand his eyes
had the quiet expectation of one who seats himself in a
theatre

  now was the crisis and all the little nerves of den-
tons being seemed leaping and dancing he had decided
to show fight if any fresh indignity was offered him
he stopped his press and turned with an enormous
affectation of ease he walked down the vault and entered
the passage of the ash pits only to discover he had left
his jacket-which he had taken off because of the heat
of the vault-beside his press he walked back pie
met the albino eye to eye

  he heard the ferret-faced man in expostulation  e
reely ought eat it said the ferret-faced man  e
did reely

  no-you leave im alone said the swart man

apparently nothing further was to happen to
him that day he passed out to the passage and
staircase that led up to the moving platforms of the
city

  he emerged on the livid brilliance and streaming
movement of the public street he became acutely
aware of his disfigured faceand felt his swelling bruises
with a limp investigatory hand he went up to the
swiftest platform and seated himself on a labor com-
pany bench

  he lapsed into a pensive torpor the immediate dan-
gers and stresses of his position he saw with a sort of

static clearness what would they do to-morrow  he
could not tell what would elizabeth think of his
brutalization he could not tell he was exhausted
he was aroused presently by a hand upon his arm

  he looked up and saw the swart man seated beside
him he started surely he was safe from violence
in the public way

   the swart mans face retained no traces of his share
in the fight his expression was free from hostility-
seemed almost deferential  scuse me he said with
a total absence of truculence denton realized that no
assault was intended he stared awaiting the next
development

  it was evident the next sentence was premeditated
whad-i-was-going-to say-was this said the
swart man and sought through a silence for further
words

  whad-i-was-going-to say-was this he re-
peated

  finally he abandoned that gambit youre aw
right he cried laying a grimy hand on dentons grimy
sleeve youre aw right youre a geman sorry-
very sorry wanted to tell you that

  denton realized that there must exist motives be-
yond a mere impulse to abominable proceedings in the
man he meditated and swallowed an unworthy pride

  i did not mean to be offensive to you he said
in refusing that bit of bread

  meant it friendly said the swart man recalling
the scene but-in front of that blarsted whitey and
his snigger-well-i ad to scrap

  yes said denton with sudden fervor i was a
fool

  ah said the swart man with great satisfaction
thats aw right shake

  and denton shook

  the moving platform was rushing by the establish-
ment of a face moulder and its lower front was a huge
display of mirror designed to stimulate the thirst for
more symmetrical features denton caught the reflec-
tion of himself and his new friend enormously twisted
and broadened his own face was puffed one-sided
and blood-stained a grin of idiotic and insincere ami-
ability distorted its latitude a wisp of hair occluded
one eye the trick of the mirror presented the swart
man as a gross expansion of lip and nostril they
were linked by shaking hands then abruptly this vi-
sion passed-to return to memory in the anaemic medi-
tations of a waking dawn

  as he shook the swart man made some muddled
remark to the effect that he had always known he
could get on with a gentleman if one catne his way
he prolonged the shaking until denton under the influ-
ence of the mirror withdrew his hand the swart man
became pensive spat impressively on the platform and
resumed his theme

  whad i was going to say was this he said was
gravelled and shook his head at his foot

  denton became curious go on he said attentive

  the swart man took the plunge he grasped den-
tons arm became intimate in his attitude  scuse
me he said fact is you done know ozv to scrap
done know ozv to why-you done know ow to
a story of the days to come



begin youll get killed if you dont mind ouldin
your hands-there

  he reinforced his statement by objurgation watch-
ing the effect of each oath with a wary eye

  fr instance youre tall long arms you get a
longer reach than any one in the brasted vault gob-
blimey but i thought id got a tough on stead of
which    scuse me i wouldnt have it you if id
known its like fighting sacks tisnt right yr
arms seemed ung on ooks reglar-ung on ooks
there

  denton stared and then surprised and hurt his bat-
tered chin by a sudden laugh bitter tears came into
his eyes

   go on he said

  the swart man reverted to his formula he was
good enough to say he liked the look of denton thought
he had stood up amazing plucky onv pluck aint no
good-aint no brasted good--if you dont old your
ands

  whad i was going to say was this he said lem-
me show you ow to scrap jest lemme youre ig-
nant you aint no class but you might be a very decent
scrapper-very decent shown thats what i meant
to say

  denton hesitated but- he said i cant give you
anything-

  thats the geman all over said the swart man
who arst you to

  but your time

   if you dont get learnt scrapping youll get killed-
dont you make no bones of that

  denton thought i dont know he said

   he looked at the face beside him and all its native
coarseness shouted at him he felt a quick revulsion
from his transient friendliness it seemed to him in-
credible that it should be necessary for him to be
indebted to such a creature

  the chaps are always scrapping said the swart
man always and of course-if one gets waxy
and its you vital   

  by god cried denton i wish one would

  of course if you feel like that-

  you dont understand

  praps i dont said the swart man and lapsed
into a fuming silence

   when he spoke again his voice was less friendly and
he prodded denton by way of address look see
he said are you going to let me show you ow to
scrap 

  its tremendously kind of you said denton
but-

  there was a pause the swart man rose and bent
over denton

  too much geman he said-eh i got a red
face  by gosh you are-you arc a brasted fool
he turned away and instantly denton realized the
truth of this remark

the swart inan descended with dignity to a cross
way and denton after a momentary impulse to
pursuit remained on the platform for a time the
things that had happened filled his mind in one day

his graceful system of resignation had been shattered
beyond hope brute force the final the fundamental
had thrust its face through all his explanations and
glosses and consolations and grinned enigmatically
though he was hungry and tired he did not go on
directly to the labor hotel where he would meet
elizabeth he found he was beginning to think he
wanted very greatly to think and so wrapped in a
monstrous cloud of meditation he went the circuit of
the city on his moving platform twice you figure
him tearing through the glaring thunder-voiced city
at a pace of fifty miles an hour the city upon the planet
that spins along its chartless path through space many
thousands of miles an hour funking most terribly and
trying to understand why the heart and will in him
should suffer and keep alive

  when at last he came to elizabeth she was white
and anxious he might have noted she was in trouble
had it not been for his own preoccupation he feared
most that she would desire to know every detail of his
indignities that she would be sympathetic or indig-
nant he saw her eyebrows rise at the sight of him

  ive had rough handling he said and gasped its
too fresh-too hot i dont want to talk about it he
sat down with an unavoidable air of sullenness

  she stared at him in astonishment and as she read
something of the significant hieroglyphic of his battered
face her lips whitened her hand-it was thinner now
than in the days of their prosperity and her first finger
was a little altered by the metal punching she did-
clenched convulsively this horrible world she said
and said no more

  in these latter days they had become a very silent
couple they said scarcely a word to each other that
night but each followed a private train of thought in
the small hours as elizabeth lay awake denton started
up beside her suddenly-he had been lying as still as a
dead man

  i cannot stand it cried denton i will not
stand it

  she saw him dimly sitting up saw his arm lunge
as if in a furious blow at the enshrouding night then
for a space he was still

  it is too much-it is more than one can bear

  she could say nothing to her also it seemed that
this was as far as one could go she waited through
a long stillness she could see that denton sat with his
arms about his knees his chin almost touching them

  then he laughed

  no he said at last im going to stand it thats
the peculiar thing there isnt a grain of suicide in us
-not a grain i suppose all the people with a turn
that way have gone were going through with it-
to the end

  elizabeth thought grayly and realized that this also
was true

  were going through with it to think of all who
have gone through with it all the generations-endless
-endless little beasts that snapped and snaried
snapping and snarling snapping and snarling genera-
tion after generation

  his monotone ended abruptly resumed after a vast
interval


amazing stories

  there were ninety thousand years of stone age a
denton somewhere in all those years apostolic suc-
cession the grace of going through let me see
ninety-nine hundred-three nines twenty-seven-
three thousand generations of men-men more or less
and each fought and was bruised and shamed and
somehow held his own-going through with it-passing
it on    and thousands more to come perhaps-
thousands

  passing it on i wonder if they will thank us

  his voice assumed an argumentative note if one
could find something definite  if one could say
this is why-this is why it goes on   

  he became still and elizabeths eyes slowly separated
him from the darkness until at last she could see how
he sat with his head resting on his hand a sense of
the enormous remoteness of their minds came to her
that dim suggestion of another being seemed to her a
figure of their mutual understanding what could he
be thinking now what might he not say next an-
other age seemed to elapse before he sighed and whis-
pered  no i dont understand it no then a
long interval and he repeated this but the second time
it had the tone almost of a solution

  she became aware that he was preparaing to lie
down she marked his movements perceived with
astonishment how he adjusted his pillow with a careful
regard to comfort he lay down with a sigh of con-
tentment almost his passion had passed he lay still
and presently his breathing became regular and deep

but elizabeth remained with eyes wide open in the
darkness until the clamor of a bell and the sud-
den brilliance of the electric light warned them that
the labor company had need of them for yet another
day

  that day came a scuffle with the albino whitey and
the little ferret-faced man blunt the swart artist in
scrapping having first let denton grasp the bearing of
his lesson intervened not without a certain quality of
patronage drop is air whitey and let the man be
said his gross voice through a shower of indignities
cant you see e dont know ozv to scrap and
denton lying shamefully in the dust realized that he
must accept that course of instruction after all

  he made his apology straight and clean he scram-
bled up and walked to blunt i was a fool and you
are right he said if it isnt too late   

  that night after the second spell denton went with
blunt to certain waste and slime-soaked vaults under
the port of london to learn the first beginnings of the
high art of scrapping as it had been perfected in the
great world of the underways how to hit or kick a man
so as to hurt him excruciatingly or make him violently
sick how to hit or kick vital how to use glass in
ones garments as a club and to spread red ruin with
various domestic implements how to anticipate and
demolish your adversarys intentions in other direc-
tions  all the pleasant devices in fact that had grown
up among the disinherited of the great cities of the
twentieth and twenty-first centuries were spread out by
a gifted exponent for dentons learning blunts bash-

fulness fell from him as the instruction proceeded and
he developed a certain expert dignity a quality of
fatherly consideration he treated denton with the
utmost consideration only flicking him up a bit now
and then to keep the interest hot and roaring with
laughter at a happy fluke of dentons that covered
his mouth with blood

  im always keerless of my mouth said blunt
admitting a weakness always it dont seem to
matter like just getting bashed in the mouth-not if
your chins all right tastin blood does me good
always but i better not it you again

  denton went home to fall asleep exhausted and wake
in the small hours with aching limbs and all his bruises
tingling was it worth while that he should go on
living he listened to elizabeths breathing and re-
membering that he must have awaked her the previous
night he lay very still he was sick with infinite dis-
gust at the new conditions of his life he hated it all
hated even the genial savage who had protected him so
generously the monstrous fraud of civilization glared
stark before his eyes he saw it as a vast lunatic
growth producing a deepening torrent of savagery be-
low and above ever more flimsy gentility and silly
wastefulness he could see no redeeming reason no
touch of honor either in the life he had led or in this
life to which he had fallen civilization presented
itself as some catastrophic product as little concerned
with men-save as victims-as a cyclone or a planetary
collision he and therefore all mankind seemed living
utterly in vain his mind sought some strange expedi-
ents of escape if not for himself then at least for
elizabeth but he meant them for himself what if
he hunted up mwres and told him of their disaster
it came to him as an astonishing thing how utterly
mwres and bindon had passed out of his range where
were they what were they doing from that he
passed to thoughts of utter dishonor and finally not
arising in any way out of this mental tumult but end-
ing it as dawn ends the night came the clear and obvi-
ous conclusion of the night before the conviction that
he had to go through with things that apart from any
remoter view and quite sufficient for all his thought and
energy he had to stand up and fight among his fellows
and quit himself like a man

  the second nights instruction was perhaps less
dreadful than the first and the third was even endur-
able for blunt dealt out some praise the fourth day
denton chanced upon the fact that the ferret-faced man
was a coward there passed a fortnight of smoulder-
ing days and feverish instruction at night blunt with
many blasphemies testified that never had he met so
apt a pupil and all night long denton dreamt of kicks
and counters and gouges and cunning tricks for all
that time no further outrages were attempted for fear
of blunt and then came the second crisis blunt did
not come one day-afterwards he admitted his deliber-
ate intention-and through the tedious morning whitey
awaited the interval between the spells with an osten-
tatious impatience

  he knew nothing of the scrapping lessons and he
spent the time in telling denton and the vault generally
of certain disagreeable proceedings he had in mind
a story of the days to come



whitey was not popular and the vault disgorged
to see him haze the new man with only a languid
interest but matters changed when whiteys attempt
to open the proceedings by kicking denton in the face
was met by an excellently executed duck catch and
throw that completed the flight of whiteys foot in its
orbit and brought whiteys head into the ash-heap that
had once received dentons whitey arose a shade
whiter and now blasphemously bent upon vital injur-
ies there were indecisive passages foiled enter-
prises that deepened whiteys evidently growing per-
plexity  and then things developed into a grouping of
denton uppermost with whiteys throat in his hand
his knee  whiteys chest and a tearful whitey with a
black face protruding tongue and broken finger -endeav-
oring to explain the misunderstanding by means of
hoarse sounds moreover it was evident that among
the bystanders there had never been a more popular
person than denton

  denton with proper precaution released his antag-
onist and stood up his blood seemed changed to some
sort of fluid fire his limbs felt light and supernaturally
strong the idea that he was a martyr in the civiliza-
tion machine had vanished from his mind he was a
man in a world of men

  the little ferret-faced man was the first in the com-
petition to pat him on the back the lender of oil
cans was a radiant sun of genial congratulation   
it seemed incredible to denton that he had ever thought
of despair

  denton was convinced that not only had he to go on
through with things but that he could he sat on the
canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to elizabeth
one side of his face was bruised she had not recently
fought she had not been patted on the back there were
no hot bruises upon her face only a pallor and a new
line or so about the mouth she was taking the womans
share she looked steadfastly at denton in his new
mood of prophecy i feel that there is something
he was saying something that goes on a beingui life
in which we live and move and have our being some-
thing that began fifty-a hundred million years ago
perhaps that goes on-on growing spreading to
things beyond us-things that will justify us all   
that will explain and justify my fighting-these
bruises and all the pain of it its the chisel-yes the
chisel of the maker if only i could make you feel as
i feel if i could make you you will dear i know
you will

  no she said in a low voice no i shall not

  so i might have thought-

  she shook her head no she said i have thought
as well what you say-doesnt convince me

  she looked at his face resolutely i hate it she
said and caught at her breath you do not under-
stand you do not think there was a time when you
said things and i believed them i am growing wiser
you are a man you can fight force your way you do
not mind bruises you can be coarse and ugly and
still a man yes-it makes you it makes you you
are right only a woman is not like that we are
different we have let ourselves get civilized too soon
this underworld is not for us

  she paused and began again

  i hate it i hate this horrible canvas i hate it
more than-more than the worst that can happen it
hurts my fingers to touch it it is horrible to the skin
and the women i work with day after day i lie
awake at nights and think how i may be growing like
them   

  she stopped i am growing like them she cried
passionately

  denton stared at her distress but- he said and
stopped

  you dont understand what have i what have
i to save me  you can fight fighting is mans work
but women-women are different  i have thought
it all out i have done nothing but think night and day
look at the color of my face i cannot go  i can-
not endure this life  i cannot endure it

  she stopped she hesitated

   you do not know all she said abruptly and for an
instant her lips had a bitter smile i have been asked
to leave you

  leave me

  she made  answer save an affirmative movement of
the head

denton stood up sharply they stared at one an-
other through a long silence

  suddenly she turned herself about and flung face
downward upon their canvas bed she did not sob she
made no sound she lay still upon her face after a
vast distressful void her shoulders heaved and she be-
gan to weep silently

  elizabeth he whispered-elizabeth

  very softly he sat down beside her bent down put
his arm across her in a doubtful caress seeking vainly
for some clue to this intolerable situation

   elizabeth he whispered in her ear

  she thrust him from her with her hand i cannot
bear a child to be a slave and broke out into loud and
bitter weeping

  dentons face changed-became blank dismay pres-
ently he slipped from the bed and stood on his feet
all the complacency had vanished from his face had
given place to impotent rage he began to rave and
curse at the intolerable forces which pressed upon him
at all the accidents and hot desires and heedlessness that
mock the life of man his little voice rose in that little
room and he shook his fist this animalcule of the earth
at all that environed him about at the millions about
him at his past and future and all the insensate vastness
of the overwhelming city

chapter v

bindon intervenes

in bindons younger days he had dabbled in specu-
lation and made three brilliant flukes for the
rest of his life he had the wisdom to let gambling
alone and the conceit to believe himself a very clever
man a certain desire for influence and reputation
interested him in the business intrigues of the giant
city in which his flukes were made he became at
last one of the most influential shareholders in the


amazing stories

company that owned the london flying-stages to which
the aeroplanes came from all parts of the world this
much for his public activities in his private life he
was a man of pleasure and this is the story of his
heart

  but before proceeding to such depths one must
devote a little time to the exterior of this person its
physical basis was slender and short and dark and
the face which was fine-featured and assisted by pig-
ments varied from an insecure self-complacency to an
intelligent uneasiness his face and head had been
depilated according to the cleanly and hygienic fashion
of the time so that the color and contour of his hair
varied with his costume this he was constantly
changing

  at times he would distend himself with pneumatic
vestments in the rococo vein from among the billowy
developments of this style and beneath a translucent
and illuminated headdress his eye watched jealously
for the respect of the less fashionable world at other
times he emphasized his elegant slenderness in close-
fitting garments of black satin for effects of dignity
he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders from
which hung a robe of carefully arranged folds of china
silk and a classical bindon in pink tights was also a
transient phenomenon in the eternal pageant of destiny
in the days when he hoped to marry elizabeth he
sought to impress and charm her and at the same time
to take off something of his burden of forty years
by wearing the last fancy of the contemporary buck
a costume of clastic material with distensible warts
and horns changing in color as he walked by an in-
genious arrangement of versatile chromatophores
and no doubt if elizabeths affection had not been
already engaged by the worthless denton and if her
tastes had not had that odd bias for old-fashioned ways
this extremely chic conception would have ravisehd her
bindon had consulted elizabeths father before pre-
senting himself in this garb-he was one of those men
who always invite criticism of their costume-and
mwres had pronounced him all that the heart of woman
could desire but the affair of the hypnotist proved
that his knowledge of the heart of woman was
incomplete

  bindons idea of marrying had been formed some
little time before mwres threw elizabeths budding
womanhood in his way it wras one of bindons most
cherished secrets that he had a considerable capacity
for a pure and simple life of a grossly sentimental
type the thought imparted a sort of pathetic seri-
ousness to the offensive and quite inconsequent and
unmeaning excesses which he was pleased to regard
as dashing wnckedness and which a number of good
people also were so unwise as to treat in that desirable
manner as a consequence of these excesses and per-
haps by reason also of an inherited tendency to early
decay his liver became seriously affected and he suf-
fered increasing inconvenience when traveling by aero-
plane it was during his convalescence from a pro-
tracted bilious attack that it occurred to him that in

  	a pigment cell especially one capable of changing its form
or size causing changing of color in the translucent skin by
bringing the pigment near the surface or by contracting con-
centrating it in the deeper layers

spite of all the terrible fascinations of vice if he found
a beautiful gentle good young woman of a not too
violently intellectual type to devote her life to him
he might yet be saved to goodness and even rear a
spirited family in his likeness to solace his declining
years but like so many experienced men of the world
he doubted if there were any good women of such
as he had heard tell he was outwardly sceptical and
privately much afraid

when the aspiring mwres effected his introduc-
tion to elizabeth it seemed to him that his good
fortune was complete he fell in love with her at
once of course he had always been falling in love
since he was sixteen in accordance with the extremely
varied recipes to be found in the accumulated litera-
ture of many centuries but this was different this
was real jove it seemed to him to call forth all the
lurking goodness in his nature he felt that for her
sake he could give up a way of life that had already
produced the gravest lesions on his liver and nervous
system his imagination presented him with idyllic
pictures of the life of the reformed rake he would
never be sentimental with her or silly but always a
little cynical and bitter as became the past yet he
was sure she would have an intuition of his real great-
ness and goodness and in due course he would con-
fess things to her pour his version of what he regarded
as his wickedness-showing what a complex of goethe
and benvenuto cellini and shelley and all those other
chaps he really wras-into her shocked very beautiful
and no doubt sympathetic ear and preparatory to
these things he wooed her with infinite subtlety and
respect and the reserve with which elizabeth treated
him seemed nothing more nor less than an exquisite
modesty touched and enhanced by an equally exquisite
lack of ideas

  bindon knew nothing of her wandering affections
nor of the attempt made by mwres to utilize hypnotism
as a corrective to this digression of her heart he con-
ceived he was on the best of terms with elizabeth and
had made her quite successfully various significant
presents of jewelry and the more virtuous cosmetics
when her elopementvith denton threw the world out
of gear for him

  his first aspect of the matter was rage begotten of
wounded vanity and as mwres happened to be the
most convenient person he vented the first brunt of
it upon him

  he went immediately and insulted the desolate father
grossly and then spent an active and determined day
going to and fro about the city and interviewing people
in a consistent and partly successful attempt to ruin
that matrimonial speculator the effectual nature of
these activities gave him a temporary exhilaration and
he went to the dining-place he had frequented in his
wicked days in a devil-may-care frame of mind and
dined altogether too amply and cheerfully with two
other golden youths in the early forties he threw
up the game no woman was worth being good for
and he astonished even himself by the strain of witty
cynicism he developed one of the other desperate
blades warmed with wine made a facetious allusion
a story of the days to come



to his disappointment but at the time this did not seem
unpleasant

  the next morning found his liver and temper in-
flamed he kicked his phonographic-news machine to
pieces dismissed his valet and resolved that he would
perpetrate a terrible revenge upon elizabeth or den-
ton or somebody but anyhow it was to be a ter-
rible revenge and the friend who had made fun at
him should no longer see him in the light of a foolish
girls victim lie knew something of the little property
that was due to her and that this would be the only
support of the young couple until mwres should relent
if mwres did not relent and if unpropitious things
should happen to the affair in which elizabeths ex-
pectations lay they would come upon evil times and be
sufficiently amenable to temptation of a sinister sort
bindons imagination abandoning its beautiful ideal-
ism altogether expanded the idea of temptation of a
sinister sort he figured himself as the implacable the
intricate and powerful man of wealth pursuing this
maiden who had scorned him and suddenly her image
came upon his mind vivid and dominant and for the
first time in his life bindon realized something of the
real power of passion

  his imagination stood aside like a respectful foot
man who has done his work in ushering in the emotion

  my god cried bindon i will have her if i
have to kill myself to get her and that other
fellow-

  after an interview with his medical man and a pen-
ance for his overnight excesses in the form of bitter
drugs a mitigated but absolutely resolute bindon sought
out mwres mwres he found properly smashed and
impoverished and humble in a mood of frantic self-
preservation ready to sell himself body and soul much
more any interest in a disobedient daughter to recover
his lost position in the world in the reasonable dis-
cussion that followed it was agreed that these mis-
guided young people should be left to sink into distress
or possibly even assisted towards that improving dis-
cipline by bindons financial influence

  and then said mwres

  they will come to the labor company said bin-
don they will wear the blue canvas

  and then

  she will divorce him he said and sat for a moment
intent upon that prospect for in those days the austere
limitations of divorce of victorian times were extraor-
dinarily relaxed and a coupl might separate on a
hundred different scores

then suddenly bindon astonished himself and
mwres by jumping to his feet she shall divorce
him he cried i will have it so-i will work it so
by god it shall be so he shall be disgraced so that
she must he shall be smashed and pulverized

  the idea of smashing and pulverizing inflamed him
further he began a jovian pacing up and down the
little office i will have her he cried i will have
her heaven and hell shall not save her from me
his passion evaporated in its expression and left him
at the end simply histrionic he struck an attitude
and ignored with heroic determination a sharp twinge

of pain about the diaphragm and mwres sat with his
pneumatic cap deflated and himself very visibly
impressed

  and so with a fair persistency bindon set himself
to the work of being elizabeths malignant providence
using with ingenious dexterity every particle of advan-
tage wealth in those days gave a man over his feliow-
creatures a resort to the consolations of religion
hindered these operations not at all he would go and
talk with an interesting experienced and sympathetic
father of the huysmanite sect of the isis cult about
all the irrational little proceedings he was pleased to
regard as his heaven-dismaying wickedness and the
interesting experienced and sympathetic father rep-
resenting heaven dismayed would with a pleasing
affectation of horror suggest simple and easy penances
and recommend a monastic foundation that was airy
cool hygienic and not vulgarized for viscerally dis-
ordered penitent sinners of the refined and wealthy
type and after these excursions bindon would come
back to london quite active and passionate again he
would machinate with really considerable energy and
repair to a certain gallery high above the street of mov-
ing ways from which he could view the entrance to
the barrack of the labor company in the ward which
sheltered denton and elizabeth and at last one day
he saw elizabeth go in and thereby his passion was
renewed

  so in the fullness of time the complicated devices of
bindon ripened and he could go to mwres and tell him
that the young people were near despair

  its time for you he said to let your parental
affections have play shes been in blue canvas some
months and theyve been cooped together in one of
those labor dens and the little girl is dead she
knows now what his manhood is worth to her by way
of protection poor girl shell see things now in a
clearer light you go to her-i dont want to appear
in this affair yet-and point out to her how necessary
it is that she should get a divorce from him  

  shes obstinate said mwres doubtfully

  spirit said bindon shes a wonderful girl-a
wonderful girl

  shell refuse

  of course she will but leave it open to her leave
it open to her and some day-in that stuffy den in
that irksome toilsome life they cant help it-theyll
have a quarrel and then-

  mwres meditated over the matter and did as he was
told

  then bindon as he had arranged with his spiritual
adviser went into retreat the retreat of the huys-
manite sect was a beautiful place with the sweetest air
in london lit by natural sunlight and with restful
quadrangles of real grass open to the sky where at
the same time the penitent man of pleasure might enjoy
all the pleasures of loafing and all the satisfaction of
distinguished austerity and save for participation in
the simple and wholesome dietary of the place and in
certain magnificent chants bindon spent all his time
in meditation upon the theme of elizabeth and the
extreme purification his soul had undergone since he
first saw her and whether he would be able to get a

dispensation to marry her from the experienced and
sympathetic father in spite of the approaching sin
of her divorce and then    bindon would lean
against a pillar of the quadrangle and lapse into rever-
ies on the superiority of virtuous love to any other form
of indulgence a curious feeling in his back and chest
that was trying to attract his attention a disposition to
be hot or shiver a general sense of ill-health and
cutaneous discomfort he did his best to ignore all
that of course belonged to the old life that he was
shaking off

  when he came out of retreat he went at once to
mwres to ask for news of elizabeth mwres was
clearly under the impression that he was an exemplary
father profoundly touched about the heart by his childs
unhappiness she was pale he said greatly moved
she was pale when i asked her to come away and
leave him-and be happy-she put her head down upon
the table-mwres sniffed-and cried

  flis agitation was so great that he could say no more

  ah said bindon respecting this manly grief
oh said bindon quite suddenly with his hand to
his side

  mwres looked up sharply out of the pit of his sor-
rows startled whats the matter  he asked visibly
concerned

  a most violent pain excuse me you were tell-
ing me about elizabeth

and mwres after a decent solicitude for bindons
pain proceeded with his report it was even
unexpectedly hopeful elizabeth in her first emotion
at discovering that her father had not absolutely de-
serted her had been frank with him about her sorrows
and disgusts

  yes said bindon magnificently i shall have her
yet and then that novel pain twitched him for the
second time

  for these lower pains the priest was comparatively
ineffectual inclining rather to regard the body and
them as mental illusions amenable to contemplation
so bindon took it to a man of a class he loathed a medi-
cal man of extraordinary repute and incivility we
must go all over you said the medical man and did so
with the most disgusting frankness did you ever
bring any children into the world asked this gross
materialist among other impertinent questions

  not that i know of said bindon too amazed to
stand upon his dignity

  ah said the medical man and proceeded with his
punching and sounding medical science in those days
was just reaching the beginnings of precision youd
better go right away said the medical man and make
the euthanasia the sooner the better

  bindon gasped he had been trying not to under-
stand the technical explanations and anticipations in
which the medical man had indulged

  i say he said but do you mean to say   
your science  

  nothing said the medical man a few opiates
the thing is your own doing you know to a certain
extent

  i was sorely tempted in my youth

  its not that so much but you come of a bad
stock even if youd have taken precautions youd
have had bad times to wind up with the mistake
was getting born the indiscretions of the parents
and youve shirked exercise and so forth

  i had no one to advise me

  medical men are always willing

  i was a spirited young fellow

  we wont argue the mischiefs done now youve
lived we cant start you again you ought never to
have started at all frankly-the euthanasia
bindon hated him in silence for a space every
word of this brutal expert jarred upon his refinements
he was so gross so impermeable to all the subtler
issues of being but it is no good picking a quarrel
with a doctor my religious beliefs he said i dont
approve of suicide

  youve been doing it all your life

  well anyhow ive come to take a serious view of
life now

  youre bound to if you go on living youll hurt
but for practical purposes its late however if you
mean to do that-perhaps id better mix you a little
something youll hurt a great deal these little
twinges   

  twinges

  mere preliminary notices

  how long can i go on i mean before i hurt-
really

  youll get it hot soon perhaps three days
bindon tried to argue for an extension of time and
in the midst of his pleading gasped put his hand to his
side suddenly the extraordinary pathos of his life
came to him clear and vivid its hard he said
its infernally hard ive been no mans enemy but
my own ive always treated everybody quite fairly
the medical man stared at him without any sympathy
for some seconds he was reflecting how excellent it
was that there were no more bindons to carry on that
line of pathos he felt quite optimistic then he
turned to his telephone and ordered up a prescription
from the central pharmacy

  he was interrupted by a voice behind him by
god cried bindon ill have her yet

  the physician stared over his shoulder at bindons
expression and then altered the prescription

so soon as this painful interview was over bindon
gave way to rage he settled that the medical man
was not only an unsympathetic brute and wanting in
the first beginnings of a gentleman but also highly
incompetent and he went off to four other practitioners
in succession with a view to the establishment of this
intuition but to guard against surprises he kept that
little prescription in his pocket with each he began
by expressing his grave doubts of the first doctors
intelligence honesty and professional knowledge and
then stated his symptoms suppressing only a few more
material facts in each case these were always sub-
sequently elicited by the doctor in spite of the wel-
come depreciation of another practitioner none of these
eminent specialists would give bindon any hope of
eluding the anguish and helplessness that loomed now
close upon him to the last of them he unburdened
a story of the days to come



his mind of an accumulated disgust with medical
science after centuries and centuries he exclaimed
hotly and you can do nothing-except admit your
helplessness i say save nie-and what do you do
no doubt its hard on you said the doctor but
you should have taken precautions

  how was i to know

  it wasnt our place to run after you said the medi-
cal man picking a thread of cotton from his purple
sleeve why should we save you in particular you
see-from one point of view-people with imaginations
and passions like yours have to go-they have to go
go

  die out its an eddy

he was a young man with a serene face he
smiled at bindon we get on with research
you know we give advice when people have the sense
to ask for it and we bide our time

  bide your time

  we hardly know enough yet to take over the man-
agement you know

  the management

  you neednt be anxious science is young yet
its got to keep on growing for a few generations we
know enough now to know we dont know enough yet

   but the time is coming all the same you wont
see the time but between ourselves you rich men
and party bosses with your natural play of the passions
and patriotism and religion and so forth have made
rather a mess of things havent you these under-
ways and all that sort of thing some of us have
a sort of fancy that in time we may know enough to
take over a little more than the ventilation and drains
knowledge keeps on piling up you know it keeps
on growing and theres not the slightest hurry for
a generation or so some day-some day men will
live in a different way he looked at bindon and
meditated therell be a lot of dying out before that
day can come

  bindon attempted to point out to this young man
how silly and irrelevant such talk was to a sick man
like himself how impertinent and uncivil it was to him
an older man occupying a position in the official world
of extraordinary power and influence he insisted that
a doctor was paid to cure people-he laid great stress
on paid-and had no business to glance even for a
moment at those other questions but we do said
the young man insisting upon facts and bindon lost
his temper

  his indignation carried him home that these in-
competent impostors who were unable to save the life
of a really influential man like himself should dream
of some day robbing the legitimate property owners
of social control of inflicting one knew not what
tyranny upon the world curse science he fumed
over the intolerable prospect for some time and then
the pain returned and he recalled the made-up pre-
scription of the first doctor still happily in his pocket
he took a dose forthwith

  tt calmed and soothed him greatly and he could sit
down in his most comfortable chair beside his library
of phonographic records and think over the altered

  aspect of affairs his indignation passed his anger
and his passion crumbled under the subtle attack of
that prescription pathos became his sole ruler he
stared about him at his magnificent and voluptuously
appointed apartment at his statuary and discreetly
veiled pictures and all the evidences of a cultivated
and elegant wickedness he touched a stud and the sad
pipings of tristans shepherd filled the air his eye
wandered from one object to another they were
costly and gross and florid-but they were his they
presented in concrete form his ideals his conceptions
of beauty and desire his idea of all that is precious
in life and now-he must leave it all like a common
man he was he felt a slender and delicate flame
burning out so must all life flame up and pass he
thought his eyes filled with tears

  then it came into his head that he was alone no-
body cared for him nobody needed him at any mo-
ment he might begin to hurt vividly he might even
howl nobody would mind according to all the
doctors he would have excellent reason for howling in
a day or so it recalled what his spiritual adviser had
said of the decline of faith and fidelity the degenera-
tion of the age he beheld himself as a pathetic proof
of this he the subtle able important voluptuous
cynical complex bindon possibly howling and not
one faithful simple creature in all the world to howl
in sympathy not one faithful simple soul was there-
no shepherd to pipe to him had all such faithful
simple creatures vanished from this harsh and urgent
earth he wondered whether the horrid vulgar crowd
that perpetually went about the city could possibly
know what he thought of them if they did he felt
sure some would try to earn a better opinion surely
the world went from bad to worse it was becoming
impossible for bindons perhaps some day    he
was quite sure that the one thing he had needed in life
was sympathy for a time he regretted that he left
no sonnets-no enigmatical pictures or something of
thatsort behind him fro carry on his being until at last
the sympathetic mind should come   

it seemed incredible to him that this that came was
extinction yet his sympathetic spiritual guide was
in this matter annoyingly figurative and vague curse
science it had undermined all faith-all hope togo
out to vanish from theatre and street from office and
dining-place from the dear eyes of womankind and
not to be missed on the whole to leave the world
happier

  he reflected that he had never worn his heart upon
his sleeve had he after all been too unsympathetic
few people could suspect how subtly profound he really
was beneath the mask of that cynical gaiety of his
they would not understand the loss they had suffered
elizabeth for example had not suspected   

  he had reserved that his thoughts having come
to elizabeth gravitated about her for some time how
little elizabeth understood him

  that thought became intolerable before all other
things he must set that right he realized that there
was still something for him to do in life his struggle
against elizabeth was even yet not over he could


amazing stories

never overcome her now as he had hoped and prayed
but he might still impress her

  from that idea he expanded he might impress
her profoundly-he might impress her so that she
should for evermore regret her treatment of him the
thing that she must realize before everything else was
his magnanimity his magnanimity yes he had
loved her with amazing greatness of heart he had
not seen it so clearly before-but of course he was
going to leave her all his property he saw it instantly
as a thing determined and inevitable she would think
how good he washow spaciously generous surrounded
by all that makes life tolerable from his hand she would
recall with infinite regret her scorn and coldness and
when she sought expression for that regret she would
find that occasion gone forever she should be met by
a locked door by a disdainful stillness by a white dead
face he closed his eyes and remained for a space
imagining himself that white dead face

  from that he passed to other aspects of the matter
but his determination was assured he meditated
elaborately before he took action for the drug he had
taken inclined him to a lethargic and dignified melan-
choly in certain respects he modified details if he
left all his property to elizabeth it would include the
voluptuously appointed room he occupied and for
many reasons he did not care to leave that to her on
the other hand it had to be left to some one in his
clogged condition this worried him extremely

   in the end he decided to leave it to the sympathetic
exponent of the fashionable religious cult whose con-
versation had been so pleasing in the past he will
understand said bindon with a sentimental sigh he
knows what evil means-he understands something
of the stupendous fascination of the sphinx of sin
yes-he will understand by that phrase it was that
bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and
undignified departures from sane conduct to which a
misguided vanity and an ill-controlled curiosity had
led him he sat for a space thinking how very hellenic
and italian and neronic and all those things he had
been even now-might one not try a sonnet a
penetrating voice to echo down the ages sensnous
sinister and sad for a space he forgot elizabeth in
the course of half an hour he spoiled three phonographic
coils got a headache took a second dose to calm him-
self and reverted to magnanimity and his former
design

   at last he faced the unpalatable problem of denton
it needed all his newborn magnanimity before he could
swallow the thought of denton but at last this greatly
misunderstood man assisted by his sedative and the
near approach of death effected even that tf he was
at all exclusive about denton if he should display the
slightest distrust if he attempted any specific exclusion
of that young man she might-misunderstand yes-
she should have her denton still his magnanimity
must go even to that he tried to think only of eliza-
beth in the matter

  he rose with a sigh and limped across to the tele-
phonic apparatus that communicated with his solicitor
tn ten minutes a will duly attested and with its proper
thumb-mark signature lay in the solicitors office three

miles away and then for a space bindon sat very
still

  suddenly he started out of a vague reverie and
pressed an investigatory hand to his side

  then he jumped eagerly to his feet and rushed to
the telephone the euthanasia company had rarely
been called by a client in a greater hurry

so it came at last that denton and his elizabeth
against all hope returned unseparated from the
labor servitude to which they had fallen elizabeth
came out from her cramped subterranean den of metal-
beaters and all the sordid circumstances of blue canvas
as one comes out of a nightmare back towards the
sunlight their fortune took them once the bequest was
known to them the bare thought of another days ham-
mering became intolerable they went up long lifts
and stairs to levels that they had not seen since the
days of their disaster at first she was full of this
sensation of escape even to think of the underways
was intolerable only after many months could she
begin to recall with sympathy the faded women who
were still below there murmuring scandals and remi-
niscences and folly and tapping away their lives

  her choice of the apartments they presently took
expressed the vehemence of her release they were
rooms upon the very verge of the city they had a roof
space and a balcony upon the city wall wide open to
the sun and wind the country and the sky

  and in that balcony comes the last scene in this
story it was a summer sunsetting and the hills of
surrey were very blue and clear denton leaned upon
the balcony regarding them and elizabeth sat by his
side very wide and spacious was the view for their
balcony hung five hundred feet above the ancient level
of the ground the oblongs of the food company
broken here and there by the ruins-grotesque little
holes and sheds-of the ancient suburbs and inter-
sected by shining streams of sewage passed at last into
a remote diapering at the foot of the distant hills
there once had been the squatting-place of the children
of uya on those further slopes gaunt machines of
unknown import worked slackly at the end of their
spell and the hill crest was set with stagnant wind
vanes along the great south road the labor com-
panys field workers in huge wheeled mechanical ve-
hicles were hurrying back to their meals their last
spell finished and through the air a dozen little pri-
vate aeropiles sailed down towards the city familiar
scene as it was to the eyes of denton and elizabeth it
would have filled the minds of their ancestors with
incredulous amazement dentons thoughts fluttered
towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene
might be in another two hundred years and recoiling
turned towards the past

  he shared something of the growing knowledge of
the time he could picture the quaint smoke-grimed
victorian city with its narrow little roads of- beaten
earth its wide common-land ill-organized ill-built
suburbs and irregular enclosures the old countryside
of the stuart times with its little villages and its petty
london the england of the monasteries the far older
england of the roman dominion and then before that

baron munchhausens
scientific adventures

by hugo ge rnshack

	miinchhausen is taught martian

ially as always at exactly  
the next evening munchhausens
 voice once more sounded in my re-
there was the usual preliminary
ter which the baron went on 

 i am very much pleased my dear alier that my
radiotomatic relay station on the moon works so well
up to last night neither flitternix nor i were sure
we could bridge the  million miles between mars
and the moon by wireless but by means of our wonder-
ful ultra sensitive radio-active detector we were en-
abled to listen in successfully when i had finished
talking last night it was about  p m your terrestrial
time we got our receiving instruments ready at once
and a little over five minutes after  p m i could
hear myself talking the message which i had sent a
few hours before had been faithfully recorded on the
telegraphone wire of my radiotomatic on the moon
and as soon as the automatic clock released the sending
machinery the vibrations carrying my voice were
hurled back to us over a distance of  million miles
then we knew that you must have heard the message
too for you are only  miles distant from the
moon while my canned
voice undoubtedly must
have sounded uncanny to
you-excuse the pun-i as-
sure you that it gave me the
creeps listening to my own
voice flung  million miles
through the ether

but to come back to
where i broke off last night

i told you how several
martians had approached
us and had placed a soft
metallic cap on our heads

i also told you how we then
followed the august mar-
tian into the church-like
structure

 while we walked over the hard metal lie-appearing
walk which conducted us to the structure we became
conscious of strange flashes in our brains we also
caught distinct though faint bars of a soft music
which was followed by weird pictures flashing through
our minds all this took place within our heads and as

   as radio waves travel at the speed of light ie 
miles a second it took over  minutes for the radio impulses to
reach mars miinchhausen therefore heard his talk  minutes
later than alicr

i closed my eyes for a few seconds to test myself the
music as well as the picture flashes persisted i knew
then that i did not hear the music with my ears nor
see the pictures with my eyes i reasoned correctly that
both had their origin within my brain

  before i had time to puzzle it out we had entered
the structure at the heels of our host we passed
through a magnificent archway constructed entirely of
some transparent material decorated in superb taste in
green white and gold one thing struck us immedi-
ately the hallway appeared as light as day but we
could not see where the light originated later we
were to find out about this

  at the end of the hallway wras a ponderous massive
panel with a door-like appearance it must have been
at least  feet high and  feet wide it looked
very much like cut glass with all its prisms and fancy
cuts we first thought it was glass but when we came
closer to it we changed our minds for we saw that the
huge thing was as flexible as a velvet portiere when
our host was but  feet away from it it suddenly
blazed forth in a brilliant golden light which seemed to
come from nowhere simultaneously the huge door

for this is wrhat it was rose
quickly up in the air just
like a theater curtain our
host now entered into a
large circular salon-like
room followed reluctantly
by us

  i say reluctantly ad-
visedly i have absolutely
no wtords to do the thing
justice our state of mind
upon entering that room
was probably the same as if
you had brought back to
life julius caesar of the
year  bc and had sud-
d e n  y transplanted him
some night to blazing
broadway in new york his mind would have reeled
at the-to him-marvelous sights it would have taken
him days and days of asking questions and explanations
of all the impossible things he saw before him

  exactly so with us only caesar would have made
a jump of only  years whereas wre made a jump
of over  years we wrere merely uncompre-
hending children and our eyes and senses were ab-
solutely inadequate to do justice at once to the higher
plane of civilization on which we had been thrown so

     me of the greatest puzzles our astronomers and scien-
 tists had to contend with during the last decade ivas the
 problem of how water is mmed in the martian canals
 nearly all scientists of note who have studied them do not
 question their existence but they are all at odds as to what
 agency moves such enormous quantities of water it is
 singular that most of them suggest a form of pump to move
 the water in the canals as our present-day knowledge of
 science and mechanics leaves them no other choice but
 what makes our rivers flow on earth  what agency con-
 denses billions of tons of occan water and brings these
 waters down in the form of rains which keep our rivers
 from drying up the sun of course why cant the sun
 move the water in the martian canals also this install-
 ment contains a new idea as to how the martians might ac-
 complish it

we could not rid ourselves of the idea that these females were some sort of secretaries to our host and it was manifest that they
were working at something they appeared to be working earn estly and diligently too but there were no pencils no books no
paper no typewriters in fact there was nothing whatsoever that a terrestrial secretary requires to get up her superiors report




amazing stories

suddenly we have been on mars eight days now and
still we know practically nothing of this most miracu-
lous world every day brings more tremendous sur-
prises and at night we are usually exhausted from all
the excitement of the continuous bombardment of our
brains by new and wondrous things

  but to come back to the wondrous salon of our
host who as we found out later was the reigning
ruler of the planet mars the house in which we were
was a sort of executive mansion or palace and the
room in which we were standing was what you might
call the rulers office

  here i must stop again to advise you that it is ex-
tremely difficult for me to explain in existing terrestrial
terms what we see hear and feel for everything on
mars is so totally different from what we are accus-
tomed to on earth that my best comparisons with ter-
restrial things must of necessity fall far short of actual
conditions on mars

  however i will do my best to convey a true picture
to you

  the thing that struck us with the greatest force at
first was that everything in this immense room appeared
transparent the room which is about  feet in
diameter is about  feet high with an immense golden
transparent cupola forming the ceiling the tables the
chairs all the furniture as well as all the objects for
which we had no names seemed transparent even the
walls seemed transparent as well as the soft rug-like
carpets on which we walked but the wonder was
centered not solely in the transparency of the strange
material but in the fact that it gave forth a soft white
light imagine a solid chair of glass glowing in a mel-
low white light-not a brilliant light-and you have a
good idea of what we beheld it struck us at once that
this wonderful material could be treated at will by the
martians for the luminous rugs on which we stood
were soft as velvet while a desk-like object nearby
seemed hard as steel the next thing which attracted
most of our attention were the luminous walls they
were all paneled in a curious manner and were of
course transparent and luminous each panel had a
vast amount of small hexagonal plate-like facets ar-
ranged somewhat in honeycomb fashion these hex-
agonal cells were constantly changing in soft colors
and the most unique as well as pleasing geometrical
designs in colors were thus unendingly produced it
was a fascinating sight and we found it hard to take
our eyes from these walls

  at the far end of the room we noticed four mar-
tians whom we recognized at once as females on ac-
count of their mass of hair and their more delicate fea-
tures their heads seemed somewhat smaller than
those of the males but they appeared to dress exactly
like the men except that the color of their metallic look-
ing dresses was of a much lighter shade but it was not
so much the girls that drew our attention as what they
were doing we could not rid ourselves of the idea that
these females were some sort of secretaries to our host
and it was manifest that they were working at some-
thing they appeared to be working earnestly and dili-
gently too but there were no pencils no books no
paper no typewriters in fact there was nothing what-

soever that a terrestrial secretary requires to get up her
superiors reports

  each girl sat motionless in front of a small glass-
like table which was entirely bare and flat except for
the center from which projected two small glass-like
rods each about  inches high and as thick as a pencil
at the top they bent over and formed a gooseneck
pointing in the direction of the girls the rods were
both pointed at their ends and while one appeared
luminous the other seemed dark

  the operators were watching the point of the
luminous rod intently and the expression of their faces
indicated that they were reading something every once
in a while they seemed to relax and at that moment a
curious white ray seemed to pass from the light point
of the rod into the point of the dark one that was
all we could see

  while we were still wondering our host motioned
us to sit down on the comfortable looking arm chairs
these chairs as already mentioned appeared like trans-
parent glass but when we put our hands on them they
felt like satin and not at all hard or cold the trans-
parent seats which had a moment before appeared as
glass were soft and flexible as an air-cushion and
extremely comfortable the only trouble with the
chairs was that they were too big for us built for large
-foot martians our feet hardly reached the floor so
we sat in the chairs just as children sit in big armchairs
-our backs resting against the inside back of the chair
and our legs and feet projecting straight out on the seat
only then were we quite comfortable

  this position ridiculous as it doubtless was evoked
a faint smile from our host who sat down in his own
chair in front of a large piece of furniture that was a
cross between a rectangular table and a flat-top desk
garnished in its center with a huge birthday-cake-like
affair with  transparent and  dark glass-like can-
dles curved in gooseneck form

  our host then turned to us and looked us over long
and earnestly his large liquid blue eyes were won-
derful in their depth in them shone a wisdom such as
we had never before beheld his face had a very benev-
olent expression and the features were clear and
sharply defined he appeared tremendously intellectual
yet will-power and strength of character radiated from
his face in an amazing manner we thought that at
last he was going to speak to us but instead he motioned
to us to close our eyes which we did the following
then happened and i will describe it as well as i can
no sooner had i closed my eyes than a clear picture
of the earth with its continents was flashed in my
mind just as if i had tried to think intently of the
terrestrial globe as it stands silhouetted against a dark
sky then in quick succession followed our inter-
stellar the planet mars a picture of our capture by
the martians with their yellow rays and their floating
fortresses then an exact picture of how we appeared
at our landing on mars

  it then dawned on us that our host was talking to
us not in words and not in a strange language but mo-
tion-picture-wise we had experienced the first trans-
ference of thoughts and had understood everything
our host had said because he thought in pictures which
baron munchhausen



were perfectly familiar to us not in words which would
have had  meaning for us when there was a lull
we opened our eyes in astonishment and blinked be-
wildered into the smiling eyes of our august host he
seemed highly amused at our amazement and once
more he motioned to us to close our eyes

  for the next hour or more we had our first lesson
in martian in easy stages our host first flashed sim-
ple pictures into our minds which were then followed
by scenes with various actions and explanations just as
in a moving picture scene where the mind must infer
what the actors are saying to each other by the expres-
sion of their faces and their obvious actions

  there was a short pause after which our host
launched into the evolution of mars we were first
shown how the planet millions of years ago was but
a nebula floating in space and how the nebula slowly
became a solid sphere the early life of mars was
then pictured which must have been exactly like the
evolution of our own earth we saw the prehistorical
martians with their clubs and stones then we saw for
a long period the slow evolution of mars down through
the ages till a civilization similar to that of present ter-
restrial conditions was reached there were the wars
the barbarism and the thousand other evils exactly as
those experienced by man on earth evolution after
all is the same throughout the universe given like
conditions

  as the story of the evolution went on we could see
how the martians small head and his small chest both
kept on increasing with each subsequent generation
we were shown how big oceans and inland seas as
well as vast rivers dried up gradually and how the
whole population turned into mechanics electricians
and chemists no true happiness and contentment
however seemed to exist on mars until thought trans-
ference was established till gravity was conquered and
money was abolished there had been wars and dis-
orders up to that period but it seems that these three
achievements apparently invented and originated at
about the same time emancipated the race completely
as we found out later this period was reached some
 years ago

  beginning with that period only did the martians
really become great we saw how in less than five
generations speech had been entirely abolished it being
possible to converse over considerable distance by
thought transference we were shown the evils of too
many languages and the race hatreds produced thereby
and how finally one universal language was adopted by
all races and nations we saw the abolition of presi-
dents and rules of small and big nations and the inau-
guration of a universal council and a planet ruler
both elected by popular votes

  we witnessed how the once dense air becamethinner
and thinner and how fertile valleys turned into deserts
on account of lack of water we saw the transmutation
of the metals as well as the transmutation of all other
matter thus we were shown how iron or lead was
turned into gold or copper or into any other metal or
else how marbel or stone was turned into steel or gold
or other metals the same as clay can already be turned
into aluminum on earth to-day

  simultaneously with these discoveries we witnessed
the unlocking of atomic forces which was the last
great martian discovery in the final mastery of the
planet

  where extermination had stared the martians in
the face on account of their constantly decreasing water
supply the new atomic engines combined with the con-
quering of gravity dispelled all fears for the future
during the next few generations we were made to see
the creation of the monstrous waterways which not
alone were to bring water from the two poles but also
were to irrigate existing agricultural districts as well
as barren deserts we saw how the martians finally
harnessed the sun and how the latter was now moving
the waters in the vast waterways which you know as
canals

  in quick succession we were then shown all the
progress and evolution on mars during the last thou-
sand years i do not attempt to go into details here
as you would surely not grasp the meaning neither do
i attempt at this time to explain all the wonders that
took place  mars during the past  years be-
cause you would not understand most of it precisely
as we did not grasp everything during our first lecture
it therefore becomes necessary to explain the wonders
to you by means of examples and comparisons with
existing terrestrial terms this i will do during out-
stay on this planet

  after our host had concluded his first lecture he
watched our utter amazement with the benevolent smile
a fond mother will bestow on her four-year-old child
after she had finished telling him a particularly interest-
ing fairy story

  after a short time we could understand him quite
well by his motions as well as by mere picture talk
without closing our eyes he then made us understand
that he desired us to transfer our thoughts to him we
tried the experiment flitternix first he failed utterly
for our host shook his head smilingly then i tried it
but as the metallic-like cap which one of the martians
had placed on my head made me too warm i foolishly
proceeded to take it off of course our host smilingly
made me put it back again and only then did i re-
member that he had shown us during our lecture that
thought transference was impossible without the medi-
um of the complex cap which i shall later describe
to you

  i then proceeded to concentrate my mind and began
thinking real hard of flitternix and how he appeared
just then for some seconds i did not seem to be suc-
cessful for our host looked blank finally with the
perspiration running down my forehead from the un-
accustomed effort the rulers face lit up and he pointed
smilingly at flitternix i was much elated over this
success my first transmission of thoughts or rather
one thought for a few minutes our host tried to make
us understand that it would take some days of prac-
tise before we could hope to talk even by pictures and
perhaps months before we could begin to actually talk-
in words without using our tongues or ears he then
recommended that flitternix and myself should prac-
tise as much as possible and should forget speech en-
tirely he also cautioned us that as all thought-trans


amazing stories

mission took place through the medium of electricity it
was necessary that the flexible metallic cord hanging
from our metallic-like caps should touch some conduc-
tor preferably the ground as we could easily guess
that this was necessary in order to provide a return
circuit for the currents we soon learned how to keep
in contact with a conductor when we wanted to trans-
fer our thoughts from one to the other

  as our host had to go to the other end of the room
just then flitternix and i tried thought transmission at
once we surprised ourselves by our success not
only could we talk in pictures after a while but almost
at once we were able to enunciate whole sentences of
course the unusual strain gave us a headache long be-
fore our host returned but that was to be expected we
had never been used to such hard mental work and we
understood quickly that we would have to learn the art
gradually by constant slow practise and by frequently
resting the brain

  as if our august host had divined the strain on our
minds during the past hour and a half he immediately
began to divert us and he did this admirably by letting
us see for ourselves with our eyes instead of with our
minds

  however we quickly began to understand and ap-
preciate his wisdom in first giving us his historic lecture
because if he had not done this most of the things we
saw during the next hour would have been meaningless
to us thus you will understand that what i am going
to tell you now including the explanations did not
originate entirely in my own mind most of my ex-
planations are naturally based upon that important
lecture

  we followed our host outdoors where we boarded
his private flyer this machine was of course an anti-
gravitational flyer propelled by atomic engines it be-
haved much like our own interstellar that is it had no
wings nor planes because it was not dependent upon
the air the gravitational attraction of mars is neu-
tralized by the atomic engine to a certain degree the
more the gravity is neutralized the higher the machine
rises now in order to steer the flyer an emanation
ray is used this ray is the joint product of several
elements not known on earth the nearest although a
poor analogy is found in your radium emanation but
the latter is several million times weaker than the mar-
tian emanation ray this ray is projected into space
by means of electricity and another source of energy
which i shall term ion as yet unknown on earth and
to be described by me later the emanation ray can
be stored just as electricity is stored in a storage bat-
tery when it strikes an immovable object it acts
exactly as an oar does when it is used in pushing off
from the dock ie the boat will move away from land
so the emanation ray is used in controlling the hori-
zontal motion of the gravity-neutralized flyer and by
its means the latter can be guided in any desired di-
rection

  our flyer was round in shape resembling a disc
and measured about  feet in diameter it was al-
most  feet thick and like most other things we had
seen on mars it was transparent in the center was a
dome that looked like the conning tower of a submarine

and a slender metallic pole extended from it almost 
feet into the air it branched out at the top into three
short brackets at the end of each was a transparent
ball about  inches in diameter between these balls
the emanation ray played and the latter could be
thrown at will into any direction desired

  our flyer was an open one and not covered on top
and there were two drivers-which you probably
would call chauffeurs-one forward and one aft there
were no steering wheels and no brakes nor was there a
horn the two drivers sat in transparent chairs not
unlike our own and in front of them was a little round
table with small key levers like listening in keys on an
american telephone switchboard that was all

  as soon as we were seated our host sitting between
us our drivers pressed a lever or two and we shot
upward with amazing speed in a few seconds the
emanation ray went into action and we began to fly
or rather float in an easterly direction from the
position of the sun i concluded that it was almost
noon as the sun was about overhead this must have
been in flitternixs mind too for presently he set his
chronometer to noon which of course was a ridiculous
thing to do for we did not know if the martians divided
their day into  hours or into  hours

  we were now floating some  feet up over what
we afterwards learned was the martian national capi-
tal the city of the ruler it is located in the elliptical
spot which terrestrial astronomers have marked as
solis lacus on their martian maps

  as if our host had divined our innermost wishes
we soon passed over the capital and approached the
waterway which you will find in your martian map
under the name of nectar

  the martian canals at last we beheld one of
them at a distance of less than  feet the riddle
of terrestrial astronomers for over a century the
cause of one of the most heated controversies on earth
and now we saw them close by with our own eyes

  the canal proper which is termed nectar by
astronomers on earth is about  miles wide it runs
in a perfectly straight line for over  miles and is
about  feet deep like all other martian waterways
it is lined with the universal martian material termed
tos which looks like glass yet is not glass the tos
in this instance is waterproof is an electrical conductor
on one side and an insulator on the other yet it is a
solid body and much harder and tougher than steel
the conducting side is turned toward the water and
when a certain current of ion is sent through the tos
the water near it loses all weight because the gravita-
tional attraction of mars is neutralized thereby it is
now an easy matter to move the tremendous masses of
water a problem which your earthly scientists could
never solve

  at each bank of the vast waterway we saw im-
mense towers about  feet high these towers are
spaced about  miles apart and follow the entire course
of every canal their purpose is as follows

  at the top of each tower is an immense pyramid

 	see accompanying map of mars solis lacus is located at
about  latitude and  longitude nectar runs from the
eastern left edge of solia lacus due east see page 
baron munchhausen



made of a certain variety of tos the sides of these
pyramids are formed of thousands of small black cells
which when exposed to the suns rays absorb the heat
of the latter as the surface of these pyramids is very
large a proportionally large amount of heat is received
this heat is directly transformed into ion and stored
within the pyramid the latter turns on its axis so as
to present the largest possible surface to the sun from
sunrise until sunset also as more power is generated
than is needed during the daytime the excess is used
during the night

  now then from the top of the pyramid a gigantic
emanation ray bursts forth fed from the stored ion
originally secured from the suns heat

  this ray is made to fall over the entire width of
the waterway and it is directed on the latter at an angle
the ray striking the water which because it has no
weight does not resist must naturally move away from
the direction of the ray this it does the emanation
ray pushing the water at a rate of about l miles an
hour if it were not for the ray the water would of
course be entirely motionless for the martian water-
ways are exactly level

  as each tower assists in moving the water over a
certain distance the water gradually acquires momen-
tum and flows slowly but steadily before the mo-
mentum has been expended the next tower is reached
which pushes the water on to the next one and so on
through the entire length of the canal you will nat-
urally understand that these towers must work nights
as well as during the day else the water would not flow

during the night the stored surplus power during the
day makes this possible furthermore the towers
work to their full efficiency and uninterruptedly year in
and year out for there are few clouds to hide the sun
on mars as is well known consequently the pyramids
are hardly ever without power except nights

  you realize that all the towers must throw their
rays in the same direction which of course they do
thus if the water is to be moved in one season from
north to south the rays face the south during the
next season when the flow of the water must needs be
reversed as explained to you yesterday the emanation
rays will all point northward thus one of the great
problems on mars has been solved but what does the
work the all dominating sun

  and what moves the waters on earth  what con-
denses the waters from the oceans and lifts up myriads
of tons of water year in and year out to form clouds
which later produce the rains without which your
rivers would run dry within four weeks the sun of
course

  only on earth the sun does it in a natural manner
here on mars the sun works to the same effect but
without the intermediary of the clouds

  there was the familiar snapping sound in my re-
ceivers a low clickand everything was quiet i knew
that the telegraphone wire on the moon must have
been filled to capacity and that i would not hear again
from miinchhausen till the next evening

	thought transmission on mars

i was still dreaming lost completely in a blue cloud
of pipe smoke when my electric chime controlled
by the western union clock which gets the xact
time hourly from the naval observatory commenced
to sound the eleventh hour in its sonorous vibrant voice

  at the stroke of eleven-my headset had been already
clamped over my ears-the familiar high whistling
sound sung in my ears once more punctually as usual
miinchhausen called

  same good old miinchhausen i said to myself
and i listened expectantly for that dear croaking sepul-
chral voice however he had a little surprise for me
he did not speak instead without warning there sud-
denly broke into my ears the most amazing music a
mortal has ever heard the sound was so loud that i
was actually forced to take the phones from my head
and place them on the table and i had to go to the far
end of my laboratory in order to hear the music at its
best

  and to think that i was listening to music which had
originated on mars  million miles away it was al-
most unbelievable but there it was filling up the en-
tire room with the most delightful music sometimes
it sounded like an immense orchestra then again like a
ccleste instrument at other times the music sounded
like a cello mixed with a flute immediately to change
into a mixture of an oboe and a cornet occasionally
there was a sound like human singing but altogether

different in quality and volume moreover all sounds
were sustained they never broke off sharply and the
music from one instrument seemed to melt into that of
another without the slightest break imagine if you
can that you are listening to a violin which gradually
in a most harmonious manaer changes into a cornet
without a break i had never been stirred so deeply
by music in my life and i have listened to exquisite
music in my day

  for five minutes or more i listened entranced then
the music gradually died down to a plaintive crying
sound which almost brought tears to my eyes when
the concert was over i returned to the phones and
i had hardly adjusted them when miinchhausen spoke
good evening my dear alier how is old mother
earth and yourself to-night sorry you cant tell me
at any rate i trust all is well i hope you enjoyed my
little musicale there has never been such music on
earth as far as i know too bad the telegraphone wire
on the moon is so short otherwise i would have given
you a longer program anyhow i am certain you
liked my little concert of course now that you have
heard the martian music you want to know how it is
produced if i were not so far famed for my veracity
i should certainly run the risk of being called something
less well sounding than a story teller but i know you
will not question my statements the indisputable facts
are that the music which you just heard was produced


amazing stories

from a solid transparent tos rod about ln inch thick
and almost  feet high at each end of this rod there
is a coil which looks like a big terrestrial magnet coil
it has however about  distinct and separate windings
the ends of these windings go to a sort of switchboard
which has a triple keyboard like an organ and both coils
are connected to this organ-like instrument by de-
pressing a key a certain pulsating current is sent
through one of the coils this in turn sets up eddy cur-
rents in the tos rod which of course is conductive
these stresses in the rod set up vibrations and cause
the rod to swing like a piano string-sound is the result
by using different frequencies different sounds arc
produced when both coils are operated at the same
time interferences take place within the rod causing
the sound to change in its quality thus by operating
the two coils while changing the current intensity and
by using different amplitudes almost every imaginable
as well as unimaginable sound can be obtained it is
thus easy to imitate a comet or a xylophone in their true
musical values nor is this all for the rod can be made
to sing and trill and it can be made to actually speak
words a good player is able to imitate the spoken or
the singing voice of any living martian equally as well
as a lifeless black phonograph dise on earth can be
made to sing the most difficult aria

  nor does the wonder stop here by using a suf-
ficient amount of power the sounds can be intensified to
such a degree that music emanating from a tos rod can
be heard plainly over a distance of  miles indeed all
outdoor concerts on mars are given by means of a
single tos rod in only one case have i seen two rods
operated simultaneously the effect in this instance
was overwhelming it was like listening to a thousand-
man orchestra and to a dozen tenors all going at one
time

  but this is not all you know that if a rod is
vibrated at a sufficient frequency it will sound a certain
note the faster it vibrates the higher the note will be
if we keep on increasing the speed or vibration we fin-
ally arrive at a stage where the note is so high that the
human ear is no longer capable of hearing it if we
keep on increasing the frequency a stage is finally
reached in which the rod sends out waves that have the
velocity of light and electricity- miles a sec-
ond this of course is well known to your physicists
on earth

  the martians make use of just this principle in
supplying the music loving people of mars with wire-
less concerts the operation is simple indeed

  not far from the equator of the planet a central
music plant is operated by a single martian who of
course is a musical genius he operates one of the
organ-like instruments of which i spoke before be-
sides the instrument the plant comprises tos rods
each  feet high these rods work exactly like the
ones just described except that they are operated at an
enormous frequency i have stood in front of them
while they were operating so close in fact that i could

   	when this was written radio loud speakers were not known
 recently radio loud speakers have been invented which can
 throw music and the human voice over a distance of several
 miles-aitthor

have touched both rods with my hands however my
ears detected not the slightest sound incredible as it
seems millions of martians at that minute were listen- 
ing to the wonderful music produced by these same
rods but not with their ears they were listening with
their brains

  i told you a few days ago how when we first landed
on mars we had been amazed to hear snatches of a
wonderful music inside of our heads what we had
been hearing was the radio music originating from these
two tos rods some  miles distant of course
radio music is nothing new the sounds of voices and
music have been wafted over thousands of miles on
earth already but your scientists still require huge
aerials with which to catch the waves and these waves
are not yet themselves audible to our ears you are
still using a variety of coils detectors telephone re-
ceivers and what not in order to translate these radio
waves into sound waves in order that your ear may
hear them

  not so on mars every martian is required for
reasons which you will understand presently to wear a
peculiar soft metallic cap from the back of the cap
a thin metallic cable runs down the martians back and
is fastened there to his metallic coat all martian
clothing as well as footgear is invariably of metallic
weave now since all pavements and all flooring car-
pets and rugs are metallic on mars for reasons which
will also be apparent to you later a metallic connection
with the earth or ground is always effected

  the metallic cable of which i just spoke does not
make contact with the cap itself but it is insulated
therefrom it connects however with a small reddish
metallic plate about the size of an american silver dol-
lar this plate in turn by means of a flat spring
presses against the temple of the wearer the cap holds
the plate in place a similar plate presses against the
other temple but this plate unlike the other is con-
nected metallicly to the cap itself from this descrip-
tion you will gather that the metallic cap performs the
function of a radio aerial while the metallic clothing
forms the ground the two reddish plates pressing
against the bare temples are made of two metals un-
known on earth and the metals are distributed over the
surface of the plate in honeycomb fashion without
touching each other now if the two plates are pressed
against the temples and when wireless waves are pass-
ing through them the waves are translated into vibra-
tions of a certain frequency it has been found that
if these vibrations reach the conscious sense of hearing
which is located in the temporal lobe of the brain
sounds can be impressed upon the brain without re-
quiring the ear and its auditory nerve in other words
the sound is heard directly within the brain without
the agency of the ears mechanism

  if this should be somewhat hazy to you a homely
though inaccurate illustration will not be amiss here
at first blush one would think that the ear is abso-
lutely essential for hearing but this is not the case
try the following simple experiment stop up both
your ears as tightly as possible with cotton so that you
will not hear a sound from outside if you are partly
deaf-and i trust you are not-all the better for the
baron munchhausen



experiment place a darning needle between your
teeth by biting on it hard and take care that your lips
do not touch the needle the needle itself should pro-
ject about one inch from your mouth now operate
an ordinary disc phonograph and with care press down
upon the record with the needles point held at the same
angle as the reproducers needle is held ordinarily
your whole brain will be filled immediately with music
exceedingly loud and clear of course in this case
you still hear with your ears mechanism the sound
vibrations being carried to the eardrum through the
bones of the head but it is interesting to note that if a
truly deaf person tries the experiment he will be enabled
to sense the sounds although not perfectly

if we can find a medium by which it will be possible to
detect these waves it will become as simple a matter to
transmit the thought waves as any other wave

  the medium of detecting these brain-waves is
found in the martian temple plates enormously sensi-
tive to the brains short wavelengths but not only do
these composite metal temple plates detect the brain-
waves they also translate them directly into a longer
etheric wavelength which in turn is shot out into space
similar to a radio signal while these waves are fairly
strong their intensity is not sufficient to carry them
over great distances as a matter of fact thoughts
have only been transmitted on mars for a distance
equal to about  terrestrial miles and even this was

the above map shows mars and its canals in mercators projection
as objects appear upside down in the telescope it should be remem-
bered when studying the above map that the top is south the bottom
north east is left west is right note how the majority of the
canals run north and south or south and north toward the poles
which is necessary in order to convey the water from the melting

  of course the function of the martian apparatus is
based on an entirely different principle and the above
experiment is only cited by way of comparison

  it goes without saying that these little red honey-
combed plates pressing against the temples are won-
derfully sensitive to etheric waves in that they exceed
enormously the most sensitive radio detector ever in-
vented by your scientists but not only do these won-
derful temple plates serve to bring distant music to the
martians brain but they still have a more important
function the fact was already mentioned to you how
we first made our acquaintance with thought transmis-
sion and how we found it impossible to transfer
thoughts without the caps being on our heads

  the act of thinking as we know it and as has been
understood on earth for a long time is merely the
action of certain nerves stimulating certain brain cen-
ters the harder we think the stronger the stimulation
this stimulation in turn sets up an undulatory motion
in the affected brain cells with the result that these
cells must of necessity vibrate like a piano wire but
anything that vibrates-no matter what the frequency
-must set up waves thus we come to the conclusion
that the act of thinking must set up certain waves now

polar snow caps equatorward the canals can be plainly seen running
over the dark areas which are therefore not seas but vast stretches
of vegetation particular attention is called to the numerous circular
dark spots only to be found at the intersection of two or more canals
these dark spots termed oases are thought to be circular vegeta-
tional tracts containing vast farms parks cities etc

exceptional extra highly sensitive apparatus being used
at the time for the experiments as a rule the mar-
tians do not project their thoughts over  terrestrial
yards as the confusion and clashing of the many waves
would otherwise become too great if a number of
martians are assembled in one room they can converse
very nicely by thought transmission without interfering
with one another the martian by long training of
his brain for generations back is enabled to tune his
mind to a comparative wide range of waves thus with
but little effort he can think in a high pitch or in a
low one as each pitch has its own characteristics-
no two being alike-it becomes easy for anyone to
listen to the selected one only it is the same as if you
converse with your friend while ten other people talk
all at one time in the same room by instinct you are
enabled to listen to your friends characteristic voice
disregarding all the other voices you tune your ear
automatically to his voice and while the sounds of the
ten other voices reach your ear you do not consciously
hear them

  exactly the same is the case when the martian con-
verses by thought transmission his brain hears only
that which he actually wishes to hear and nothing else


amazing stories

nor can one martian force his thoughts upon another
if the latter does not want to listen he simply shuts
the other out just as you can shut out your friends
voice if you do not care to listen to him you tune
his voice out by concentrating real hard on a subject
with the result that you are not conscious of what he
is talking about the same is the case with the martian

   on the other hand if the martian does not want to
have anyone listen to his thoughts he simply pushes
the plates away from his temples when of course no
thought transmission can take place

   but as usual i get ahead of myself i believe that
i told you last night how we had taken an excursion
over the mighty mars canals with our host the planet
ruler and how we had been shown the machines which
move the waters in these miraculous canals after
the inspection our host took us back to the executive
palace and once more we were seated in our transpar-
ent chairs

   our host also resumed his transparent chair in front
of his desk which as i mentioned yesterday was flat
and transparent while on top  transparent tos rods
curved like goosenecks were mounted in two semi-
circles our host sitting in front of the desk formed
the center of one of the semi-circles in such a manner
that one gooseneck was as far away from him as he
was from the other

   the august ruler hardly sat down when a -foot
transparent tos rod which was mounted on the desk
suddenly gave out a pleasant but penetrating chime-like
sound our host immediately assumed an exceedingly
grave manner and motioned us to pay close attention

   we then witnessed a most astounding procedure

    he ruler of the planet mars placed his finger upon
a black button-like contrivance in front of him and
instantly the transparent gooseneck tos rod in front of
the button changed its color and became almost milky
white simultaneously its upper sharp point began to
glow in a bluish white color and a faint discharge not
unlike tobacco smoke struck our host squarely in the
face this discharge was unlike any electrical high ten-
sion phenomenon we had ever witnessed for it was
transparent and it did not make the slightest sound
moreover it seemed to constantly undergo changes
for a few seconds the stream would be bluish white
quickly to change to a pinkish color during the next
moment then again it would appear slightly violet
one moment it would spread out the next it would look
like a single beam of light altogether it was the mosi
singular astonishing phenomenon we had ever seen

  but this was not the most wonderful part for
when our eyes were directed upon our hosts face
another surprise awaited us his expression was con-
tinually changing sometimes he would smile some-
times he wrould look very severe at other times he
would nod as if he was giving his approval to some-
thing  then again he would sway his head slightly from
one side to the other but at all times while we were
watching him we could not rid ourselves of the idea
that lie was reading something

   indeed as we were to find out later this was pre-
cisely what he was doing in other words we were

witnessing how the ruler of the planet mars was
reading his morning correspondence

  while we were still marveling the gooseneck
stopped its discharge-the ruler had read the first
letter

  we were to see immediately how he answered it
he simply touched a red button in front of the black
one which he had just released and by his demeanor
we did not find it difficult to understand that he was
transmitting his thoughts pertaining to the letter just
received to one of his secretaries he dictated for a
few minutes and when he had finished he pressed upon
the second black button in front of the second goose
neck-he was now reading his second letter

   for an hour or more he thus attended to his cor-
respondence never slacking never resting a minute
whatever the qualities of a martian ruler are it is
certain that he must be energetic to the utmost as well
as a quick worker of course we had no inkling of
what was going on we were to learn the details later

   briefly they are as follows the planet mars is
divided into  equal zones each administered by a
zone president these ten officials scattered over
the planet at different points are directly responsible
for the welfare of their zone and report to the planet
ruler once each day at a certain predetermined time

   as the most vital question on mars is invariably
the supply of water nine-tenths of the planet rulers
correspondence is on this subject so strenuous is the
ijattle for existence on mars that the inhabitants of
the planet themselves are always considered after the
water supply never before it if the zone presidents
report has been prepared by him he sits down in front
of his desk similar to the one described except that it
has fewer goosenecks than that of the ruler when
he presses the red button in front of him his thoughts
are immediately transmitted through a cable to the
executive capitol and are received by the planet ruler
i described a few minutes ago the manner by which
the message is received by him simultaneously while
the ruler receives his message a record of it is made by
one of his secretaries connected to the tall tos rod on
the rulers desk which is used to receive the trans-
mitted thought waves is a sensitive recording mechan-
ism this latter is in charge of a secretary and works
as follows a thin metallic ribbon of the thickness of
tissue paper unrolls slowly in front of a sharp stylus
the thought waves acting upon an amplifying system
operate this stylus which in turn engraves a continu-
ous wave line on the thin metallic ribbon this wave
line is perfectly legible and a martian can read it as
well as you can read an electric ticker tape thus
incoming as well as outgoing correspondence is always
recorded so it can be readily looked up should occasion
arise each tape is carefully labeled and stored away
in the archives of the capital and being of metal it
will last practically forever

   but i note by my chronometer that the time is up
and in a few seconds the telegraphone wire on my
radiomatic on the moon will be full to capacity so i
must cut off short au revoir dear boy and pleasant
dreams till to-morrow

to be continued next month

the octopus cycle

by irvin lester and fletcher pratt

concluded

  he was interrupted by the arrival of an excited
senagalese who addressed major larivet

  the boat she is smoke she go

  how what cried the four leaping to their feet
and starting down the road in the direction of the pier

  it was too true the morgana out beyond the reef
line was marked by a tiny plume of sraoke from her
funnel and as they gazed she seemed to move a bit

  quick shouted weyl lets push off a dhow

  followed by the englishman and at a longer distance
by duperret he raced for the pier and leaped into the
little craft grab a sweep he called to larivet

  propelled by sail and oar the little craft began to
swing out from the pier and then catching the land
breeze in its full strength heeled over duperret drew
in his sweep useless at that speed he shaded his eyes
and looked toward the morgana suddenly he turned
with a short bitter laugh

  look he said pointing a few hundred yards
ahead of the dhow weyl and mulgrave saw a globular
grey shape among the waves from it lying flush with
the water radiated-tentacles weyl put the tiller over
to avoid it and as the craft swung saw another and
then another it was the end

  but even as he prepared to wear the little ship round
and run back for the pier if indeed they could make
that temporary safety they saw out beyond the loath-
some globular head and spreading arms a triangular
fin-shape that cut the water with hardly a ripple

  it was charging straight at the octopus and as they
watched there was a swift turmoil in the water the
flash of a sleek wet black body a vision of dazzling
teeth and the globular head of the octopus disappeared
into a boil of water from which rose two tentacles
waving vainly off to the right another of those knife-
like fins was coming followed by more-a half-dozen a
dozen a score and suddenly around each of them there
gathered the whirl and flush of a combat

  the dhow drew ahead right toward the center of
one of those tumultuous whirlpools out of it dis-
solved an octopus that was only half an octopus its
tentacles torn and a huge gash across that inhuman
parody of a face-an octopus that was striving vainly
to escape from a flashing fate that ran behind it

  weyl shouted-duperret began to weep the unaf-
fected tears of joy of the emotional frenchman and
mulgrave stirred from his imperturbability was shout-
ing killer whales to an audience that had eyes and
ears only for the savage battles all about them

  everywhere they could see through the clear tropical
water that the killers stronger and swifter if less in-
telligent were the victors the octopuses routed were
trying to get away-as vainly as the natives had tried tc
escape from them

  let the bally yacht go shouted mulgrave to weyl
i want to enjoy this

  for fifteen twenty minutes they watched until they
saw the vanishing fin of a killer moving off to north-

ward signal that that part of the battle was over and
that the killers were departing for new fields of triumph
three men with hearts lighter than they had known
them for weeks manoeuvred the boat back to the pier

chapter x

they seem to be gone sure enough said weyl
tossing down on the table a brace of the native
pheasants it was only two days later but he
had returned from a four hours trip into the jungle

   i didnt even come across the traces of a single one
of them-unless you can call a trace the fact that they
seem to have cleaned out about all the animals in this
district even the monkeys are gone

  do you think they will come back asked major
larivet

  i am sure they will not said weyl there seem
to be perfect shoals of killer whales off the coast at-
tracted no doubt by the octopuses which are their fa-
vorite food you may be sure they would hunt down
every one as the killers are very voracious

   but what made them appear in the first place 

   god knows it is or was since they are now gone
some phenomenon allied to that which produces the
lemming migrations every twenty-eight years you
mulgrave are a biologist you know how once in
twenty-eight years these little rat-like animals breed
in such numbers that they overrun whole districts and
then migrate into the ocean where they are drowned by
the thousand

  these octopuses would have plenty of opportunity
to develop their extraordinary size and intelligence as
well as their quality of breathing air by life in the shal-
low deserted lagoons all around madagascar and if
they were actuated by a life-cycle similar to that of the
lemmings they would breed in the vast numbers which
we saw it seems the only logical hypothesis

  in any case there is nothing for the rest of the
world to fear a sort of wireless telegraphy seems to ex-
ist among animals with regard to neighborhoods where
food can be obtained in quantities and just as you will
see the condors of the andes flock to where food is the
killer whales gathered around this visitation of giant
cuttle fish

   it is one of natures numerous provisions to right
the balance of things on the earth when they threaten
to get out of joint in any direction if any other enemy
of man were to multiply as these octopuses did you
may be sure he would find an animal ally

   we were merely panic-stricken and foolish to think
we could accomplish anything we should have
waited

  and now my friend said duperret i suppose i
must bid you farewell

  yes i am anxious to get back to my monograph
on the ammonites of the upper cretaceous it will
astonish the scientific world i think

the end

author of the machine man of ardathia

a strange disappearance

thing is a lioax
ilpably a hoax

nd yet the handwriting is theirs
r a forgery
clever forgery then schultz is a
handwriting expert you know and he declares the
signatures to be genuine

  but the thing is incredible

   he two men looked at each other helplessly one
was a doctor of science the other a nationally-
known criminal lawyer several days before a
strange thing had happened the nationally-known
lawyer had been dining with his family in his home
on langlewood road berkeley california when
what was at first taken to be an infernal machine of
some sort dropped in the midst of the dinner table
with a crash upsetting the table and narrowly miss-
ing injuring the diners with its flying wreckage
yet as it was the rainy season and the evening was
damp and raw no windows had been open nor did
investigation show any of the panes or sashes to
have been broken as would have been the case had
the machine been hurled through them in short
save for some spatters of food and a few dents in
the walls made by the flying metal the room was
intact only one door had been open at the time
the door leading into the kitchen and the kitchen
had been occupied by the cook a middle-aged lady
who had been in the em-
ploy of the lawyer for five
years seemingly the in-
fernal contraption had ma-
terialized out of thin air

as if this were not start-
ling enough there was the
manuscript

  i found it said the
lawyer in the midst of
the wreckage

  the third member of
the party an ordinary
practising md examined
the manuscript with curi
osity it had evidently been tightly rolled and was
yellow as if with age

  you say he said that this purports to be a
message from two men who dropped out of exist-
ence some twelve months ago as i am only visiting
in the east bay for a few weeks i am not acquainted
with the facts of their disappearance if it wouldnt
be too much trouble 

  not at all replied the doctor of science john
reubens was a fellow professor of mine at the

university and held the chair of physics raymond
bent was a student working his way through college
by doing secretarial work for him reubens was a
man of about forty-odd well-known in scientific
circles as a brilliant if somewhat eccentric physicist
in fact he had studied under andonce collaborated
with jacques loeb before the death of that great
mechanist he lived with his widowed sister in a
large old-fashioned house on panoramic way and
had a splendidly equipped laboratory there in which
he carried out strange experiments of his own i
will frankly confess that while we acknowledged him
to be a brilliant man in some respects the majority
of other professors thought him a nut because of
wild theories he was wont to voice in relation to
time on the other hand he made no secret of
regarding us as so many dumb doras without vision
enough to see beyond the tips of our noses thats
the best picture i can give you of the man who went
into his laboratory with his secretary on the th
of october  and never came out again but
let his sister give you her version of the affair i
clipped this interview with her out of the san fran-
cisco examiner and saved it

  lhe md took and read the proffered piece of
paper

   at four oclock raymond bent came and i let
him in by way of the side door he chatted with
me a few minutes before going to the laboratory
where my brother was the laboratory is on the
second floor and i had oc-
casion to pass it several
times on my way to and
from my bedroom my
brother never told me
about his experiments and
it was understood i was
never to enter his work-
room one time the door
was ajar and i saw the two
of them standing by some
sort of a machine that is
all except at about four-
thirty when t was passing
the laboratory door on my
way downstairs i heard a terrible crash i guess it
was a pretty bad one because all the plaster was
knocked off the ceiling in the room below when
my brother didnt answer my call i got frightened
and went in things were upset-you know basins
and things-but neither bent nor my brother was
there

  the article went on to state that reubens sister
admitted that the machine had also disappeared

  some bright reporters remarked the doctor

          of americas great entomologists made the state-
 ment that if the insect world ever took it in its heads
 to conquer this planet there would be no stopping them
 man would be powerless against billions and billions of
 ants if they should ever become organized anyone who
 has been in the tropics and has seen army ants at work
 and has seen how they cat everything that comes their
 my humans and cattle included will understand this
 statement much better let no one think that mr flaggs
 picture is overdrawn km even to the milking of human
 beings for ants do keep cattle now and do milk them just
 as we milk our domestic cows


relentlessly the loathsome thing clambered upwards until it had settled itself firmly on neck and shoulders the two antennae
reached down my cheeks gripping the corners of my mouth and c lamping themselves there    and as i fought to unseat the
inhuman rider perched on my shoulders i knew what i was  i was an inferior animal being conquered beaten trained by a

superior one




amazing stories

of science got to speculating if the professor hadnt
hopped off in some sort of an airship he had built
but the theory wouldnt sb-nd up against the fact
that while one end of the laboratory was all glass
and the great door-like windows swung wide open
a crow could hardly have winged its way through
the iron grilling which protected them on the out-
side

  wasnt there talk of missing money in connection
with the affair asked the md seems to me
now that i do recall reading of the case only   
the nationally-known lawyer nodded unfor-
tunately yes at the time of his disappearance the
professor had drawn twenty thousand dollars of his
sisters money from the bank for reinvestment the
money had been issued to him in treasury notes of
one thousand dollars each some people were un-
charitable enough to find in this fact full explanation
of his disappearance however notes bearing the
serial numbers of tlffrse issued to him have never
appeared on the market as far as is known

  at this juncture the doorbell rang and a few
minutes later the president of the university and two
members of the faculty were ushered in when
they were seated the lawyer addressed the gathering

  i take it that everyone of you is aware of why
i have asked you here tonight he held up the
manuscript my letters i believe explained ade-
quately how this document came into my possession
it only remains for me to say that i have submitted
it with specimens of the handwritings of professor
reubens and raymond bent to herman schultz the
chirographist and he pronounces the writing and
signatures in the manuscript to be identical with
that of the specimens submitted

  the president of the university nodded i be-
lieve that is clear to all of us the manuscript is
held to have been written in the hand of raymond
bent and bears both his signature and that of pro-
fessor reubens very well then we are acquainted
with the peculiar manner in which you received it
but as yet are unaware of its contents if you
would kindly read the communication to us   
thus bidden the lawyer cleared his throat and
read what is probably the strangest document ever
penned by human hand

the document

whether any human eye in the age i have
left behind me forever may chance to read
this writing i do not know i can only trust
to providence and send what i have written into the
past with the fervent prayer that it will fall into the
hands of intelligent people and be made known to
the american public

  when  came into the professors laboratory on
the afternoon of october   i had not the
slightest inkling of the terrible fate that was so soon
to befall me if i had i would probably have fled
in horror from the place the professor was so
absorbed in tinkering with the mechanism of the
machine which had engrossed his interest for nearly
two years that he did not at first notice my entrance

 picked up a book lving open on a stand to one side
of him it was h g wells the time machine
 smiled at the absurdity of a great professor being
interested in such truck the professor turned and
caught me smiling impossible fiction i remarked
with what god help me was an illy-concealed sneer

  fiction yes replied the professor but why
impossible 

  surely you dont think there is anything possible
about this i exclaimed

  yes i do

  but to travel in something that has no reality
what is reality  the earth on which we stand 
the sea on which we sail the air through which
we fly have they any existence outside of the
attributes with which our senses endow them
but i can touch the earth i protested i can
feel the sea but i cannot touch or handle time
neither can you touch or handle space said the
professor dryly but you move in it and if you
were to move through space say from this spot to
the city hall in oakland you would probably cal-
culate the journey took you fifty minutes of time
in that sense time would have a very real signifi-
cance for you and you would have moved in it to
the extent of fifty minutes but if i ask you why
it isnt possible to move ahead in time not fifty
minutes but fifty centuries you consider me insane
your trouble -is that of most people my boy the
lack of enough imagination to lift your brains out
of the accustomed rut

  perhaps so i replied reddening angrily but
save in fiction who has ever invented a time
machine 

  i have answered the professor he smiled at
my look of disbelief now this thing he added
patting the mechanical creation affectionately is
a time machine

  it was the first time he had ever told me what
his invention was supposed to be

  you mean it will travel into the future i asked
skeptically

  if my calculations are correct-and i have every
reason to believe they are-then this machine will
take us into the future

  us i echoed

  he walked over and shut the door with a bang
have you any objections to taking such a trip
none at all i lied thinking the chances of doing
so were very remote

  that is splendid then there is nothing to pre-
vent our giving the machine a trial this afternoon
the machine had two seats with backs probably
two feet high the professor seated me in one of
them while he occupied the other just as a pre-
caution to keep you from falling out he smiled
buckling me in with a broad leather belt in front
of himself he swung a shelf-like section of the
apparatus on which was arranged a number of dials
and clock-like instruments in some respects-save
for the clocks-the shelf resembled the surface of
a radio board whatever cogs and wheels there
might be were hidden in the body of the machine
under our feet

  that said the professor indicating a dial regis-
ters the years and centuries the one next to it the
weeks days and hours and this handle he touched
a projecting lever controls the machine before
sitting down he had lifted the bottom from his seat
and revealed below it a hollow space filled with tools
and provisions it is the same with your chair
he said with satisfaction and if you examine the
leather belt which holds you in you will discover
that it also acts as the holster for a colt automatic
and a box of spare cartridges he settled himself
the master ants



comfortably in his seat and grasped the lever are
you ready my boy

  so business-like was his manner so self-assured
that for a moment a qualm of doubt assailed me
what if the confounded thing were to work then
my commonsense got the upper hand again of
course it wouldnt already i began to feel sorry
for the professor at my nod of assent he pressed
down on the lever the machine shook there was
a purring noise but that was all i smiled partly
with relief partly with derision whats the mat-
ter  i asked and even as i spoke the whole room
spun like a giddy top and dissolved into blackness
the roaring of a million cataracts dazed and stunned
me there was an awful sensation of turning inside
out a terrible jolt and then it was all over and i
was lying sprawled out and half senseless in a wreck
of disintegrating iron and steel my first thought
of course was that we were still in the laboratory
the machine had turned over or exploded and
nearly killed me thats what came of listening
to bughouse professors and their crazy inventions
i felt my head and limbs blindly sound enough i
seemed save for a few scratches and bruises i
struggled to sit up as i did so i came face to face
with an old man with a tangled mane of gray hair
and an unkempt beard it was several minutes
before i realized that i was looking at the professor
even as i did so i became conscious of the fact
that black whiskers hung down on my own breast
and that the top of my head was as bald as a
billiard ball i looked around and saw that we were
lying on a prairie-like expanse of country some
trees were far off to one side and the immediate
plain was covered with stunted bushes and tufts of
grass anything more different from the laboratory
could not well be imagined as i stared stupefied
not yet realizing the awful truth the professor
gave a deprecating cough

im afraid he said in a voice that was his yet
curiously changed im afraid i overlooked a very
vital thing he shook his head how i was so
stupid as not to think of it i cant understand 
think of what i mumbled

  of the almost elementary fact that as we jour-
neyed into the future our bodies would age

his words brought me to my senses incredible
as it seemed this was the future at least we
had come to rest on some other spot than that of
the laboratory and undoubtedly physical changes
had taken place in the professor and myself

  we must return at once i cried

  of course replied the professor at once but
how 

  i looked at him dumbly

  as you see he remarked picking up a piece of
rusted crumbling metal the machine just kept go-
ing until it was so old it fell to pieces my boy we
have had a lucky escape

  a lucky escape i echoed

  yes for if the machine had not worn out when
it did we would have gone on until we perished
from old age

  but i thought you told me once that old age
was not caused by the passing of time

  i did but you can readily understand that in
our journey through time we encountered more or
less friction from environment of course the faster
we traveled through a century say the less action

of environment on our bodies there would be in a
given period of time but stil there would be
enough to age us after awhile at least such seems
to have been the case

  how far have we come i asked

  i dont know all my instruments are destroyed
as you see the machine is junk

  but we can build another

  what with

  i groaned machine tools weapons all were
gone god knows how many centuries in the
future we stood on a bleak prairie middle-aged and
old the rotting clothes falling from our backs with
only our bare hands to protect us from whatever
dangers might lurk for us in this new and unknown
age with despairing eyes i stood up and scanned
the horizon look professor look i cried seiz-
ing him by the shoulder arent those men running
towards us

  the professor focussed his eyes in the direction
my finger pointed perhaps a half mile away hav-
ing seemingly just topped a rise was a body of
what appeared to be men even at that distance
something about them looked peculiar and when
they came nearer we saw that they were running
with bowed backs their heads jutting at almost right
angles with their bodies and their arms dangling
loosely in front of them

  those are the queerest looking men ive ever
seen i said in alarm looking around for a weapon
to defend myself with in case of attack and pluck-
ing up the only thing available a piece of rusted
iron the professor did likewise thus armed we
stood up to await their approach for there was no
place to hide and nothing behind which we could
find shelter perhaps three hundred yards away the
odd men spread out into a semi-circle there were
probably twenty-five or thirty of them naked with
not even a breach-clout shaggy of hair and beard
and with hair almost as heavy as fur running down
their backs and on the weather sides of their arms
and legs they continued coming at a fast gallop
but just when it seemed they would run on and
over us they reared back-much as do horses when
reined in-and came to an abrupt stop shaking their
heavy manes and pawing at the ground with their
feet

  very peculiar very peculiar indeed said the
professor thoughtfully except for the clearly
defined features of their faces and the general struc-
ture of their bodies one would not take them for men
at all

  they seem more like apes i retorted i hope
theyre not as savage as they look speak to them
professor before they start something and see if
they cant talk

  the professor held up one hand in a peaceful
gesture and took a step forward he raised his
voice so as to make it carry across the thirty or
forty feet which still separated the shaggy men
from us

  we are american travelers he shouted is
there any among you who can talk english 

  the only response to this was a snorting and a
rearing accompanied by a rustling sound which
affected the nerves disagreeably several of the
shaggy men broke from the circle doing a great
deal of plunging and rearing before reluctantly
coming back into formation again

  by god professor i said fervently the goose-


amazing stories

flesh appearing on my body i dont like this at all
the professor repeated his question in french
spanish italian he asked it in portuguese and in
what he later told me were several indian dialects
but all to no purpose only every time he paused to
catch his breath there came that dry rustling as of
the rasping of metal on metal suddenly he stepped
back and caught me by the shoulder

  those creatures he whispered gesturing towards
the shaggy men are controlled

  controlled i exclaimed what do you mean 
  that there is something on their shoulders

  i thought the professor was taking leave of his
senses what could it possibly be i began then
stopped for the shaggy men were in motion they
divided one group going to the right of us and
the other to the left in our rear they joined ranks
and made us retreat before them it was then i
caught my first glimpse of the unbelievable riders
that perched on their shoulders and rode them much
as human beings ride horses long antennae reached
down on either side of the shaggy mens faces grip
ping the corners of their mouths and serving to
guide them as with bit and bridle other antennae
waved in the air or rubbed one on the other pro-
ducing the rasping noise which had so grated on
my nerves the bodies to which these antennae were
attached were about a foot in length

  in the name of god what are they professor
i screamed half raising my piece of iron as if to
throw it at the slowly advancing horrors but the
professor gripped my arm dont start fighting
he warned sternly unless you have to as to what
they are im not certain but i believe them to be
some sort of ant-like insects

  we retreated slowly at first then at a brisk
walk finally at a trot when we moved in a given
direction the insects were content to keep their steeds
at a distance but when we veered from it they
urged on the shaggy men to head us off

   i believe those insects are driving us in front of
them as men herd cattle gasped the professor

  we topped a rise and saw stretching away before
us a level plain far out on this plain-several
miles away perhaps-were numerous mounds and
it did not take us loig to suspect that they were our
destination several times the professor sank to the
earth utterly winded unable to run another step
at such times i stood over his body with my iron
club determined to sell our lives dearly but there
was no need to fight the shaggy men were brought
to a halt and their uncanny riders waited patiently
until the professor could regain his feet when we
were once more urged ahead at a brisk pace

  night had fallen and it was almost too dark to
see when we finally staggered through a narrow gap
into a large enclosure and were left to our own de-
vices the splash of water led us to a stream where
we slaked our thirst and bathed our sore and swollen
feet and then too miserable and tired to care what
further happened to us we huddled together for
warmth and fell asleep

the master ants

several hours later the professor and i
awoke chilled to the bone and no wonder
for we were practically naked only shreds
of cloth clinging to our backs the moon was rid
ing high overhead making the enclosure as light

as day now and then the silence would be broken
with a shrill scream or a heavy snort once or
twice we heard the metallic slithering of antennae
and once in looking up i saw an insect crawling on
top of a mound its sinuous body etched sharply
against the sky i shivered with more than the cold
professor i whispered is this a nightmare or
am -i really awake 

  im very much afraid that both of us are wide
awake said the professor with a sigh

  but it doesnt seem possible i exclaimed
those bugs    my god professor what has hap-
pened to the world

  the professor pulled thoughtfully at his unkempt
beard i dont know in our day there were sci-
entists who held insects to be a growing menace to
mans rule perhaps    but you could see for
yourself that those ants rode men

  were they men

  yes i believe they were

  but their hair

  could be accounted for by the fact that they
were exposed naked to all kinds of weather the
fit in this case the strong hairy ones would survive
and breed a few centuries of such breeding could
possibly produce the type we saw

  the thought of a world in which insects were the
dominant species and men subject to them as beasts
of burden filled me with horror if such were the
case what would our fate be in spite of the chill
night wind in spite of the fact that we were cold
and hungry i dreaded the morning but daylight
came at last and then we were better able to exam-
ine our surroundings the enclosure was probably
a half mile square and fenced in with an irregular
line of mounds anywhere from ten to twenty feet
high across the stream from us bedded against
the walls of a mound were several hundred of the
shaggy men soon after daylight they were afoot
and came down to the stream to drink wading into
the water in some cases up to the waist and drink-
ing with an animal-like abandonment that filled me
with disgust it couldnt be possible that those crea-
tures had once been human beings like the pro-
fessor and myself no no it seemed incredible
that mankind could ever have fallen so low

 some of the shaggy men crossed the stream to
view us more closely most of these were females
stooping forward as they walked one of them
came quite close to us uttering plaintive cries -and
the professor stepped forward in an attempt to speak
to her at this a great hulking bull of a fellow
with fiery red hair that glinted in the sun and who
would have stood well over six feet if he had
straightened up rushed at the professor with a roar
the latter retreated hastily whereupon the leader
of the herd-for you could have called the gather-
ing of shaggy men nothing else than a herd and the
red-haired giant the leader of it-turned upon the
females and with blows of his fists and sundry
kicks of his splay feet drove them back across the
stream where they all men women and children
took- to grubbing in the ground for some sort of
roots

  and you call them human i said to the pro-
fessor

  they once were

  i shook my head those creatures are bent
almost double even the children are so formed and
the posture seems a natural one to them
the master ants



  perhaps they were bred for that characteristic

  bred

  why not if things are as i suspect then those
men have become the domestic animals of the in-
sects in the beginning they were probably bent
double by bearing the weight of their riders ac-
quired characteristics are of course generally con-
ceded to be uninheritable but little is known of the
possibilities of variation-what effects the constant
doing of a thing may have on the germ-plasm it is
possible that mutations with certain peculiarities of
structure were born and men such as you see bred
from them

  before i could make reply we had our first leis-
urely view of one of the ant-like insects it sud-
denly appeared on top of a ten-foot mound a few
yards from where we stood its body was in three
segments of an almost metallic blackness being
raised on stilted feet about eight inches from the
ground four feelers or antennae waved in the air
or rasped one on the other and were- attached to a
mobile head there was no indication of eyes yet
the weird thing paused in one spot for all of five
minutes as if intently regarding us and i for
one believed that it could see other insects ap-
peared on the mounds and soon the air was full
of metallic slithering at the sound the males of
the shaggy herd pricked up their ears stamped the
ground with their feet and then continued feeding
on the other hand the females ran towards the
mounds stretching up their hands to the insects
on top of them and calling out with imploring cries
then we witnessed a strange sight the ants
crawled down the wall in one stream paused beside
a female for a moment or two and then crawled
up the wall again in another it was a few minutes
before the reason for this dawned on me

  good lord professor i exclaimed suddenly
theyre milking them

  it was true the females of the shaggy men were
so many cows being milked again the horror of
our position came over me we were castaway in a
future age where man no longer was lord and mas-
ter instead he was a beast to be driven like a
horse milked like a cow and-since-ants ate meat
or used to-slaughtered like an ox i wiped the cold
sweat from my forehead

  professor i said we must escape from here

  of course replied the professor but how-
and where to

  there was no answer to make the mounds
hemmed us in and even if we could get beyond them
and away from our present captors there were
doubtless other mounds and other insects who would
capture us if the world was really in the hands of
ants then we were animals to be hunted down
tamed or killed this age into which we had blun-
dered was not safe for man-at least not for
civilized man i closed my eyes to shut out the
horrible sight of crawling insects i tried to shut
my ears to the sound of insane slithering but heard
readily enough when the professor said somewhat
nervously my boy i believe theyre coming over
here three of the ants had mounted on the backs
of shaggy men and were trotting them towards us
i looked desperately around for my piece of iron
it was gone so was the professors someone or
something had removed them while we slept nor
was there anything else that could be used as a
weapon in this dilemma we turned and ran but

were soon overtaken two of the shaggy men closed
in on me while the third held the professor power-
less i fought like a fiend but the four hands of
the shaggy men were like iron bands the grip of
their fingers like vises in a few minutes i was
helpless then came the crowning horror one of
the insects dismounted from the back of its steed
and clinibed on mine at the feel of its suction-
like legs on my flesh i went crazy the muscles
writhed in horrified protest under my skin i bit
and screamed and lashed out with my feet all to
no avail relentlessly the loathsome thing clam-
bered upwards until it had settled itself firmly 
neck and shoulders two antennae reached down
my cheeks gripping the corners of my mouth and
clamping themselves there almost at the same in-
stant the shaggy men loosed their grip of me and
 was free for a moment i stood still dazed and
trembling then the antennae gave a pull at my
mouth wrenching the head back with a cruel jerk
with a scream of pure terror i plunged forward
in a mad leap clawing upwards with my hands at
the awful incubus on my shoulders tearing futilely
at the antennae which gripped my mouth and as
i fought to unseat the inhuman rider perched on
my shoulders i knew what i was i was a horse
being broken a wild mustang knowing for the first
time the torture of bit and saddle of spur and quirt
i was an inferior animal being conquered beaten
trained by a superior one the blind unreasoning
fear i felt a thousand wild horses being brought
under the yoke of all-powerful man must have felt
i ran-it seemed for ages-goaded spurred until
i could run no more my gait slackened became a
trot a walk finally i stood still frothing blood
and saliva at the mouth gulping painfully for air
trembling in every limb the incredible insect
breathed me for a few minutes before again urging
me into a trot i made no protest i was beaten
cowed the antenna on the left pulled i went to
the left the one to the right tugged i went to the
right my rider drove me past mounds where ants
perched watching much as cowboys of the past were
wont to straddle corral fences and observe one of
their number perform they slithered what was
undoubtedly their applause for about twenty min-
utes i was put through my paces made to walk
canter circle wheel and stop at command finally
the insect slid from my shoulders and i sank to the
ground too miserable and distraught to care whether
i lived or died i flinched and closed my eyes when
it patted me with its antennae and slithered sooth-
ingly much as a man might pat a horse and at the
time say there there old boy dont be afraid
afterwards a quantity of raw vegetables and what
appeared to be coarse grain cakes were tossed to me
and the insect went away i lay there for a long
time hardly stirring a finger when the professor
came up and sat down beside me

  no he said they didnt ride me too old
perhaps

  he picked up a grain cake and gnawed at it
hungrily

   try one my boy theyre not half bad besides
youll feel better if you eat something

   i suppose it seems queer to tell it but we sat
there on the rough grass with the slithering ants
coming and going about their business and ate those
cakes neither one of us had tasted food since the
day before-or was it several centuries before-


amazing stories

and were half starved only hunger could make
eating at all bearable with my sore and lacerated
mouth suddenly the professor spoke to me in an
odd tone

  my dear boy i dont like to arouse any false
hopes but will you take a look at that thing in the
air and tell me what you think it is

  i glanced up apathetically enough then at sight
of what i saw i leaped to my feet with a wild cry
for soaring through the air at a height of about
seventy feet from the ground was a craft of shining
metal

  an airship i shouted deliriously an air-
ship

 ad

yes it was an airship there could be no
doubt of that and where there was an air-
ship there must be human beings men

   then civilized people are still living on the earth
cried the professor exultantly quick my boy
shout and attract the drivers attention

  he had no need to urge me pain weariness and
despair were forgotten as i waved madly help
i shouted dancing up and down help

  the strange craft jerked to a pause in mid-air
hung motionless for a moment then sank directly
earthwards for what must have been forty feet or
more over the side looked a girl her beautiful face
wearing a look of amazement

  for gods sake help us i shouted again or
the ants   

   i got no further fear throttling my voice for the
ants were coming thousands of them suddenly
appeared in sight literally covering the tops and
sides of the mounds they saw the airship there
could be no doubt of that a half million antennae
reached threateningly heavenwards and the angry
slithering of them appalled the ears the woman
shouted something what i could not hear and waved
her hand even as some of the insects surged
down from the mounds and made for us the airship
dropped it was a close thing we leaped and
clutched the metal sides hanging on with the grip
of desperation as the strange craft brushed the earth
like a feather and soared aloft again i felt the
sucking claws of an insect fasten to one leg and
kicked out in a vain endeavor to rid myself of it
suddenly a withering ray flashed from a cone in the
girls hand and played on the insect there was an
acrid smell of burning a little flash of light and
the grip on my leg relaxed with a sob of relief
i stumbled over the side of the car and fell in a
heap on the floor safe my boy safe exulted
the professor who had preceded me then turning
to the girl who was regarding us with wide-eyed
wonder he asked what year is this

   she answered in perfect english

  ad 

  yes

  hum muttered the professor making a quick
mental calculation five hundred and twenty-five
years in the future

  but i was too busy adjusting myself to this sud
den change in our fortunes to give him much heed
far below us the earth was unrolling like a checkered
carpet mounds hillocks trees sweeping by at con-
siderable speed what power was driving the air-
ship t wondered there was no sign of a propeller
neither did the craft possess wings and a rudder

nor any of the other properties associated in my
mind with flying machines only the girl stood
in front of a square box and now and then shifted
a small lever she was i judged twenty-one or two
with red-gold hair eyes like slanted almonds and
skin of yellow ivory her lithe body was of medium
height and clad in a loose-flowing robe of some
scarlet-colored material

   where are we going i asked her

   to the castle she answered

   as she regarded me i realized for the first time
that i was naked but the professor seemed bliss-
fully unconscious of the lack of any clothes

  we have to thank you for rescuing us from a
very dangerous and awkward position he said
courteously

   i took you for beast men at first she replied
and if you hadnt called out in english i shouldnt
have stopped tell me where do you come from
and how did you fall into the hands of the master
ants 

   we came from the past replied the professor
and landed on the plain about seven miles from
where you picked us up the insects-what you
call master ants-captured us there

  the past questioned the girl where is
that  over the sea 

  no answered the professor in another age
an earlier one than this out of the past you know

   the girl didnt know she stared at the professor
as if she thought the hardships we had undergone
had unbalanced his mind as for me i was content
to sink into a seat and wonder what kind of place
was this castle she was taking us to and what
manner of people were they who inhabited it in the
year of our lord  i had not long to wonder
about an hours flight brought us in sight of a
vast structure which crowned the top of a high
hill its walls glittered like dull silver under the
rays of the afternoon sun and its roof seemed to be
one large garden or park never had i seen any-
thing more beautiful or bizarre here and there
domes of silver towered among swaying palm trees
spruce and live oak the car swooped down like a
homing bird and came gently to rest on a wide plaza
and was immediately surrounded by a crowd of curi-
ous people of all ages and both sexes the women
were clad in gay-colored dresses the men wearing
white trousers with soft linen tunics both men
and women went bareheaded and barefooted and
the men were clean-shaven at sight of us the
women and children fell back with cries of alarm
and some of the men made as if they would attack
us forthwith but the girl cried out that we were
not beast men but english-speaking travelers whom
she had rescued from the master ants at this
announcement hostility ceased but the amazement
with which we were regarded deepened

   how is this possible  said one handsome young
fellow save for ourselves there are no english-
speaking people left alive in the two americas and
for three hundred years no word has come from
europe the master ants rule this country and
perhaps the world where then could these men
have come from unless it be from the ranks of the
beast men

  we are time travelers began the professor
we come from   

  but a tall commanding man of about sixty in-
terrupted him
the master ats

 our guests are worn and weary time enough
 for questions after they have bathed and fed and
 rested come come are we of science castle so
 inhospitable as to leave two wayfarers to faint at
 our very door

 at these words the young fellow fell back abashed
 and willing hands lifted us from the aircraft it is
 hard to tell of the exquisite enjoyment of the next
 few hours we were led into a central roof build-
 ing of dull silver and bathed and washed soothing
 lotions were applied to my wounds our bodies
 were anointed with refreshing balms and swathed
 in soft robes tangled beards were clipped to the
 skin and our faces shaved after all these minis-
 trations i glanced in a mirror and saw the reflected
 features of a man of about forty-odd bald of head
 yet not entirely unreminiscent of the youth i once
 had been food was served to us as we lay on soft
 couches first a thick broth aromatic satisfying
 then various dishes whose names i did not know
 but all were palatable after eating we fell asleep
 and slept we discovered later until eight oclock
 of the next morning

science castle

without a doubt our couches had been
enclosed by four walls when we fell asleep
what miracle was this we were lying in
an open space with only some green shrubbery be-
tween us and the wide plaza on one side and walks
and gardens on the other three children were romp-
ing in the plaza evidently laughing and shouting
yet their voices came to us but faintly

   i suppose were not dreaming said the pro-
 fessor he got up and took a few steps forward 
 then came to an abrupt halt this is very odd
 he said and even as he spoke the four walls magic-
 ally enclosed us the professor standing with his face
 against one of them

   good morning said a laughing voice i for-
 got your room was to be left opaque and turned on
 the ray

   it was the handsome youth who had questioned us
 the day before

   the ray asked the professor

   oh i forgot exclaimed the youth every-
 thing is probably strange to you  he ray is wthat
 makes the walls transparent so that one can look
 through them

   but what is it

   the vouth looked puzzled why i dont know
 that i can tell you offhand he scratched his head
 in perplexity i guess its like electricity used to be
 thousands of people turned it on every day but
 nobody could tell you what it was

   we dressed ourselves in white trousers and soft
 tunics of a fair fit and followed him to a central
 dining room it was strange to walk through what
 was undoubtedly the corridor of a large building and
 yet never be certain whether one were indoors or out
 two or three hundred people were breakfasting in
 this central room and i noticed that they seemed to
 be a mingling of all races there were some with
 the slanted eyes and yellow skin of the chinese
 others plainly had more than a drop of negro blood
 in their veins yet all were mingling with their white
 companionson terms of perfect equality in science
 castle i was to learn later no distinction was made
 as to race or color among the early inhabitants had

 been numbered japanese negroes and chinese as
 well as whites a common foe a common vital
 danger had served to weld the various strains to-
 gether race and color antagonisms a scientian
 told us would have proved fatal to the small com-
 munity of necessity a mingling of races took
 place my grandfather was a negro the girl who
 rescued you has chinese blood in her veins what-
 ever differences existed among our people in the
 early days has been ironed out by centuries of a com-
 mon culture and environment but i am antici-
 pating

    breakfast consisted of fruit cereal scrambled
 eggs and milk and we served ourselves cafeteria
 fashion after eating we repaired to the plaza
 where several hundred people were gathered seated
 on the grass or on rustic benches seats were given
 us on what was evidently the raised platform of a
 speakers rostrum the tall elderly man who had
 spoken for our welfare the night before received
 us kindly

   my name he said is soltano director of
 science in science castle i am speaking for my
 companions as well as for myself when i assure you
 that you are welcome to our home and refuge and
 need fear no harm however you must realize that
 it has been centuries since strangers like yourselves
 have entered science castle and understand that
 your rescue and coming has caused us untold amaze-
 ment now that you are clothed and shaved we
 readily perceive you to be not beast men but civilized
 beings like ourselves yet are we puzzled as to
 whence you could have come

   the professor replied courteously my com-
 panion and myself thank you for your kindnesses to
 us and gratefully receive your assurances of future
 asylum and safety a little of your curiosity i can
 understand and shall do my best to satisfy it

    he had raised his voice so that the words might
 carry to the people below

    there is no need to pitch your voice above its
 ordinary key explained soltano this rostrum is
 really an instrument which broadcasts and magnifies
 it everyone-even those of us who are employed
 elsewhere-will pick up what you say by means of
 ear-phones

    i noticed then that the attentive people in the
 plaza were holding round devices to their ears and
 ceased wondering how some of them leaning on the
 parapet two hundred yards away expected to hear

    splendid said the professor some sort of an
 amplifying radio machine i see he beamed on
 soltano i merely talk to you is that it and all
 will hear for a moment i thought he was going to
 interrupt the interview long enough to examine the
 platform but if he wanted to do so he conquered
 the temptation my name he said is john
 reubens late professor of physics at the university
 of california and this lad here is raymond bent my
 secretary we are time travellers

    time travellers echoed soltano

    yes replied the professor from the year 
 this means of course that we have come five cen-
 turies and a quarter out of the past

   there was a stir in the crowd below soltano
 looked amazed as well he might this is a strange
 thing vou are telling us john reubens he said at
 last and well-nigh incredible much simpler would
 it be to believe that you had managed to come over


amazing stories

 the sea from europe or from asia never have we
 listened to such a tale before

   nor anybody else replied the professor with
dignity as we are the first human beings ever to
make such a trip

   and how did you come

   by means of a time machine the remains of
which lie rotting on the spot where the master ants
discovered us he then proceeded to tell of the
building of the time machine of our incredible
rush through space and of our awakening in another
age then he told of our subsequent capture by and
experiences with the insects when he had finished
excited talking and gesturing broke out among the
people below evidently there were doubting
thomases among them who discounted our story
but the professor was not disturbed

   if you are amazed at what i have told you he
said how much more amazed are my companion
and myself to find ourselves in a future where ants
ride men as steeds and human beings live penned in
such a castle as this such a state of affairs was not
even dreamed of when we left our own day and age
naturally we are curious to learn how it has come
about

vur historians are not quite clear as to that
replied soltano if you came through time
from  then you left your period nine years be-
fore the ants began their attack on mankind it was
in  that the papers printed news of a queer hap-
pening in south america natives came fleeing
from the jungles with stories of how the white ants
were eating everything up in the forests-even men
in the united states no one paid much attention to
the news the world at that time was in a state of
political unrest and the government and people were
watching europe and building up a great air force
they were too busy to give heed to preposterous
yarns emanating from latin america a year later
the newspapers again flamed into headlines with news
from argentina peru and brazil small towns in
the interior of these countries were being devastated
it had always been known that termites would de-
stroy things carelessly left exposed in the fields or
jungles but now they were eating up brick and
stone buildings collapsed at the touch of a hand
men woke and turned to wake a sleeping companion
who dissolved into dust at a pressure sunday sup-
plements carried lurid stories and sensational pic-
tures for the edification of their readers then all
such nonsense was swept into oblivion by the fact
that poland declared war on lithuania russia
moved to intervene and italy and france came to
death-grips for five bloody years in the united
states ensued what were called prosperous times
munition factories provided well-paid work for
thousands of workers and made millions of dollars
for hundreds of millionaires everybody was busily
employed and had no time to think of crazy happen-
ings reported from crazier spiggoty republics only
a few scientists from the smithsonian and other in-
stitutes went down to south america to investigate
and wrote back long reports which were read with
foreboding by a few learned men and ignored by
everybody else the papers they wrote-the records
of those days-are preserved in our library

  but the master ants asked the professor
where did they come from and how did they over-
whelm the united states

    soltano waved his hand i am coming to that
the master ants were first noticed six years after
the depredations of the white ants commenced how
they came nobody knows only in the nests of the
termites in the little galleries and chambers under-
ground something stupendous was taking place
something fraught with disaster for the human race
during thousands of years the white ants had un-
doubtedly been changing evolving acquiring god
only knows what knowledge it is all speculation of
course but you doubtless recollect how the bees by
feeding their larvae different foods will produce at
will a queen a drone or a worker well the white
ants had discovered how to make such food-and
to feed it to their larvae at any rate the master
ants appeared no one had ever seen them before
they swarmed down from the jungles by the hun-
dreds of thousands and wherever they went the peo-
ple were stricken and fell in the fields and the streets
we now know that the termites bit them injecting a
subtle poison into their systems which induced a
species ot paralysis but at the time it was only
known that of every three that fell two were de-
voured and that the third one recovered stupid
beast-like to become the creature of the master
ants in vain the southern republics sent their
soldiers to battle the insects guns crumbled to pieces
in their hands armies lay on the ground to bivouac
and only one soldier out of every three ever rose
again-and he rose to bear an ant on his shoulders
and chase his fleeing countrymen panic spread
natives fled to the seashore and put to sea in all
kinds of unseaworthy crafts--only to drown by the
thousands when the master ants finally occupied
the crumbling ruins of rio de janeiro the whole
world was forced to realize that something terrible
was happening in south america and when fifteen
years later all south america having come under
their sway the termites were reported to be making
inroads on the canal zone a feeling of uneasiness
swept through the people of the united states still
it seemed impossible that the mighty northern nation
could be invaded and flouted by such an insignificant
thing as an ant newspapers ran articles written by
government experts pointing out how absurd it was
to even entertain the thought south america had
succumbed said the experts because she had been a
tropical wilderness without proper chemical defense
elaborate plans were drawn up showing how the
border states were protected from invasion by sys-
tems of pipes and sprays showing how fleets of
airship were prepared to drop tons of chemicals and
explosives only the scientists who had studied the
tactics and methods of the ants knew how futile
these preparations were but they and their sug-
gestions were ignored by the petty politicians and
nincompoops who were directing the affairs of the
country

  soltano paused i stared at him wide-eyed

  and the ants came breathed the professor

  yes the ants came millions of them were killed
with explosives with gases and poisonous chemicals
but their numbers seemed as exhaustless as the sands
on the seashore in the space of a year they ate up
the pipes and put the sprays out of commission but
you will have to read the history of those times for
a more detailed account then you will learn how
the united states soldiers marched against the in-
vaders and met the same fate as had previously be-
fallen the armed forces of south america and ilex-
the master amis



 ico the scientists had suggested that the soldiers go
 mailed in a composite metal they had made from the
 blend of three other metals comprehensive experi-
 ments having shown it to be the only substance the
 ants could not devour guns pipes everything pos-
 sible they said should be protected with a casing of
 this metal no one paid any attention to them re-
 buffed a group of them interested financial backing
 and retired to this hill here they congregated ma-
 chines and workers and started building the castle
 you now see it was intended at first for an observa-
 tion base mferely an outpost as it were from which
 to spy on and study the habits of the insects but as
 the years passed and it become increasingly clear
 that the country was doomed the place became
 thought of as a permanent home and refuge com-
 menced in  it was not finished until the year
  for some reason the ants were comparatively
 speaking slow in infesting north america per-
 haps the cooler climate had something to do with this
 for instance they swept through south texas and
 all of the southern states before they fared further
 north when their coming finally drove the inhabit-
 ants of this vicinity panic stricken before them the
 scientists-those of them who still lived-entered
 the castle accompained by the workers and their
 families and we whom you see today are their
 descendents

    but the rest of the people cried the professor
 what became of them

u they went crazy with fear replied soltano

 for fifty years the united states was increasingly
the habitat of terrified mobs the economic life of
the country became disrupted citizens white and
black fled from the southern states and added to the
congested panic of northern cities famine raised
its gaunt head crime became prevalent hundreds
of thousands died of hunger of disease epidemics
those who could beg borrow or steal a passage
abroad fled to europe to asia out of what was
estimated to be a population of a hunderd and twenty
millions in  only seven millions were living in
america when the ants turned north

  and now asked the professor

  in the whole western hemisphere there are prob-
ably a few hundred thousand beast men bred by the
master ants for food and transportation

  i stared at the professor with horror only ves-
terday it seemed we had left a populous thriving
america great industrial cities had sent their smoke
and ash into the sky giant locomotives had carried
thousands of people on two ribbons of steel over
thousands of miles of country and now    now
   it was all as if it had never been could it be
possible that five hundred years had dissipated an
empire five hundred years

  come said soltano enough of such matters
for the nonce you will learn more of us as the days
pass as you become better acquainted with us in-
dividually

  he led the way down into the plaza where we were
immediately surrounded by the crowd and warmly
greeted

soltano tells of the progress and danger
of the age

when i stepped down from the rostrum on
that first day in science castle it was to
meet the girl who had rescued the professor
and myself from the master ants her name was

theda if anything she looked more beautiful than
she did the day before

   you have gone through much danger raymond
she said shyly

   it was worth it if it brought me to you i re-
plied  and meant it

   she did not seem displeased

    it is the hour for bathing let us go to the pool

   i looked around for the professor but he was
walking away with a group of elderly scientians
who were evidently bent on entertaining him

    very well i said

    the pool was an artificial pond perhaps fifty yards
 square i plunged after her into the pool when i
 drew myself panting out of the water at the other
 end of the pond it was to find myself sprawling be-
 side the handsome lad who had called me to break-
 fast ilis name i learned was servus and he was
 thedas twin brother their parents he informed
 me were both dead theda and he were enthralled
 with my accounts of the life and customs of 
 by the time we were ready to dress for lunch the
 three of us were firm friends

   in the days that followed i learned a great deal
about science castle and its inhabitants with
theda and servus i walked the parapets which
circled the roof of the castle and looked down the
steep sides that fell a sheer eight hundred feet before
they touched earth from the foot of the castle the
hill sloped away to the east as far as the eye could
see stretched a level waste and to the northwest lay
a range of somber hills on the plain twenty-five
hundred feet below grew nothing green the sight
reminded me of something about which i had won-
dered more than once

   how do you get water  i asked servus

   in the earl days he replied we relied on
wells boring as deep as four thousand feet but two
hundred years ago they began to fail us there was
a terrible time i believe when we were faced with
a water famine efforts were made to bring water
from distant lakes but without success then just
in time our chemists discovered how to make water

   make water i exclaimed

   yes from hydrogen and oxygen you know now
all the water we use is manufactured and stored in
great tanks far down in the depths of the castle
from whence it is raised by means of force pumps

    w onderful i said marveling at such ingenuity
 but wonderful things were what one learned to ex-
 pect at science castle for instance the professor
 and i were invited one day to be present at a history
 review to be given to the children of the castle the
 walls of the classrooms were made transparent by
 means of the ray and there was all the illusion of
 being outdoors highly pertected projecting devices
 showed moving pictures depicting the building of
 the castle it made me gasp with awe when i
 realized that the opening reels of this stupendous
 picture had been taken five hundred and fifteen years
 before one saw the motor caravan of scientists and
 workers coming to the hill and watched breathlessly
 as the earth was broken by great steam-shovels one
 saw the vast walls of the castle growing upward
 foot by foot and finally the finished structure being
 furnished and stored with all the mvriad inventions
 and devices of the twentieth and twenty-first cen-
 turies in the same manner we were shown how the
 castle was enlarged in  workers sheathed in
 protecting metal armor labored to raise walls when


amazing stories

these walls were finished and floors installed they
were scoured with flaming rays which hardened the
nietal and destroyed whatever insect life might have
gotten inside them so inch by inch we watched the
pictured story of how the castle had grown to its
present proportions

  some moving picture i breathed to the pro-
fessor what a knockout that would be for cecil
b demille did you notice the scene where the
panic stricken people rushed by pursued by the
ants i shuddered and the one where the
scientists and workers were hoisted up the walls into
the castle  what i cant understand is why the
ants couldnt have swarmed over the walls and wiped
everyone of them out

   soltano overheard me because he replied the
walls were electrified nothing could have lived on
them after the current was turned on

   about a week after this the professor and i were
taken into the body of the castle proper far down
under the fairy-like buildings and blooming gardens
on its roof were the machine-shops the laboratories
which made possible the pulsing life above here
we saw great dynamos and whirring machines at
whose functions i could not even guess in one vast
room men were putting the finishing touches to what
were evidently a number of airships in another
workers were manufacturing crude oils and thick
greases whole floors were given over to experi-
mental and research work of too complicated a na-
ture for me to attempt to describe the professor
was enthralled he was in his element here and
hated to go on

   what do you do for metal  he asked suddenly
iron tin zinc

  hemmed in as we are replied soltano suf-
ficient nietal has always been difficult to obtain
however we have managed it a great deal of our
tanks wheels shafts and so forth are made from
pulp from trees grown in the gardens above and
even from vegetable tops leaves and vines which
treated by a chemical process we have discovered
serve our purpose very well iron is the one metal
however for which we must mine in those hills
north-west of us are old mines which we still work
when ore is needed the work is hard and danger-
ous the men engaged at it must go clothed in pro-
tecting metal and be constantly protected with flam-
ing rays however some day when ore is needed
you may go with us in the airships and see the whole
process for yourself

   he dismissed the subject hastily evidently having
something of further interest to show us

   that he said pointing to great metal tanks and
a mass of complicated pipes and whirring wheels
is where the water is made

  he pressed a button the walls surrounding us
became transparent and looking out we could see
the brown slope of the hill suddenly i focussed
my gaze about twenty feet from where we stood
was a small mound something behind it stirred

i caught a glimpse of a metallic bodv of waving
antennae yes said soltano it is a master ant
they are all around us but i did not bring you down
o show you them i am going to show you some-
thing far more deadly he guided us into a large
lift under us the foundations of the castle sink
into the ground for a hundred feet it is where we
manufacture the composite metal when needed the
lift sank silently into blackness the noise of clanging

machinery above grew fainter seemed farther away
almost ceased we stepped forth into a wilderness
of massive columns soltano pressed the now fa-
miliar button and the walls faded we could see the
black earth beyond them and even it seemed a foot
or two into it something gray out there was mov-
ing and turning along little runways and tunnels
millions and millions of tiny things were ceaselessly
burrowing and gnawing for a moment i did not
understand then soltano spoke and enlightenment
came to me there were the termites--the white
ants

      ehold the enemies we fight said soltano
-u solemnly the insects out there are far
more dangerous to us than the master ants whose
creators they are those termites are seeking to
demolish the very foundations on which the castle
rests by eating away the earth from under them

   i felt the gooseflesh rise on my skin

   i hree times in the last one hundred years have
we had to sink our foundations further into the
earth originally this basement was only fifty feet
deep now it is a hundred in a few years it will
be more than that

  but good god i cried cant you do something
to stop them

  he shrugged his shoulders so far-no  how-
ever our chemists our various scientists are busy
experimenting night and day it is hoped that we
may perfect a poison a ray that will kill them off
prevent them from coming near the castle walls
and if you cannot asked the professor

  if we cannot replied soltano then some day
   he made a fatal gesture with his hand

   i thought of the busy joyful life far above of the
green gardens and the laughing women and children
i thought of theda and i suddenly realized how
much she had grown to mean to me

  professor i said that night when we had re-
tired to our room with all those machines and tools
at your command couldnt you make another time
machine 

   i possibly could replied the professor

  then why dont you

   perhaps i shall soltano has promised to put a
laboratory at my disposal you know

  much relieved i turned away here was a way
out for theda and myself i fell asleep and dreamed
i had taken her back on a time machine to  and
was showing her the university campus and pointing
out the time on the campanile clock at breakfast
theda stood behind the counter and filled my tray
with cereal fruit toast and eggs that was one
thing i had early noticed there were no idlers
toleiated in science castle all worked at something
useful one week servus for instance washed
dishes three hours a day the next he would be tend-
ing to the vegetable gardens bringing in the fresh
heads of cabbage and lettuce gathering the firm red
carrots or digging potatoes at my own request i
was given such work i was amazed at the fertility
of those gardens amazed that fruit trees would grow
at all under such conditions

   is the soil renewed very often  i asked servus
   he shook his head it is never renewed

  then you must have good fertilizers

  we have-electricity

   electricity i exclaimed

  why yes taken from the air by means of
the master ants



 magnetism but you shouldnt marvel at that so
 much didnt a german engineer do as much in
 your day  but whereas he got two crops from
 sandy soil we get seven

   so it went i had noticed no animals of any sort
 in science castle not even cows yet there was no
 lack of eggs butter milk or meat servus again ex-
 plained the mystery milk is made from turnips
 and potatoes he explained i believed a man
 named ford did that in  eggs and meat are
 manufactured synthetically he went into technical
 details which there is no need to set down here

   truly a wonderful place this science castle it
 was difficult to realize that its brilliant inhabitants
 were chained to a hill-top by insects which for cen-
 turies had been mans hopeless inferiors but were
 they so chained hadnt theda rescued the pro-
 fessor and me by means of an aircraft and hadnt
 soltano shown us others in the process of being
 built  and hadnt we been invited to take trips in
 them  one night while  sat with her on the parapet
 in the moonlight i asked t heda about it yes
 she replied we have air vessels but save for min-
 ing ore they do not do us much good

   why not i asked

   because outside of science castle there is hardly
 a spot they dare land

   but there is europe and asia i exclaimed
 perhaps the ants do not control there

   on the average of once in every ten years she
 replied expeditions have left here for over the
 seas-and never returned my father commanded
 the last aircraft to attempt the flight lhat was five
 years ago she added softly i pressed her hand

   but they seem to be wonderfully well-controlled
 machines i said what drives them

   radio power waves are sent from a controlling
 center in the castle here and received by a device
 incorporated in the airships themselves complete
 control of the machine is invested in the driver by
 means of a lever which oprates a very simple me-
 chanical arrangement for a radius of several hun-
 dred miles and in fair weather the aircrafts are ab-
 solutely safe and easily handled many of us use
 them for pleasure rides but beyond that- she
 shook her head perhaps atmospheric conditions
 interfere with the waves when sent over too great a
 distance perhaps the receiving apparatus fails to
 operate beyond a certain point though theoretically
 they should pick up power waves four thousand miles
 from the sending station all we know however
 is that those who venture too far-vanish perhaps
 they fall into the sea and are drowned or worse
 still on the plains and the master ants    her
 voice shivered to silence for comfort against a
 black spectre which took on the hideous form of an
 insect we drew together

   theda i said unsteadily o theda would
 you    will you  

   in answer she kissed me

the master ants take to the air

 under the thin metal roof which is all that
 shuts away from us the hordes of conquering
 ants i am seated putting the finishing touches
 to this manuscript of the terrible catastrophe which
 has occurred i can hardly write we were standing
 one day by the parapet when a young scientian who
 had gone on a pleasure spin planed down from the

 sky and landed on the plaza his face was ashen-
 grey

   what is it demanded soltano sharply

   the ants gasped the breathless youth the
ants have taken to the air

   to the air what do you mean

   that they have mounted the backs of insects of
wasps a yard long and are flying

   instantly the castle was in an uproar from every
direction the scientians came rushing from the
depths of the castle from the gardens and the pool
they assembled irf the plaza and listened to the tale
the youth had to tell attracted by strange activities
among the mounds he had flown nearer the ground
than usual when great insects had spread gossamer
wings and pursued him fortunately the speedy of
the airship had outdistanced them though at first
it had been a close chase when he finished speak-
ing soltano mounted the rostrum and addressed the
gathering

   fellow scientians he said if what we have
just heard be true then science castle is in immedi-
ate and grave danger you will remember that we
have often discussed the possibility of an alliance be-
tween the master ants and other insects now it
seems they have enslaved or enlisted a winged insect
probably of the bee family not only that they have
evidently fed them with special foods until mon-
sters capable of bearing a master ant aloft have
been produced sooner or later we shall be attacked
the great cone must be manned at once the chemical
pumps made ready let everyone hasten to his post
for we are facing the gravest crisis in our history

   i stared at the professor with fear he stared
back at me grimly

   what do you think i asked with dry lips

   that the situation is desperate

   but the ray cones the acids

   my boy he said solemnly if those insects have
 really taken to the air then god help us

   i	sank nervelessly into a seat then sprang up
again as the remembrance of something sent a thrill
of hope through my heart

   the time machine i cried surely you have
finished it by this time

   the professor nodded yes he said it is
ready

   then we can make our escape by means of it

   he looked at me pityingly im afraid not
   whats the matter with it

   nothing only you forget something

   forget what

   how we aged when we travelled in it before
   well

   dont you see it would have the same effect
on us again

   for a moment i did not understand then the ap-
palling truth staggered me like a bolt from the blue
the professor read the dawning comprehension on
my face

   yes he said slowly yes if age is caused by
the action of environment then the same friction
would be encountered by the body whether it traveled
forward in time or backward in returning to 
we would be subjected to the same resistance the
same wear and tear as we were in coming from it
that would mean annihilation for me death for
yourself and theda would it be much better you
could expect to find yourself an old man of eighty

a visitor from the twentieth century



arkham slept what could be more
commonplace than this nightly respite
from worried and worrying conscious-
ness during which the nerves and con-
stitution and muscles exhausted by the
work of the day are permitted to generate new
power and vigor for the work of the day to come

  and yet it is the very nature of this particular
sleep that troubles markham and will continue to
trouble him for the rest of his life he is as vision-
ary as ever but due to the sleep or perhaps to the
disillusionment which followed it he no longer
bores everyone by trying to put his visions into
practice or by explaining how they could be so put
very seldom now does he allow his dreams to come
to the surface but when he does nobody can deny
that he cuts a truly admirable figure

  to begin with markham is somewhat of an archi-
tect considerable of an architect if we are to judge
by his success he specializes in the hollow square
and cooperative types of large apartment houses
but at the same time if some wealthy faddist or
nouveau riche desires a residence of radical design
embodying all known mechanical conveniences and
many that are not known as yet he comes to mark-
ham the worst of it is that his friends and fellow
architects seem to imagine that it is not latent genius
that is responsible for his successes but rather su-
perior practical ability that he got this ability by
industrious application and all that sort of thing
at school markham must realize how futile it would
be to attempt to assail this conspiracy of thought and
his present policy of reticence is perhaps the best he
could observe under the circumstances

  the day in particular had been a trying one for
him and had held what he maintains was a pecu-
liar series of coincidences first of all he had spent
the whole morning in preparing his entry in the
 city beautiful contest that was being con-
ducted jointly by several newspapers two magazines
and a department store the contest was to deter-
mine the best plan for an ideal city on the site of
new york nothing of course could be done
about removing the one that was already there but
a comparison of the actual city with the ideal one
would arouse considerable interest and bring much
publicity to all parties concerned furthermore
there were vague rumors that the board of estimate
and apportionment had
more than a passing inter-
est in the matter and that
if the winning plan ap-
pealed to it it might take
primary steps toward
moulding little old new
york into the ideal city

  at any rate markham
had reacted to the contest
as a cat reacts to the smell of fish he had set his
fertile brain to work and finally had evolved what
he considered the ideal plan but at the same time
as he later revealed there was an undercurrent of
suspicion that told him that this was not at all his
ideal plan that it was merely the best his brain
could do under pressure that at any time of the
day or night there might leap to his cerebellum when
he least expected it a vision of the ideal city and
that this city would be a thousandfold better than
the one he had produced

  so he pigeon-holed the plan and drawings ex-
pressing the fervent hope that the vision of the
ideal might occur to him before the day two weeks
away when the plans would have to be submitted

  he had intended to spend the afternoon of that
day at a library examining certain scientific and
technical magazines as well as catalogues for new
household devices and labor saving machinery which
he would be able to incorporate into his future
houses he found several interesting ideas but was
soon bored and strolled into a cinema house it
was just his fortune to witness some fantasy that
attempted to portray the city of the future he could
not help smiling as he walked out of the theater
and whenever he thought of the coincidence during
supper in the evening he planted himself in the
most comfortable armchair in his study and forti-
fied by his pipe prepared to enjoy an hour or two
of reading not until he had opened the book did
he notice that it was a pseudo-scientific novel by
verne or wells or one of that class and then he
threw his head back and indulged in a long hearty
laugh

  his burst of mirth over markham felt that in
view of the nature of his activities that day he would
rather not read that type of book lest he develop
what he feared most a one-track mind he was
tired however and very comfortable and the smoke
of his pipe was beginning to form fascinating spirals
in the air the reader may recall a time when he
was in a similar situation nevertheless he finally
persuaded himself that the book was no worse or
less desirable at that moment than any other book
so he commenced to read

  we are to assume that at some point in his reading
the print on the pages before him seemed to jumble
together into a heap and the pipe somehow slipped
through his lips and his eyelids acquired the weight
of lead his sense of time his consciousness every-
thing became hazy he sensed that he was falling
asleep but he was not aware of any subsequent
blankness he seemed to regain full consciousness
almost immediately

he was in a queer little room it seemed to be
an eight-foot cube the hollow interior of the
building block of some brobdignagian infant but
while it was indeed eight feet in all three dimen-
sions it could hardly be
called a cube for the walls
melted into one another
and into the floor and ceil-
ing in smooth curves that
appealed to markhams ar-
chitectural nature there
was not an angle in the
place against one wall
was a neat little metal cot
with a peculiar mattress which he found by testing
was simply an inflated rubber pad tucked inside of an
immaculate white sheet that was the sum total
of bed clothing he was quick to surmise that as
there were no coverings warmth must be supplied
in some other manner he looked about him again
and was amazed to find that there were no heating
device and no windows with a scientific eye he
looked toward the bottom of the walls and as he
expected he found about eight inches above the
level of the floor a tiny row of holes extending all

   a ny new thought that comes along that shows us
 what will happen hundreds of years hence is always
 greeted with acclaim by the true scientifiction fan our
 new author presents us with such a situation in a novel
 dress and at the same time you will find that there is
 plenty of new scientifiction in this interesting story


amazing stories

around the room putting his hand to one he felt
a stream of warm fresh air pouring silently and
steadily into the room he saw another row of
holes an equal distance from the ceiling and knew
these to be for the exit of the exhausted and over-
heated air that rose to the top of the room he also
saw a hemisphere of frosted glass that looked as
if it had been cemented into the ceiling from which
soft light streamed outward and downward

   he began to think about getting out and looked
for a door there it was entirely of metal and
without panels its bottom formed the only break
in the curve of the floor into the wall but even so
wherever corners occurred they had been beautifully
rounded off he approached there were no visible
hinges and no handle only a thin stream of light
along the top bottom and left side told that it was
a door at all he pushed against it and it yielded
in a moment he had passed through and it swung
quickly back to its original position

  markham glanced rapidly about and took in the
features of the room he now found himself in it
was considerably larger than the chamber he had
just left and there was the same lack of right-
angled corners up above were hemispherical illu-
minators but these were not lit great floods of
sunlight were pouring into the room through a single
glass pane that formed almost the entire wall on
his left it took markham little time to see that the
glass was quartz giving free access to the all-
important ultra-violet rays the wall opposite him
as well as the one through which he had come held
several of the queer hingeless knobless doors to
his right-

   funny that he had not noticed him before there
behind a long narrow flat-topped desk sat a man
regarding him interestedly with sympathetic blue
eyes he was leaning on the desk with both elbows
a pen in his right hand on his left was a file tray
on his right several rows of buttons and electric
bulbs but it was the clothing of the man behind
the desk that first made markham doubt that this
experience was anything more than a casual dream
of a super-modern hotel

  there were two visible garments the inner was
almost skintight and apparently combined warmth
with freedom of motion the outer was a sort of
loose cloak that combined dignity with modesty
both were dark blue in color with a thin yellow
braid running along the edges the mans feet were
visible beneath the desk and at sight of them mark-
ham was compelled to display astonishment they
were encased in high-arched open sandals and the
feet were not the corned bunioned products of our
civilization but a shapely pair that could have served
as models for the feet of a sculptured apollo yet
their possessor was apparently well past middle age

  there was silence for several minutes the man
at the desk doubtlessly some sort of official was
unperturbed and seemed to have the situation well
in hand while markham was so utterly astounded
that he could not think of what to say or to ask first
at last the official dropped his gaze and pushed one
of the buttons to his right on the desk the bulb
beside it flashed and he picked up from its metal
holder a black roundobject that looked like an
earphone he put this to his ear and listened for
a moment then applied it to his lips a guide
he said that was all and he replaced the tiny

phone in its holder there was a click and the light
in the bulb disappeared the man resumed his writ-
ing as if markham no longer existed

   behind the official and to his left was a double
door through this a moment later came a hand-
some young man clad exactly like the official but
with a blue braid instead of the yellow the older
man looked up at him and smiled

  you again john

   yes sir was the reply but i dont mind its
interesting work

  the official resumed his writing and the young
man turned to markham could you come with
me sir

  markham followed him out through the double
door and found himself in an immense corridor
that was all of thirty feet in width about one
hundred feet to their left the passage ended in a
right angled turn but on the right it extended for
almost as far as the eye could see it was well lit
by those frosted glass illuminators the side from
which they had emerged was lined with double doors
but on the opposite side markham was surprised
to see the glass display-windows of shops a long
row of them as they walked silently along they
passed many people who w-ere clad in garments
similar to those of the official and of the guide but
an undecorated black in color these evinced only
a slight interest in the unusual clothing of the
stranger the latter fascinated by the novel adver-
tisements and the size of the shops each one was
three times as large as the average store he had
known noted that no two were alike as to product
one displayed canned boxed and bottled food ex-
clusively another fresh groceries and vegetables a
thirdstationery supplies and so on markham won-
dered if the business world had finally reached a
millenium and eliminated competition

   they passed through a single door different in
color from the others ascended a short flight of
steps and emerged through another door upon a
beautiful terrace formed by a set-back in the build-
ing the set-back was evenly fifty feet wide the
innermost ten feet formed a walk the pavement
markham noticed was the same as that of the in-
terior a black substance that must have been poured
out in a liquid state and seemed to yield to the step
the outer forty feet of the set-back was a beautiful
belt of grass flower beds and small shrubbery

   the guide reduced the pace to that of a stroll
by your clothing i judge you to be of the early
twentieth century he ventured

  the succession of wonders and novelties had
beaten upon markham with the remorseless pre-
cision of a trip hammer now he sensed a momen-
tary let-up and a flood of questions occurred to him

   i am as you put it he replied to the guide of
the early twentieth century but where or when
am i now and how did i get here

   this is new york in the late part of the twenty-
first century you are what is known here as a
visitor

  undoubtedly said markham with a slight at-
tempt at sarcasm i could hardly call myself a
native of this place even if i was born on
manhattan

  the guide laughed good naturedly what i
meant he explained seriously is that you are of
an entirely different period of time or rather of
a visitor from the twentieth century



history for we are coming to doubt more and more
that there is such a thing as time how you were
brought here-well the advanced psychologists and
hypnotists of our colleges have been very successful
in their recent experiments they think nothing of
yanking out of the so-called past some person whose
consciousness is cn rapport with their united con-
centrations of late they do it not through any
scientific interest but just for the practice as a prank
you might say your case for instance

  this thought set markhams brain reeling there
was something in the guides tone that discouraged
him from pursuing the matter he dared not try to
pursue it he felt that he would go insane if he did
he thought of the situation of a psychologist who
is anxious to know the mental reactions of a man
falling from a cliff and yet does not care to make
the experiment personally

  it was all too bizarre he must not question any-
thing he must take everything for granted he
turned to the guide what is your name he
asked it will be more convenient to know

  my name is john warren -c-

  markham was aghast what he exlainied
has mankind come to the number and filing-case
stage so soon

  not at all was the laughing reply that is
simply for purposes of mail and communication
the  means that my building is in the twelfth
row from the south the c means that it is the third
row from the west the  means that out of all the
families named warren in building -c mine is
considered number 

  you spoke said markham or all the families
named warren and you have given a peculiar sig-
nificance to the word building is it that families
of similar names are confined to separate houses
why no there are upwards of ten thousand
people to a building you know and there are bound
to be several familes of the same   

  upwards of ten thousand people what kind
of buildings have you here

  warren smiled indulgently that will come
later he said

  alt this time they had been following the same
path now a low murmur seemed to be flowing up
over the set-back from below they neared a spot
where a tiny walk led to a sort of fenced platform
that overhung the edge of the flowery terrace this
they entered and the guide invited markham to
look over the edge

  wonders and wonders it took the man from
the twentieth century several minutes to grasp all
that he saw

  two hundred feet away was another building a
gigantic affair a quarter of a mile in length there
was a set-back on the same level as the one on which
were markham and his guide and the former quickly
assumed that the two structures were identical the
set-backs were above the fifteenth stories and the
buildings towered up for another ten stories
twenty-five altogether not so much markham
thought visionaries of his time had predicted edi-
fices of a hundred stories and more but these
seemed to go in more for length and perhaps for
width

  he looked downward at the street level the
width of two hundred feet had been divided into a
central band of one hundred feet and two outside

bands of fifty feet each the central portion was
merely a great promenade paved with the universal
black substance that seemed to absorb the sunlight
rather than to reflect it back into the eyes at inter-
vals there were gigantic kiosks leading probably to
the buildings on either side the flanking bands
consisted of five endless moving platforms each
ten feet in width the speed of these platforms
increased with their distance from the promenade
so that the two outer ones moved at approximately
twenty-five miles an hour there were collapsible
metal benches on the bands while passage from one
to another was facilitated by means of occasional
hand-rails

  the scene was strangely familiar the solution
leaped to markhams brain all at once

  why he cried such a street as this was de-
scribed by a writer of my time 

  then he was a prophet said warren calmly
it is not so easy to prophesy the inevitable

  but markham continued not having caught the
guides last remark he mentioned i believe streets
a hundred yards in width and ten moving platforms
in each direction while you have here only five
nevertheless the coincidence is   

  we have such a street it is called the fifth
way and was once known as fifth avenue there
are ten platforms in each direction and the fastest
move at a speed of nearly fifty miles an hour but
that is in the exact center of the island and the
outer platforms are used only by people desiring
to travel from one end of the island to the other
very quickly as a mans residence place of busi-
ness and recreation centers are all in the same build-
ing in most cases there is very little cause for traffic
between buildings two platforms for each direc-
tion in fact would be sufficient to handle the traffic
were it not that the more platforms there are the
higher the speed that can be attained cross-town
ways move at a lower level

  fascinating as was the sight of the moving plat-
forms and the hurrying black-clad people who
seemed quite adroit at slipping from one band to
another that moved about five miles an hour faster
markham felt that he was delaying the sight-seeing
tour for that was what he sensed their present walk
to be they regained the promenade and after a
short distance the guide led the way back inside
they came to a place in the huge corridor near a
corner of the building where a peculiar track paral-
leled one wall it was set deep into the floor and
was about two feet wide near the end of the track
were half a dozen little trucks their square plat-
forms level with the floor each platform had at
its sides two frail-looking metal railings

  warren motioned markham to the foremost plat-
form admonishing him to keep a tight grip on the
railings he seemed to doubt the strangers ability
to do this however for he took from a nearby rack
a leather belt which he fastened around his waist
and to both railings he then mounted the platform
behind using no belt for himself and indicated to
markham a tiny lever on the under side of the right-
hand railing which he was to press

  markham did so the platform started slowly
forward with a low rumble and a similar sound
from behind apprised him that the guide was fol-

  h g wells in when the sleeper wakes


amazing stories

lowing suddenly he felt his feet shoot out from
under him and there was a sensation as of being
shot from a gun this lasted an instant and then
his position resumed the vertical and his momentum
slackened rapidly but without any unpleasant sen-
sations looking about him he found himself in
a sort of glass roofed glass walled shed the plat-
form was trundling toward the end of the track he
released his belt and dismounted

  what was that he demanded breathlessly of
warren who had followed immediately

  a high speed escalator the guide explained
the platforms move forward and are caught by
hooks in a rapidly revolving belt at the end of the
incline they are released and are slowed down by
compressed air pressure we have climbed ten
stories and are now on the roof

  they emerged from the shed and markham found
that it was so they were on another black-paved
promenade running to one side he saw far below
the terrace they had just quitted and abysmally
farther down the street he ran to the other side
and was amazed to see at about the same height as
the terrace on the exterior a park it was square
conforming to the shape of the building and some-
thing over three hundred yards square in dimension
in the center an ornate fountain was hurling rain-
bow-hued water high into the air and catching it
again in a marble pool tiny paths radiated from
the fountain to the sides and numerous childrens
playgrounds nestled in the shadows of the ten-story
walls but predominating over the whole pleasant
scene was a color little associated with modern cities
and not at all associated with visionary cities of the
future-the green of well-kept lawns and trees

  and as they moved slowly along stopping from
time to time to watch the playing children and the
chatting housewives warren explained the construc-
tion of the buildings

  they were all alike square in shape measuring
about a quarter of a mile on each side and twenty-
five stories in height the upper ten stories were
purely residential the apartments ranging in size
from single rooms to large suites the size of the
suites depended strictly on that of the family and
not on its means the lower fifteen stories were
taken up with offices schools and shops on the
interior of the square its surface level with the six-
teenth story was a twenty feet layer of soil sup-
ported on a massive roof of steel and concrete be-
low this roof and down to the street level were
such institutions as did not require the light of day
including gymnasia auditoria theaters and houses
of worship there were three more stories below
the street level one of which was entirely taken up
with generators of the electricity used in heating
lighting and operating all machinery throughout
each building had its own electrical installation
run on power from a gigantic plant five miles north
of manhattan which plant in turn received its cur-
rent from niagara falls the other two stories were
used for storage and by the distribution system

  and what is that asked markham

  warren smiled the distribution system was now
so commonplace that it was hard to believe that there
ever was a time when it did not exist over across
the hudson was the huge distribution center where
were received food products from the west and
south and clothing and manufactured goods from

the great factory cities at niagara falls and along
the mississippi from this center an intricate sys-
tem of pneumatic tubes spread under the hudson
and into manhattan an individual tube for each of
the scores of buildings through these the food
products and clothing and manufactured goods were
shot in great containers to the cellar stations from
which they were relayed through a smaller system
to the shops

  the noise from the moving ways far below had
diminished considerably the number of people on
the promenades both on the roofs and on the set-
backs had increased as more and more people their
days work done were trying to get in a last walk
by the rays of the setting sun the two men came
to a corner of the building where markham saw
that the path on which they moved was connected
to the corresponding paths on the two adjacent
buildings by slender bridges of cantilever construc-
tion they proceeded across one of them the man
from the twentieth century conquering by sheer
mental effort the dizziness that threatened him

  i have it he exclaimed suddenly something
seemed queer something bothered me when i looked
at the streets and i have just realized what it was

i	have not seen any automobiles

  warren was puzzled for a moment automo-
biles he murmured automobiles  oh you
mean gasoline surface vehicles

  yes said markham where are they

  there are none

  what you mean to tell me that there are 
more automobiles why in my time new york
was being carved to suit them streets were being
widened sidewalks were being narrowed residences
were being torn down ruthlessly to make streets
and cross streets for them skyscraping garages
in the business districts were being contemplated
and built nearly every family had an auto and
manufacturers were trying to convince them that
they needed two and now less than two hundred
years later you say that there are no more automo-
biles impossible he almost felt hurt

  as might have been foreseen said warren
calmly the whole industry that was growing so
abnormally fell in one crash around  a grow-
ing shortage of petroleum that the manufacturers
were trying desperately to keep under cover could
no longer be concealed there were terrible riots
and mob scenes in new york chicago detroit and
in fact all over the globe in a thousand cities use-
less automobiles were piled up in the streets and
burnt the plants of the two greatest manufac-
turers were mobbed and razed to the ground for
a month the united states suffered a complete chaos
then things gradually adjusted themselves new
oil fields were subsequently discovered and an effi-
cient substitute for gasoline was produced synthetic-
ally by an experimental chemist but the gasoline
car never regained the pinnacle it had held before
the chaos

  why not asked markham

  you have said began warren apparently ir-
relevantly that the plans of whole cities were being
changed to suit the convenience of the automobiles
that houses were being torn down playgrounds bi-
sected by roads parks destroyed by the fumes of
the gasoline and pedestrians crowded to the walls
or killed by the score was it not so 
a visitor from the twentieth century



  yes markham conceded but  

  the duration of houses was halved by the con-
stant vibration of passing trucks the manufacturers
in feverish competition were making the cars cheaper
and cheaper and more and more defective forty
percent of the men at the wheels were unfit to drive
-et did so thanks to incompetent laws the roads
were choked with gaudy hire-cars called i believe
taxicabs driven by men who lured by the profits
had obtained licenses after a minimum number of
lessons and no experience whatever men who after
a days work were mere automatons and incapable
of being entrusted with the human lives they were
responsible for was it not so

  yes yes agreed markham the facts were
all undeniable yet it was the least bit irritating to
have them served up to him in this gatling-gun
fashion his irritation unknown to him was based
upon a human and excusable pride in his own times
as contrasted with these

   well continued warren the eyes of the people
heretofore blinded to these abortive conditions were
opened to them by the chaos the automobile no
longer had the same significance no longer seemed
so necessary or rather so desirable in view of the
conditions that accompanied it the manufacture
of the cars declined ceased to be profitable and in
time stopped altogether today we have a form of
surface vehicle used solely for pleasure one that
you would hardly recognize

  our roads consist of parallel metal tracks
twenty feet apart each a foot in width the vehicles
are forty feet in length fifteen in width and gyro-
scopic balancing on two huge rubber-tired wheels
they are known colloquially as capsules for the
body consists of a capsule-shaped unbreakable quartz
glass it is blown into the standard shape and holes
are pierced for entrance and ventilation the cars
are comfortably furnished and self-operating for
diey draw power by roller contacts and trolleys you
might call them from the metal track to which they
are held by a sort of electro-magnetism automatic
safety devices stop the car as soon as it comes within
fifty feet of another anyone desiring to use one
of the capsules goes across the hudson to the depot
and hires one it bowls along over hill and dale
maintaining an even speed of fifty miles an hour
fifty miles an hour exclaimed markham is
that considered a proper speed for a pleasure ride
certainly said warren it is just the right
speed once all responsibility and care of operation
are removed besides you forget that the world ad-
vances one hundred years before your time
twenty miles an hour was considered tempting fric-
tion

  true markham acknowledged

  so absorbed had he been in the conversation that
he had kept his eyes on the pavement before him
for most of the time they had been strolling north-
ward now his eyes raised for the first time en-
countered a vast structure a mile away that seemed
to fill the entire quarter from horizon to zenith

  the new york tower explained warren the
only real skyscraper it has been deemed necessary to
have it is not hollow but a solid structure having
as you see pyramidal setbacks it is not as wide as
the other buildings but together with the great plaza
and gardens that surround it occupies the same
space that four of them would occupy it is

one hundred stories in height and contains all the
executive legislative and judicial offices of the mu-
nicipal and state governments and also the local
branches of the various federal departments this
may seem strange to you but the duties of govern-
ment have been considerably changed and reduced
the number of municipal ordinances for instance
is only about one-third what it was in your time
the cellar of the tower contains the post office
from which letters and packages are distributed by
pneumatic tubes and tunnels to the branch post of-
fices in each building

  he referred to his wrist-watch a queer one-
handed device ah yes in a moment you will see
something interesting watch the top of the tower

  markham watched soon he saw a gigantic af-
fair resembling a net rise slowly into the air lifted
by four balloons taking shape it resolved into a
great square funnel of netted fabric the open mouth
of which was fully five hundred feet above the top
of the tower to which it was connected by a slender
net-work chute the balloons were at the corners

  now said the guide look to the west

  from that direction a large stream-lined mono-
plane was splitting the air in straight unhalted flight
it flew faster than markham had ever seen an air-
plane go before as it passed above the funnel it
released a large sack which dropped down through
the chute into the building proper the monoplane
kept on toward the east seeming to descend

  the western mail said warren at present
the flight from san francisco takes ten hours but
that will be remedied within fifteen years by which
time the transcontinental pneumatic will be com-
pleted

     the flight from san francisco takes ten hours
but that will be remedied    the phrase rang
through markhams brain moving him to alternate
spells of laughter and wonderment these people
seemed to have the most awful conception of time
and speed he now feared to comment or to express
admiration for what warren regarded as the com-
monplace lest he should reveal his provincialism

  look again cried warren this time to the
east

   far off in the heavens a tiny silver shape resemb-
ling a minnow in a limpid pool was darting toward
them descending as it came in a few minutes
markham saw that it was a dirigible much the same
as those of his time but somewhat larger the
cabin was a long structure that fitted snugly against
the gas bag like a great keel the advantages of
this arrangement over that of the half-dozen sepa-
rated cabins and engines he was used to as to de-
creased wind-resistance and increased ease of opera-
tion were obvious to markham he surmised from
the size of the cabin that a new lifting compound was
employed and found by asking warren that it
was so

  as it approached heading apparently for the new
york tower his attention was attracted to a con-
struction at the northwest corner of the roof of that
building it was a vertical shaft of metal bars
reaching one hundred feet into the air at its top
was a jumble of wheels gears and cables the air-
ship dropped a weighted cable which hooked into the
top of this structure and as it floated past the cable
became taut and the ship was slowly drawn down to
the open metal shaft and then markham could


amazing stories

hardly suppress a thrill of pride such as overcame
him when he had seen his first house completed for
the top of the shaft fitted neatly into the floor of the
airship cabin and he could see a tiny car run swiftly
up the shaft and into the cabin itself it was all an
idea which he had conceived and discussed often with
his fellow club members the device of a mooring
mast which would extend into a hole in an airship
so that an elevator in the shaft would rise level with
the cabin floor but they had laughed at him and
here it was a wonderful reality a moment later he
saw the car descend laden with people

  tell me he turned to warren i am eager to
know the progress the world has made especially in
sociology and transportation there was a deal of
theorizing in my time but from what i have seen i
imagine that most of it either exaggerated or under-
estimated the truth that dirigible for instance i
imagine it is a transatlantic conveyance- warren
nodded -is all oceanic transportation like that 
no indeed said the guide the airships carry
only mail visiting and returning diplomats and such
people as can convince the authorities that their voy-
age requires all possible haste and are willing to pay
the price the passage from new york to paris
takes something over fifteen hours ordinary trans-
oceanic traffic has changed radically you may have
noticed that there is nothing in sight resembling a
port or loading place for ships

  i have remarked something like that admitted
markham but i had thought it was due to the trans-
cendency of airships

  there was some little agitation for developing
air navigation in your time warren went on
which lasted until well after the chaos of 
but these plans were ultimately shelved for many
reasons one of which was the unexpected develop-
ment of means of surface transportation trans-
atlantic voyagers now travel in gigantic covered
sledges which have practically no draft at all and are
driven both by water screws and by air propellers
these ply between the great seaport at the eastern
tip of long island and a recently developed port on
the coast of france taking no more than thirty
hours for the trip from the seaport passengers are
taken in ten minutes by pneumatic tubes to the grand
depot half a mile beneath the new york tower
freight boats are modeled more after the so-called
ocean greyhounds of your time but never take more
than sixty hours to go to europe they also dock at
the eastern seaport but the freight is shot by tube
to the distribution center

  inter-urban communication is carried on through
the great pneumatic tubes as i have told you the
transcontinental pneumatic is now under construc-
tion and will afford transportation between the coasts
in from two to three hours

  but surely the pneumatic tube isnt universal
suggested markham

  certainly not said warren although in time
it probably will be in outlying sections we have
the advanced equivalent of the railroad of your time
it is single railed like the pleasure vehicles i have
described to you and also like those vehicles the
trains draw their power from the same compound
rail they ride on these rails are so constructed
with bridges viaducts and tunnels that there is a
minimum of curves and the altitude does not vary a
hundred feet in as many miles the result is a

smooth speed of one hundred and fifty miles an hour
the monorails as they are called are used through-
out australia africa asia and south america but
no longer in europe and only in the less settled por-
tions of north america

  they had turned back toward the south the sun
was hovering above the western horizon a depart-
ing watchman taking his last look at a satisfied and
satisfactory world there was a growing chill in the
air

  tell me of the people said markham how
they live are they happy surely with your ad-
vanced machinery unemployment must present a
problem

  ah said warren the solution of that problem
is a matter on which we pride ourselves let me
explain we assume that two men working eight
hours with hand tools can complete a piece of work
in that time a machine is invented to do the work
of both men in the same time so that only one is now
needed to handle the machine in your time one of
those men would have handled the machine and the
other would have starved today the men would
each work four hours at handling the machine and
both would be happy

  i see said markham as the efficiency of your
machinery increases you divide the time of labor
among the number of workers displaced by the ma-
chine it is wonderful almost ideal but it never
would have worked in my age the spare time would
have hung heavy on our hands

  that explained warren is a matter of evolu-
tion we spend this spare time in reading in harm-
less and beneficial amusement and the pursuit of the
arts and sciences the world has advanced tre-
mendously in that respect

  community life has also undergone radical
changes there are today in the united states only
fifteen cities similar in appearance to this except for
differences based on climate population and regional
architecture each city has its standardized build-
ings and its municipal tower some follow the pure
checkerboard design like new york and some are
radial like washington five cities new york
chicago san francisco st louis and new orleans
have a population of over ten million the others
all have over five there are an additional ten mil-
lion living in the half-dozen nameless factory cities
and twenty-five million more scattered throughout
the land these last are the food makers the back-
bone of the country all the land outside the cities
is either national parkland or else under cultivation
except for a few suburbs of a strictly residential
character in the neighborhood of the larger cities
the twenty-five million are served by the monorails
and by private airplanes they are forbidden by the
government to organize into communities or mutual
benefit associations so that they regard themselves as
a whole and are doubtlessly happier that way

  somehow they had stopped to lean on the nar-
row railing of a path that bridged the abyss between
two buildings and watch long island bathed in the
last rays of the sun where once had thrived the
growing borough of brooklyn was now a beautiful
parkland of close-cropped lawn reddening trees and
scattered residences and bungalows that stretched
away to the east as far as markham could see what
warren had said was true there was not a single
building of urban character outside of the island of
a visitor from the twentieth centura



manhattan although much land had been added to
the island itself there were not even bridges
brooklyn staten island new j ersey the land to the
north all were a little paradise

  it is wonderful said markham

  the sun out of sight they turned southward once
more we must get back to -c said warren
i shall present you to the captain of the welfare
office where you first found yourself they-walked
the length of a building and out upon another pre-
carious bridge snowflakes began to drift down
upon them in increasing numbers the black pave-
ment absorbed the moist flakes but in the process
there was formed a thin watery surface which the
shoes of the man from the twentieth century were
not qualified to cope with a group of people ap-
proached them head down to avoid the north wind
and markham lurched to one side to prevent their
running into him

  his lurch carried him clean through the railing
he heard a cry of dismay from warren and then
he was hurtling headfirst down the twenty-five story
depth he saw the moving white-coated ways rush-
ing up to meet him

	 

  he awoke with a feeling of stiffness on the floor
before the arm chair in which he last remembered
himself his pet poodle was licking his face and a
steady gust of wind was blowing through the open
door formerly a student of dream phenomena
markham recognized the circumstances which had
lent such fearsome realism to that last part of his
dream the wind from behind him as that north
wind had been the white poodle who running back

and forth as he had tumbled from the chair had
given the fleeting impression of white moving ways
and the tumble itself yes it had all been a dream
however strange and wonderful

  the reader may be interested in subsequent events

  inspired by his vision markham ran to his desk
withdrew his plan from its pigeonhole and tore it to
bits he then sat down and worked far into the
night on this other plan which had come to him much
as he had expected it to come he modified it con-
siderably but the principles remained the same he
suggested the uniformity of buildings all twenty-
five stories in height and a quarter of a mile square
with a set-back at the fifteenth story and a park on
the interior he suggested the two hundred feet
streets but lest he seem too radical he described
them for automobile traffic finally he suggested
the great new york tower with its government of-
fices giant post offices and dirigible mooring mast

  the plan that won the contest was a fanciful thing
embodying towering skyscrapers in artistic shapes
no two of which were alike and the uses of which
were not quite clear what was probably the win-
ning factor was the advanced suggestion of an air-
plane hangar and landing platform on every roof
markhams entry was returned courteously with the
criticism that it was a highly improbable and im-
practical combination of the too fanciful and the too
conservative

  so markham to all extents has abandoned his
visions but as creative architect he has become the
most outstanding worker in that gradual scientific
and civic evolution which never can be covered at
one jump

editor amazing stories

  although i read all kinds of amazing stories
lakh dal destroyer of souls is about the most
amazing story i have ever read in my opinion
it is the working of a disordered mind the author
must have cuckoo birds on his aerial or maybe
the rays of the machine were directed at him

fnough of that however for i must hurry with
this letter nevertheless i dont see how the rays
of our satellite would make a man bereft of his
reason it only makes a dog bark maybe he is
barking at something else and has no effect at
all on people on the other hand maybe they have
no effect on people because of their superior mind
however if they were in quantity they might have
some effect on humans but nevertheless i think that
the story is highly improbable

  now for the story ten million miles sunward
if this story had really happened there would no
longer be any earth because it was stated in
newtons law that a body once in motion must be
stopped by some outside force or it will continue
forever in the same direction therefore i say
that even if the axis of the earth was changed the
earth would continue in the same orbit

  the master of the world was pretty good but
i liked baron miinchhausens scientific adventures
best of all there is a streak of humor a streak
of truth and some lies but i liked them anyway

  i am a great enthusiast as regards this magazine
and i think that a copy should come out every two
weeks why not ask all the readers if they want
it a monthly or semi-monthly  think most of
them would agree on a semi-monthly

story than ten million miles sunward even if
 am only thirteen years old nevertheless i am
in a at school take science and will take it as long
as possible down with latin

  we are always glad to hear from our younger
readers one characteristic thing which we have
noticed is that their criticisms are more unmerciful
than thoseof our more mature correspondents in
the april issue you will find a note by an eminent
authority on the error in the story of ten million
miles sunward the general idea is that to affect
the motion of the earth some external force would
have to be applied and while the rushing of the
water through the canals might be taken as an
outside force the amount of that force would be so
trivial as to make the effect absolutely imperceptible
as regards the frequency of the publication of
amazing stories our readers seem much divided
on this point many of our readers feel that our
new quarterly furnishes a good compromise

  if you want to try a hand at writing a story
we will be glad to give it the same consideration
that we give to others but it would probably do
better for you to wait a few years for whatever
you think of adult humanity there is no doubt
that at the proper age time mellows the character
and experience rubs off some of our corners you
have a very high rank for your age in school but
if you will take one piece of advice from us you
will thank us in the future do not say down
with latin if you will work hard at it it will
do you a great deal of good it will mean a lot to
you for it will help you with english and inci-
dentally will teach you to plug-editor

editor amazing stories

  i have read your magazine for about  months
and think that it exactly fills a vacant place in
magazine literature-that is the place which was
vacant

  your discussion column is very interesting in
that so many people show themselves up by con-
sidering their own pleasure and not showing a
spirit of co-operation they seem to feel that if
it docs not suit them then whosoever would dare
read that particular article is an initiecile or an
idiot frankly speaking people with such ideas as
that are almost in one of the classes themselves

  it is true there arc some stories i do not like
but taken as a whole the magazine is wonderful
and even those i do not like are undoubtedly the
favorite of some person whose hobby in sciencc is
thus illustrated and i am glad to know that some-
one else has a chance at something that suits his
whims

  poor old ii g wells has certainly got his share
of criticism personally i too agree that his
stories are great but i do believe that a vote
among his readers would show him that while he
is highly approved in general it would be a still
greater approval-even by bis present admirers-if
he would leave out some tedious details in other
words while we like the stories we would love
them if he would not make us so tired of tedious
details that we almost lose interest before he gets
down to the point

i have enjoyed many of the stories but i believe
that the moon pool was the best i have ever read
m your magazine not merely bccause of the folk
lore it contained but because of the beautiful

the master ants

       by francis flagg

                concluded

 or ninety penniless unknown in charge of a middle-
 aged woman what good would that do either you
 or theda  besides there is something else to con-
 sider do you realize that it was only by a miracle
 we escaped death when our time machine fell to
 pieces on the plain out there yet there is no way
 of returning a machine to  save by hurling it
 back in time until it too disintegrates from old age

   as i stood glaring at him in horror there came the
 terrified clamor of hundreds of voices

   look cried a womans shrill voice look

   far out on the plain had risen what seemed an
 eddying cloud even as we gazed petrified there
 rose another and yet another until the sky was black
 with them the master ants were coming to the
  attack

   of the ghastly fight which took place on the roof
 there is little to say the millions of insects with
 their winged steeds simply fell upon the giant ray
 cone and smothered it to ineffectiveness with their
 charred bodies nearly two hundred of the scien-
 tians fell in battle stung to death by the sword-like
 stings of the flying insects the remainder fled
 panic-stricken from the roof into the interior of the
 castle and sealed up the entrance with impregnable
 composite metal by means of the transparent ray
 it is possible to look through the walls and ceiling
 the once fair garden is being eaten and destroyed
 the fruit trees are crumbling into dust all that is
 vulnerable is a decaying wreck as i look at the
 scene of unutterable desolation despair grips my
 heart and a wild desire to strap myself in the time
 machine and quit this terrible future for the past
 almost overwhelms me but that is impossible
 there is nothing to do but stay and face whatever
 the future holds in store for us- soltano maintains
 that our situation is not yet hopeless those scien-
 tians amaze me their courage and optimism in the
  face of disaster are wonderful now i know what
 their religion is it is an abiding faith in the power
 of their science to aid and uphold them the pro-
 fessor tells me of an intricate arrangement for sup-
 plying us with air i do not understand it yet very-
 well but it is made clear to me that we can live in
 the interior of the castle indefinitely water and
 synthetic foods can be made meantime in the
 splendidly equipped laboratories and machine shops
 the scientists and inventors are rushing forward ex-
 periments which may release they say the energy in
 the atom and give us possession of weapons which

 will destroy the ants and return the lordship of
 america to man but as to this i do not know i
 hardly dare hope theda leans over me and presses
 her soft cheek against mine and though i do not feel
 at all heroic i am comforted and made stronger by
 her love

  escape or help seems impossible nevertheless i
am going to tie this manuscript in the time machine
which stands ready at my side and send it back to
the period i have left forever i repeat my hope
that it will fall into the hands of intelligent people
and that its contents will be made known to the
public it may be that we shall overcome the ants
in the inevitable final conflict between men and
insects in that case we will try to communicate
with the twentieth century again if not then we bid
a final farewell to the people of 

       signed professor john reubens
               raymond bent

  what is to be done with the document

the nationally known lawyer laid down the
incredible document for a moment there was
complete silence in the room finally the
president of the university spoke

  i suppose you wish our advice as to what dis-
position to make of this    this   

  exactly returned the lawyer i am positive
itis a hoax  and yet  

   and yet finished the doctor of science  there
are more things in heaven and earth horatio than
are dreamt of in your philosophy as hamlet said

  the ordinary m d coughed there is some-
thing fishy about this whole affair he said cast-
ing no reflections on our host whose account of how
the manuscript came into his possession i believe
absolutely perhaps someone is trying to cover up
the fact that twenty thousand dollars disappeared
but that doesnt sound plausible either my advice
is to lock the manuscript up in a safe time enough
to publish its contents to the world if any queer
happenings should occur-in south america for
instance

  the five other men gave hearty approval to this
plan and there the matter rests except that there
are at least three men in berkeley california who
carefully scan the press every day for any strange
news from latin america

  language used i do not remember its authors
  name but i do know that he can use language
  to the extent that we might say that he said it with
  flowers i see a comment by one writer in dis-
  cussions in the last issue about the magazine
  catering to those whose intellect is weak or those
  who are childish he did not use the exact words
  but conveyed the meaning i might suggest to all
  of such a mental capacity and ideas pertaining to
  that meaning that if they will also pursue the
  current topics of inventions they will be enormously
  surprised at the actual patents on things only re-
  cently placed as fiction in amazing stories take
  for instance the story about the world below the
  infra-red kays which sounded foolish to those
  unbelievers but not to yours truly and now there
  is an article in last sundays atlanta constitution
  about a machine which transposes vision picked
  up by the infra-red rays and so arranges it that
  the human eye can see it-and picks up scenes in
  the dark foolish eh well its good science so
  says the new york police department

    this letter is more helter-skelter than i ex-
  pected because of interruptions to discuss business
  with my clients while writing it mayhap i can do
  better next time if this letter be so lucky as to
  get into print

    just one more thrust at those spineless brains
  that claim amazing stories are weak and for
  weaklings i have found that the reasoning ca-
  pacity of those in discussions have been awak-
  ened to new ideas and loftier ideals by perusal of
  these same stories and if we be able to make some
  poor human being think in a line of progression we
  have most certainly attained a point in the scale
  of benefit and good will to man that we should
  be able to say to each of our editors of amazing
  stories and worthy contributors well done thou
  food and faithful servant

    the writer of this interesting communication is
  the senior member of a columbus ga law firm
  and like so many others of our readers letters
  it tells its own story bennettes clients with all
  their interruptions did not prevent him from writ-
  ing a particularly good and well-put letter it
  interests us to see the commendation which he and
  many others bestow upon the moon pool it had
  a touch of travel and geography about it a touch
  of psychology especially in the irishman and quite
  a deep character study we feel that we publish
  letters enough to show how well taken it is when
  we receive such good letters as the above-

the proposed science club-a con-
structive letter with a good
outline of work

  editor amazing stories

    being a regular reader of amazing stories i
  have often intended to write to your discussions
  department about the organization of the science
  club which has been the subject of discussion for
  some time this idea has interested me very much
  and i would be greatly pleased to see it developed
  into something worth while i thought at first
  that you would take hold of it suggest a plan of
  organization and get it started following the line
  of development used by other publications which
  have fostered organizations of readers for various
  purposes but it is now apparent that you are
  determined to leave it entirely in the hands of those
  of your readers who are interested enough to go
  ahead and organize the science club and on care-
  ful consideration this plan will prove to be best
  a club so organized will be best because it will be
  strong and able to stand on its own feet it will
  have a backbone composed of those who have the
  initiative to go ahead and organize it there must
  be a number of such persons among the readers
  of amazing stories and i hope to see them get
  into action soon

    a plan of action which suggests itself to me is
  this which i submit for the consideration of all
  who are interested

  if you are interested in organizing the science
  club insert a small ad in the personal column
  of your local newspaper reading something like this
  anyone interested in organization of science

 club communicate with ----

    that would be a very inexpensive way of get-
  ting in touch with those in the vicinitv who were
  interested and it will get results

    instead of writing immediately to all who reply
  to your ad get in touch with a few who will help
  you bear the expense of communication with the
  others get out a mimeograph letter if there are
  enough replies to warrant it

    issue a call for a meeting sending it to all who
  reply to your ad those who attend the meeting
  will authorize one of their number to write a
  letter to the editor of amazing stories outlining
  their ideas regarding the nature of the permanent
  organization these ideas should be stated as
  certain clearly defined points which can be collated
  and classified by the editor when all the letters
  from the various meetings are examined it is quite
  certain that the points outlined in each will be
  duplications of those outlined in others the
  editor can then collate the suggestions and send
  to the corresponding secretaries of the branches a
  list of the points suggested by all the letters an-
  other meeting can be called to vote on acceptance
  or rejection of each point as stated in the editor s
  list and the ballots will be returned to the editor
  who will tabulate the returns and determine there-
  from the final form of the organization

  ten years ago radio was in its infancy-today
  television is the possibilities of tele-
  vision are every bit as great as those of
  radio and development will probably be
  much faster for the basic principles of tele-
  vision arc closely allied to those of radio
  much of the fundamental groundwork there-
  fore has already been laid grow with this
  infant industry-all the thrills of the experi-
  menter are here justas they were in radio
  learn all there is to know about this new art
  this up-to-date book will give you full details
  on all that has been done in the development
  of television written by the leading
  authorities-all theories discoveries  and
  trends are fully explained and written in an
  easily understandable way

    i hope i have made my plan clear and concise
 enough as i would like to see some action

    i have read with interest the letter of mr wines
  in the march issue regarding the science club
  and while i am glad to see the interest he takes
  and am also delighted that a man of his type
  should be interested in the project i am bound to
  agree with the editor on the proposition of secrecy
  that should be out right from the start for a
  number of reasons l-or one what good would
  the magazine be to a secret organization the
  editor has proffered the use of its pages but the
  space would have to remain blank if the club were
  a secret society nothing could le discussed an-
  other feature suggested by mr wines requires
  careful consideration and that is the establishment
  of laboratories employment of scientists attorneys
  etc ad lib i would be the last to deny that the
  foundation of a good laboratory would le a fine
  ambition for such an organization but it should
  not be a primary consideration at the time of
  organization the first goal should be the or-
  ganization of a science club for the discussion
  locally in meetings and nationally in the pages of
  amazing stories of the ideas of the members on
  scientific matters to the end that ideas might be
  spread on fertile soil and develop into a bountiful
  harvest the greatest laboratory is the human
  mind

    mr wines suggestion that the branches be
 called laboratories is a good one and  might add
 to that the suggestion of a motto for all the
 laboratories and the organization as a whole
 jt is an ancient french motto je iay emprins
 i have undertaken

                                   d mason

    this letter requires no comment the ideas
 which are contained in it are so clearly put and
 the details are so well given that it really looks
 as if something might yet be done about the scien-
 tific society it seems too bad to let the subject
 drop when so many seem ripe and ready for it
 we shall be glad to publish the results of any
 new movement of science club enthusiasts-
 editor

   a letter of thoughtful criticism

 editor amazing stories

    first mr editor i am writing this letter to
  praise your super-classic amazing stories of
  which i am a charter reader secondly i write
  his to take up my bludgeon on mr wells side
  of the argument anent the war of the worlds
  story surely such splendidly-written material
  must appeal to anyone who truly knows and ap-
  preciates artful description wells merely uses his
  fine description to bring out the high lights in his
  stories the same way in which mr merritt en-
  hances the beauty of his moon pool with sparkling
  description nobody objected to mr merritts de-
  scriptive matter because it moved along somewhat
  snappier than mr wells description wells is
  a remarkable author and  am sure his great
  popularity has not come about accidentally

    as for picking apart certain stories and squab-
  bling over trifling mechanical details thats illib-
  eral there must be some esnesnon now - and
  then a little fairy tale here and there to keep our
  appetite for romance whetted we must overlook
  the overdrawn and ridiculous situations for there
  are so many delightful things that grow out of the
  occasional absurdities i want to confess here that
  i swallowed dr mentiroso hook sinker et al till
  some of the boys declared him a phenomenal liar

  i fail to get any edification or kick out of such
  stories as the underseas express the star of
  dead love the machine man of ardathia the
  tide projectile transportation co and the detec-
  tive tales the latter are obvious and flat carry-
  ing a canned flavor for me your illustrations
  are splendid as is mr paul catches the right in-
  spiration and as an artist myself i appreciate his
  cleverness your idea of the quarterly is o k
  a nice compromise over the semi-monthly idea

    to date the stories that have appealed to me the
  most are off on a comet the moon metal the
  land that time forgott station x dr moreaus
  island the malignant entity the second deluge
  the moon pool war of the worlds around the
  universe and kindred tales i read all and each
  issue of amazing stories thats only the half
  of it i have read such as dr moreaus island and
  others two or three times i consider myself a
  discriminating reader so this must mean a high
  tribute to some of your authors work at any
  rate mr editor i cannot give you any construc- 
  tive advice further as to the conduct of your edi- -
  torial work im satisfied with your efforts as is
  and i trust amazing stories will prosper as
  greatly as has your radio news and other splen-
  did publications by the way i read all of them

    in spite of our modesty we appreciate your
 calling amazing stories a super-classic while it
 is interesting to find mr wells defended the great
 popularity which he has acquired seems to make
 such defence unnecessary what you say about
 esnesnon reminds us of the lines by an unknown
 writer

          a little nonsense now and then
  is relished by the wisest men
  for most readers will know now that esnesnon is
  nonsense spelled backwards we think you take a
  proper view of the work of mr paul you must
  realize that to illustrate such stories as we give
  requires a special ability on the part of the artist
  we certainly appreciate your good wishes-

im going to raise his salary

 tt

 ive had my eye on him for some time and i know he can handle
 bigger work he studies those i c s textbooks every chance he
 gets and i want to tell you it has made him a valuable man for this
 business im going to raise his salary and give him that new job
 we were talking about i wish we had more men like him

    how do you stand when your employer checks
  up his men for promotion  does he pass you by
  as just a routine worker or does he think of you
  as a man who is ambitious to get ahead  wont
  you be far more likely to get the promotion if he
  knows you arc studying at home and are really
  preparing yourself to handle bigger work

    every mail brings letters from students of the
  international correspondence schools telling of in-
  creases in salary due to spare-time study

    at the time i started my i c s course i was
  working in a paper mill writes a j hutchins
  chief draftsman of the american strawboard co

    before i had completed the course i was called
  upon to make drawings in one of the companys
  largest mills and was appointed superintendent of 
  construction at a  per cent increase in salary 

    jesse g vincent was a toolmaker before he en-
  rolled with the i c s he is now vice-president
  of the packard motor car company walter
  chrysler president of the chrysler motor cor-
  poration is also a former i c s student

    an i c s course enabled fred w south-
  worth to leave a poorly paying job that he had
  held for twenty years and get a position as a
  salesman in six months he also had increased
  his salary more than  per cent

    george a grieble was a stone cutter earning
   a week when he enrolled with the i c s
  he now has his own engineering business in cleve-
  land and his income is between  and
   a year 

    if the i c s can help these men to get out of
  the rut and make good it can help you too if it

  can raise the salaries of other men it can raitfi
  yours at least find out how

some brickbats and others-a word
from the antipodes

  editor amazing stories

a few bouquets and brickbats from australia

     i have read amazing stories from the first is-
   sue it is the only magazine which appeals to my
   vivid imagination and fills a long-felt want i
   cant understand those who complain that amazing
   stories twice a month would cost too much i
   would find enough to buy it if it was published
   every day

     the illustratipns by mr paul are wonderful
   his imagination seems to be like space itself-
   unlimited you have just the right number of
   illustrations-no more no less are wanted

     now for a few brickbats

     please cut out  g wells jules verne and
   h h simmons

     taking wells the only two of his yarns which
   can really be described as scientifiction are the
   time machine and the war of the  orlds and
   there is very little science in them in my opinion
   the science is only a cloak to allow mr wells to
   air his views on civilization what it is where it
   is leading us and how little it would take to
   upset it the i far of the worlds is poor meat
   anyway it was written umpteen years ago and
   is out of date completely what chance would the
   martians have against modern instruments of war
   -aeroplanes dirigibles tanks gas masks long-
   range artillery etc no sir the war of the
   worlds is a back number and simply makes the
   modern reader feel sick please drop him

     jules verne is beyond the pale he belongs to
   the bygone victorian era with his long windbag-
   ging dissertations on trivial matters no doubt
   jules verne was a genius in the generation in
   which he lived but his ancient writings leave a
   taste of senility in the mouth

     hicks inventions with a kick yes a high
  kick mr simmons ought to be kicked why oh
  why are these abominations printed in amaztng
  stories amazing scienti fiction hear me
  laugh

     lhe best story that has appeared in amazing
  stories so far is the moon pool with the second
  deluge running a good second

     mr merritt is a genius the people of the pit
   and the face in the abyss were great

    other yarns that tickled me were the green
  splotches star of dead love and the mad planet
  the mad planet contained the best science of any
  of these in my opinion

     the astounding discoveries of dr mcntiroso
  could have been called better the puerile vapor-
  ings of a diseased mind if dr mentiroso went
  round the world with the speed of light it is obvi-
  ous that he must consume time in so doing a
  mathematical absurdity built into a story

     treasures of tantalus is even worse the tele-
   phonoscope must indeed be a wonderful instrument
   to see a person and hear words spoken at the same
   instant considering the relative speeds of light and
   sound this is not so bad while the author con-
   fines himself to the earth but when he goes
   wandering off into space it becomes arrant non-
   sense sound cannot travel in space and even
   assuming that it could the intensity varies in-
   versely as the square of the distance so the sounds
   would be pretty feeble by the time they had
   traveled a thousand light years

    now mr editor i have a favor to ask do
  you think you could manage to publish the blind
  spot by austin hall and homer eon flint this
  appeared in the argosy all-story weekly about the
  middle of  i only read the first instalment
  and have been consumed with curiosity ever since
  it is a scientifiction story of the first order

other good yarns which would not be out of

  lace in amazing stories are the planeteer and
  he king of conserve island by homer eon dint
  argosy all-story - a little collection
  of scientifiction stories under the names of the
  purple sapphire the amphibian xordcnlwlts
  millions and the brain blight by jack l-iarrower

     now mr editor will you publish my name and
   let a few of these scientifiction lovers get in touch
   with me well i close with a wish to see amaz-
   ing stories doubled in size by advertisements and
   published oftener please give that blind spot
   story a chance

     while we have headed your letter with the words
   some brickbats we observe that mr paul is not
   a target but do read the letters of our other
   readers and see how they admire the very stories
   which you dislike do you think that you could
   select stories to please everybody in regards to
   mr simmons stories about hicks inventions with
   a kick you say hear me laugh as the humor-
   ist says this is writ sarkastick but you
   should have heard us laugh in good earnest when
   we first read them we think they arc very clever

      ou are rather hard on dr mentirostf we can
   assure you that the complete understanding of his
   story would imply the knowledge of the difference
   in time which has played so important a part in
   the history of the world it is on this that ocean
   navigation has been based and there was a prize
   offered and eventually won for some method of
   determining the longitude of a ship at sea which
   was solved by the invention of the marine chrono-
   meter to give the difference of time between the
   position of a ship at sea and a standard meridian
   such as that of greenwich england this took
   numberless ships across the ocean and brought them
   safely to port we note what you say about the
   bhnd spot and we shall consider it  seriously-

there is no mystery

a severe young critic

editor amazing stories	

   i have been watching your discussions column for
some time and i would like to make comment on
the criticisms contained therein

  many of your readers do not consider a story
good scientifiction unless an explanation is given
of every episode containing science in any way
shape or manner they do not take into consider-
ation the fact that scientifiction usually contains
feats that the writer has to evolve from his im-
agination therefore they must deviate from the
usual path of science and employ sleight-of-mind
tricks to mask their scientific deceptions if a
feasible and definite explanation was necessary for
each scientific point the writer would become so
limited as to situations etc that the story would
become dry and journalistic in aspect

   i heartily disapprove of scientific tales which
contain romances they sentimentalize the story
to such an extent that it diminishes some of the
scientific glamor which rightly deserves uninter-
rupted notice

   ten million miles sunward although erring in
parts is my idea of what good scientific fiction
should be it is absorbing to the nth degree and is
a well systematized story working to the climax at
the right conjunction	

   lakh-dahl destroyer of souls is undoubtedly the
best scientific detective story you have ever printed
it has well planned situations and well distributed
tense moments	r

   baron miinchhausens scientific adventures are
so ridiculous that they are funny although i do
not look forward to them each month they never-
theless afford the comic element in your publication

   sub-satellite was fair but was merely a repeti-
tion of the much tattered moon story the idea
of the bullet although at first glance appearing
humorous contained a lot of interesting science

    he flowering of the strange orchid was a be-
calmed and stagnant piece of literature containing
a lot of tortimyrot probably inspired by dumas
the black tulip may you use the same amount
of magazine space to better advantage in the near
future	

  i am thirteen years old and enjoy your maga-
zine to the extreme in my conception amazing
stories is a relief to the individual who likes sci-
entific literature as the only resort one had before
your periodical appeared was a limited amount of
poor stories

  since the first issue of amazing stories was
put on the newsstands i have perused it with un-
abating interest each month hoping that your
publication will continue to give such educational
enjoyment i remain

  a green apple is not as much appreciated by
the generality of mankind as one which has had
time to ripen criticism severe and scathing from
one who is a lad of thirteen years will be looked
back upon by the youthful writer in a few years
as far from ripe we have received some aston-
ishingly good communications from very young
writers such as this one but it certainly is inter-
esting to see how much more definite they are in
their views than older writers who have learned
that in this world it is not always safe to be sure
about things for it is often very hard by natural
means to elicit the truth one curious feature is
that our writer who is a correspondent severe in
his views states at the end that not only is he
thirteen years old but that lie enjoys the magazine
to the extreme when he and the magazine are ten
or twenty years older we are sure he will take a
broader view of things and not be quite so sure of
himself-editor

  the international science club

editor amazing stories

   i believe that the time has come when all those
that are interested in forming the international
science club and i am sure that there arc quite
a number who are interested should unite and get
the club started

   the club i believe will help to form a closer
relationship between the scientific thinking youths
of the world you must remember that the scien-
tific thinking youth of today is the scientific leader
of tomorrow

   i believe that the first thing we must do is to
appoint a committee to draft a constitution and
by-laws as most of those who arc interested in
starting the club wrote to you i do not believe
there is anyone who is better suited than you are
to appoint such a committee i am sure that you
will do that for the good of science and the club

   well so much about the club for this time

   i do hope you will print more stories which per-
tain to astronomy as i find them all extremely
interesting for that is my favorite branch of
science

  the poems that appear in amazing stories are
real good i dont think it would lie wise to dis-
continue them

   ait appreciation of ocr efforts

 editor amazing stories

    my favorite publications previous to your intro-
  ducing amazing stories to the magazine field
  were science and invention popular science and
  all-story but i will let you guess as to which one
  i wait for now-rather impatiently  must say
  between the first and tenth of each month amaz-
  ing stories has certainly proved its merit as a
  magazine of the first order a mother lode for the
  class of readers who are of a scientific or pro-
  scientific turn of mind i had the honor of pur-
  chasing the first copy sold in the city of hammond
  ind and of course since then have not missed a
  copy i saved all the old issues for quite a time
  and then lent the stack to a new and enthusiastic
  reader who forgot to return them ill trust no
  one any more with my amazing stories

    while your discussion column is being racked
  and torn between two classes of readers-pro and
  anti-our esteemed friend ii i wells ill just
  pick up the latest issue or perhaps an earlier
  one and re-read one of his excellent stories most
  of which i had read several times before you
  printed them in a s i do not like them all
  its true but wells in common with verne wrote
  most of his stories years ago consequently they
  are not as up-to-date as your usual run or type as
  i should say

    merritts moon pool fur roughs land that
 time forgot are old stories to me but were re-
 read several times just the same

    i disremcmber if i read the girl in the golden
  atom in your magazine or another one kindly
  enlighten me  this point

    since several thousands of your readers howled
  long and loud over verrills dr mentiroso i won-
  der what they will say about your own stories of
  baron miinchhausen im sure the baron has it
  over doctor mentiroso when it comes to exagger-
  ating the truth well time will tell and truth
  will out lets see who will be the victor in the
  battle of lies from the readers viewpoint read-
  ing the discussion column is a good-sized kick and
  must be to you too but there is one consolation
  you can rest assured that your chronic kickers
  and censoring critics must spend their quarter
  each month-otherwise how will they have any
  theme on which to air their criticisms and com-
  plaints

    your magazine as a monthly interests me more
  as i have time to digest each story thoroughly one
  might be rushed to much if it were a semi-monthly

   i have to thank you for hours of splendid
 reading

                        joseph goldstein

 w pine st st louis mo

   one point about dr mentiroso and baron
 miinchhausen is that both of them tell a lot of
 truth despite their very obvious lies we can
 assure our correspondents that the barons science
 was very closely followed up by the author and
 the gist of it is in its definite correctness youll

 find our ideas about dr mentiroso stated in various
 placcs in these columns he is well worth study-
 ing ask yourselves how much you know about
 the difference of time upon the earth

    we have not yet printed the girl of the golden
 atom

    we have little to say in connection with your
 letter which tells its story very clearly but cer-
 tainly an editor who is in a sense living for the
 magazine is delighted to find it well thought of
 by such readers as you-editor

our discussion correspondents
amuse the writer

  editor amazing storied

  i have just been sitting here holding my sides
  with laughter over the letters about our friend dr
  mentiroso that part from wm etheridge your
  magazine cannot survive  that basis exccpt with
  morons and then donald l cummings witty
  piece to the effect that the best part of the story
  was the end well mr editor im just a junior
  in high and may not rank much above a moron
  but really i thought the story good and at least it
  made me think more than any story ive read in the
  magazine so far anyway i certainly agree that
  the discussions is the best part of the magazine

  i want to extend a welcome to harry martin for
  his rices ray i think this is the most logical
  story about a space ship so far printed

  i have read your magazine for over a year now
  look forward to every new copy and read every-
  thing in them im for more illustrations but keep
  it a monthly for im afraid you wouldnt have the
  same quality in more frequent issues

i have nothing more to say except that i consider
the moon pool the best story you have ever printed

  remember me to the doctor

  it is well to find that our correspondents of the
  seriously criticizing type operate to amuse one good-
  natured reader while we are delighted to find our
  stories taken seriously and criticized from a serious
  viewpoint it is well to be cheered up by a little
  appreciative good humor sometimes and that is the
  clue to our appreciation of this letter from a high
  school junior whom we emphatically deny to be a
  moron we have given in several places in our
  discussions columns our views of dr mentiroso
  his name announces him a liar but the story con-
  tains excellent matter conccrning the difference of
  time a subject which puzzles many

  how many realize in crossing the ocean to
  europe or back that going one way they have
  about a -hour day and going the other way the
  day is about  hours long yet the voyagers adapt
  themselves instantly to the new time

  we find that the planetary stories are liked by
  our readers and certainly rices ray is an excel-
  lent example of this specific type of fiction-

impossible themes are not interest-
ing but what ones are impossible

editor amazing stories

  ive been a reader of your mag for over a
year and  believe you are entitled to some word
of praise and criticism as well as a certain remark
was made by one of your critics the critics re-
mark is not reproachful rather in behalf of your
magazine yet it contains a certain word that has
led me to write this letter  quote the remark
impossible themes are very interesting

   now my idea is impossible themes arc not inter-
esting perhaps you will think that  dislike the
majority of your stories on this account but on
the contrary i do not and why for the simple
reason that with the exception of one none of your
themes are absolutely impossible the one excep-
tion is the so-called time traveler or any con-
traption that makes it possible for our physical
selves to mingle writh the peoples of the past or
future  need not go into detail why i believe the
impossibility of this theory or rather nightmare
since your critics have given as excellent reasons
as can possibly be made

  as for your other stories although some are
more feasible than others as i said before none
are impossible the most fascinating stories are
those of unknown lands planes and planets and
their inhabitants on whom the author can specu-
late as to the shape of body and features on
the tail of these tales are such as the revolt of
the pedestrians in which we live in the future in
an age that is recuperating from some calamity
stories of inventions usually bring up the rear
although quite often one is found that is very
interesting

  my reaction to such a story as jules vernes
master of the world gives me an idea how people
a few hundred years from now will look upon some
of our scientific feats of today i smile when f
notice the enthusiasm of jules verne when he de-
scribes the speed of the terror today we have
planes capable of over  miles per hour and we
can build automobiles of the same speed yet
when someone says that within a hundred years
we may be traveling as fast as the rotation of the
earth we have a skeptic on every hand gradually
though since the advent of the radio and vita-
phone the birth of television and the new develop-
ments in aviation the ignoramuses are waking to
the fact that skeptics are a hindrance to the
advancement of civilization and that many things
considered impossible are only so because of lack
of investigation and development

   before closing i want to commend you for the
first three miinchhausen stories in the february
issue if i m aliers succeeding instalments are
as good as the first two ill be satisfied with the
rest of the magazine the comedy is so novel one
cant help but smile out loud i enjoyed the four-
teenth earth and likewise h g wells story
pollock and porroh man all told it was one of
your best issues and lets hope all the subsequent
ones will be as good

                       john p pratzkt

                   s th st st louis mo

   our magazine in its editorials virtually takes
the ground that it is very unsafe to say that this
thing or the other thing is impossible the impos-
sible is being achieved every day for years it was
impossible to make a wire of the metal tungsten
now when the impossible became a possibility
miles of tungsten wire are made every year and the
electric light due to its use is now about four times
as efficient as it was a few years ago you are
correct when you speak of skeptics being a hin-
drance to the advancement of civilization although
when you think of the way the world is going
there is every excuse for skepticism in this regard
-editor

more about the revolt of the
pedestrian

editor amazing stories

  i read your magazine occasionally and enjoy
many of its stories i was peculiarly impressed by
one in the february issue the revolt of the
pedestrians by d m keller i like it because
parts of it were really well written almost clas-
sical and it was written it seemed to me by one
having a real warning to issue to society though
to many it might seem far-fetched

  i would like to see more stories by the same
author if he is a doctor maybe he can give us
one on some of the urgent problems of the day-
the hidden forces that seem to put us mentally and
physically at odds with our environing world and
its limitations and chains

  perhaps a bit educational-that everyone can
understand would help prevent such moral cata-
clysms that happen to snyders and grays-or start
a big drive against murders

                              f balcar

                   murray st elizabeth n j
this correspondent is one of a number who ex-
presses high approval of the revolt of the pedes-
trians there is one saving clause however in
the city of new york and that is that those who
use the elevated railways and subways for getting
about get concentrated exercise in ascending and
descending stairs benjamin franklin made the
remark wdien in france that he considered a mile
going upstairs worth a number of miles on the
level yet he said that he did not use the stairs
while they were there we can consider that in
the present era of automobiles the elevated trains
and subways are doing their part in saving the
legs of the community-editor

a good criticism of ten millioh 
miles sunward

  editor amazing stories

    here you have another voice from faraway okla
  homa although only sixteen years of age and but
  a senior in high school i have always taken much
  interest in your magazine with one exception it
  is the only periodical which i ever really looked
  for in advance

    in your latest edition you published a story ten
  million miles sunward and asked your readers to
  find a certain flaw in its science now to shift
  the amount of matter stated in the story would
  slightly change the axis of the earth but would
  it throw it out of its orbit no because at its
  present position the centriiugal force generated by
  its annual journey around the sun exactly counter-
  acts the gravitation toward that body to either
  increase or decrease the speed of the earth would
  change its orbit but the mere shifting of matter
  would not because the two forces betore mentioned
  would remain the same

    also mr simeon of iowa in the discussions
  department mentioned the fact that as the trav-
  eler in space exceeded the speed of light he could
  not see the stars behind him apparently diminishing
  in size and the editor stated that as the rays had
  been emitted long ago the traveler would still be
  in their midst and could still see them so far so
  good but as he would be overtaking the light
  waves he would either see the same stars in front
  or if moving either too fast or too slow the waves
  would be either too short or too long to be visible
  by the human eye so in cither case one could not
  see the stars behind

    i fear i am taking too much space but there is
  one more thing i would like to say why not put
  out an accessory magazine for discussions so that
  your readers could arguethings out among them-
  selves as there is no better way to learn than
  to express ones own thoughts this would lie in
  keeping with your policy of spreading interest in
  science and the cost should not rise so high as to
  be prohibitive to the readers

                           mearle prout

medford okla

    it seems to us that there is nothing more to be
  said about the effect of enormously rapid motion on
  the seeing of stars the planetary traveler will
  always be subject to the action of light rays and
  therefore will see the stars however fast or in
  whatever direction he may travel because the ether
  is charged as it were with their vibrations and in
  whatever direction our traveler goes he can never
  get away from them if a ran were traveling
  away from a locomotive with a speed exceeding
  that of sound waves in the air and the engineer
  sounded his whistle when the man was in advance
  of him he would never hear it but if the engineer
  had been sounding his whistle for sometime before
  the man started then he would hear it because he
  would be within the space occupied by the vibrat-
  ing air until his high speed carried him beyond the
  sound again

dryness in stories-a basis of fact
necessary

 editor amazing stories	

    being very interested in your publication i feel
  i have something to say about it in relation to the
  literature contained and some suggestions to make
  about the appearance of it

    your stories with the exception of a few are
  excellent and provide scientific facts in a palatable
  form some of your stories however have a dry
  and journalistic flavor about them which renders
  them uninteresting and in my opinion poor for
  publishing in a magazine devoted to scientifiction
  i refer to jules verne and h g wells to be
  sure wells has written some stimulating and in-
  spiring talcs but his style ruins them scientific-
  tion is uninteresting when it has become a tact
  your story the master of the world by jules
  verne has not become reality but still imparts
  a sense of the practical about the best story i
  have ever read in vour magazine was the second
  deluge this i am sure everyone of your readers
  perused with unwauing interest for the reason that
  it was a revision of the popular theme ot our
  old noahs ark stories that our mothers used to
  tell us on sunday if you dont do anything else
  keep your stories scientific in detail and plot it
  possible nothing is so boring as an unscientific
  scientific story this world today wants a fact tor
  everything that is told them and that a proven fact
  about the most original story you have ever printed
  was the thought machine by ammamaus mar-
  ccllinus and the revolt of the pedestrians by
  david h keller both were highly interesting and
  well-written and also looked quite practical   

    i heartily agree with the plan submitted in your
  february discussions column by watkin l evans
  as to the paper and cover

                           robert eisenbach

 sacramento st san francisco cal

    there is one peculiar statement in this letter to
  the effect that our type of fiction is uninteresting
  when it has developed into a fact w e think that
  we give enough interplanetary stories and others
  of that type to stay clear of this fatal rock ot
  fact to which our correspondent objects and then
  there is another statement in the letter namely
  that the world wants a fact for everything that s
  told it you see you have us between the horns
  of a dilemma-editor

comments on our corespondents
from an editorial mlnd-criti-
cizing the critics

editor amazing stories

   after concluding the perusal of the march issue
 of amazing stories the idea came to my mind
 why not criticize the critics anyone can realize
 the handicap you labor under in commenting on the
 discussion pages you are compelled to be diplo-
 matic in order to preserve tranquility and render
 animosity impossible but at times you must long to
 express yourself without any restrictions conse-
 quently i will take upon myself the responsibility
 of answering the various letters as my mina dic-
 tates let us hope the trend of thought is in
 unison with yours pardon the egotistic attitude
 and any cynical criticisms that may occur

  victor lewis- initial comment adequate but
would add as personal advice either strengthen
your mind to digest horror stories or skip them
entirely they occur at rare intervals in this
magazine

  g	p simeon thanks for the support glad to
know a few of the stories meet with your ap-
proval but bear in mind opinions vary and the
multitude must be catered to collectively not indi-
vidiually the initial comment covers the star-
light question radium electrons and the fourth
dimension are most assuredly scientific radium is
the only visible one of the three conceptions the
electron hypothesis has been generally accepted and
the fourth dimensional theory has a great number
of loyal adherents

 wells also deserves credit for the varied scope of
 his works his is a marvelous intellect

 cording to your favorites you are of a practical
 turn of mind with a leaning toward romance

  maurice c volkman regarding your analysis
of war of the worlds wish to differ with you
even the most eminent psychologists are not gifted
with the power to say what your reaction will be
under stress if it came to a practical demonstra-
tion man might be worse than wells depicted him
due to the fact there are less than ten people who
fully understand einsteins theory we are elated
to know you acquired the full knowledge from a
hand manual

ence and you will appreciate those you now con-

this

  t a netland survival of the fittest is the
fundamental basis of existence if you arc of the
opinion that there is a higher standard you are
either without much worldly experience or deluded
by the flowery treatises pertaining to the characters
you mention your question as to a finer state of
matter than ether shows lack of concentration on
your part the state you seek exists and manifests
its existence in various manners but has never
been isolated for analysis e g mental telepathy
and hypnotism are recognized facts but who will
and can essay an hypothesis as to the medium
employed a thought is transmitted by purely men-
tal force it requires material substance to pene-
trate tlr recipients consciousness call it what
you will it is matter various trade names have
been applied but your quality x is as good as any
what sleep is or why it comes is as yet not a
matter of agreement the only alternative one
has is to note the changes during the procedure
blood pressure is lowered blood vessels in the brain
are relaxed although filled with blood and they
contract when sleep is disturbed or during dreams
respiration and all vital processes have their ac-
tivity reduced evidence is tending toward the
assumption that there is some loosening of the
connections between the different elements such as
increased resistance at the synapsis to the passage
of excitations but the causation is conpectural
nervous action is not abolished and the mind still
gathers and creates impressions the absolute
unconscious state is never reached until
death it is obvious sleep is a state of relaxation
conducive to the restoration of tissues the effects
of fatigues are nullified cell bodies restored and
waste products eliminated from the blood and mus-
cle this should prove its vital necessity until a
chemical substitute can be made to perform these
duties would suggest you read psychology of
dreams by dr e w walsh as your questions
are treated in detail in this volume

   johnnie walker unless one believes in the ein-
 stein theory your preordained destiny remains to
 be created by nobody but yourself whatever
 thoughts sounds or actions you are responsible for
 in the past are still here although they have un-
 doubtedly lost their identity e g if you whistled
 a tune twenty years ago the vibrations you created
 are still in existence to prove this theory cap-
 ture your vibrations and lengthen or shorten them
 to their original state and your auditory members
 will reproduce them once again as far as the
 future is concerned there is no future there is a
 certain amount of matter never increasing or de-
 creasing at our disposal which has been remodeled
 time and again through the countless aeons the
 future in store is to assist in the present recon-
 struction which in turn will sooner or later go

  we have published many comments in this col-
  umn concerning our stories but here one of our
  correspondents who possesses the editorial mind
  gives seriatim criticism of many of our corre-
  spondents letters and we are sure that this com-
  munication will be greatly enjoyed by many of
  those who write to us and whose letters have ap-
  peared in this department of the magazine in a
  sense this is the most original letter we have ever
  published now for a gas attack by super-super-
  critics on this super-critic-editor

 concerning ten million miles sun-
 ward-an admirer of h g wells-
 what the celebrated critic
 william archer says
 about him

  editor amazing stories

   in the current march issue of amazing
  stories the story which  considered by far the
  best was geoffrey hevelckcs ten million miles
  sunward not only was it well told and of ab-
  sorbing interest but it contained just enough sci-
  ence to give versimilitude to the tale as to the
  accuracy of that science  am not competent to
  judge however i am inclined to believe that the
  feat of diverting the earth from its orbit is beyond
  the realms of possibility and even were such a
  stupendous project achieved it could only result
  in universal chaos for the planets of the solar sys-
  tem are so delicately balanced that the slightest
  deviation from its course of so huge a mass as the
  earth could not fail to precipitate a catastrophe
  but i need not indulge further in such futile
  guesses for by the time this letter is printed-if
  at all-professor luytcns solution will already have
  appeared and i am not one to contest in the lime-
  light with a harvard don

    therefore i shall turn to a subject with which
  i am more familiar namely the recent attempts
  of some misguided readers to disparage the stories
  of ii g wells there is no need for me to defend
  mr wells against these insignificant diatribes but
  for the edification of his detractors let me quote
  what william archer in his criticism of god the
  invisible king says of mr wells no quest is
  loo perilous for him no forlorn hope too daring
  he led the first explorers to the moon lie it was
  who lured the martians to earth and exterminated
  them with microbes he has ensnared an angel
  from the skies and expiscated a mermaid from the-
  deep he has mounted a time machine of his
  own invention and gone careering down the vistas
  of the future

    this deserved tribute from a man who himself
  is prominent in english letters needs no elaboration
  as mr c p prescott remarked in a recent letter
  the critics of h g wells are more to be pitied
  than heeded were this magazine to contain but a
  single story in each issue and that by h  wells

  i should continue to purchase it and consider myself
  amply repaid

    i notice that a number of readers are continu-
  ally asking for reprints of certain masterpieces of
  scientifiction which have appeared in other maga-
  zines in adding my request to theirs i would
  specify the following on the brink of  after
  a million years and between worlds by garret
  smith the metal emperor by a merritt and
  the fire people by ray cummings of course

  i do not suggest the reprinting of all these stories
  but i would be highly gratified to see any one of
  them in this magazine

                           a l glasser

 forest ave new york n y

    ten million miles su nward is certainly a very
  clever story and the little sequel as it may be
  called giving professor luytens clear explanation
  o this possibility makes it a liue more valuable
  sometimes we feel that we lear-i more through our
  mistakes than from everyday instruction mistakes
  can be made to do good sometimes exceeding the
  harm they mav have done and this story has done
  much to clarify the ideas of many readers on cos-
  mic physics

   we wonder what some of the critics of mr
  wells will think when they read the extract from
  the great english critic william archer
the best stories both short
and serial

   editor amazing stories

     i am one of your faithful readers and have not
   missed a single story since amazing stories was
   bom  have attempted several letters but have
   always thrown them away before giving you a
   chance to do the same	-

     i am very much interested in your discussions 
   and also enjoy reading mr gernsback s editorials
   my onlv kick which i am going to get out of my
    system right now is the date of the appearance of
   your publication as soon as i received my l-ebru-
   ary number i read about the quarterly also the
   statement that it would appear on january th
   as soon as the twentieth came  rushed to the
   newsstand for a copy after a wait ot a jttle
   over three weeks  was able to secure one 
   suppose you had some reason for it but it the
   magazine is going to come out on rebruary th
   instead of january th i wish that you would
   at least give us a nearer idea which is all your
   date seems to have been of the day we can
   secure it

     the following are the bgt short stories you
   have published in my opinion whispering ether
   charles s wolfe he man m ho could work
   miracles by h c wells the man who could
   vanish -by a lfyatt yen-ill the green splotches
   by t s stribling the time machine by j-i g
   wells the radio ghost by otis adelbert kline
   around the universe by ray cummings and be-
   lore the infra red by george paul bauer

     i have selected the following serials that stand
   out in mv memory station x a columbus of
   space first men in the moon the land that
   time foraot moon pool treasures of tantalus
   and the moon of doom as for the last men-
   tioned i think it was great i feel rather proud
   as it was written by one of my fellow townsmen
   the day before the quarterly came out the augusta
   paper carried an item about it including a photo of
   mr bell returning to the above stories  think
   that land that time forgot was the best wlnlc
   the moon pool and the treasures of tantalus ran
   as close seconds

     i notice that one of your readers says that the
   books of wells verne and other old writers can
   be secured at the bookstores and that we would
   rather have new stories  notice an advertise-
   ment in your magazine the master of the world
   price  i would rather you would give us
   the classics in the magazine because such are
   absolutely out of my reach otherwise in most cases

     i will close by asking for three things more
   illustrations more serials  certainly cannot get
   along with just one a month and more stories
   bv edgar rice burroughs a merritt prof serv-
   iss if he has written any that you have not
   hitherto published garret smith mcleod wind-
   sor ray cummings and clement fezandie t beg
   that you grant just as much of thelast request as
   possible

                           g	coleman luck

                     wrightsboro augusta ga

     we would like to have had the chance given us
   to have thrown away your previous letter because
   judging by the present one we would certainly
   never have done so there has been considerable
   trouble in getting some of our various publications
   on the newsstands on time there were various
   reasons including a flooding of one of the estab-
   lishments due to a break in the water system and
   this is only one of several things which occasioned
   the unfortunate delay so you will have to excuse
   what we may fairly term the unavoidable troubles
   of a publisher your specifications of the stories
   which you like are very interesting and we are
   glad to see that mr bell received credit in one
   of your local papers for his very line work w e
   have given a great many classics in our maga-
   zine and hope to continue doing so w e are sure
   that if you will look back on our work of the last
   few years you will realize some wonderfully good
   things have been taken out of the past we cannot
   say we have rescued them from oblivion but as
   we have used them they have had a great effect
   in giving a very high standard to amazing stories

an unnamed approver of
pedestrians

 editor amazing stories	

     i am writing to tell you of my interest in a
   story which appeared in the february issue of your
   magazine the revolt of the pedestrians by david

   h	keller md seems particularly convincing
   in its imaginative conception the science of
   the story is embodied in sufficiently simple terms
   for the usual reader and this veiled satire is most
   interesting

     i believe that most of the reasoning is true and
   logical and it seems that such stories should stir
   automobilists to question the advisability of their
   chosen pastime all in all it is a thought-provoking
   story other stories of its caliber should strengthen
   your magazine i think

                    an interested reader

gilneo texas

     this letter gives a version of what we find from
   our correspondent to be quite a general apprecia-
   tion of the revolt of the pedestrians the con-
   trast between the non-pedestrians with their atro-
   phied legs and the charming girl who had not
   yielded to the general custom and so kept her
   physique intact was certainly very well told and
   after all theres a worthy moral in the story-we
   should utilize our powers both muscular and men-
   tal to obtain the best results-editor
