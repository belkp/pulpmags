   once upon a midnight dreary i was lying-not so weary

   on a mass of silken pillows heaped upon my bedroom floor
   while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
   as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
   must be theodore i murmured jack or fred or lewis vore-
   one of them-or maybe more

   ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december

   and i shivered in my nightie as i ran to ope the door

   my young heart was beating madly and my body swaying gladly
   so i doffed my nightie-bad me-an i opened up the door   
   in disgust though i retreated and from kisses i forbore

           it was hubby-nothing more

hilda gets all hot
and bothered

  by eugenia day

               jerrys story and he sticks to it

ilda was a cool blonde
and looked like a cool
million
it was
neces-
sary for
hilda to
keep
cool or
herheart
would

have galloped away with her head-
and you know what happens then

  hildas good looks were not or-
dinary good looks they were rav-
ishing when she focused her big
violet eyes on a poor fat butter-and-
egg man he turned to putty in her
hands    and little hilda was some
sculptress with butter-and-egg-man
putty she knew her night clubs
too    and shed long before decided
that it was better to like a little and
live on riverside drive than love a
lot and live in the bronx thats the
way she figured it and at that about
fifty million other girls figured the
same-and fifty million other girls
cant be wrong

  hilda swore when the telephone
rang she was just getting settled
down for a long day-time nap but
the little french instrument on her
bed table was insistent-and here it
was noon-the middle of the night

  ye-ss

  if television were in use she could
have seen j mortimer wilks stocks
 bonds seated in his suite at the
biltmore in his b v ds with a
great big bouncing bottle of  a
case scotch roosting before him   
half gone

  did i wake up little cuddlums
cooed j mortimer innocently

  oh no- but hilda smothered
the wise-crack after all her little
 pound play-mate of the night
before had said something about a
mercedes roadster    and a square
diamond-or was it that other gink
that mentioned the square diamond
-oh well what the hell-

  hello hinky dinky said hilda
affectionately she called him hinky
dinky for no apparent reason-the
name amused her

  i cant sleep worth a damn con-
tinued j mortimer thickly-what
say we get together  

  whh-at

  i mean for lunch  

 oh-

  at the biltmore-at two-oke

  oke replied hilda and tried
to hide the lack of enthusiasm that
she felt for the date but that
mercedes roadster-

  now hilda was considered front

ginger stories

page copy for the evening tabloid
newspapers she was pretty and not
afraid to show a little hosiery in her
photographs and there was scarcely
a raid that she didnt figure in dont
get the idea that she was mixed up
in ordinary speakeasy haul-ins-oh
iny no but when the better swig
and giggle joints got pinched hilda
was usually right on hand one foot
on the bar and three sheets in the
wind and too she had been named
in no less than four divorce cases
hilda was a good correspondent even
though she was a rotten letter
writer

  it just happened that the follow-
ing little scene was being enacted in
one of the pinker tabloid offices just
at the moment that hilda was step-
ping into her warm tub getting all
ready to meet j mortimer

  the managing editor bellowed

 hey-

  the object of this hey was a tall
youngster with sandy hair and keen

                  blue eyes - a cute
kid and no mis-
take his name
was jerry james
not jesse and he
had just come to
work for the paper
-in fact it was
his first job in the
wild and wicked
metropolis

  yes boss an-
swered jerry
jumping to the
chiefs side

  go up to  s
east  th street-
apartment -c-and call on a dame
named hilda-hilda-aside hey
bill what the hells that hilda girls
last name  oh yes hilda hark-
ness  to jerry go up to this
place and see if you cant get some
sort of a story out of her-shes usu-
ally got one up her teddy-

  jerry blushed

  yes sir-any particular kind of
a story

  the boss snarled

  take a look at her-theres only
one kind of story you can get about
her-see if you cant find a pair of
mans pajamas under her bed-see if
-oh hell go on up and see her

  when jerry stepped out of the
taxi he felt in his vest pocket to be
sure his pencil was handy hed want
to take notes-ill say he would

  just as hilda was stepping out of
the tub her bell rang

  being in a hurry she pressed the
buzzer and slipped into a thin neg-
ligee

  then there was the soft purr of
her own apartment bell

  yes    she called wrapping

the silk gadget around a million
dollars worth of torso

  its mr james from the evening
laughic

  come in shouted hilda open-
ing the door-for if there was any-
thing she liked better than publicity
it was twice as much

  the minute she caught sight of
jerry her hard-boiled heart took
three handsprings a couple of nose-
dives and landed up side down

  jerry got pale - sufferin sex-
appeal-what a baby

  i-er-i-er stammered jerry

  i heard you the first time said
hilda smiling have a shot
jerry didnt know whether she was
referring to a colt or a cocktail
shaker and whats more he didnt
care a good metropolitan damn

  dont care if i do he replied
grinning from ear to ear

  that remark was my downfall
reparteed hilda but she didnt go
into details

  my boss sent me up
here for a story began
jerry as he drained the
thin glass of straight rum
   know any stories

  did you hear
the one about the
farmers daugh-
ter-

  i mean for the
newspaper-

  hilda looked at
jerry again and
her heart started
to skip again

  something had
to be done  so
she went over and
sat on the arm of
jerrys chair

  jerry looked in-
to those large

violet eyes    his nostrils inhaled the
exotic scent from her freshly bathed
body  he felt her lovely bare leg
press against his    and in less time
than it takes to snap a garter he
crushed her down beside him and
kissed her-once    twice    three
times-and sold

 oh-oh jerry boy-

  jerry believed that actions spoke
louder than words so he answered
her with another kiss

  hilda jumped up

 oh - oh
-oh she
wailed

i cant let
you do that

-	i cant
fall in
love with
you- id-
starve-

whats that you say
i say said hilda
in a nervous voice i
cant make it-
but-

  hilda hung up
quickly

turn to page 

  of course jerry didnt fully un-
derstand what she was raving about
but he did understand that if he
didnt have her in his arms hed go
nutty

  so he got up and leaped toward
hilda like a tiger for his beefsteak
hilda started on a fast trot for the
bedroom silly girl what made her
think shed be safe there arent
women the nuts

  in an instant jerry was beside her

-	catching her up in his arms -
caressing her-fondling her-kissing
her-driving her cuckoo

  together they seemed to drift into
a complete haze of passion-
the time place date and month
of the year were forgotten -

they were living only in a glorious
warm exotic land of love-

  oh jerry-

 hilda-hilda-hilda-

	   

  the telephone began to ring -
brrrrr-rrrrr-

  damn

  brrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrrrr-

  finally hilda picked up the phone
in no mood to be talking with j

  hilda said a voice where in

diary

of a

ginger bred
girl

by eve lynn

sunday



march



just back from a mad shopping tour and what do i find
someone has been good to me - i wonder who -

the latest model portable and loose-leaf diary well -
now i may use the hunt and peck system to my hearts content
i am nearly as fagged as i was last night after i imprudently
told francois le chaud that i couldnt believe french lovers
were all they are pashed up to be he certainly convinced
me though and how that man can-argue but to return to
this afternoons hectic store-trotting the dress i finally
unearthed is nothing less than the latest reply to a young
ladys plea its one of those awfully affectionate cling-
ing affairs that makes a girl grin and bare it any man
who could calmly look at a girl inside of a dress like that
simply isnt hitting on all glands and who wants a man lika
that

to-morrow night is the colossal evening for little eve
that being the time when i am to see arthur dell the famous
author of ten evils of dancing there is to be a public
dance at the gilt glade and he is going to be there osten-
sibly in search of material for another book on dancing

and be it understood that i am always ready to assist strug-
gling young authors-providing they are sufficiently attrac-
tive judging by arts photo in this mornings paper he
isnt exactly the type one sarcastically invites over to
scare the children of course he has a goody-goody complex

turn p


as is evidenced by his horror of modern dancing but then-
he hasnt danced with me yet

 tuesday



 march

  

  two days later and everything is hotsy-totsy now in
other words veni vidi vici which boing freely inter-
preted means i arrived i saw him i got him referring
to the little puritan novelist of course

  the gilt glade should have changed its name last night to
the sardine container-it was so packed with poor fish in
fact i was there more than an hour before i realized that the
guest of honor arthur dell wasnt even on the floor but
was sitting at one end of the hall in a little draped
grandstand he was neatly sandwiched in between two terrible
femmes who seemed to be just about as welcome as a scotch-
man at a gold diggers ball not having reckoned upon him
being exiled in that manner i was rather dismayed for a
moment but after all napoleon was right when he said
everything is fair in love and war so i just sent one of my
partners over to art with the cryptic message that someone
ii

who wished to see him about his new book was waiting for him
in the balcony

  i watched him make formal and i fancied not too re-
luctant adieus to his two crestfallen companions and then
he swiftly threaded his way through the maze of dancers up
the balcony steps and toward me he would have passed me
though had i not reached out and touched his arm

  it was i who sent for you i said demurely dont you
intend to dance to-night

  -dance  he repeated horrified why i never danced
in my life 

  oho thought i no wonder you wrote the ten evils of
dancing you know nothing at all about the ten or more
thrills i pursed my lips and tried to look very business-
like

  im from your publishers i said - we cant all be little
george washingtons-and they think that you should have
more practical experience of your subject they-ah-believe
that you could write much more realistically if you danced
in fact they absolutely refuse to take your next book un-
less you follow their instructions of course i hastened
on they realized that you wouldnt want to dance with
everybody so they sent me

  and then i smiled my most appealing smile - the one that had
taken a whole afternoons practice before the mirror it
worked he looked very deeply and steadily at me for a long
long moment and then without a word took my arm and to-
gether we descended the balcony stairs

  i obligingly instructed him in the conventional - or  it
unconventional - method of holding a lady during a dance
he was very careful to leave plenty of space between us -
at first as we glided away he just a trifle unsteady and
unsure of the steps he muttered this is - horrible

  i looked hurt other men havent found it so - horrible
i pouted he didnt reply being too engrossed in a study
of the floor over which we were dancing it was unique
for at intervals it was made of heavy plate glass through
which one could see little pools of sparkling water filled
with gold fish disgraceful gasped my escort glancing
down

  do you really consider it a bad influence for - the fish
i asked innocently he glared and soon after that we dis-
covered that there were a number of mirrors placed just
below the glass we hadnt seen them at first because of
the crowds continually circling about them arthur didnt
say a word but i noticed that a very determined expression
crept into his handsome face i wondered if he contem-
plated tearing up the floor and ruining the demoralizing
mirrors - but how i did misjudge that boy not ten minutes
later i suddenly realized that though going through
all the regular motions of dancing we still remained on
the same spot i glanced up puzzled and what was my aston-
ishment to find my partners eyes riveted feverishly upon

the favor

       by arthur styron

on bill lend us
nest pleaded

dont be a damned
luui jim said bill a
nest has to be strictly private secret
or the chickens arc shy of it-see
but bill just for this once you

know im an old friend -

  all the more reason we shouldnt
get our love affairs mixed and spoil
everything get a nest of your
own

  i will-later but i need one
today-urgently

  why dont you go to a hotel
asked bill

  the er-lady refuses you see
she is a widow and has a position to
maintain so she is most discreet ive
had an awful time bringing her to
the point of-er-granting an inter-
view and only last night she con-
sented and even then it was only
on the condition that we meet in an
apartment where no
one lived secluded
and strictly private
and rented under an
assumed name

  in other words-
a nest

 yes and now
that you understand

im sure youll do me
this little favor old
boy

  i will not said
bill firmly

  the two men were seated in the
lounge of the mctropole club smok-
ing long cigars and sipping longer
aperitives they were both of the
same type-tall slender well-dressed
men-about-town with smooth-shav-
ed faces and dark sleek hair both
were about thirty although jim
with his merry eyes and humorous
mouth at times seemed much
younger

  jim gave vent to a deep sigh at
his friends obstinacy and ordered
another aperitif i dont understand
you at all bill he said sadly even
if you wont do me this little favor

you might do it for inez -

  inez exclaimed bill sitting up

suddenly is that who it is -

  sure didnt you know all the
time

  i suspected said bill slowly a

jurn over


ginger stories

dark color was beginning to stain
his face

  well theres no use pretending
youve known all the time i was
after her

  you are lucky said bill dryly
she is a beautiful woman

  shes luscious added jim enthu-
siastically you used to like her
pretty well yourself and so i thought
youd be willing to do her this little

favor -

  you are clever jim

  or maybe thats why you re-
fuse because you liked her-

  what

  you wont lend us the nest be-
cause youre jealous

  dont be an ass jim i refused
before i ever knew who you were
meeting

  and now that you know you
wont refuse any longer

  bill looked at his friend for a few
moments in silence
while a heavy frown
gathered between his
brows certainly jim
was not a heavyweight

mentally he delivered his kos to
the many women who adored him
in other ways

no jim he said slowly i wont
refuse any longer

thats the lad said jim grate-
fully reaching for his friends hand
and shaking it warmly have you
got the key

  wait a minute said bill if
you take the nest you will have to
keep it i wont be able to use it
again

  glad to said jim ive needed
one a long time

  ill write you a transfer said
bill he took a notebook from his
pocket and scribbled something with
his fountain pen tearing the sheet
out he handed it to his friend with
two keys dont go together he
advised

dont you think ive got any
brains asked jim gaily receiving
the articles and
dropping them in-
to his pocket
c t n r f r stories



  not many thought bill but he
said its not a question of brains
but of instincts

  have another drink jim in-
vited

  no thanks  have to write some
letters

  well so long thanks a thou-
sand times for the-transfer ill
send you a check

  not at all old man im glad to
let you have it good luck bill
wended his way to the writing-room
where he actually did write a letter
to a miss daisy smith urging her
to meet him at the usual place that
afternoon

  as soon as he was alone jim too
grew very busy there was first of
all a letter to be written to inez
telling her about the won-
derful rendezvous he had
arranged and giving her
detailed instructions about
finding the apartment

after adding a burning
exhortation not to fail
him that afternoon he
sealed the letter not for-
getting to enclose one of
the keys and sent it by
special messenger
to the beautiful
widow

 instead of
lunch lie had a
swim and rub-
down at the club
followed by sev-
eral high - balls
after which he
procured a taxi
and made his way
to the nest it
was still early
but he was im-

patient to get things in readiness for
his loved-ones arrival

  the nest was an apartment n one
of those small discreet hotels jvhere
one encounters only an clevator-boy
with affected blindness jim fitted
his key in the lock with a feeling
of bland satisfaction which was en-
hanced as lie entered the room bill
certainly had exquisite taste for such
things the floor was completely
covered by a black persian carpet-
very thick and silky and the walls
were tinted a delicate pink a
french couch-bcd very low and
wide curtained with apple-green
silk draperies reaching to the ceiling
occupied one side of the room form-
ing the motif so to speak of the
apartment opposite a small open
fireplace in which a gas-log burned
brightly was surmounted by a parian
marble mantel upon
which ticked a gold
clock two arm-chairs
a small writing desk a
liquor cabinet and a low
jacobean table complet-
ed the rooms furnish-
ings

jim closed and locked
the door and considered
the burning log some-
one must have been here
then he sniffed the air

critically jasmin inez she had
beat him to it the sweet thing had
been as impatient as he

  the sound of splashing water came
to him from the bathroom the
next instant he heard a voice call-
ing subdued and muffled through
the thick door

  is that you darling

  yes he cried jubilantly

  get ready ill be out in a min-
ute said the voice

  jim noticed for the first time a
pair of pyjamas laid out on the bed-
pyjamas of delicate silk tan splotch-
ed with crimson he quickly strip-
ped and donned his uniform

  im all ready he called to the
bathroom door

  in a minute said the voice

  jim decided to pass the time by
doing some exercises to strengthen
the back he was so engrossed in
this that he did not hear the bath-
room door softly open nor the soft
flurry of silk as someone crept across
the room and so he was taken com-
pletely by surprise when a soft warm
body leapt upon his back as he leaned
over to touch the floor and a pair
of small hands clutched at his thick
hair as if it were reins

  certainly he thought quickly
inez had thawed more completely
than he had ever anticipated

  giddap said a fresh young
voice jim rose upright the girl still
clinging to his back and trotted off
to the bathroom there in front of
a large pier-glass they regarded each
other for a moment both of them
were too stunned to speak the face
that he saw peeping over his shoulder
was not that of inez at all but of
a vivacious striking blonde the
face that she saw above her encir-
cling arms was not that of bill but
of a younger man who resembled

 bill in every feature except his eyes
 and mouth

  she was the first to recover put
 me down she commanded haught-
 ily

  jim released her thighs which he
 had been holding in place astride his
 back and allowed her to slip to the
 floor i hope you enjoyed your
 ride he observed politely

  dont try to be funny said the
 young woman with as much dignity
 as could be expected of a lady wear-
 ing only a brief pair of step-ins
 just tell me what you are doing
 here

  playing horsey answered jim

  the young woman stamped her
foot on the tile floor but the gesture
was not effective as her foot was
bare

  tell me she ordered

  all right said jim but dont
 you think its rather cold in here
 suppose we go out by the fire

  very well she said

  he gravely offered her his arm
which she accepted and they
marched into the bedroom jim
pulled the two arm-chairs close to
the blazing log and they sat down
he gallantly removed the coat of his
pyjamas and draped it about her bare
shoulders

  well she said regarding her
 toes which she wriggled before the
 blaze

  my name is jim what is yours

  daisy

    daisies dont tell he quoted

  then let jim do it she said sig-
 nificantly

  all right daisy this is the ex-
 planation this is my apartment

   it is not

  it is i rented it just today from
 a friend of mine named bill whom
ginger stories



the paper bill had given him and
resumed his seat

daisy read and gave a little ex-
clamation it says that for one
thousand dollars he transfers the
apartment and everything it contains
to you she cried

  jim nodded so it does

  the beast she stormed he
meant to include me he is selling
me

  i havent paid him yet jim con-
soled her

  then you mustnt she cried
i couldnt bear to be paid for

  i wont pay him said jim firmly

  daisy began to blubber a little
using the pyjama coat for a hand-
kerchief jim overcome with sym-
pathy knelt on the rug at her feet
and put his arms around her waist
he raised his face and his merry
eyes looked deep into hers

  you arc a good friend she
sighed

  you must not rate my friend-
ship too highly he told her

turn over

i suppose you know

  today she seemed bewildered
why he wrote me to meet him here
today

  then he must have done it be-
fore he transferred the apartment to
me as a matter of fact he did seem
a little loath to let me have it-for
some reason

  i dont believe you at all she
announced

  i can prove it he rose and
rummaged among his clothes lying in
a heap on the low table finally ex-
tracting a piecc of paper from one
of the pockets daisy watched him
fascinated by the wide shoulders and
strong back upon which she had
lately jogged

  perhaps youd better put on those
clothes she observed icily

  before you he asked reproach-
fully i wouldnt be so immodest
besides im too hot

          you were cold a minute
        ago

           thats the way with me
he said hot and then cold-
or vice versa    now for
a	the proof he handed her


ginger stories

  their lips met in a deep burning
kiss

  i never did give a damn about
bill anyhow she said tenderly and
sneezed

  you are taking cold darling
murmured jim you must lie
down on the couch and cover up
want me to ride you over there

  yes she replied gratefully

  jim got down on all fours and
daisy mounted upon his back he
was trotting gracefully over the car-
pet when the door softly opened and
a woman appeared on the threshold
she was a dark exotic creature ex-
quisitely cloaked in rose kashmir
trimmed with ermine

  horse and rider collapsed in the
middle of the room inez stam-
mered jim

  the gorgeous brunette looked them
over haughtily and some of the deep
bloom of her cheeks faded then

  too bad t came a little early
she said in a crisp icy tone and
without another word turned into
the hall slamming the door behind
her

  what shall we do mumbled
jim

  finish our ride answered daisy

e radically digging her hands into
is thick dark hair

	  

  inez was seething with rage when
she reached the street bill who had
been spying from a doorway oppo-

site thought it best not to speak to
her until she had walked several
blocks then as if it were a casual
encounter lie addressed her

  inez what arc you doing here
oh-hello  was paying a little
visit to a friend

  i hope its already paid he ven-
tured

 why

  i was going to invite you to come
over to my apartment for a cup of
tea ive just taken a new place-
today

  really

  and i do so much need your ad-
vice a man is lost without a wo-
mans help

  bill dont be absurd i know
what a gay bachelor you arc

  not for three years inez

  her large dark eyes grew suddenly
warm just the time ive been   
a widow

  i get very lonely tnez

  so do  bill she sighed slipping
her arm confidingly through his

  bill was elated already he had
forgotten the long months he had
gazed so greedily upon her dark love-
liness when he had thought she was
destined only for jim

  after all jim had done him a great
favor by taking the old apartment-
and daisy-off his hands

  the past was finished it would
be wonderful to turn over a new
leaf

  thus thinking he drew her down
a side street towards his new nest

much of a coward to enter into the spirit of wedlock tells her husband the whole
story he agrees to let the marriage stand on her own terms but she thinks it
better that he allow her to go out of his life rus as she calls him agrees promises
to make a generous settlement-and leaves her on their wedding night

    after he had gone alva couldnt sleep but twisted restlessly in her bed until

sat down on the edge of the bed
you are beautiful he went on after
a minute no wonder i couldnt
get you out of my mind youre the
kind who send men to hell

  not a real man rus she cor-
rected scornfully only a weakling

  she scrutinized him through nar-
rowed eyes it was quite evident
now he had been drinking heavily
and he was as unlike the rus monroe
she knew as the same man could be
somehow looking at his bleary eyes
his slightly loose lips the way he
staggered around the bed she felt as
though she were ill rus monroe
the impeccable rus so-he was
like all the others a coward he
couldnt face an issue he had let a

get away with your usual stuff did
you

  what do you mean

  oh you have quite a reputation
my dear for bending men to your
will youd like to have added me
to the list wouldnt you

manded imperiously

  the answer came thickly in a
voice she scarcely recognized you

  she watched him close the door and
cross the room to the foot of the bed
watchcd him fascinated was this
really rus monroe or a twin brother
physically alike but subtly different
he was grinning down at her one-
sidedly

  he laughed shortly nothing you
can say will make any difference to
me tonight oh youll get your
divorce all right youll get your
alimony but-tonight is mine he
caught her fingers and disengaged
them from the sheet youre my
wife for tonight

  rus she exclaimed and man-
aged to elude his grip gaining the
floor on the other side of the bed
rus she said again you dont
know what youre doing you dont
want me and i dont want you
please go to your room

  his head was lowered but his eyes
held hers his feet were planted far
apart as though he meant to charge
youre my wife lie repeated
all the more reason why you
should treat me with respect she
replied sparring for time while she
calculated the distance to the door

  but reading her intention in her
wild gaze he reached the door ahead
of her and locked it

  quite in the approved melo-
dramatic style he said with a mock-
ing bow

  she stood close to him panting
raging

  youre despicable

  not at all merely within my
rights

  if you are a gentleman you will
g  

  this is my honeymoon it is
hardly proper to spend it alone

  i hate you

  and i love you

  love she tossed her head you
call this love

  and suddenly he reached out for
her but she darted away toward the
balcony her heart was pounding
furiously she was deathly afraid of
this man who had turned the tables
upon her if she could only reach the
balcony

  but she didnt he caught a flow-
ing piece of drapery and though it
tore in his grasp he succeeded in
digging his fingers into the flesh of
her arms

  rus she cried in fierce panic
in time i may learn to-to care for
you-but if you force me-i swear
to god ill hate you all my life

  i wont be the first man youve
hated-for the same reason

  no no that isnt true you
are the first-you are

youre mine and im going to have
you

hpd sold herself into his keeping no
matter what he did to her she de-
served it she had sold herself to the
highest bidder

and pressed hard against them the
world was blotted out in a sordid gust
of passion that gradually attained the
heights of sublimety

  all night and well into the morn-
ing alva lay on the bed in a strange
magic spell neither sleeping nor wak-

floated like thistledown across her

sleeping heavily drugged with
liquor she had done that to him
yet she had something to forgive
him now what a difference it made
no longer the man who could preach
to her but one akin on her own
level a human being even as she
was someone to be taken care of

  she couldnt have told the exact

wake her saw him sit down write
something on the mauve paper leave
it propped up against a perfume
bottle on the dressing table then
without a glance toward the bed go
swiftly toward the door

  her voice arrested him in the act
of opening it a languid voice that
gave no hint of the tightening of
her throat the beating of her heart

  he whirled as though he had been
shot and his black eyes bore into hers
she saw that he looked drawn tired

answered i dont know

had met her fearless gaze he bowed

his head on her hand with a groan

he couldnt seem to understand

what has gone before

  a semi-tropic storm causes judith hem-
inc  beautiful mystery-girl to break her
journey from new york to palm beach by
spending the night in a beautiful resort hotel
on the edge of a lake-the villa rosa jerry
ransome who owns the hotel is attracted
to judith and is puzzled when she reveals
an almost frantic fear of another guest
martin ivebb judith and jerry sit up strr-
eral hours on the storm-swept hotel veran-
dah and a keen attraction springs up be-
tween them

  that night jerry finds martin trying to
gain access to judiths room and sends him
on his way though martin insists that he
has a right there at two am judith
comes to jerrys room and gives herself to
him with every manifestation of desire and
response much to jerrys amazed delight

now go on with the story

n the morning when
jerry awoke he was alone
his eyes deepened to an
almost worshipful ten-
derness as he realized that
her shyness had made her
slip away from him in
the night unable to face his adoring
eyes in the gray dawn

  it was still quite early the storm
had increased and the sky was gray
the rain descending in torrents driv-
ing against the side of the hotel as
though in an insensate fury the
wind had increased and the orange
trees bent their heads before its fury
the palm trees bent and swayed the
wind rattiiig their feathery tops with
a dry rattling sound

 when he went down into the
lobby he found that oaly such of

the servants as were quartered in the
rooms over the kitchen were on duty
and lie immediately plunged into the
task of helping them getting the
lobby to rights seeing that prepara-
tions for breakfast were made and
all the time his eyes were on the
stairs waiting hoping eager for his
first sight of judith

  she came down at last-a slenderj
lovely vision in a morning frock of
jonquil-yellow crepe she held her
lovely head high and when he started
forward to greet her she hesitated
an imperceptible moment then with
a warm tide of crimson creeping up
and over her face she averted her
eyes and brushed by him without a
word

  jerry stood stock-still for a mo-
ment staring after her dumb-
founded could it be possible that
she was treating him like this-after
spending the night in his arms held
close returning nis caresses she had
come to liim of her own free will
with no persuasion or pleading from
him almost thrusting herself upon
him-although goodness knows ha
had been pleased to death thereat but
i was just a little thick that she
should ignore him like this after
giving herself to him as she had

  he was angry at her actions and

  he stared after her his fists clenched
a little and his jaw set hard a low
laugh behind him brought him right
about face and he looked into the
cold amused eyes of martin webb

ginger stories

obviously webb had witnessed the
little scene and had been much
amused

  you see you didnt make such a
tremehtious hit with the little lady
after all young fellow sneered mar-
tin few girls like to have their
parties spoiled - anybody but a sap
would have known that i would not
havo gtne to her room last night
without an invitation from her

  in the sober gray light of the
stoihiy morning jerry hesitated a
moment wondering after all-was
she that type of woman what rea-
son had he to doubt it hadnt she
corue to his room offered herself to
him what reason had he to doubt
that she had asked martin webb to
her room and in the little moment
wiiiie he puzzled shaken no doubt
webb passed on into the dining-
room and jerry saw him seat him-
self at the girls table

  he waited to see if she would show
tbat the presence of webb at her
table was distasteful but when jud-

ith merely looked up at him and went
calmly on with her breakfast jer-
rys heart sank in his breast h
turned back to the desk grimly cer-
tain that he had made several differ-
ent kinds of a fool of himself by in-
terfering last night

  a little later judith came out into
the lobby glanced indifferently
toward him and mounted the stairs
in the direction of her own room
about twenty minutes later webb
left the dining-room and with a sig-
nificant glance in jerrys direction
also mounted the stairs

  jerry tried hard to go on with his
work but after a little he turned
the desk over to his assistant before
he could leave the lobby however
a testy old gentleman came up to
him

  see here ransome-what sort of
hotel is this anyway ive stopped
here every winter for ten years-and
its the first time ive ever seen or
heard anything-er-off-color but
if this infernal noise goes on im
ginger stories



moving to another hotel storm or no
storm he snapped

  you mean the storm sir is that

the noise- began jerry but the

old gentleman cut in

  i do not i mean the young
woman who has the room next to
mine she kept me awake most of
the night crying-and then two men
almost fought over her in the hall
ard it was two a m before the
dratted place settled down to quiet
i meant to sleep this morning-i sim-
ply must have twelve hours sleep or
im so nervous i cant endure exist-
ence and now she has a man up
in her room and theyre quarrelling
and fighting like the cats of kil-
kenny i insist that something be
done about it snapped the old man
testily

  dont worry sir - something
will said jerry grimly and went up
the stairs two steps at a time

  he hastened down the corridor
toward judiths room but before
reaching it he heard voices not
loud enough for him to distinguish
the words but loud enough for him

to realize that two people were quar-
relling

  he paused at the door listening for
a moment and heard webbs voice
thick with an almost murderous fury

say

  if i thought that was the truth
-id-wring your neck if i knew
id swing for it

  and then judiths voice grim
hard

  you may be quite sure that it is
the truth-or i wouldnt have told
you

  without waiting to hear more-
jerry knocked at the door-there was
a little pause - and then judiths
voice quite clearly saying come
in he heard webbs protesting
murmur did jerry even as he pushed
open the door but it was judith at
whom jerry looked

  im sorry miss fleming-but this
is against the rules of the hotel-a
man in your room with the door
closed also-the other guests are
complaining of your quarrel he told
her courteous but cold

  please come in and close the doors

turn over
gffft stories

jerry said judith quietly i was
going to telephone the desk and ask
you to come up

  jerry hesitated a moment but
something of dumb pleading in jud-
iths eyes impelled him to obey her
and he entered the room closing the
door behind him waiting

  mr webb does not bciieve that
-spent the night in your room-at
least that part of it from two a m
until dawn said judith quite
clearly will you please convince
him that i did

  jerry stared at her dumbfounded
and martin webb turned eves that
were filled with an almost murderous
hatred upon him

  is she telling the truth he
grated after a moment

  she is said jerry simply she
came to my room directly after you
went to your own

  and-stayed demanded webb
through clenched teeth his face going
gray-white his fists knotted until
the knuckles showed w hite with the
strain

  and stayed said jerry firmly

 why damn you-- howled

webb and flung himself at jerry
but jerry was ready for him as the
two men clenched judith screamed
and cowered back webb was trem-
bling with rage but jerry was more
than a match for him even with the
added strength that webbs rage gave
him they fought like mad men-
some of the other guests and hotel
help rushed upon the sccne and sepa-
rated them

  you win this time damn you
s-id webb panting held firmly by
two of the male guests but ill
get you yet if it takes me a life
time and that goes for you too
you little - he barked at the girl
hurling an unprintable name into her
face as the guests exchanged signifi-
cant glances

  they carried webb away to his
room and the hotel physician treated
his bruises jerry waited until jud-
iths room was cleared of all save him-
self and judith and then he spoke-
gently

  im - sorry to have precipitated
such a row in your room

  she lifted her slim shoulders in a
little weary shrug

  what difference docs it make
and anyway it wasnt your fault
she assured him wearily

  see here judith-i feel i am en-
titled to some sort of explanation
why did you-come to me as you
did last night burst from jerry
almost without his volition

  she faced him squarely

  partly-because  wanted to you
attracted me you were he first man
v  ever-thrilled me-that sounds
trite and hackneyed-but-its quite
true she told him quietly the
other reason wasthat-i was afraid
of-webb

  jerry held himself in leash though
his pulses were throbbing at the
thought that she had come to him
because she had felt a desire for him
there was more that he had to know

  why were you afraid of him
judith had you ever seen him be-
fore he persisted

  oh yes-ive known him for-
two years she returned

  jerrys heart sank a little but he
went on grimly

  judith - ive got to know - so
that i can decide what is to become
of - you and me he told her
what-is martin webb to you

  she looked up and suddenly her
eves were old and tired-beaten and
unhappy

  he is - my husband she said
very low

jerry stood still while the ground
rocked beneath his feet and the

crashed in ruins about him

  your-husband he repeated as
though he could not force himself to
a realization of what that meant

  yes said judith wearily my
-husband and-i hate him id
rather have - a rattlesnake coiling
about me than his arms id rather
die-than be to him-what i have
been to you

  jerry looked a little startled then
you have never been-his wife in
anything but name

  she shook her head and her face
twisted with a little sick frown of
repulsion at the thought no she
gasped shivering a little no no-
and i wont be i wont be ill-
kill myself first

  jerry went to her and took her in
his arms holding her close drawing
her down beside him on the little cre-
tonne covered love-seat beneath the
storm-lashed windows

  tell me about it darling he said
gently of course you know that i
love you and that i want you to
marry me perhaps there is a way
out

  she shook her head wearily but
gave herself to the embrace of his
arms with the sweet relaxation that
thrilled him and made his arms
tighten about her with delight

  there isnt anything to tell she
said wearily i was in school abroad
-a finishing year dad came to
me told me that he was ruined and
begged me to marry martin so that
martin would lend dad a lot of
money with which to build back his
fortune dad was so-pitiful i
couldnt refuse him and-i thought
martin was-rather nice i hajl
known so few men so-we were
married the day that dad and i ar-
rived in new york and-dad died
in a motor accident less than an hour
after our wedding

  she broke into sobs and for a mo-

ment clung to him collapsing in her
grief and the vividness of her memo-
ries but after a moment she re-
gained her shattered self-control and
forced herself to go on

  i-had made a bargain with mar-
tin-and-i meant to keep it but
-i didnt love him-and-he was-
brutal- he-doesnt love me-he
never did he just-wanted to-
me-because i was innocent and
untouched-ugh he-he fright-
ened me so-that-i ran away from
him i started to palm beach to some
friends who would help me-and the
storm caught me here

  she paused for a long moment and
when at last she looked up at jerry
her face was suffused with a glorious
color and her eyes would not meet
his

  you-were so nice to me i-i
-liked you at once and-i thought
that if-i could convince martin that
i wasnt-untouched-he wouldnt
want me-would be willing to-di-
vorce me and-i could-give my-
self to you because-i liked you-
and you were-so gentle and-and
sweet to me she stammered

  his arms about her were very gen-
tle and his eyes were tender as they
looked down into hers how sweet
she was how adorable his veins
ran fire at the thought of her as she
had been last night soft and fragrant
and warm in his arms giving him
back his kisses with a shy abandon
that had whipped his senses to ec-
stasy

  and-he wont he asked after
a moment

  judith shook her head and sighed

  thats why i told him this morn-
ing i thought hed go away and
leave me in peace-with you but
he said lie wanted me more than ever
now-because i had showed grit-
and that the only change in his plans
would be that he would not need to

be-quite so-gentle with me she
stammered and clung to him sob-
bing   

  there was a gentle knock at the
door and jerry put her from him as
he went to open it the house physi-
cian dr sturgis stood there and
seeing over jernys shoulder the girl
who sat huddled weeping on the
jove-seat he motioned jerry outside
the door

  bad news jerry-ugly news
said dr sturgis grimly the chap
you fought-this webb they say he
is-is-dead

  jerry caught his breath on a little
startled gasp

  dead he repeated incredulous

  dead nodded dr sturgis id
say the cause was acutc alcoholism
and a body burned out by dissipa-
tion his heart was like a worn-out
sponge couldnt stand any excite-
ment-went out like a lamp

  then-would you say that i was
guilty of - murder stammered
jerry in horror

  heavens ito boy snapped dr
sturgis strongly your struggle

with him wasnt rough enough for
that webb was about forty and had
lived at a pace that burned the candle
at both ends you neednt feel any
responsibility lad climbing too
many stairs-running for a train-
an extra glass of liquor-any one of
them would have been enough to
have finished him

  he hesitated a moment looking at
jerry oddly

  from what i hear he was pretty
much interested in the young lady

there- he began cautiously

  in strictest confidence dr stur-
gis-she was his wife said jerry
oh said dr sturgis non-com-
mittally then ill leave you to
break the news to her ill attend to
everything else

  jerry stood looking after the doc-
tor as that individual went briskly
down the hall then jerry turned
and opened the door - that door
which led him out of the darkness
and the shadows into the land of
dreams-come-truc where judith
would tread with him and in which
they would live in happiness-to-

what has gone before

  gene stoddard is seated at toni val-
duccis  red dance a dive he sees joan
havelock a beautiful girl enter and take
her place at one of the tables after a
short time she draws a revolver from
her handbag and turning it in the direc-
tion of her own body is about to pull the
trigger when gene intercepts her lead-
ing her from the place gene takes joan
in his car and after a few questions
proposes is accepted and the two become
man and wife an hour later

  it is not a great while before gene is
aware that other men have been calling
at the house to see joan during his ab-
sence and that his wife pays visits at
other apartments

  on one occasion he enters his icifes
room but a short time after he has noticed
a strange man leaving the house seeing
her unadorned his suspicions are natur-
ally aroused-he questions her with no
result a while later he found her
dressed and with a letter in her hand
when he demanded to see the letter she
tore it in shreds and threw the remains
in the fireplace stoddard rescued one
mall corner and while joan stood by
with blazing eyes he read the fragment
    must not come to the house   
my husband   ill meet   the rest
was gone

now go on with the story

gene stoddard stood there
with that fragment of letter
in his hand that fragment
which seemed to tell so much and yet
tod so little of what he really wanted
to know

  his wife stood at the far corner of
the room tears welling in her eyes
si was the picture of wronged and
in-  cent beauty but he could not see

her beauty nor her tears through the
red haze of anger that enveloped
- found his lips framing audibly
an unspeakable name a name whick
was meant for her they were right
about you he cried theyd all
said they wished he hadnt picked a
woman from the gutter of the red
dance well they had been right
shj had turned out worse than he
would have though

  im through with you he told
her im taking rooms -t the club
you can stay on here as long as you
care to as long as you-have the
nerve i ask one thing it would ba
m  to call them affairs but what-
ever they a i please dont carry them
c a in this house  but i gather that
the purpose of this letter was to make
some sort of arrangements

  gene gene youre crazy with
jealousy you dont know what
youre saying

  jealousy is a man jealous because
his lady of the evening has had an-
other the night before jealousy
you talk as if i might still love you
with a little cry joan sank down
upon the bed and she did not turn
when she heard her husband slam the
door of his own room her white
h-d clutched at the covers clutched
and unclutched at them    and
finally her tired body drifted into
sleep

  in his own room gene made prep-
arations to go to the club cable

g t n r e f stories

toul see to m- t of it

  for a week nr two lie was the old
gene stoddard he visited the old
strange haunts-that is all except
the dive wherein hed saved joan
havelock from suicidc that would
have brought too r ny poignant
memories but using his club as a
central point the old gene cut a wide
swath and his friends grinned and
said i told you so they could
guess what had happened

  as for gene he kept finding it
hard to believe yet it was plain
enough joan was no good her
bcaut was a wantons beauty and
it was all that she had she used it
  a brill lait woman would use her
brains-upon any man at all shed
bcn low when hed found her but
givv the chance to begin again shed
started it all over shed go through
the gamut again
eventually find her-
self in a dive like
the red dance

x the point of sui-
cide maybe nobody
would be fool
enough to save her
this time well

gene told himself
he didnt give a
uarnn

  eu he did give a
damn the mem-
ory of joan have-
lock tortured hiii
night md day he
remembered her
that night under
the shower and in
countless situations
since that marriage
night every woman
with whom he tried
to forget made him
remember j o a n

not because she was
at all like joan bu

because her very imperfections made
him want his wife back again

  he was almost ready to go back
to her his desire for joan had almost
made him forget everything when
something happened to remind him
driving down the avenue in his car
he was passed by a taxi in which he
aas certain hvd recognized her some
curious impulse prompted him to fol-
low her he switched the car about
and began the pursuit

  the taxi drew up before a tall
narrow apartment and joan alighted
to the curb gene nosed his roadster
near the taxi jumped out and con-
fronted her

  gene she seemed startled not
quite glad to see him
ginger stories



  joan-i-i want to talk to you

	 

  but i thought you were through
with me gene  and i want
to tell you im leaving the house to-
morrow i-i couldnt think of
staying of course

  but i want you to stay joan i
want to come back all i ask is
that you make some sort of explana-
tion for-for your actions that
day

  ive told you that i cant    and
i have to go now dear

  go

  yes she nodded toward the
apartment im late now

  gene wondered what sort of an
appointment she might have inside
his face hardened then you dont
wish to explain anything

  i-i cant ive told you that
and this appointment i sup-
pose thats none of my business
either

  joan smiled bitterly well is
it you left me-said youd had
enough

  a sudden rage swept through him
yes and by god i had too with
that he turned on his heel and got
into the roadster as he sat there
he watched joan disappear into the
apartment building

  somehow a dim jealousy crept
over him there was no doubt of
it joan had captured him he was
hers no matter what she did why
couldnt he keep her why couldnt
he get at the bottom of this thing
she had said she couldnt tell him
did that mean someone had some
power over her or did it mean that
she couldnt control herself he
hoped it meant the former he
could cope with that and by the
lord harry he would too

  suiting the action to the thought
he drove his car to the next block

and parked it beyond the sight of
the apartment building he walked
back keeping close to the buildings
and entered the apartment once
inside he was at a loss to know what
to do what room his eyes scanned
th names on the cards dickinson
hilliard simons-dr harry simons
that was the name old cable had
given him for one of the gentle-
men who came to see madame

  gene got the number and dashed
up the stairway the apartment
was at the rear and the door natur-
ally was closed he listened but
there was only an ominous and sug-
gestive quiet he looked at the
window at the end of the hall it
jutted over a narrow ledge should
he try it the outlook was on a
deserted alley and the chances of de-
tection were small quietly he
opened the sash and slid out onto
the ledge it was easier than lie
thought the indented brickwork
gave his hands ample hold one
more step he peered cautiously
through the window

  the scene which confronted him
was not unlike the one he had sur-
prised when the rain had spoiled his
golf that certain afternoon there
was joan a clinging revealing robe
around her flawless figure she
stood before a long mirror and
seemed to be arranging her hair
then she sauntered to the other side
of the room out of gene stoddards
sight

  he was about to crash into the
frame of the window to confront
her once more when he was startled
by the entrance into the room of the
same man hed seen that day dr
simons obviously up to duties that
were not altogether professional he
passed from view and at length re-
appeared in his hand was the robe
joan had worn he threw it care-

lessly over a chair and returned to
the other side of the room invisible
to the trembling stoddard on the
ledge outside

  for a full five minutes stoaddard
clung there in a sort of maddened
dae and finally he pulled him-
rif together re-entered the window
and walked slowly down the hallway

  for the next few days he shadowed
joans every move she went
again to dr simons she en-
tered an apartment in an-
other district and twice
visited a house near to stod-
dards own he did

  he suspected that joan was
throttled by something bigger than
herself that there was in her blood
some morbid strain that made her
not the mistress of her own soul
perhaps that was why shed tried
suicide that night in toni valduccis
place if that were so then she
needed to be saved from herself and
luw he wanted her needed her

look up the names of the owners of
these placcs somehow he did not
want to know somehow he was
afraid to know one thing he did
know it must be that this simons
was the biggest factor in joans
life almost mad with jealousy and
bitterness he resolved to know

ceaselessly watching
her keeping track of
her movements both
from his own efforts and
those of a detective
stoddard at length dis-
covered another intended visit to the
simonsapartment he stood in an
entrance way across the street wait-
ing his heart leaped as a taxi drew
to the curb across the street and de-
posited his wife on the walk he
watched her lithe figure into the
apartment and after an appreciable
length of time followed her
ginger stories



  this time he went unerringly to
dr simons apartment he discreetly
rang the bell it was answered by a
blank looking philippine boy who
stated flatly that the doctor was not
in the city he would not be back
until the end of the week

  stoddard shoved a foot into the
doorway liven so lie said i
think ill wait the astonished
philippine remonstrated seemed
ready to cry out but gene stuck his
hand in his pocket with a signifi-
cant gesture there was no sound
from the frightened servant with-
out a moments hesitation stoddard
strode into the room where lie knew
 would find joan he was not
disappointed

  she had removed the suit of her
coat was unclasping the throat of
her sheer waist when lie entered
she turned on him with a little cry

  one more sound and   let you
have what you wanted at valduccis
that night  found you  i want
to see the rest of this

  frantically she looked toward the
doc at her back and even as she
looked the tall dark dr simons came
into the room he saw stoddard and
stopped dead still he turned to
joan who is this

  my-my husband   

  genes lip curled yes isnt it
unfortunate now perhaps youd
like to explain these rather-unusual
-ah-ctc-a-tccs perhaps it would
be better for you if you did
simons shrugged i think per-
haps vour wife could tell you bet-
ter than i

  joan looked at the doctor as if
to obtain his permission again
simons shrugged as if to say what
can you do he has found us
gene it isnt-it isnt what you
think at all you see dr simons
saved my life-

  stoddard grunted so you pulled

the siicide stunt on him too eh
just a minute mr stoddard
simons interposed ill explain it
and i ask that y i allow me the
floor until im finished    he
paused lit a cigarette with madden-
ing ease

  before you met your wife she-
she was in rather straitened circum-
stances you will remember i was
doing some work for the city clinic
she came there with a very nasty case
of grippe almost pneumonia  no-
ticed that just above her left breast
was a black pigmented mole that
would be the beginning of cancer
my colleagues and  had been work-
ing on a cure for cancer we had
this remedy perfected to the point
where it was ready to try the re-
sult might mean cure-and it might
mean death miss havelock-who
is now your wife-made an agreement
with us a legal contract was drawn
we were to give her live thousand to
experiment upon that mole which
would eventually take her life-
you-you actually performed
t operation when you didnt know
how it might turn out

  the doctor raised a hand it has
turned out extremely well for a
time it looked very doubtful it was
then that she felt the need of a more
painless death-at valduccis where
you found her

  i dont believe it simons all
this damned secrecy

  that was a part of the contract
mr stoddard this is a great dis-
covery i wanted no publicity as
yet when vou were married she
pleaded with ne to tcl you but i
know how husbands feel  asked
her not to until the whole thing
was certain now  believe it is
-ah- a see the disrobing was
altogether necessary cancer once
gained ground spreads to any part
of the body i had to be sure that

urn over


ginger stories

my method had cured and not
merely shunted the symptoms to an-
other part

  stoddard turned to joan these
other men at the house that day and
those other visits that you made-
those other men were my col-
leagues simons broke in the
other visits were no doubt to friends
hers triflscent visits your mind
was naturally suspicious stoddard
i can appreciate your feelings and
i am sorry

  genes arms dropped i guess-
i guess it is i who should be sorry
he turned to joan oh joan   
your going through all this    and
ive treated you so badly when i
should have trusted you

  dr simons smiled and left the
room   

that night gene could detect no
black pigmented mole

  oh dr simons quite removed it
dear theres not even a scar
funny i dont remember having
seen it there before either

  joan laughed i seemed so per-
fect to you gene you couldnt
find even one flaw in me    kiss
me darling

  she was helen she was ishtar
she was a woman too beautiful to
live he took her in his arms glad
that she was black again

  arid the next day dr simons
who had never taken a cancer case
in his life sat down and wrote a
short note to a wanton woman

dearest

  we must not meet again it
it too dangerous we are for-
tunate if he keeps on believing
my preposterous story only
your full attention to his love
can make him keep on believing
  and as a physician i advise
yon to rein in that pagan nature
of yours these are things i
could never find the courage to
advise you as a lover as a phy-
sician i find it possible

           harry simons
diary of a ginger bred girl

continued from pntc 

the floor beneath us  i looked down - we were over a mirror  i

  youre certainly anxious to get material for your new
book arent you i asked dryly he flushed deeply and
led me away but like the little prairie flower he too
was growing wilder every hour so he made no attempt at an
apology but only said i dont think ive been holding you-
quite right and then he boldly proceeded to draw me
closer to him i would have protested- certainly would
have-if unfortunately i hadnt experienced a terrible
dizzy faintness just when he had me closest i could only
cling and hope for the best

during the last dance all the lights were extinguished

a powerful spotlight thrown on the revolving crystal chan-
delier sent a million patches of gay vari-colored light
racing through the scented gloom over walls ceiling
floor and dancers arthurs clasp tightened slowly de-
liberately until i hardly knew where my body ended and his
began a delicious sensuous languor crept over me and my
head fell limply back against his supporting arm in the
dimness i could see his eyes flashing burning down into
mine his fine rather grim young mouth relaxed and yearned
toward my uplifted one i saw that his was trembling in a
mad desire for long exciting kisses and my own lips
quivered in response actually aching for the pain of a
pleasure denied he murmured softly hoarsely you-
darling - and bent down-damn  the lights went on and
now i will never know what might have happened but i can
guess

  he couldnt take me home because a committee of fellow-
novelists were dragging him on to a party afterward but
when i was ready to leave he told me thoughtfully that he
believed he needed more dancing instruction before he could
begin his new book

  i havent collected quite enough - data he said gravely
i understood and agreed that he might call here to-night
must dash uptown for another new dress alas that a girl
in the same old gown doesnt look as sweet there is a per-
fect dream of a dress in the paris shoppe window this week
its one of those new swathed-hip effects and when you
walk a certain way-sing halleluiah they need more than a
hand-out to revive em again

when i did finally come downstairs he jumped up took both
of my hands and then just stood there staring at me his
eyes lingering with particular admiration upon the new
nile-green gown

a thing of brevity is a joy forever he quoted solemnly
then we both laughed and he started the victrola and caught
me impetuously in his arms i began to sing with the music
last time we went shopping everything was cod
cods the way youre gonna get love from me i

  but before id finished the verse he suddenly stopped
dancing and groaned oh i cant stand this any longer i
must kiss you the audacity of the man

  seeing that the lady did not protest too much he pulled
my head back against his shoulder and kissed me wildly
almost brutally it was sadly apparent that he knew little
of the fine art - it is an art and a fine one too - of oscu-
lation and equally plain that he would make an apt and
willing pupil he certainly had plenty of ambition and
perseverance but he didnt quite know what to do with it
all so after a lot of hectic lovin that didnt get any-
where if you know what i mean i got sort of exasperated
and said aptly illustrating my words dont do this -
and-that do thus - and - so  after all anything that 
worth doing is worth doing well

  he seemed to take a genuine interest in my lessons and
insisted upon practicing them over and over at last i
was moved to protest he looked agrieved and reminded me in
a hurt tone that all is fair in love and war what could
i do that happens to be a favorite proverb of mine and
really a girl cant go against her favorite proverb how-
ever before i could come to a decision one of my customary
dizzy spells came over me i closed my eyes and fell limply
against arthur he picked me up in his arms - and because
of this odd faintness i cant remember just what happened
after that but i seem to recall sort of vaguely that it
wasnt exactly - unpleasant

a long time afterward the famous author of ten evils
of dancing rose from the divan - how should i know how he
got there - and began to adjust his tie he sighed bliss-
fully then very dutifully he inquired when do we invito
the neighbors to scatter rice sweetheart

  we dont i replied languidly i am not going to marry
you and make an honest man of you little innocent this
is a case of art for arts sake as it were darling mar-
riage ia not for little eve she has discovered the bitter
truth namely that wedded bliss is like an ancient egg -
it looks better than it is

  well you know what the scriptures ray he said sol-
emnly tis not good for man to live alone - but tis
cheaper and then he leaned down and put his lips hard
and close against mine for a long rapturous moment when
at last he stood up again he said enthusiastically im


going to write a perfect wow of a book now - going to call
it on with the dance 

 at this point memory smote me - also conscience ive
got to tell you arthur i whispered your publishers
didnt send me last night at all

 he looked amused oh i knew that you see i have no
publishers so to speak i paid for the printing of my book
myself

  which makes me believe that the only woman who ever got
ahead of a man was salome

  i have been asked to help with a charity bazaar next
month truly there is no rest for the wicked but then as
some knowing soul put it the good dont have much fun
either but this bazaar thing looks sort of interesting
im to sell kisses must study up on salesmanship this
week for i am firmly determined that all my customers
shall be satisfied ones

hilda began to think fast there
was a dull thud as the body of j

weight against the mahogany door
jerry whispered hilda excited -

him if she knew-quick jerry-
hildas instructions were just in

and the rumpled form of j mortimer
wilks dropped on the floor he was
soon to his feet and staggered to
hilda

a kiss or ill take back that promise-
he approached hilda putting his
arms around her he attempted to
force a kiss on her  
quivering lips in the
struggle that followed
the coat she was wear-

 jerry produced a bottle of cham-

two coughs and bounded out of the
closet

	   

  when the boat left new york
harbor for paris the next day there
were two on board who couldnt wait
until they could leave the deck and
cuddle up in their stateroom

  as soon as the last farewells had
been waved    the last good-byes
hollered jerry and hilda went to
their room and locked the door

  oh precious breathed hilda
just think that well be all alone-

fascinating
worth-while

 say literary critics
 and connoisseurs

the book that zealous reforimers once burned in public

nowdecidefor
yourself whether

the greatdecameron
should be banned and censored

terrible immoral
shocking

say blue nosed reformers

  tull never know life until youve read

y th greatest of all forbidden books

a youll never know how utterly stark
and vivid a picture of human passions can
be painted in words until youve feasted on
the most fascinating tales from the greatest
of all true-to-life books - the immortal
decameron by boccaccio

no longer padlocked

   perhaps no other book ever written has
had such an amazing history written in so
vigorous a style as to be actually startling
it has long been a storm center of fierce
controversy and even persecution critics
and the haute-monde have acclaimed it
with unstinted praise for its sparkling
vividness and subject matter-while prud-
ish zealots and tyrannical reformers aghast
at the utter frankness with whidi boccaccio
exposed human life and love in the raw
resorted to every possible means to keep
this masterpiece from general circulation
at one time they actually went so far as to
gather all the available copies and have
them publicly burned

   but all that was yesterday today the
thrill that awaits the reader within the
glowing pages of decameron talcs is no
longer denied you this is the age of reason
-and the peerless word-artistry of genial
old boccaccio has come into its own at last
   now for a short time only you can
inspect these great examples of realistic
writing in your own home for five days
without obligation

thrill upon thrill awaits you

   between its pages the supreme sensation
of a lifetime of reading awaits you before
your very eyes is unfolded the glittering
pageantry of a golden age now vanished-
an age when passion intrigue and high-
riding romance held full sway past you
in a breath-taking parade sweep some of
the most beautiful yet unprincipled women
of all time-women whose intense fascina-
tion fired mens blood and even altered the
fates of empires here you will find tales
of carlet days when a robust world drank
of life and love to its very dregs

   few writers have ever dared to write so
intimately of the frailities to which the
 er but the aming pen of
giovanni boccaccio knew no restraint so-
phisticated and fearless to the ultimate
degree his stories are not only brilliant
fiction of the most gripping variety-but
also the most illuminating record of life in
fourteenth-century italy ever penned hardly
a detail of these stirring times escaped his

and palaces they dwelt in the fantastic
pleasures they indulged in-all are told with
both wit and pathos that are indescribable
thus the stories not only arouse and enter-
tain but constitute a landmark of literature
which must not bo passed over if you
would broaden your vision-make yourself
truly cultured

read

   - how n certain noble indy
   slipped into her husband
   chamber by stealth nnd
   changed places with his mis-
   tress in order to win back his
   love

   -how a tiny mole on n wo-
   mans breast condemned her
   to death nnd wrccked three
   lives

   -how clandestine love in the
   kitchen turned the barons
   dinner into a fiasco nnd the
   nenr-trnpredy which followed
   -how the luke of crete paid
   for a nights pleasure in
   human coin

ever-watchful eye-and what he saw he
wrote without hesitation or fear

a literary treasure-house

rich in fascinating plot tense with action
and vibrant with human passion-the de-
cameron has furnished plots for the worlds
greatest masters of literature longfellow
keats dryden chaucer and even the great
shakespeare himself sought these immortal
pages for inspiration in no other volume

fourteenth century so graphically laid be-
fore you-the way people lived the hovels
