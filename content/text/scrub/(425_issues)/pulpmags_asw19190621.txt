 the unique distinction of this story is that it transcends the modern standards of romantic
      fiction here is a greek cameo dug from the ruins of ancient greece by b j r

      stolper resplendent with the perennial beauty of all things grecian rarely does a
 story of such distinction find its way into a magazine of fiction we are much concerned that
 you should taste the full flavor of this exquisite tale for the author is saturated with the
 grecian spirit and his work faithfully reproduces the greek view of life the author
 is a veritable magician who will lift you out of the turmoil of the twentieth century and
 set you down in the classic environment of hellas when men pursued the heroic and the
 beautiful as to-day they pursue money and power this is not a modern picture set in a
 greek frame but a veritable grecian tragedy the literature of greece which still remains
 the richest in the world was predominantly occupied with the tragedy of human fate this
 story is essentially tragic and you will be disappointed if you look for modern instances and
 the proverbially happy ending

      modern literature is essentially romantic and far removed in its outlook on life -from that
 of the greek tragedians who were uncircumscribed by romantic ideals and christian convictions
 tragedy is the topmost peak of human achievement or arts creation if the austere beauty
 of greek tragedy repels you have nothing to do with  daughter of lyssa but if you ap-
 preciate the elgin marbles or an athenian temple if the story of prometheus or orestes or of
 antigone take hold of you as no mere modern romance can ever do you are of the elect you
 have a spiritual kinship with the greeks and you will find stolpers story as beautiful as it is
 tragically true

bent his ear with fierce pleasure to the
echoes only when these ceased would he
cast off the osier rope from the stake driven
into the sand clench and coil it with a kind
of cold ferocity and push out powerfully
wading holding the boat incredibly against
the stream his hands were huge dispro-
portionately huge even to his own great
muscular body when the water foamed
under his armpits he would vault heavily
into the ferry seize the broad-bladed oars
and make across with dead monotonous
inevitable strokes

  he was always on the far bank no matter
from which shore he was hailed for his
hut stood on a small rocky patch in the
middle of the rushing water and his ferry
was always moored before it save his own
and myas no human foot was ever set on
the island he had looked grimly to that
once and it had been enough when young
cynthoss phrygian cap was picked up at
the far mouth of the stream and later
young cynthoss broken body charon had
truly no need thereafter for so much
watchfulness yet though he might have
shed two-thirds of herculean sweat-labor
by making fast as close of each passage
rowing only from bank to bank he ever
returned to his boulder after landing his
freight

  charons island cropped out in a curt
elbow of rock curving left toward the
stream the ferryman had strengthened the
curve with great stones and tree-trunks
he had carried them down from the interior
of his island wedging them fast and had
completed a jetty in shape of a young moon
behind which the flat ferry rode safe at all
seasons

  otherwhere the water ran swift and deep
on all sides round about save in the sultry
dog-days there was no ford and even in
such time only at the crossing in full eye
from the jetty to swim was to whirl
blinded to the gods no man had tried it

  above and beyond twenty paces against
a grove of black cypresses rose the hut in
which charon lived with white mya his
daughter to right and left of the low walls
lay the goat-fold the swine-pen and the
bits of farming earth where the two grew
their small corn and set their grape stakes

  charon had not always lived on the
island at first his hut had stood on the
left main bank as you look down to the sea
that had been for one year before these
happenings and for fifteen continuous years
before that his moving to the island came
about abruptly and in this wise

  when mya was born-she was now six-
teen-her mother had died in labor lycan-
der-he had not been charon then-had
been a wordless man even before the black
day and the blacker day it is true old folk
said they had seen him smile once or twice
with wonderful sweetness after he brought
his wife home to the river-edge but silence
and dark mood had come back to him very
quickly he had gone to the light-haired
hill dwellers for a wife and had got him
holy aphrodite and unholy clytemnestra in
one or so it was said

  young lyssa had been a wonder to stare
on the color of foam and sky and gold and
rosy-fingered dawn in her slim body wide
eyes fine hair and oval cheeks she had
been a shepherdess and lycander had met
her on the hills she was fifteen a woman
grown yet with the face of a child and a
white body so sweet and fragile as is not
seen among lowland folk when she raised
her clear eyes to him as he bent over her
lycander saw truth of all olympus in their
blue depths his heart choked him with its
sudden beating and the blood flamed on his
brown face and throat he was dusty with
striding but she took in his splendid brawn
in a glance all innocence and smiled up at
him even fluttering the delicate petal her
white hand to his great corded tawny arm

   iion murmured lyssa with wonder
 let me see your two eyes

  lycanders heart looked out at her
through both of them

   but for those stranger i might have
thought a cyclops had met me you are a
giant we do not see such men in these
hills

  it was sundown he had gone with her
to her byre among the young trees the
two talking as they went the sheep
moved before them she had no kin she
told him she was alone in all the world
even owning nothing he looked at her
slender form in the dim light that fell so
daughter of lyssa



dull everywhere and yet blurred so softly
and wonderfully on her shapely golden
head and he smiled and took her hand

  at dawn he helped her drive the sheep
up to the old man who owned them the
latter stared at the huge stature of the
stranger a lean faced young man came
out of the dwelling and lolled against the
door-post watching with an ambiguous
smile his lips pouted full even when his
cheeks creased revealing his white regular
teeth but lycander reached out his left
hand to lyssa took a strong grip of the
ashen staff in his right and turning began
to descend with her from the mountain

  when three months had passed lycan-
ders sullen brows had lightened unbelieva-
bly he took to humming indistinct tunes
as he plied the heavy oar when five
months were by one day he hurled his
rough gold armlet an ancient thing and
choice into the shouting water to the
gods they were without ruth when they
saw to envy when six months had come
and gone folk called him charon and he
waited a second hail to listen with fierce
pleasure to the echoes

  he had rowed passage to the opposite
bank and had returned alone with wonder-
ful speed his heart was like a boys he
had labored mightily against the current
all round the dangerous island had landed
sharp on his left bank far from the hut and
stolen home noiseless thai he would hear
lyssas startled laughter

  he heard murmurs in the hut a dry
twig cracked under his foot when he
entered lyssa was alone singing lightly
and mending a tunic

   lyssa 

   lycander

   who has been with you

   with me no one lycander

  but his sharp ear had caught a rustling
in the leaves back of the house he had
turned leaping through the doorway there
was a crashing in the low branches of the
plane trees a short struggle and lycander
strode into the hut crushing a slim figure
in his arms he moved the pale face to the
light there was pain in the eyes and the
upwritten eyebrows but the full red lips

still pouted in a faint ambiguous smile it
was the young man who haxl leaned against
the door-post in the house of lyssas master

   lyssa

  a red haze had risen lycanders ears
were full of noise like roaring water every-
thing seemed misty red-the hut lyssa the
young man his own two arms

  but lyssa was speaking in her sweet
truthful tones he knew them there was
 guile in her voice

    it is my brother he came this day
from the mountain

   you have no kin

   i was afraid the old man was my
father this is my brother i was afraid
lest you demand the bridal gifts as is the
custom

  and her blue eyes were troubled only as
a childs might be almost he believed her
but when be looked suddenly down on the
narrow face at his breast and beheld the
black hair black as his own and the sleek
outthrust lips a kind of rage came upon
him she had lied once she was lying
now

   he is your lover you were common
to the hill i will kill him

   he is my brother he is my mothers
son

  but lycander had turned with his burden
and was walking swiftly toward the stream

   my brother my brother my brother
ah gods lycander i will say the truth

  she rushed stumbling toward him her
naked arms outflung her fingers working
distraught with horror but lycander had
heaved the stranger terribly high above his
head gripping and squeezing him in the
vise of his great hands the man screamed
once twice the echoes awoke lycander
had hurled him into the whirling race his
voice was smitten dumb as with a blade
in an instant he was gone

  but the echoes called on a while longer
and lycander stood half-bent forward
listening listening

  a month later mya had been born and
lyssa had died in labor none but lycan-
der had been at the birth which indeed
had taken place in the small hours of
morning lycander had not given forth his

 wifes corpse to be burned as was custom
 but had hollowed a place for her in the earth
 under the plane-trees that had stood back
 of the hut

    this had given rise to dreadful rumors
 for a space anthropophagi cannibals and
 what not but when hardy folk had dared
 lycander calling him by name he had
 glowered pointing what he had done hai
 it was a foreign thing but not unhuman
 with that the questioners had been silenced
 one whose wife had newly lost a child
 had wished to bear tiny mya to his home
 to suckle but lycander had looked black
 a she-goat stood tethered in the room
 toward her he had jerked his head presently
 driving the softened vistors before him out
 of the hut

chapter ii

the vision of poias

 r  this fifteen years had run and lycan-
 der was char op he had reared mya
 himself feeding her goats milk in the
 beginning but weaning her soon and very
 roughly when she had begun to crawl he
 kept her tied with a tough vine while he
 plied the ferry when she had grown and
 understood a little he so held the menace
 of the water to her terrified mind that she
 never tempted the calling brink indeed
 she kept a horror of the flood the rest of
 her days

   a song some poet made when her strange
 tale had noised about bceotia said it was
 that had later drawn her so hotly to poias
 the marble-cutter her horror and his dis-
 dain of the devouring river he had baffled
 twice for her sake perhaps so

   when mya was small she feared men
  because they were like her father when
 any appeared she fled and hid in the hut
 charon grew corn and grapes enough for
 their needs he kept goats for milk cheese
 and flesh and for skins to make garments
 and when mya was bigger he sent her out
 to pasture them in the unpeopled wood
 behind their dwelling

    the ferryman had kept no count of days

since his eyes unceasingly sought the
ground he had no regard for time that
shows in mens faces to him mya was
hardly more than just come into the world
-a dumb infant

  but late one afternoon when he returned
home he heard a murmur of voices-a voice
-within the hut his heart stood still
there was a rushing in his ears a red haze
arose at the same time there came a
crashing in the plane-trees that grew in-
credibly fainter and fainter then ceased to
silence

  his great hands opened and closed as he
turned to pursue but the years slipped
from him and he rushed headlong into the
hut

  mya sat on a stool staring before her
humming

  his chest heaved he gripped his daugh-
ters shoulder cruelly and she raised two
clear blue eyes to his

   who has been with you

  but he knew what the answer would be
she was a woman how had he been so
blind kill her no kill him he
stared stupidly about and threw the hair
from his eyes no this was his daughter
mya his daughter he turned and went
slowly to the door he stood half-bent for-
ward listening nothing spoke but the
river he raised his eyes-the island

  that same day he had borne hut and
herd and goods to the rock on his flat ferry
but first he had lifted mya and rowed her
across leaving her there alone she had
screamed at the whirling water it had
been a savage joy to lift her in his arms
and walk swiftly toward the stream he
had stood there half-bent forward listening
but he had set her in the boat and had
rowed her across

  charons encounter with young cynthos
had been abrupt and violent the iad was
a vine-dresser a lover and a dancer in the
mysteries charon had oared at his call
to set him across midstream a great splash
had beckoned his attention and without
breaking stroke he had made for the island
the race had loosened some stone or other
and a tree-trunk had sprung threatening

	a religious ceremony of a secret nature to which only the initiated were admitted
daughter of lyssa



the jetty presently the ferryman had made
fast to the stake motioning his passenger
to keep seat when he had wrenched the
tree in place wedging all fast and had
turned to put off again the ferry was empty
he looked upward shading his eyes the
youth had mounted the steep rise paused
lithely and was flashing his white teeth at
slim mya who smiled at him through the
grape-leaves

  charon had sped like a terrible shadow
two waiting on the left bank sawthe whole
he had seized the shapely naked ankles
clenching and dragging down had gathered
and crushed the dust-stained form in his
arms walking swiftly to the jetty there he
stood crouching had heaved his monstrous
hands burden and all high above his head
young cynthoss phrygian cap fluttered
down and vanished and a moment later
young cynthos himself curved turning far
out in air struck and disappeared without
a cry

  but charon had remained listening pres-
ently he had got dully into the ferry and
started for the left bank but the two wait-
ing had fled

  the tale now moves to poias

  the heroic age had not then so receded
as now all things were possible men still
lived who had seen demigods in the flesh
hearing even their spoken accents while
charon at the river-edge was still lycan-
der one poias a marble-cutters boy at the
base of the mountain dreamed and planned
two things either would make him known
the breadth of bceotia both would put
him into the mouths of the singers forever
so his name should outlast and outlive his
body

  he dreamed as a boy dreams some night
after hearing a breathless tale of men and
quick fame-impetuously pompously but
unlike the great lost among slim hot-eyed
youths divine boys who die into earthly
men he bent a stubborn will to plan early
musing on shifts to make his two dreams
truths when he should be grown to their
accomplishment

  he would achieve the most perilous ad-
venture in the world he would possess the
loveliest woman of his time

  in those days there stood on the left main
bank seven miles north of charons rock a
tall round tower it was old even in poiass
time and he has been dust these fifty olym-
piads more than one spoiler of cities had
tried to take it by craft as by force as its
fame spread but it had always won
through immovable and unassailable as
atlas

  it was called simply the tower it stood
in the open field but cunningly and won-
derfully guarded all round a deep wide
basin had been dug flooded to the brim by
turning the bed of an underground stream
a mans life attacking would be spilled
twice over even while he sped furiously
swimming or oaring across the stretching
water the great building was made all of
stone huge gray blocks such as now are
not used they cannot be lifted to set one
above the other cyclops or pelasgians must
once have set hand to the work

  within were vast dry bins for grain stalls
for cattle endless racks for weapons in a
low-ceiled cell below earth level a fresh
spring bubbled up through flags and back
again down a runlet twice when athens
sent armies into bceotia the whole village
had retreated to the tower holding out with
such ease that siege had been raised

  the fabled rearing of the tower too
overlaid with mystery added to its lure and
impregnability it was not alone a strong-
hold and a treasury it was also a fane
making defense desperate for this much
was known in hidden times a god had
fallen from heaven and turned to black
stone in the village or else he had cast
his image there for men to worship it had
come down by night with noise in a trail
of fire and when those who had hid came
forth trembling in the morning to look-
there was the stone in the image of a man

  the folk had set it in a grove of young
oaks till the tower was ready for the gods
better safekeeping a belief sprang up that
when the tower was taken the image would
be defiled the men of the village slain and
the women and children sold into slavery
some say an oracle had uttered the words
perhaps so

  but thereafter armed men from the vil-
lage watched incessantly on the walls as

who perform a rite not only as soldiers but
as priests taking eager turns at a duty
which had become a solemn vital honor
reverence of the immortals their own lives
as well as the freedom of their women and
children hung on unyielding defense of the
tower

  it was this citadel that poias dreamed to
take the tradition of its unconquerable
strength was older than the oldest memory
no less than this was his adventure

chapter iii

the wonder of the world

he woman poias desired was mya

  he had not indeed beheld her at
once for his fame-knowing her face
and form her dwelling and parentage that
was impossible she had not then been born
into the world

  when he awoke that wonderful night a
lad of eight on the floor of his fathers hut
to find himself staring with wildly beating
heart at the bright stars that twinkled down
to him through the black-rifted beams his
thought was not of mya daughter of lyssa
it was of glory through the tower and a
woman the two should bring him fame
forever he would take the tower he
poias the most wonderful of women should
call him husband his fame would endure
through hellas and mid-argos

  his achievement was firm in his mind
the tower no other but his dream of the
maiden was hazy-golden and confused a
mere stubborn longing his images were
boyishly vague tinged with fable and songs
half understood a nymph made mortal the
slim moon on the hill a gift from aphrodite
like helens self

  for long he told nothing of his dreams
for he feared the rough marbie-cutters would
laugh his rough father more loudly than
any but once he had made a song of his
thoughts fitting a rude tune to words he
said over and over again as children do
he lay under an olive-tree out of the sun
eyes half shut chanting

   i will take the tower he sang  i
will take the tower and have to wife the
wonder of the world

  he thought himself alone but a shadow
fell on his naked feet and he sprang up on
confusion his mother stood before him
she had brought a jar to fill at the brook
she stood there with the tall curved clay
poised on her shoulder gazing down at him
strangely

   the song she murmured  where did
you learn it son do the baiotian children
sing it is it a game

  and when he kept dumb while his eyes
grew intent on a pebble he fell to prodding
with a brown toe

   do not be ashamed poias she said
gently

  at once his boys heart began to beat
violently like that of an ephebus on the
threshold of the first mystery he felt
though cloudily that his mother knew and
understood perhaps she swung the jar
down midway setting it then out of the
heat and presently drawing the boy down
beside her under the oval shade of the olive
she looked long into his eyes tilting his firm
young chin

   it is no game she said  the boeo-
tian children do not sing this song

   i have watched you poias i am your
mother you will tell me everything

   but first i will tell you a tale we are
thebans that you know and by no means
bceotians for the children shout it after
you when they play and the women call
me theban at the linen-pool and the
marbie-cutters speak good words to your
father only because his strength is great
but this you do not know i had not
thought to tell you so soon who are you
of what house by what name do you
call yourself not poias son of ctephar
the marble-cutter and not poias the
theban a light name a by-word and by
no means poias the boeotian

   when i was a maiden in the fields about
thebes there met me once a stranger at
dusk in the furrows how old are you
poias that was even so many years ago

    	a free-born youth in attica between eighteen and twenty years of age who has just been
entered on the list of his tribe
daughter of lyssa



he was tall and beautiful he was clad
in purple he was like the gods who hold
ihe open sky  have never seen his like
nor did i behold him ever again after i
awoke in broad sun on my couch under a
cypress he was vour father poias

   my father

  your father though soon i had fol-
lowed the flutes and tympani of the mar-
riage procession with ctephar called by
that name not altogether mean is your
blood for the stranger if not an immortal
was at least of those who live after death-
a hero-a demigod

  as when a runner in the pentathlon un-
tried a novice dreams of tempting glory in
the sacred games secretly he leaves his
dwelling lest his kin mock meleager me-
leager after him in scorn he steals by
night through the gates of his town some
mean attican village treading at last after
journeys the groves of elis-swift-poised
sleek with oil he crouches how tense
among the eager naked contestants-the
signal falls out he leaps breathing a prayer
to the gods dimly longing for success yet
daring no form for his thoughts on he
runs forever his feet grow numb his thighs
his shoulders he sobs and hisses for pain
of labored breathing confused on his ears
beats a distant roar of voices he tastes salt
blood in his mouth and all grows black
anon he rouses to shouts and pxans lo he
is victor glad arms uphold him before the
great statue chryselphantine-he feels on
his hot temples the smooth sprig of olive
he has won the marvel has happened he
will hold and spread glory forever so the
lad poias hearing and believing a god had
begot him grew exalted beyond his years
in heart and purpose he was not as others
he would live in the mouths of singers for
all time

  but his mother was speaking again

   i have watched you poias hoping
good seed is known by the fruit

  her voice sank so low she seemed brood-
ing aloud but the boy heard and under-
stood

  if you were as other womens sons
bred to small desires mean tasks common

things - eheu alas then your mother
had once been smirched forever she whis-
pered   stained cheapened made vile
then the stranger your father-then your
mother-a mockery to smirk at sprawling
where -immodest fellows meet to inflame
themselves with wine

    i have watched you from your birth
hoping at last one night i heard you cry
out before you awoke-or did you wake-
of towers and wonder-women and my heart
was proud dreams come from zeus you
are not born to be forgotten poias what
you will you can there is ichor flowing
in your veins

   but now tell me this the tower of
which you sing i know it is a great deed
you will achieve it be resolved though how
and when lies with the gods and you but
who she smiled  is your wonder of the
world

   confidently poiass eyes smiled back at
her

    when i am grown he said  i will
know but it will not be one from among
these huts the are childish and play with
dolls they have no fame when i am
grown and bear weapons i will know and
then wherever or whoever she be i will go
and take her

the lithian games

jn far off athens it was said men were
i building white houses pillared temples

   great open theaters hewn in the solid
hill the village children played a game
of architects with flints mud and bits of
wood and reed but poiass father ctephar
took him one day with the marble-cutters
to the true marvels of athens herself once
every week the slow oxen were guided with
their rough carts to the quarries at the base
of the mountain the white blocks were load-
ed in and the long creaking train plodded
off into the southeast it was a journey
of many days the men took with them
food and water musical instruments and
weapons as for a campaign

	overlaid with gold and ivory


all-story weekly

  long afterward when he was grown
poias recalled the delight of that first ad-
venture into the unknown the wary prog-
ress the lowing oxen the gruff friendliness
of the cutters he remembered the pleasure
of striding out strongly at ctephars side
near the ox-cart shuffling up little spurts
of warm dust with his naked feet in the
road

  the touch of marble even when he had
become a man grown and feared always
softened him somewhat perhaps because
of the thrill on that young strange jour-
pey when he clambered up to perch on the
cool block of white stone high above the
broad swaying backs of the swing-paced
animals

  indeed his vague plannings for fame
were later shaped perhaps by the vivid
episodes of that first sally into the free-
dom of the open the hardy independence
the fresh unfamiliar wooded spaces the
lolling by the wayside in the soft shade
when the oxen were unyoked and the men
prepared and ate the noonday meal at
night the bright firelight leaped up in the
road the men lay around it singing and
telling marvelous tales how the disguised
son of iegeus slew the stretcher on his own
dreadful bed how alcides did his twelve
labors how by craft ilios was stormed
and spoiled after ten years

  ctephar told wild stories of theban
sphinxes they crouched behind highways
in his country and leaped upon travelers
there strength however vast was fruitless
only cunning and swift thinking availed
women too were discussed-with many
quips and coarse turns that poias did not
understand but also with stirring fables
that set his heart beating faster

  behind in the shadows sounded the
muffled stamping and munching of the
oxen flutes and rough stringed instru-
ments were brought out and tuned the
wine skins passed around and he too was
given a share of the sour-sweet liquor as
one who had equal right the flat round
bread-cakes the oil the goats cheese the
honey the thick porridge the roasted
swine-flesh had a savor beyond that at
home in the village

  but of all impressions none grooved so

deep in poiass mind as the day of entry
into athens they had come to the end
of their journey over a stretching plain
and down into the valley of the cephissos
suddenly a lofty isolated mass of rock the
acropolis towered before them soon they
were in the wide streets of the city

  white houses ranged on either hand
more dazzling than any marble in the quar-
ries men walked leisurely about on the
flagged pavements and the narrow foot-
ways they seemed different from any
poias had ever known of a majesty and
fineness that made his heart flutter they
wore garments such as he had never seen
purple saffron and many-colored

   could one of these thought poias
 be the stranger-my great father

  little prickling points seemed to rise at
the short hairs on the nape of his neck the
blood hummed in his ears

  but no these were men

  at upper stories in the white dwellings
behind tall smooth columns wonderful wo-
men showed dimly at the windows some
were spinning flax or weaving others sat
motionless in a peculiar attitude looking
silently down into the street there were
many of those each rested her dimpled
elbow on the stone sill the slim fingers of
the right hand clasping the rounded fore-
arm of the left a silver ring gleamed
brightly on one of two upraised fingers

  the marble-cutters spoke together in un-
dertones whenever they passed one of those
laughing hoarsely and blinking and nod-
ding their shaggy heads significantly
outward all outward

  one of the men a black-browed lustful
fellow patted the great block of marble on
his cart and chuckled

   when this is delivered over-

   psyche to take

  outward - all turned outward xot
one ring-point toward the palm

   what is wrong with the athenians

   they are busy building

  and the men laughed again loudly

   psyche to take psyche taken

  it was some rude jest but what poias
could not then comprehend his young
mind was mazed with his dreams which
drifted in on him now in broad day here
daughter of lyssa



were wonders which of these fabled
dwellings would send forth one to his de-
sire when he was grown

  a sharp nudge broke in on his thoughts
he stumbled forward and only saved him-
self from a fall by a quick catlike turn
near him stood a pert town lad of little
more than his own age laughing at the
young rustic who seemed lost in longing
before the worst known house in athens
poias flushed a dark red and clenched his
fists but ctephars ox-cart had been mov-
ing forward steadily and was now a good
distance away slowly he turned and
walked after it

  in the years that followed poias plodded
out on many such slowr journeys with the
marble-train he shot up and unfolded
rapidly to a strength and swiftness of body
that amazed the thick-muscled boeotians
very soon ctephar set him to quarrying
and as his skill increased there were few
and fewer of the men who could keep pace
with him in breaking free the huge masses
prying and cutting the blocks presently
there were none

  he overtopped the tallest in stature the
grip of his hands the numbing pressure of
his arms when he seized and crushed an op-
ponent to him wrestling in the village trials
became a rumor of spreading wonder the
marbie-cutters were the strongest about
because of their life and the manner of
their labor and of them ctephar was the
foremest and most feared but soon even
he shook his head with a wry smile when
poias stepped forward silently to a chal-
lenge he was proud of the youth albeit
puzzled sometimes he could not say why
nevertheless he had felt poias ts great
strength on two occasions and had no
stomach for more

  one day there had been games in the
village the lithian games folk called
them after the manner of those of the
isthmus of nemea in argolis or even of
olympia in elis but these were local all
work had been put aside men and youths
strove together in honor of the stone god in
the tower whose feast it was

  only the strict guard of the citadel re-
mained at duty and of them the fortunate

watchers on high post clustered on the
walls there were foot-races casting shoot-
ing with the bow boxing and wrestling in
the open field about the broad stretching
water of the tower there was no contest
in singing the village had only one poet
and even he had failed them he was
hoarse as a crow with a throat cold in
those days there was no writing in bceotia
-the poet had guarded his new effort too
jealously-and so there had been no way
to give over the hard practised ode

  poias had disregarded the shorter races
though he was swift-footed enough he
had won in those when a mere stripiing
but his heavy discus hummed through the
air striking farther than any of the lighter
ones his quoits fell true he sped his spears
straight to the mark only the boxing he
omitted fearing to kill his opponent or
break his jaw-bone then his mother had
oiled th supple muscles of his body and
he trotted out with the crowd of naked
runners over the long course

  ten times they circled the great track
three miles each time toward the end
the sobbing runners were strung out in a
straggling line the whole length of the way
here and there one had collapsed with
blood pouring out of his nostrils many
limped or walked slowly with quivering
hand pressed to their sides only four came
n steadily the whole distance and of these
the first was poias his deep chest rose
and fell quickly but his eyes were clear
and he smiled at his mother as she threw
the robe about his glistening shoulders as
he stepped forward to receive the wreath

  presently the wrestlers came forth thick-
set brawny men

   son-

  poias raised his head with difficulty he
was lying stretched full length on the warm
grass his eyes sheltered from the glare by
his mother

  your father is no foot-runner ctephar
stood looking down on him good-naturedly

  but he planted fairish sinew when he be-
got you sit up and give heed i will try
a new fall so watch with care and a whole
mind

   he needs little teaching grinned a
quarryman

  his great hairy breast showed like a
vaulted cask through his goatskin but
poias had once wrapped long arms around
him with such power that his ribs had
cracked pie had been hurled like a lump
to the earth

   with his strength new falls are fool-
ish

  ctephar grew angry he had a short
temper

   it is true the marble - cutters cannot
stand up to him he throws them on their
shoulders every one what of that i do
no less i have left you in peace boy
for me to strive with you would have been
unnatural but remember-and you poias
-your father is still to come 

  poiass mother had risen and poias also
they stood drawn back a little and in his
mothers eyes the young man beheld the
same strange look she had given him that
day long ago when she had gazed down
on him under the olive the tall curved clay
poised on her shoulder he felt suddenly
a surge of will so firm it seemed as if some
one other than he were standing in his tired
flesh some one fresh unwearied thrilling-
ly strong the childish words of his song
came back to him  will take the tower
 will take the tower

   my father is still to come he repeated
gravely he looked down into ctephars
drawn brows

   will you try the new fall with me
from every side the folk had crowded
around there were many words of con-
demnation especially for poiass mother
but she said no word poias too was si-
lent was such thing ever heard a fa-
ther and a son it was wrong on any day
in any place but above all at the sacred
lithian games and before the tower the
heaven-flung image

   thebans-thebans

  there was a murmur of many tongues
the words went from mouth to mouth

   let the savages wrestle

   we were wrong to let them take part
in our games who are not of our blood
said an old man  but the youth was a
great athlete xow let them do as they
have in mind doubtless it is custom
among the thebans

    come you cried ctephar violently

  he forgot he was the boys father for
so he thought he forgot poiass stirring
feats the pride he had felt in him his son
excellent in trial after trial the great weari-
ness that must lie listless on the boy after
the heart-breaking race rage a blind lust
to seize to teach the whelp a lesson laid
hold on him like a black madness he
crouched somewhat bending his body and
crooking his knotted arms and tense fingers
like some mountain bear he looked as his
shaggy head sank down between his wide
hunched shoulders and his little eyes peered
fiercely from under their thick pent brows
his anger had risen to white heat against
poias against this strange woman his wife
and above all against himself

  together they had brought the fame of
their city into disrepute it would be
spread forever in the village and perhaps
beyond it that thebans knew no obedience
nor reverence between fathers and children
that they were raw folk uncouth without
laws or fear of the immortals

  but poias had leaped forward had
dashed aside the seeking hands and taken
ctephar about the middle a gasp went
up from the spectators as the thebans lips
contorted to a groan of agony his feet
left the ground he was lifted at once to
the height of poiass shoulders his face
grew purple his eyes rolled whitely from
side to side he was laid on the earth like
a child the back of his head brushed the
grass-tops his neck jerked forward - and
both his shoulder-blades had flatly touched
poias held him motionless with one power-
ful hand crushing down on his chest

chapter v

the strength of ten

in the lithian games ctephar had felt
the boys full strength for the first time
what happened after on that day-how
poias had risen had tossed back the long
black hair that hung about his young fore-
head and stepped out in the exaltation of
the moment to the edge of the tower water
-ctephar heard later from others it had
made him vain of his son when broken ribs
daughter of lyssa



had healed and rage and unreasoning jeal-
ousy ebbed though he was puzzled as any
bceotian by the mystery but in that hour
he iav half conscious and indifferent to all
save the dull anguish in his body

  poias had taken his mother by the hand
and standing there at the brink of the vast
basin he had fixed dilated eyes on the tow-
er beyond it and sung these words

          tower tower

and you o god within the tower

    mother mother

and you o woman that will be my mother the
    mother of mine

 no small words were spoken by ctephar the
    theban the marble-cuttcr when he said my
    father was still to come

 i am not of your blood bceotians but i think
    your thoughts i am not your kin o women
    and children of the village but my heart is
    soft to you for the days to come

let the tower be strong

let the god in the tower be strong

  it was a good ode so thought those who
heard it the hoarse poet could have done
no better though his would have been
longer for an outlander the sympathy
and understanding had been true-measured
and just the sentiment had been devout
it showed a love of bceotia let the tower
be strong let the god in the tower be
strong after all the two-father and son
-had striven only in honor according to
their uncouth custom the fault if there
were any lay in ctephar whose rudeness
was known young poias however had
been bred up almost in the ways hereabout

  only one thing was clouded and ill-ex-
pressed whkt had the youth meant by the
words concerning his mother  that will
be my mother-the mother of mine will
be-how that she had given birth to him
up there in the cypress hut hard by the
quarry and a strangely long labor it had
been however the words were poetry
which not seldom were little more than
good sounds

  but the mother of poias paled and
flushed and her eyes shone

  a month or six weeks later when
ctephars fractures had knit soundly and

he was laboring his full days stint in the
quarry he had felt poiass strength for the
second time but that had been the last
to another who had twice laid hand on him
in violence the theban would haveseized
his knife openly perhaps secretly if
that were the only way

  yet this second time too after his fury
had disappeared he had nursed no fester-
ing ill-will rather he had felt wonder a
kind of bewildered respect for this extraor-
dinary son like one who has set a silly
fowls egg to hatch and brooded out an
eagle also there was a rough sense of
justice somewhere deep in the marble-cut-
ters hot heart that made him see right in
the boys actions

  poias had shown no anger that day at
the games when he had gripped his father
and put him to the ground but a terrible
passion had mastered him on the second
occasion almost leaving a dead man under
his hands he had come home to the noon-
day meal together with ctephar the lat-
ter had been moody and sullen all the fore-
noon flaming out into violence over small
things it had seemed to him that the
marble-cutters were goading him that a
hidden gibe of which he was the butt were
being slipped about from mouth to mouth

  the men worked in groups at the cut-
ting because he had been silent his group
had been silent but all the others had
laughed together in pauses of labor and it
had seemed to ctephar that they were ap-
praising him with the rough side of their
tongues at that time the trial at wrestling
still rankled he had sprung up and
rushed over to one such group and of
course a sudden silence had fallen there
were no two poiases in the quarry cte-
phars strength was known now he seemed
insanely angry for some reason so the
marble-cutters had been afraid and had
kept still but the theban had cuffed one
of them the man had drawn a knife and
ctephar had at once clutched and broken
his arm at the wrist

  now he paced restlessly to and fro in the
narrow hut the meal delayed his wife
came in his path as she moved about set-
ting forth the food ctephar had never
laid the weight of his finger on her ungen-


all-story weekly

tly but that day he seemed beside him-
self as she brushed against his arm he
flung her aside with such force that she fell
full length against the timbered wall op-
posite the earthen bowl she held crashed
to the ground the hot liquid spread scald-
ing over her face and body while a thin
stream of blood made by a pointed shard
trickled slowly from a wound in her temple

  she quivered and lay motionless

  ctephar had stood frozen with wide
horror-stricken eyes but poias had moved
with the swiftness of a leopard across the
narrow space had hurled the fierce mass of
his body at the theban overborne him to
the ground and fastened his fingers in his
throat the young mans face was gray
and hard set like flint a great vein
swelled up between his eyebrows his nos-
trils expanded quivering like those of a
maddened stallion there was death in his
intent stare a moment and ctephars life
would have gone but a faint voice called
from the other side of the hut

   poias poias no

  and his fingers had relaxed

  ctephar however had carried the swol-
len angry marks on his throat under his
thick beard for days it was long before
they faded out entirely

chapter vi

the pulse of poias

thus thirteen years had run since
poias had awakened that wonderful
night a lad of eight on the floor of
his fathers hut to find himself staring
with wildly beating heart at the bright
stars that twinkled down to him through
the black rifted beams

  but now his thoughts had begun to
reach out to mya daughter of lyssa
even as rumor had become busied with far-
echoing versions of his own strength swift-
ness sureness of eye his great craft at di-
vine improvisation the heroic proportions
of his body-so reports had crossed to his
ear over shorter distance of the dark
ferrymans wonderful daughter

   poias spoke little but he listened much
soon he had heard from the marbie-cutters

and from other talk here and there the
whole tale of the whirling flood of lyssa
and the grim death of the unknown who
had visited her of lycander called cha-
ron his monstrous hands and intent un-
holy lust for echoes

  two men perhaps more had met cruel
doom at the hands of the sullen ferryman
they had come between him and the wo-
men of his house

  one a hill-dweller folk said had been
found caught in the jagged rocks at the far
mouth of the stream where the fury of the
water had hurled and wedged him in his
body was so squeezed and crushed with
purple-blue finger bruises below the arm-
pits that he must have been dead when he
struck the race the other had been a man
of the village a light of love he had dis-
appeared some days after the first corpse
had been found eyes had never beheld him
since undoubtedly charon had made
away with him also but none had dared
to ask

  charon was forty years old bitter
touched darkly by the scourge of those who
may not be named he was in the prime
of an incredible bodily force

  a strange thing women who can be-
lieve in their faithfulness who could
blame them unfaithful yet who could lie
calm under his own betrayal helen of
troy they say was led from lacedaemon
and her husbands bed by aphrodite her-
self none the less menelaus made furious
war zeus fought in it aphrodite averted
her head from her own after a time clear-
eyed athene condoned and counseled the
avengers

  charon had killed a man with his hands
as a thief and violator yet he himself had
gone into the mountain out of his country
and taken lyssa without plain words be-
forehand what cause then had he later
to blaze - into anger killing and killing
lyssa had gone with him at once was he
a god to set the treasure of love suddenly
in her heart-to plant faithfulness full-
grown there had been many young men
in the mountain and she was a shepherdess

  and yet she had cried out that the stran-
ger was her brother-that he was her moth-
ers son she had wept and told the same
daughter of lyssa



tale over and over again as she lay on the
floor of her hut such times as charon plied
his ferry and pitying women stole through
the covert to help and comfort her it
might be she had not been unfaithful
charon himself brooding after she died
had seemed unresolved in mind what
were his dark thoughts as he sat half the
day on his boulder motionless his naked
upraised knee gripped in his tightly clasped
hands his lips were always compressed
his eyes staring toward the earth nor did
he speak alone to himself when one is
idle and silent in broad day he thinks
what were charons thoughts always he
seemed waiting for some word some event
that must surely come

  but when a hail for the ferry sounded
from the far bank he would rise walk the
four paces to the flat-boat and stand there
half bent forward listening with fierce
pleasure-to the echoes

  and now mya was fifteen a woman
grown though her father did not know it
to him she was hardly more than just come
into the world a dumb infant since his
eyes unceasingly sought the ground he had
no regard for time that shows in mens
faces yet the girl though she had a childs
face possessed a white body so sweet and
fragile as is not seen among lowland folk
when she raised her two clear eyes there
seemed truth of all olympus in their blue
depths those who had seen her mother
lyssa when she had first come home to the
river-edge said mya was lyssa-lyssa-
a wonder to stare on the color of foam and
sky and gold and rosy-fingered dawn in her
slim body wide eyes fine hair and oval
cheeks

  it was thus poias heard of her

  he had long since learned the riddle of
the hetccrce the courtezans who sat so still
at upper windows looking forth into athe-
nian streets a silver ring - point gleaming
brightly on one of two upraised fingers he
had entered submitted and gone away
never to return youth recoils always to ex-
tremes

  but poias when the first sickening revul-
sion had slowly faded had silently taken
counsel with himself and put the matter
from his mind for fame all acts were pos-

sible for love also as witness what was
sung of the gods but neither fame nor
love could be bought his thoughts had
not taken that form perhaps but they had
had that meaning

  now he mused on mya daughter of
lyssa wondering whether she were the wo-
man of his dream she was very beautiful
it was said beyond lyrics in loveliness
young men had seen her from spying places
in the unpeopled wood behind her fathers
dwelling she had pastured goats so shy
she seemed and graceful in her shaggy tu-
nic a hamadryad might have borne her to
that dumb brute her fatnct her hair was
the color of glittering gold only finer than
spun thread whiter and more shapely
than that of the young nymph carved in
marble in the temple at athens was myas
naked arm the sun had never browned
it her little feet were two pale drifts like
those left on green tree-roots when the snow
is melting the knee-an oval lozenge-
a cameo her eyes were deep blue full of
kindness there were lights in them her
young breasts had budded

  but the youths had remained hidden
hardly breathing she had not known they
were there cruel death floated about
myas innocence her marvelous body like
a diaphanous veil seen and unseen-invisi-
ble to eyes and beating heart-all too visi-
ble to shuddering reason charon-his
monstrous hands-the foaming whirling
flood

  the world was a wide shield and many
rumors drifted in of the beauty of women
in far places but none so set vague desire
flaming as those told of mya moving with
her flock in the unpeopled wood behind the
dark ferrymans dwelling the grim
menace of death lent a lure perhaps to the
girls fabulous loveliness peril tinges all
goals with glamour-much as a setting
brings out richness in a jewel

  so poias mused often on the daughter
of lyssa rousing suddenly at times to won-
der how lost he had been a full half-hour
at whiles he would stand his arms drawn
back the long bar arrested in mid air in
the motion of thrusting into a rock crevice
was she the woman of his dreams

  poias had never before glanced sidewise


all-story weekly

 at a maiden except indifferently these
 were the village girls he knew them they
 had no fame

   the silent women too that sat in the
 windows in the great town-there were
 many of those one like the other a
 wretched price bought them all

   but the daughter of lyssa- his imag-
 ination took slow fire warming him he
 fell to staring at full forms swinging hips
 clustered hair-psappha oe melitta-as
 they passed by the quarry bringing food to
 their husbands or their fathers as they
 stepped rhythmically down to the washing-
 pool a basket of linen balanced on sleek
 head wherein did she differ from one of
 those

    a little pulse began to beat quickly in
 his blood that was always so calm yet
 his keen mind too grew busied with a
 thousand thoughts shifts revolving this
 and that gathering all but full-shaped to
 a plan there had long lain dormant some
 such vague speculation as there must

   the tower it stood seven miles north
 of charons hut

  mya-

   if there came but occasion the ferry-
 man her father was bceotian of boeotians
 own blood kin to those in the village

    suddenly the words of his childish song
 leaped to his mind as indeed until his death
 they always shook him when he desired
 some one thing greatly i will take the
 tower i will take the tower

   he would go down to the whirling flood
 to see this wonder of the world

    since that old day under the olive poias
 had told all things to his mother not ex-

	cepting the unlovely matter of the cour-
 tezans he talked over with her his dreams
 and plans they walked out often to-
 gether in the cool of the evening musing
 on shifts to make his two dreams truths
 now that he was grown to their accom-
 plishment

   in return his mother told him much of
 her early life as a maiden in the fields about
 thebes she spoke of ctephar and his
 persistent wooing he had been the strong-
 est of the young men thereabout a sort of
 leader she had not been unmoved by him

but she too had had her dreams her
friends had mocked her and called her
strange even then songs odes lyrics
dithyrambi they said had turned her wits
she was looking to a god no less but
one evening in the furrows the stranger
had suddenly appeared

  soon she had followed the flutes and
tympani of the marriage procession with
ctephar her parents had praised her
her companions had pretended joy smiling
covertly when they thought she did not
see but she too had smiled knowing
that soon she would carry a demigod under
her heart

  ctephar had ever been gentle with her
but to otkess he was given to bursts of vio-
lence from the first on one such occa-
sion he had slain a man with his knife
a magistrate of the city she had known
nothing of the matter lying deathly sick
with nausea stretched on the couch in their
hut but ctephar had suddenly entered
thrown bread cheese and the wine skin on
a linen tunic he spread hastily on the earth
flung the bundle over his shoulder and had
seized her roughly by the hand together
they had fled along hidden byways she
had dragged half fainting through under-
brush over rocks and between trees but
he had told her nothing till they were far
advanced into the bceotian plain then he
had said abruptly he had killed a man
a magistrate of thebes and that they could
never go back to their home

  poias had been born months later in the
cypress hut hard by the quarry none the
less he had come to world before his time
the labor had been an agony of suffering
so long so protracted her body had
seemed cruelly given over to those who
may not be named but her spirit had
laughed through anguish gods are not
men even if she died-but she knew she
would not die surely not till she had seen
her son brought into the world

  these things and others that are not
spoken of between mother and son she
told to poias together with wonderful say-
ings of gods and heroes many of those
poias had heard before from the marble-
cutters they had been told and sung
on the slow journeys with the ox-train on
daughter of lyssa



the way to athens when the oxen were
unyoked and the men prepared and ate
the evening meal behind in the shadows
had sounded the muffled stamping and
munching of the animals the bright fire-
light had leaped up in the road the men
lay around it singing and telling marvel-
ous tales women too had been discussed
with many quips and coarse turns that
poias had not then understood but also
with stirring fables that had set his young
heart beating faster

  his own mother had been a nymph folk
said-clymene but no matter

  on the lips of the tall slender woman
walking beside him there in the cool of
the evening those old tales took on a deeper
significance poias felt always a sudden
surge of will so firm it seemed as if some
one other than he were standing in his
flesh some one eternally unwearied thrill-
ingly strong

  none the less when he resolved to go
down to the river-edge he said nothing
of it to his mother

 why

  he who can answer that truly can say
also where the conies nest why the whelps
forsake their lioness in her lair and where
the young men go out alone when dusk
comes over the fields

chapter vii

wild geese

though the boeotians spoke of poias
as bred almost in their ways he had
certain traits they could not fathom
he was indifferent to girls and women he
marveled constantly at the tower though
born-as the phrase goes-within spear-
cast of it he wandered at whiles head
bent now here now there over the fields
that circled the sparkling water a prone
hazel-fork thrust rigid before him he van-
ished sometimes from hut quarry and vil-
lage staying for days none saw him leave
nor return neither was it known where
he went

  poias never turned to the maidens even
to the comeliest to follow her sidewise with
his glance not one but would have let

him carry her across her mothers thresh-
old the most prudent might have yield-
ed herself together with every marriage-
rite young girls await with delicious van-
ity-the palms the torches the garlands
the marriage-robe the flutes and singers
of the procession he was beautiful as an
immortal yet he never walked at dusk
save with his mother

  as one not of their blood poias had never
set foot within the tower that was for-
bidden by ancient custom outcasts and
strangers from immemorial time might not
enter the fane they were profanation
some say the forgotten builders had made
the custom through craft handing it down
a defense to forestall betrayal from within
though boeotians hated to hear that said
perhaps so but though the strength and
skill of poias were boasted of wherever
those of the village met foreigners the
young man was not permitted across the
stretching water nor did he demand it

  and yet he wras seen constantly about the
tower on this side and that at the two
low-arched water-gates front and rear at
the blind sheer uplift monotonous slip-
pery with greenish moss it seemed he soon
must know every gray block of it

  he moved about it in broad day when
the sun was most deadly the watchers
cried down to him laughing from the walls

   poias do you dream to take the
tower that you eye it so intently

   oe or melitta of the big eyes-or even
that cross-eyed one at the linen pool-turn
your glances there they would reward
your patience 

  the hoarse poet pronounced that the
young man was sunk in contemplation of an
epic that the curtness of his first ode had
mortified him and he was amassing wider
detail more sharp more minute it seemed
possible to many for a poet should know
the manner of his kind but the greater
number shook their heads the history
of the tower was known to every child
and what could poias learn from stones

  one day the young man had spoken to
iasos whose home was within the citadel
asking a curious question and yet-not
beyond comprehension men seek to know
such records certainly prize-men


all-story weekly

  iasos was the finest athlete thereabout
after poias as was custom he had been
made peculiar guard of the fane dwelling
constantly within the walls what time he
conquered all comers in the lithian games
it was a solemn vital honor reverence of
the immortals the lives of thosj in the vil-
lage as well as the freedom of iheir women
and children hung on unyielding defense
of the tower therefor excellence in war-
like qualities was gloriously rewarded
the unbeaten victor interposed his firm
flesh his watchfulness and cool purpose
for the god himself

  liisos had been second of the four to
come in steadily all the way over the long
course in the heart-breaking race poias
had been the first others had collapsed
with blood pouring out of their nostrils
many had limped or walked slowly with
quivering hand pressed to their sides only
two other young men ctesion and phidon
had achieved the whole distance in good
time

   liisos was second at the discus the quoits
the spear cast the leaping and boxing he
was too heavy for the shorter races pie
also was a marble-cutter and none could
cope with him at wrestling save ctephar
and poias but those were outlanders
plad they been bceotians poias would have
lived in the tower there would then have
been but half a purpose to this tale-and
none at all to the youths two dreams of
fame

  one day poias had fallen in with iasos
as the latter strode back earnestly to his
duty and the two had talked together
there was pleasant friendship between them
because of athletics also liisos felt that
poias and not he truly merited the bronze
watchers-seat in the fane though the bceo-
tian was proud of the honor

  on two occasions only might the gods
companion set foot outside the round walls
-once every year at the games when he
went out to defend his place and once
every thirty days when he laid a trophy
on the old altar in the grove it was there
the ancient folk had at first set the god
when he fell from heaven with noise by
night in a trail of fire the grove lay a
distance from the village all vast oaks

dark with spreading arms massive as a
mans body there was dim twilight under
them always however brightly the sun
blazed but when the altar had been newly
set th  e the oaks had been young and thin-
leaved then the tower had been raised
for the gods better safe-keeping

  xo athlete could be chosen the gods
companion unless he achieved twelve at
least of the twenty-four wreaths contested
at the games once every thirty days he
laid a single trophy-or more according to
the number he had won-on the altar
when all were piled his name had vanished
mounting up in fire with the wreaths which
were burned as a sacrifice then came the
lithian games and either he or some
other eheu alas placed the first trophy
again on the altar

   liisos poias had begun after keep-
ing pace silently for a time  i have been
thinking about the games they arp very
old and we do the same things every year
we leap run box and wrestle we try
with the bow cast spears the discus quoits
and heavy stones i suppose these things
must be we do them and when we are
dead doubtless others will do them too

   yes and we sing-

  he smiled

   now i have a desire for a new sort of
trial or at least a change in the old box-
ing and wrestling we cannot change leap-
ing too would not be feasible though i
should like to learn how far a man may
leap from a height yet not suffer injury
he might practise constantly increasing the
distance as we do in broad-leaping but
he would need a soft place at first to land
water now the tower would be an ex-
cellent start at a great height too to
harden one to dizziness but of course the
basin is sacred- 

    sacred repeated liisos wistfully  it
may not be entered at all nor crossed in a
boat save by those who come to watch
or go being relieved or by bceotians when
the village is threatened but it would be
interesting to try

   no said poias  but there were
other matters too we cast and shoot
sometimes at a moving target even a living
one but more often over motionless ground
daughter of lyssa



at a motionless goal even the goats and
mad heifers they set capering and charging
for us in the games leave me indifferent
i am tired of them what training could
those give us in war for i will make war
somewhere before i am old there is al-
ways fighting in the world

   a charging goat or a heifer sharp-
horned is good training one must loose
swiftly and accurately

  poias shook his head

   a beast even the wildest is not a man
a beast puts its head down and rushes
blindly if one is cool he steps to one side
and lets drive but when a man is the
target unless he is a fool the method must
be different i think a beast no matter
how crafty has no cold plan it cannot
know what you might plot its rage is
blind above all it has no weapon to speed
over distance faster than its own body can
rush

   what man will stand as your target
said iasos simply

   another matter when we shoot or cast
even toward a motionless goal the course
of our cast is motionless also do not
laugh iasos the earth is fixed and quick-
ly as we aim and throw every stone every
grass-blade and clod in range of our eyes
has guided our effort but how would it
be what quick judgments would we have
to make if earth itself leaped danced and
scattered glittering million-pointed along
the- whole course of our cast

   it cannot be it is that i would ask
you to try-for  cannot-together with
certain other tests

   you cannot

   it concerns the waters of the tower
but no profanation it would be hostile
for me a theban -poias smiled showing
his white teeth- to hurl a missile toward
the tower but how fatally could you hit
across the sparkling sun-broken water aim-
ing from the tower i am curious to learn
you are always close on my casts every
one there is no edict or custom against
that trial

   and now these other things-

  presently idle folk saw them iasos on
the wall known by his style of shooting and

    	a-s

the rapidity with which he snatched up his
arrows and young poias on the brink of
the great basin plainly a trial was toward
for the two men behaved unlike the gods
companion held a war bow and let fly
drawing the taut sinew to his ear mean-
while poias stood empty-handed in the
field intent staring toward the tower even
as iasos drew the theban leaped crouched
sprang backward or forward or stood mo-
tionless his clenched right hand uplifted
menacingly as though aiming a throwing-
spear arrows fell all about him nor were
those headless

  after a time however iasos laid aside
the bow and took up a sling it was a nar-
row thong weighted heavily at one end
with spiked bronze men used it in war
with deadly effect iasos swung it about
his head slowly at first then in ever swifter
wider circles and suddenly launched it
straight toward poias but here was a
strange thing a long thin thread shot out
like a tail after the missile and a short
length at the end cut a quick wake in the
water at the edge of the basin whipping
on immediately into the grass of the field
the head missed poias by a good deal

  this iasos did several times coming ever
nearer to his mark once he grazed poiass
shoulder

  afterward the young theban gathered
up the slings coiling them but the ends
he cut off with his knife some longer some
shorter

  the other guard in the citadel were much
taken with the test and later practised it
often among themselves great skill grew
up among them in sending the missile as in
dodging it for while the man in the field
who was the target could see the dark
bronze coming-the slinger could follow the
trail of thread with his eye over the spark-
ling sun-broken water and correct his er-
rors of aiming

  the hazel fork no man could understand
but poiass mother had related to him long
before how when a maiden in the fields
about thebes she had seen one trace the
course of hidden water with such a wand
hazel willow or some other slim sapling
when the wand dipped down water drew
it now one fork now the other

  poias vanished sometimes from hut
quarry and village staying for days none
saw him leave nor return neither was it
known where he went he would disappear
when lights-quenched everywhere for sleep
suddenly coming back after long absence
in the small hours of morning his mother
may have known for he debated all things
with her when they walked together usually
in the cool of the evening but a great
curiosity was waked in others by his vacant
place at meals in the stone-pit and the
trodden path about the tower water

  the girls tossed their heads the young
men laughed knowingly poias poias

  there were those more steeped in experi-
ence older folk who said he was a fool
what did he want with venom far tilings
seem fair foreign women more desirable
but they were bad and treacherous those
what had that lovely mountain girl made
of lycander unproved unproved
but not disproved poias would do better
to make eyes nearer home though even
bceotian girls bred in the village- how-
ever he was half a foreigner himself wild
geese fly off mysteriously to others of their
kind

  but his father ctephar spied on him one
night when the young man thought him
asleep he stole into the darkness follow-
ing secretly not far behind on his sons
footfalls the way led down by the grove
across a short plain and up into the wooded
mountain poias had stopped abruptly
once and whirled round on his heel giving
his father a hearty fright luckily a shad-
ow had concealed him also he wore the
blue tunic at last poias had whistled
softly a mans head had appeared above a
boulder and presently the man himself
ctephars eyes had bulged for he recognized
the face a savage scar ran crookedly from
right temple to nostril hewing short the
nose it showed ugly and livid under the
young moonlight that flooded down

  enop he who had been driven into the
mountain with stones and spears he had
bred horses and men said of him-

  he and poias spoke together briefly
poiass grave face had never seemed so joy-
ous then the two had gone on up leaving
ctephar staring with horror after them

  not girls nor women but wilder and
worse excitements lay beyond that steep
rise outcasts atheists broken men of all
sorts without house or kin lodged yonder
in the rocks still deeper back where they
had their caves and dens at times they
came down for cattle or waylaid on the
highways or did worse things

  so ctephar had gone back more rapidly
than he had come he hid his discovery
for he was ashamed and afraid he grew
moody and sullen waking often at night
to look toward poiass couch but some
nights later when he raised his restless
head poias lay there asleep his face un-
troubled one arm thrown back over his
head as had been his habit from a child

chapter viii

the girl among the goats

a slender silver crescent rode in
the mild sky as poias slipped forth
silently late after sundown from the
cypress hut his father lay stone-quiet
seeming to sleep his mother stirred softly
and called after him each had his own
thoughts as the young man stepped into
the shadow of the doorway glanced quickly
to left and right and made across the moon-
lit space and each was partly right so
were the youths and bridling maidens of the
village had they but known it

  poias meant to go down to the whirling
flood to see mya daughter of lyssa

  but first he moved steadily along the
familiar way to enop and the men up on
the mountain the horse-breeder met him
at the accustomed place for poias always
set when he left the time when he would
come again or failing that the next

  the lawless men in the rocks were fair
prey every hand against them and they
kept good watch against surprise one had
to be taken to them with proper warning
from a distance otherwise-a quick and
violent death

  but poias had known some of them from
a child enop was his friend admiring
his strength when the crooked scar had
been made-it was not a scar then but a
pulsing bloody cleft-poias had found him
daughter f lyssa



half dead huddled among the thick pines
the lad had thrown away the berries he was
gathering had stolen off with earthen pip-
kin and fetched cold water to bathe his
face afterward they had grown friends
poias had told him boylike of his dreams
and enop had taken him up to the rocks
to the outcasts and broken men

   when you are ready to take the tower
he had cried  here are men to your hand
only show us how

  and the men had laughed

  now poias stood among them in high
humor discussing many things he had
found the very width of the stretching water
-if that were of importance-and would
soon know the hidden source that fed it
perhaps if that were cut off- and yet he
had another plan in mind that might make
that needless lending still greater glory to
the conquest he would return in three
nights or failing that in two more let
gnop wait for him on the upper rocks
toward the ridge road then he would tell
them everything

  the men lusted for revenge and trea-
sure poiss desire was for fame alone
but their paths met at the tower and he
cared nothing for the means so that only
the end were achieved

  he spent the night near a little crackling
fire that leaped up brightly before the cave
where the sheep and cattle were penned
the cave was honeycombed with passages
leading all ways deep into the mountain
and up into open air the shadows danced
with the flames the men lay around eat-
ing drinking wine and telling tales behind
sounded the muffled stamping and munching
of the oxen they lowed the air was crisp
and racy with pine the open spaces far
down below through the trees toward the
moonlight-flooded valleys seemed vast
without limit

  morning was well advanced when he
threw off his cloak and rose from sleep
the men had gone save a few but there
was bread porridge and wine for him by
the cooling embers he ate climbed higher
up the mountain toward the rough road that
lay parallel to the whirling flood then went
on steadily till midday at noon he stopped
to eat his bread and cheese drinking water

later from a small brook late in the after-
noon he lay in the plane trees growing
back of the hut of lycander called charon

  a little wind blew softly rustling all the
leaves about him and over his head though
he could not hear them beyond the hut
and the river spoke the water it ran
swiftly seeming motionless midway rush-
ing forward along the near bank by dark
reed and hummock par off it flew up at
whiles in quick spray against a steep rocky
patch crowned with cypresses falling back
in a sparkle of silver

  a low object showed blackly to the eye
half-way across moving to the distant bank
beyond the island ever it grew taller and
shorter taller and shorter with slow
rhythm heaving very slightly sidewise left
between whiles little dazzling gleams
flashed regularly at longer intervals out
from each side

  charon-plying his ferry

  presently it would be sundown the pale
curve of the young moon like the ghost
of a childs bow-a little lonely floating
cloud-sickle-hung in the quiet sky that
flushed faintly

  it was summer breaths of langourous
scent rose from the plane trees from the
flowers the mosses and herbs of the thicket

  not thus had poias dreamed his second
longing would be stilled to his hearts de-
sire as he stood waiting behind a tree-
trunk one hand pressed lightly on the cool
bark he felt an unknown softness come
over him a little pulse-beat muffled at
the hollow of his throat his lids drooped
he gazed vaguely through blurring lashes

  he had thought to storm a town swiftly
mounting the burning walls in face of rain-
ing arrows spears hot fire to take the
wonder of the world at the summit to hold
her against fierce attack to feel his tense
naked arm circling her yielding body silk-
drenched with the cool smoothness of her
hair

  would she meet his dream what were
her ways-the curve of her lips her blue
eyes her turn of head the budding of her
young breasts

  forgotten were tower long craft of plan-
ning his tall mother and the tales she told
when they walked together in the cool of


all-story weekly

the evening the stranger his great father
drifted from his mind lost as under deep
water his heart beat and his palms grew
moist the long black hair fell over his
hot forehead and he tossed it back

  then came mya

  she moved among her goats toward the
hut from the unpeopled wood behind her
fathers dwelling a little bell tinkled in
the flock she was slender and full of grace
her arms were rounded and white very
delicate the sun had not browned them
the shaggy goat-skin tunic rose folding
over her left shoulder one young breast
showed her little feet were two pale drifts
like those left on green tree-roots when the
snow is melting

  she penned her charges milking them
the thin limpid jet shot foaming into the
earthen vessels her slim hands caressed
the rough coats of the patient beasts before
she gently thrust them each away calling
out to the next

   cissaitjia amymone eris oita
phryxa

  then she rose the light wooden yoke
swayed a little as she moved toward the
hut she steadied the vessel with outspread
fluttering fingers

  mya-

  poias stepped from among the trees

  as when a fawn treads daintily in the
still glade setting slender delicate legs one
before the other she thinks herself alone
she is content unafraid demure she goes
her quiet way turning here and there trot-
ting confidently to crop the tender grass
anon the fine head rises large liquid eyes
look with trust into the forest till the bud-
ding velvet hornlets lower curving the
dappled neck droops she is safe fragrant
herbs call tempting with their scent-sud-
denly a jealous wind rushes by her ear it
pricks up pointed an arrow has hissed
by life-close its cruel tooth has bitten into
a tree-trunk its forked feather quivers she
must leap aside and away terror winging
her headlong flight-so the daughter of
lyssa hearing a strange voice a mans
not her father calling her name turned
hurriedly to escape

  yet she held the two swinging vessels
safe spilling not a drop

   mya said poias  mya do not
be afraid see i will go away though i
have come a long journey on foot to see
you with my two eyes you are beautiful
you are more lovely than they said

  the young mans voice was husky his
head trembled a little as he whispered
though his gaze was deep and straight

  mya looked at him sidewise

   who said who are you i do not
know you go away or i will call i will
cry aloud to my father who is on the
river

   you are beautiful repeated poias
 but i will go i had not dreamed it would
be like this you are so slender yet you
have taken my strength away

  he turned slowly moving toward the
thicket his brown muscular back was
straight where it showed at the tunic the
white linen arched slightly away from left
shoulder to right hip a ripple of power un-
dulated beneath his smooth skin as he raised
his hand passing his fingers back over his
hair but long black locks drooped again
over his forehead as he dropped his hopeless
arm he walked with hanging head

  the sultry air weighed the muffled roar
of the river echoed in his ears dulling him

   what is your name

  mya was laughing softly

   your name you are a foolish man i
see vou will not harm me but go if vou
wish

  poias stood rooted

   i have never spoken to a man when
any appeared i ran and hid in the hut i
will run now what is vour name

   poias

   it has a sweet sound poias it is
different from my fathers whom men call
charon though his name is lycander but
you are different from my father you have
a smooth face and you tell me things i like
to hear-not about goats and food and the
dreadful rushing river

  she shuddered

   your voice is pleasant and you smiled
when you spoke my name you have white
teeth

  are you dumb-poias though you
spoke to me just now why does your hand
tremble you are taller than my father
daughter of lyssa



though he is very tall but he is stronger
his hands are big you look like the young
men i have seen hiding in the woods where
i pasture my goats they thought i did
not see them and they nodded together
making great eyes as i combed the burrs
from phrysas coat with my fingers one
day there were two and one day many
behind the broad oak and the clump of
five trees

  she smiled again

  a dull ache throbbed suddenly in poiass
breast leaped and disappeared it shocked
just below the breast-bone then in the hol-
low of his throat his heart raced beating
beating a hot wave rushed up to the
roots of his hair spreading warmly over
his whole body his palms grew moist

   where do you live asked mya  but
let us walk from here it is hot i will
laugh if you stand there like a tree am
i so ugly that you stare at me with great
eyes

  her supple fingers moved to her hair
coiling and twisting the heavy gold she
tucked a strand into the sleek knot over
her white neck

  you-you-

  poias stammered

  you are not ugly let no man say it

i am not always-my tongue- mya i
could put you in a song-your sweet eyes
your white body the treasure of your hair-
that men would sing of you evenings
through hellas and mid-argos

  i have never been put in a song said
mya curiously  but let us go into the
hut where it is cool you shall put me in
a song my father will see us when he turns
the ferry the goats are penned and i
must set the milk in the shallow vessels to
skim the light fat i must make cheese
and set the evening meal

  she led the way and he followed after
her dimly gazing through blurred lashes
her form was like a sapling the yoke
pressed softly on her shoulder dimpling the
skin the swinging vessels balanced sway-
ing like tall grain when summer wind has
drifted by-like two maidens in a slow
dance

  the hut was cool and half dark with
low raftered roof the walls were round

logs of cedar peeled bare of bark wrinkled
and grooved in grain their whole amber
length they gave forth a faint fragrance
behind the open doorway through which
mya and poias had stepped grossing the
threshold the plane trees rustled all their
leaves moving their trunks a little bright
cracks of light shaping a thin upright ob-
long frame showed in the wall opposite-
two long slim sun-streaks shot like golden
wires across the hard earth floor-the door
that led to the river-edge

  mya knelt like a dryad easing the
glazed vessels to the ground then she
slipped from under the wooden yoke rose
lightly and stretched her white arms up-
ward clasping her hands behind her shapely
head her lithe body dilated

   sing me your song she said  poias

  the young man had leaned against a
door-post now he started forward with
swift impetuous steps the girls lashes
dropped fringing her eyes her bosom rose
and fell quickly

  but poias had stopped-trembling

   mya  he cried  you must-

  he leaped forward and crushed her in
his arms pressing her passionately to him
his hot breath beat back to his nostrils as
he kissed her shoulder her cheek her yield-
ing lips the tender velvet of her throat
under her chin her two arms slipped down
over his neck tightening he had not
dreamed they could be so strong so frail
they had seemed suddenly she moved
convulsively her head drooped and hung
to one side like a broken blossom and his
clasp relaxed a great terror came over
him for the first time like ice above his
eyes at his heart fie knew the strength of
his body he had been a savage a mad-
man he had killed her

   mya

  she opened two swimming blue eyes
smiling faintly up into his vivid face that
bent over her

   poias-you are stronger than my
father

   i have hurt you i am a brute beast
let me see your side-

  he stripped away the goatskin tunic with
a gentle hand everywhere the flesh was
ivory but a red angry welt glowed broad-

ly about her waist and up-diagonally
across her left shoulder

  i have hurt you

   you are strong poias but you hurt
me less than my father when he found me
by the river brink-when i was small

  she rested in his arms drawing her tunic
back in place with slow fingers

   mya you must come with me i love
you i was a fool out there by the plane
trees when i saw you for the first time

i love you you must come with me to my
mother she will take you in you will
live in our hut by the marble-quarry i will

  to be continued next week dont
  that you will get the continuation of

build you a dwelling with my hands i am
not always so cruel 

  his words followed one on the other a
low impetuous flood confusedly stemmed
at times only by his quick breathing

  but the girl had stirred he felt her
warm body stiffen she moved her head
swiftly intent listening toward the river

   my father she cried  he will kill
you

  poiass great arm tlosed again about her
his lips compressed his face set his nos-
trils began to quiver

the monkey married the baboons sister

kissed so hard he raised a blister-

the red-grimed men on the commis-
sary steps stared curiously toward
the slender youth who marched
blithely up the steep grade and whose clear
tenor rang up defiantly against the swelter-
ing heat of alabama august

  as he came closer he seemed little more
than a boy his skin was pink and clear
as that of a baby his eyes wide open blue
and guileless his step light his manner
that of a man at peace with the world
and determined to remain so

  he actually seemed to enjoy the final
steep pull to the commissary the sun
glaring down from a cloudless sky and

begetting little heat-waves which danced
mercilessly above the dusty red of the road
seemed to hold no terrors for him

as for the men in the hot breezeless
shade of the veranda they gazed in wonder
they were nearly prostrated and the mer-
cury in the thermometer tube gave them
just cause it registered an even hundred
even the leaves on the few trees which
served to relieve in some small measure the
starkness of the landscape drooped in utter
dejection

  the young man paused before the com-
missary his voice soared clearly

    kissed so hard he raised a blister-

and then with a sweep of the broad felt
hat from his curly head he made obeisance
the baboons sister



to the crowd on the gallery  howdy
fellows beautiful sunshiny day isnt it

  somebody laughed and the stranger
joined him there was an infectious quality
in his chuckle which brought smiles to
the lips of afl save one giant man who sat
humped against the wall sucking a soft
drink through a straw the youth intro-
duced himself

   my name is dane he said easily
 jimmy dane-at your service and if
some one will tell me where i can get a
nice yellow drink like the one in that
mans bottle yonder -he pointed toward
the big lantc-rn-jawed man crouched
against the wall- ill be forever his
debtor

  five minutes later he emerged from the
interior of the commissary with the coveted
beverage in his hand he seated himself
on the steps shoulders against an upright
and grinned genially at the crowd

   beautiful camp-this red ore-isnt
it

  his sarcasm brought an approving grin
from the wondering men for red ore
although one of the most productive iron
camps in the northern manama district
could lay small claim to beauty

  a red rocky hill rose sheer behind the
commissary a hill almost barren of vege-
tation and split by a work railroad a
branch of one of the mineral lines which
radiate from birmingham the commis-
sary itself was a gaunt unimposing struc-
ture which had been painted red against
the day when it should be dyed that color
by the ore-dust which covered the entire
camp

  next to the commissary was the one
pleasant spot in the camp the company
offices the building was low and rambling
and constructed like a huge bungalow
about it was a lawn framed by a carefully
trimmed hedge and within it worked the
engineering and clerical forces

  beyond the offices one could see three
skeletons rising in silhouette against the
burnished sky the three tipples which
marked the entrances to the trio of slopes
up and down which the skips rattled day
and night

  from the commissary steps the road fell

 sharply away for several hundred yards
 it was intersected at regular intervals by
 rough ungraded streets on that road and
 on those streets were the tiny whitewashed
 cottages of the miners even the newly
 painted home of the superintendent was
 far from an artistic triumph there was
 little which was physically attractive about
 red ore

 the stranger who had introduced him-
 self as jimmy dane sipped his drink with
 a relish he nodded toward the three
 tipples the first of which showed no signs
 of life  holiday he queried easily

 one of the miners on whose face tiny
 streams of perspiration had made white
 valleys in the encrusted red grim shook
 his head

  not quite he said  accident in
 no i mine

  anybody hurt

  no-and its a miracle there wasnt

  pav good

  fine

  short handed

  always

  need drill men

  yes- say sonny you aint makin
 out to be an ore miner are ye

 dane nodded  sort of-maybe

  drilled before

 a little

  mucked any

  i know something about it

  well ill be ding-busted how old
 are ye

    younger than my daddy and not quite
 as young as that little boy yonder

 the deep booming voice of the big man
 against the wall broke in gruffly he
 aint old enough to be anything but a
 fool

 dane turned until his baby-blue eyes
 rested fully on those of the big man

  mowd you guess that he inquired
 cheerfully

  any fool could see it

  and you caught on right away dane
 chuckled the miners roared with laughter
 and the big man rose to his feet and
 towered menacingly over the newcomer

   you didnt happen to mean nothin
 personal by that did ye
s

all-story weekly

  dane smiled  me personal my
goodness no i never get personal with
grown men it isnt respectful

  the big fellow stared hostilely and
then because there was nothing else for him
to do he turned away swearing under his
breath jimmy dane apparently took no
notice of the episode but the others who
had watched with abiding curiosity shook
their heads apprehensively the big man
was the camp bully and no man relishes
being made the butt of humor-least of
all a man of the bully type

  meanwhile jimmy dane chatted in a
wholesome friendly manner with the men
on the veranda-talked with them as if
they had been lifelong friends within ten
minutes he was one of the crowd and
then in the middle of a sentence he broke
off and sang a few bars of the inevitable
song

    the monkey married the baboons sister
    kissed so hard he raised-a blister

  oh boys do you raise em that
way in red ore

  the object of his remark was a young
girl scarcely more than eighteen years of
age in a voile dress-cool and fresh and
beautiful as a morning flower she rounded
into the main road from one of the inter-
secting streets nodded genially to the men
on the veranda and entered the commis-
sary jimmy dane stared admiringly and
then slapped his knee with approval

   does she live in red ore he inquired
   she does answered one of the men

   then asserted jimmy positively
 red ore is where i camp i apologize
for everything i ever thought about the
place-which is considerable apology at
that if youve got princesses here-

  a heavy hand fell on jimmys shoulder
muscular fingers tightened until they dug
cruelly into the flesh and the youth was
jerked to his feet and whirled around to
stare into the eyes of the big man with
whom he had just had the verbal run-in

   whatja mean by that growled the
big man ominously

  a glint of steel flashed momentarily in
jimmy danes eyes but his cheery manner
did not leave him for an instant

  just what i said he retorted  i like
 the scenery in red ore and im going to
 stay here

  if you mean that gal-

  my dear big man-i thought i made
 that very plain if they raise em as beau-
 tiful as that here i think ill stick around
 a while and see what i draw

 the big mans idle hand clamped on
 jimmys other shoulder the mottled face
 with jaw outthrust shoved itself into
 danes  apologize he ordered

 jimmy nodded  sure-sure ill apolo-
 gize i dont know what im apologizing
 for-but im one of the best little ol apolo-
 gizers you ever saw in your life i apolo-
 gize humbly i beg your pardon a million
 times i salute you i love you dearly
 is that enough

 the big man flung him away and strode
 into the store but the men on the veranda
 were not laughing solicitude showed in
 their eyes

  better be moughty careful sonny
 counseled one  you stepped plumb on
 his toes that time

  you dont say that nice big cheer-
 ful cuss whos just been manhandling me

   the same

  didnt i apologize enough

  too much came the prompt answer
  y see that there gal happens to be his
 sister 

good night jimmy dane sank to
the floor with affected grief and gave forth
a lugubrious wail

     o-o-o-oh

    the monkey married the baboons sister

     kissed so hard he raised a blister

  isnt that just my luck he wound
 up  just about

  hes a bad un proffered the other

  whats his name

  and his sisters first name

    how did it happen that theyre fruit

  those the offices next door
the baboons sister



   yes

   superintendent there

   he went down in the mine after the
accident dont know whether hes got
back yet

  jimmy nodded and strolled away whis-
tling gaily the men on the commissary
steps gazed after him the lips of each
wore a smile

   some feller that kid  yeh an in
bad with delaney mores the pity
 jerry  squash him one of these days-
just like that  cheerful kid aint he
 looks like a youngster  or a girl
eh  he aint scared much though it
took nerve to laugh at jerry right to his
face thataway it kind of took the big
feller down

  the door of the commissary swung back
and delaney and his sister emerged the
man glared about belligerently and flung
a general question at the crowd  wheres
that smarty feller

   gone to see mr jerrold

   hed better not try-

  the lilting lyric tale of the matrimonial
affairs of the monkey and the baboons
sister came to them from the door of the
superintendents office and jimmy dane
danced toward them apparently oblivious
to the presence of delaney and the girl he
leaped onto the veranda and bowed low
to the men

   welcome me brothers he said  im
one of the crowd drill helper to start
with

  the girl was staring curiously at the
effervescent young man here was a type
new to her he was as different from the
stolid phlegmatic mining men as night is
different from day jimmy swung on the
crowd

   when ladies and gentlemen are pres-
ent he hazarded it ought to be cus-
tomary to introduce em

   meet jimmy dane miss eunice-
began one of the men when jerry growled
a surly interruption

   shell not be meeting this monk and
as for you young feller -turning to
jimmy- the first time i see you hanging
around my sister-

  jimmy paid no more attention than if

he had not spoken his eyes held those
of the girl steadily and he spoke directly
to her

   remember miss eunice weve been
introduced so the next time i pass you
ill speak and it wont be polite to cut me
in spite of herself the girl laughed and
her laughter fanned the sullen flame of ill-
temper in her brother to a white heat
nough of this he roared then to
jimmy  you get th hell out o this
camp ill give you one hour

   all favors thankfully received-usu-
ally delaney but you can have your

calling you a liar-and that would make
me just as impolite as you are

  eunice placed her hand on her brothers
arm she was flushed and ill at ease and
patently ashamed  lets go home jerry
they started down the slope together
and scarcely had they gone a dozen steps
when jimmys clear voice called after them
 miss eunice

  involuntarily she turned

   remember said jimmy  weve been
formally introduced

  and despite her obvious fear of her
brother the girl flashed him a smile  ill
not forget she said

  jimmy dane won straight into the
hearts of the men for two weeks he
mixed with them and was one with them
they found him a different sort always
cheery and good-natured always ready to
help always ready to loan a few dollars


all-story weekly

when money was needed a close-lipped
confidant and a sound adviser

  tommy davis had it that jimmy looked
eighteen and had the wisdom of eighty
and what surprised all of them was that
from the ouset jimmy dane proved him-
self one of the most skilful drill-men in
red ore

  he seemed tireless and his muscles ap-
peared to be made of chilled steel he
was always ahead with his own work and
ever ready to help others he even did
part of the work of a mucker for two
days when one of his drift-crew was sick

   and above all he paid positive and direct
court to eunice delaney

  he did not visit the delaney house to
have done so would have been to invite a
clash with jerry delaney whose rancor
against the young chap seemed to grow with
each meeting and who seemed to have
made a hatred of jimmy dane his watch-
word time and time again he attempted
to force jimmy into an unequal physical
combat but every time the young drill-
helper turned him aside with light jest
and merry quip the men stood back and
smiled with silent amusement although
there were many who had grown to like
the young newcomer and who feared for
him when the inevitable clash should come

  or was jerry delaney the only man in
red ore who looked with unfavorable
eyes upon the growing affection between
eunice and jimmy dane there was one
other to whom the situation did not appeal

  that man was harris jerrold superin-
tendent of the red ore mines

  harris jerrold was a big man physically
the size of jerry delaney although built
more along the lines of the smaller jimmy
dane he was the trained athlete in every
inch of his broad-shouldered deep-chested
six feet moreover he was an unusually
handsome man with a shock of sandy hair
brushed straight back from a high fore-
head with steel-gray eyes looking out
levellv from under light lashes he was
straight as a sapling and undoubtedly a
competent man

  his friendship with eunice delaney
dated back nearly six months to the day
when she had come home from a two-year

course at the university of alabama being
egotistical by nature he had fancied to daz-
zle her with the grandeur of friendship with
the superintendent of the mammoth camp
but if she had been dazzled she had not
shown it

  however she welcomed him warmly he
was an infinite relief after the slow-tongued
stupidity of the uneducated men with whom
she was forced to associate through her
status as sister of and housekeeper to a
miner but she instinctively distrusted
harris jerrold and her guard was up against
him she knew him for more or less of a
social butterfly and she realized that he was
not the kind of man to offer his hand in
marriage to the sister of a miner and so-
while she welcomed his company she dis-
couraged any attempt at intimacy

  jimmy dane looked with pronounced dis-
favor upon the friendship between the su-
perintendent and the girl he did not like
it he knew harris jerrolds type and
being jimmy dane he did what no other
man would have done on such short ac-
quaintance-in his habitual light way he
questioned the girl about harris jerrold 

   like him dont you eunice he had
called her  eunice  from the first with-
out asking her permission

   yes she answered honestly  hes a
relief

   from these dunderheads

   yes

   i admire his taste said the boy  but
the admiration doesnt extend beyond that
is he serious

   does that interest you-much it
was very dark along the road where they
were walking and he did not see the flush
which stained her cheeks

  he waved his hand airily  not much
like to understand my fellow creatures
his eternal lightness of manner irritated
her the flush of cheek was succeeded by
a pallor  i like mr jerrold more than
any man i know

   present company excepted

   no-not even that

  pie bowed low  lady i thank thee for
thy honesty i fancied i was irresistible
 i know it she flamed

   seeing that i am not i wish you luck
the baboons sister



with him whose charms exceed mine but
fair lady i bid thee be careful

   what do you mean by that

   think it over he said easily  you
may get the right answer some day and
now lets talk about something pleasant-
like that brother of yours for instance

   what about him

   for a man who does very little work
said jimmy dane frankly  he has more
money than any miner i have ever seen
she bit her lip  well

   did he inherit it

   i dont see-

   that its any of my business it isnt
thats why i enjoy inquiring

 since it is none of your business came
her tart answer  ill say nothing about it
 fine-fine he threw back his head
and his clear tenor ascended heavenward

    o-o-o-oh

   the monkey married the baboons sister

   kissed so hard he raised a blister-

  suddenly the song broke off he clasped
tense fingers about her arm and pointed up
the hill toward the tipple before mine
no  isay-look at that

   that was a fire which crept up the
timbers of the giant tipple and in a very
short time roared into the clear night air
there was a general exodus from the houses
and up the street could be seen an eddying
of the miners and their families toward the
scene of the blaze an extemporaneous
fire-company was working in the glare of
the fire toward the scene of the excite-
ment jimmy dane and the girl ran she
keeping pace with him by a display of agili-
ty which surprised and delighted him

  as they rounded the power-house and
came within view of the blazing tipple they
saw that it was doomed and that with its
destruction work on no  slope would be
held up for perhaps a month while a new
tipple was being constructed the fire-
fighters were bending their energies to sav-
ing the cable-house to the rear of the tipple
all wtere working under the direction of
superintendent jerrold

  jimmy dane helped but little with the
fire-fighting instead he separated himself
from eunice delaney and worked around

to a position near the foot of the burning
tipple searching the ground he bent over
then straightened and made his way to
jerrold that individual - who had de-
veloped an antipathy to the young man be-
cause of jimmys friendship with eunice-
glared at him

   well what do you want

  wanted to show you this answered
jimmy extending a handful of small sticks
jerrold glanced at them

   what about it

   they forgot to light it i found it at
the foot of one of the support timbers

   who forgot to light what what are
you talking about

   just this mr jerrold said jimmy
quietly  this pile of tinder was care-
fully placed at the base of a supporting
pillar it was saturated with kerosene
the entire base of the tipple was soaked
with oil the fire couldnt have spread as it
did had that not been the case-

   it means he finished  that this fire
is incendiary it is the result of premedi-
tated vandalism-just as all the other  ac-
cidents  which have occurred in the last
few weeks have been caused by somebody
who is seeking to injure the red ore mines
what do you say to it

  jerrold snorted  youre a damned
fool he snapped get back and help
put that fire out

iii

  another  accident three days later
left red ore with a majority of its popula-
tion unemployed no  mine was working
to capacity but the destruction of the tip-
ple at no  and the new accident in no 
cut down the mines output by two-thirds

  the company was growing impatient but
the superintendent did not seem flustered
with quiet efficiency he directed the repairs
at that the task was tedious and the day-
and-night efforts of the engineering force
did not satisfy the men who were paid by
the day or by the ton and were therefore
forced into idleness

  labor agents appeared in red ore and
a general migration to other camps com-
menced the red ore mining company


all-story weekly

found that it would be faced by a serious
labor shortage as soon as its nos i and 
slopes should reopen it was a virtual cer-
tainty  that only one of them could be
manned

  the general offices in new york were
howling the company was paying enor-
mous penalties for failure to deliver accord-
ing to ironclad contracts a field repre-
sentative came on from new york and re-
ported back to the general offices that ail
progress possible was being made red ore
had apparently been the victim of circum-
stance

  what the field officials did not know-
but the fact was patent to the sober-faced
directors who gathered about a polished ma-
hogany table in the thirty-first floor of a
big new york office building-was that the
company was facing insolvency

  for two months the red ore camp had
been paralyzed by a series of supposed ac-
cidents following close on the heeis of one
another the fire at no  had been the
crowning catastrophe and when no 
slope was eventually opened again it was
found that only enough labor remained in
red ore to work it work on the rebuild-
ing of the tipple at no  went on slowly
there was little need for haste the min-
ers had gone

  after the opening of no  slope super-
intendent harris jerrold left for birming-
ham one morning on the mineral accom-
modation on the same train was jimmy
dane who had not been working for sev-
eral days the following night jimmy re-
turned and one day later the superin-
tendent again reached the camp the chief
engineer having been in charge during his
absence

  jimmy spent two hours with eunice that
evening he was breezy as ever laughing
joking chatting - refusing to take things
seriously and misreading-or not reading
at all-the light of invitation in her eyes

  the girl had been considerably worried
lately superintendent jerrold had been
rather obtrusive with his attentions and she
had exhausted her fund of tact she in-
stinctively disliked the man but woman-
like when jimmy asked her the question di-
rect she refused to admit the fact she

evaded a straight answer and left the really
earnest but apparently disinterested young
man totally in the dark as to the condition
of her real feelings toward the handsome
young mine superintendent

  when they parted that evening jimmy
struck down the hill toward the shack where
he had a room the girl watched him
until he was lost in the shadow of a clump
of bushes then she sighed and turned
back into the house she wondered about
the young man she marveled at his eternal
light-heartedness his refusal to take any-
thing seriously his perpetual laughing at
the serious things of life and she liked
jimmy liked him more than she dared
admit even to herself

  he was so different from the other two
men who played major roles in her restricted
existence - her half-brother big brutish
bullying heavy of muscle and hard of fist
grim unimaginative rather repulsive to her
if the truth be known and harris jerrold
a polished man of education self-opinion-
ated and overbearing but a competent work-
er and a man who had fostered a friend-
ship with her brother that he might more
easily foist his attentions upon her

  yes-jimmy was different from them
yet she found it in her heart to wish that
he had more of their soberer qualities his
was the irresponsibility of youth she could
not believe that he knew of her love for him

  had she watched jimmy after he disap-
peared in the shadows she would have found
food for puzzling thought for jimmy did
not go straight to his cabin instead he
turned down the street on which the su-
perintendent lived and hid himself behind
a boulder there he waited-motionless as
the big rock itself-for an hour at the
end of that time his patience was rewarded

  a big man strode along the road a man
whose huge angular bulk identified him as
jerry delaney he did not see jimmy
crouched behind the boulder nor did he
see that light-hearted young man as he fol-
lowed across the main road and pussy-
footed along his trail toward the mouth of
no  mine

  occasionally delaney paused to glance
apprehensively about the moon was new
and shed but little light apparently satis-
the baboons sister



fied that he was unobserved he skirted the
hill into which no  slopes burrowed and
struck down into the valley on the other
side a hundred yards behind him jimmy
dane followed stealthily

  for a half-mile jerry walked then struck
into a clump of bushes jimmy clenched
his fist he understood now jerry had
reached a surface opening from no  mine
which led to the water-pumps the young
man no longer doubted what he had before
only suspected-namely that jerry delaney
was the man who had been responsible for
the series of accidents which had placed the
red ore mining company on the verge of
bankruptcy nor could jimmy dane for-
get for a single instant that this man was
the half-brother and sole surviving relative
of the girl who in the last few weeks had
come to mean so much to him

  he followed delaney into the stygian
darkness of the passage the big man
worked swiftly in ten minutes the pump-
ing apparatus was out of commission it
was a certainty that by the following morn-
ing no  slopes lower levels would be un-
workable

  delaney crawled to the entrance and
there standing quietly whistling his eternal
 the monkey married the baboons sis-
ter was jimmy dane the big man
started with surprise and then strode for-
ward angrily

   whatcha doin here dane

   whistling

   i dont mean that was you spvin on
me

   why should i spy on you

   im askin of you-you aint askin of
me

  oh i thought it was fifty-fifty

   say young feller-ive a good mind to
take this chance and knock the everlasting
hide offen you

   no

   and for half a cent-

   no you wouldnt delaney

   id like to know why

   ill tell you why unless you had a
gun and a pair of knucks you couldnt lay
a fist on me in an hour im considerable
of a boxer it may interest you to know
that i held the amateur welter-weight cham-

pionship of the united states for four years
and if you did lay your hands on me id
be likely to hurt you and hurt you badly
if you have any doubts-just start in
delaney stared into the unfiickering eyes
of the young man dane was laughing his
lips were creasing into a broad good-na-
tured mocking smile and then dane
spoke

   i see that you realize that im telling
the truth thats good it  save you a
lot of trouble and a good licking and now
for the other reason-why youd be al-
mighty foolish to whip me even if you
could-and that is because you cant afford
to get me sore at you because if you did
id land you in jail very quickly

  delaney cringed  wha - whadaya
mean

   im a great little meaner to-night jerry
my lad i mean that ive just watched you
cripple this water-pump apparatus and i
happen to know that youre the man who
set fire to the tipple on no 

  thats a lie

   thems harsh words adolphus be-
sides it isnt a lie i know that youve
been at the bottom of every accident which
has occurred here in two months now
im no fool i know youre not running
these risks for the love of the thing and
i need money count me in on the divvy
and ill keep my mouth shut

   you mean youll come in with me

   sure im not asking any embarrassing
questions mind you but i need money-
plenty of it and youve evidently got the
secret of landing it am i with you or do i
squeal to the superintendent about you be-
ing the man who is at the bottom of all
this dirty-work

   you-youre in on it-of course but
say-i didnt think you were that kind

  	no jimmy dane threw back his head
and laughed joyously  that innocent
look of mine helps me to get away with a
lot of things jerry

iv

  that night marked the beginning of an
intimacy between jimmy dane and jerry
delaney which developed into a franken-


all-story weekly

stein for the younger man for with the
intimacy between the two men eunice de-
laney snubbed jimmy dane completely

  and jimmy did not know that the reason
was because eunice knew that her brother
was the vandal who had virtually wrecked
red ore and that now she knew that
jimmy and her worthless brother had
formed an alliance for evil

  and although he went his way in his cus-
tomary lightsome singing manner there
was the suggestion of worry on his boyish
forehead as for the girl she did a thing
which proclaimed aloud her sheer feminini-
ty she assiduously invited the attentions of
the superintendent jimmy saw them to-
gether many afternoons and many nights
he did not trust the superintendent but
now the girl would have nothing to do with
him and he was deprived even of the satis-
faction of warning her

  his alliance with jerry delaney was a
successful one he furnished the brains
which jerry lacked the sly cunning neces-
sary to their work they crippled machines
in the shops they placed a blast which
caused a rockfall in an important drift and
held up work on that level for days they
even robbed the crusher of two important
bolts and for five days it remained helpless
until new ones could be wrought

  more men were leaving red ore daily
work was too uncertain the gossip had
gone that the camp was hoodooed after
the succesful completion of each dirty job
jerry handed jimmy his share of the money
and both men seemed satisfied and su-
perintendent jerrold went his way quietly
and calmly unflustered in the face of the
series of crippling accidents and apparently
happy in the smiles of eunice delaney

  and then one night jerry came to jimmy
dane with a plan to put important no i
slope out of commission for a week or more
they were to file the steel cable on the
skip-hoist when they were quite sur that
no men would be endangered it was a
certainty that the car pelting wild from the
surface at lop speed would leap the track
tear off rods of trackage and perhaps cause
a cave-in jimmy hesitated for a moment
and then agreed

  their job was completed that night near

midnight it worked according to schedule
no one was hurt but the tracking was
ruined the cable useless until expert re-
pair work could be done and no  drift
closed tight for several days

  superintendent jerrold was summoned
and visited the scene of the accident im-
mediately he swore a bit and examined
the cable the following morning he wired
news of the latest misfortune to company
headquarters and got busy on repairs no
one seemed to suspect either jimmy dane
or big delaney

  two nights later four strangers arrived
in camp in a touring car they proceeded
straight to the superintendents office and
interviewed that gentleman privately a
half-hour later jerrold left camp in their
company and at eight oclock that night
the front door of the delaney cabin opened
and jimmy dane entered eunices lips
curled she rose and would have left the
room but jimmy restrained her

  just a minute eunice he said  i
have something to say to you

    nothing that i care to hear

  jimmy laughed  yes it is i promise-
stay-please-

  she stayed

  jimmy turned on jerry delaney he
was smiling broadly the same care-free
jimmy dane whom the men in camp-and
the girl standing straight on the other side
of the room-had learned to love dane
addressed the girls brother

   i thought it might interest you to
know he observed quietly  that super-
intendent jerrold has just been arrested
he saw the girls bosom rise with a sud-
den intake of breath jerry rose slowly to
his feet his face ghastly with sudden fear
 arrested he faltered

  - yes

   wh-what for

  trying to wreck the mine

  but-but- say weve got to beat it
jimmy

  jimmy smiled  no

   but if theyve got him-

    youve got to beat it delaney

   youre in it deep as i am

    a little deeper in fact you see i swore
out the warrant for jerrolds arrest
the baboons sister



   you-you swore out- what are you
talkin about

   im talking about this delaney youve
been a fool-a sucker i came down here
from company headquarters im a mining
engineer im a stockholder in the com-
pany

   when those accidents started we knew
that there was something radically wrong
the company was facing ruin they sent
me down here incognito to investigate

   i got away with it and it didnt take
me long to suspect that it was you you
had too much money and did too little
work but i didnt want you youre small
fry you were just the tool and i knew it

i	wanted the man behind you i knewr
that whoever it was he was in authority
and that his idea was to keep his hands
clean in case anything went wrong

   it struck me as peculiar that jerrold
should be so lukewarm in his investigation
he didnt even try to hold the laborers
here he almost encouraged them to leave
then when that tipple burned i took pains
to prove to him that the fire was incendiary
and he never said a word about it that
proved that he was in on the know

   i got the goods on you that night at
the water-pump you accepted me as an
ally where a cleverer crook would have
been suspicious of me after that it was a
cinch to find out that the money was com-
ing from jerrold

   but then i was puzzled about where
jerrold got the money from and why he
wanted to wreck the mining company for
which he was working i followed him one
day and was not very much surprised to
see that he went to the city and direct to
the offices of a rival mining company which
has been trying to buy red ore mines

   it was a cinch that jerrold was em-
ployed by this company easier still when i
managed to get a look at their records and
discovered that he is already a stockholder
their idea was to force us to sell at rock
bottom and allow them to grab a corking
good piece of mining property at a frac-
tion of its values

   it was a pretty clever scheme but
they carried a good thing too far and the
climax came the night we cut the skip

loose i knew that jerrold saw that filed
cable and i knew that being an engineer
he could not fail to realize that it had been
deliberately cut that was when i swore
out the warrant and got the deputies out
here to arrest him

   youve been the goat delaney but
im running this thing my way i might
mention that im the new superintendent
of red ore youre been criminal but we
have nothing to gain by putting you in jail
jerrold will do time enough for the pair of
you youve been the dupe the fool-
nothing more

   youve got forty-eight hours to make
your getaway thats all ive got to say 

  jerry delaney apparently had even less
to remark within an hour he had left red
ore his eyes wide with fear the last any
one in the camp saw of him was when he
drove down the road in a hired rig

  for a long time after he had gone the
girl stood motionless in the corner jimmy
humming softly to himself gazed at her and
compelled her eyes to his finally he spoke

   well

   i-im glad you were merciful she
said  he is my half-brother

   he has been more foolish than crimi-
nal answered the young man  but at
that he might have spared a thought for
you

   he never did that in his life she said
bitterly

   now youre alone in the world said
jimmy softly then he smiled  ive an
idea- youve sort of specialized on su-
perintendents-how would it strike you to
marry the new one

   marry- the girls hands flew to her
bosom and her eyes opened wide

   me

   i-i-guess you need-a sobering in-
fluence she said tremulously and then
she made the discovery that the muscles of
his arms were strong as steel

  jimmy dane did not leave the girls
cabin until near midnight and as he
trudged down the steeply sloping road she
heard his clear tenor floating over the red-
grimed camp

  o-o-o-oh

  the monkey married the baboons sister-
preceding chapters briefly retold

henry baird was unhappy because he had to stay in new york to complete the sale of a
copper property that would bring him eight hundred thousand dollars while his rival alan
moss went to the rockridge colony in massachusetts to visit the country home of mabel
darrow when he returned to his apartment he was made still more unhappy for he found
anderson his attorney and whitmore terral his cousin and chum waiting for him and from
them learned that a man named blackton claimed the copper property and that the sale would
be held up until his claim could be disproved in court but it was when larkin his tailor called
and demanded immediate payment of a bill of three hundred and fifty dollars that his cup of wo
ran over and he decided that new york would have to get along without him while he took a
trip to the country-which meant rockridge and mabel telling terral that he would keep in
touch with him from either rockridge or new bingham a near-by town he started in his ancient
motor-car his entire fortune of one hundred dollars in his pocket

     but misfortune dogged his wheels and most of the hundred was spent for repairs and replace-
ments before he reached new bingham there he was inveigled into a lawn fete for the benefit
of the church and his few remaining dollars taken from him by charming girls selling chances
then a great idea came to him and he arranged with mr singer in charge of the fete to raffle his
automobile selling two hundred two-dollar chances henry to receive three hundred dollars of the
proceeds but no sooner had he received this money than terral appeared having followed him
from new york and told him that the tailor would sue at once if henry did not pay him that
day terral had borrowed eighty dollars and henry had to give him the remainder leaving him
with twenty dollars with which he resolved to spend at least one night in rockridge after terral
had left henry noticed a crowd about the automobile it was afire and in a few minutes was
desrcyed  too bad said mr singer  well have to return the four hundred dollars

chapter ix

for value receiv ed

the jab of a knife between his ribs
perhaps might have caused henry
baird to start more violently surely
no other less energetic means could have
duplicated the effect of mr singers words
the stunned feeling had all vanished now
in the fraction of a twinkling henrys
breath was taken in with a queer little
whistling hiss his eyes with a squint of
positive terror darted at mr singers
profile and darted away again to settle
fixedly on the blazing ruin in the center of
the empty space

  his six or seven gallons of gasoline
seemed to have distributed themselves
wonderfully even now the fire was begin-
ning to burn out stray blazing pieces
dropped here and there from the side of the
car and under the bottom the running-
board collapsed strewing his few tools over
the grass the excitement was dying and
some of the small boys were edging nearer
the scene of the catastrophe

   and i congratulated myself so much
on that unexpected hundred dollars mr
singer sighed  however these things will
happen i suppose

  he felt in his pocket and produced the
marked envelope he ripped it and extract-

this story began in the ah-story weekly for june 

s

author ol  dodd-bis diary  ready to occupy  one brighi idea elc
his word of honor



ed the bills to turn to henry with a smile
of bland sorrow

   here is our share mr baird give me
yours and ill have the girls locate the
various tickets and refund

   i-i- henry stammered
oh we shall have to refund mr
singer said hastily  you-er-under-
stand that of course

   i understand it fast enough henry
said more steadily  but one of us cant
refund im the one

   pardon me said mr singer and his
eyes opened

 that three hundred dollars is no longer
here i sent it back to the city by the
young man who left here ten minutes ago
young man mr singer echoed  i
saw no young man

   well plenty of other people saw him
im not lying to you henry said warmly

  he followed me to get some money that
was needed in-in my business and that
was the only money i had and i gave him
that

   then-let us overtake this young man at
once and-

  he cant be overtaken hes on the
train long before this

  mr singers gaze was almost painfully
steady

   are you telling me that you-er-can-
not produce another three hundred dollars
for the people who bought these tickets in
perfect good faith

   im telling you just that henry said
bitterly

  mr singer cleared his throat with a de-
cided little sound

  it seems to me sir that you have cre-
ated a very unusual and very unfortunate
situation here

   it seems just like that to me henry
agreed

   one sir which is very easily open to
unpleasant construction and one for which
the remedy will have to be found in very
short order mr singer added still more
energetically

   do you mean to say-

   just a moment mr baird i do not
necessarily  mean to say  anything at all
it may be merely gossip but one of the

    	a-s

boys who arrived a few minutes back hinted
that you were trying to sell this very car for
one hundred and fifty dollars an hour ago

  henry winced

   so that at the very happiest it would
seem that you have used our fair to your
own advantage and now that affairs have
taken this unfortunate turn i would sug-
gest for your own welfare that you set the
matter right as soon as possible

  and he turned to one of the several
elderly gentlemen who had gathered from
different points-one whose short gray
whiskers and keen gray eyes marked him
as a man of acumen and authority

   oh youre listening judge grayson
mr singer smiled

  the judge nodded shortly

   i aim to hear most of whats going on
around here he stated with some signifi-
cance and stared straight at henry

  there was threat in that tone henry
glanced at its owner and then for a time
gazed at the smoking crackling heap that
had been his car and one might almost
have expected that panic would have seized
upon him and that taking one or two of
them with him that he would have dashed
to the nearest telegraph-office and set the
wires smoking in an effort to catch the train
that bore whitmore terral and have that
gentleman return to new bingham

  no panic came however or any sign of
panic that part of henrys brain which
could feel an emotion so trivial as terror
was temporarily benumbed but the ability
to reason with ghastly clearness remained
the only money in the world which could
keep the knowledge of his poverty from
tilbury and tilbury was on its way to new
york-which settled that what was of
vastly more importance his trip to rock-
ridge had reached its definite end alan
moss had the field to himself and- it
was a slightly selfish way of considering the
immediate situation was it not

  this bright thought came to henry at
the end of one minute causing him to scowl
suddenly and blackly two hundred well-
meaning people had paid two dollars apiece
for a chance at his car now there was no
car left but the wholly simple and very
unpleasant fact persisted that henry baird


all-story weekly

had taken and used money for which he
could make no return

  nor had anything like this ever hap-
pened before in all henrys career as a
little boy and ever since-even if the stress
of recent circumstances had caused him to
dally a little longer than usual in the pay-
ing of his personal bills-henrys word had
been his bond and that bond was as good
as gold

  a quick hot flush came to henrys cheek
and an angry light to his eye he took to
gnawing his lips and the flush deepened
this was no time at all to begin breaking
lifelong principles for that matter he
couldnt begin breaking them now or any
other time

   well mr singer inquired icily

   just what do you want me to do
henry demanded

   hand back the money you took in
what else the judge rapped out

  i havent it

   youll have to materialize it mighty
quick young feller the judge said

   and i cannot raise it henrys under-
tone went on swiftly and desperately
 im not going to recite my troubles to you
gentlemen but the solid fact is that all i
have left on earth is-myself

  	um muttered the judge

  so im going to sell myself cried
henry baird

   key said mr singer

   yes im going to sell myself into
slavery to the holder of that winning
ticket henry laughed savagely

  there was an utterly astounded pause
as well there might have been mr singer
first regained breath and did it with an
outraged hiss and lips compressed

   i will venture to say he announced
 that that is the most superbly idiotic
most utterly unmoral proposition that has
been uttered in this town since the day of
its foundation by elijah bingham

   and i will add- the judge began

  wait a minute before you add it
henry snapped  there is nothing idiotic
and nothing unmoral about it im not
offering to hand over my body and soul for
the term of my natural life im-well
lets see somebody has paid two dollars

for that winning ticket ill go to work for
them for say two weeks in any capacity
under the sun that isnt likely to land me
in jail

   and there are no reservations on that
either i can keep books or milk cows or
drive a car or repair one i can paint a
house or develop a roll of films or feed the
chickens or pick fruit or read to the sick
by thunder i can put down a concrete
floor too and i know how to nail on
shingles and can cut hay and look after
horses

  he was fiercely in earnest it goes a
long way in the world judge grayson
grinned suddenly although he had expected
to do nothing of the kind

   hed have to be pretty poor stuff not
to be worth a dollar a week he mused

   but even-even so mr singer stam-
mered

   oh there is nothing in it of course
the judge assured him  you couldnt
write a contract like that that would bind
him slavery went out of date quite some
time back

   well honor didnt did it henry
cried  or the habit of keeping ones
promise to the letter that sort of thing
is pretty well understood hereabouts

   i guess they didnt and it is as it
were the judge said almost soothinglv
 but-

   give me a piece of paper  said henry
baird and snatched out his fountain pen
while the judge who was growing really
interested found his capacious note-book
and extended it  they had the drawing
before the fire i believe what was the
number of the winning ticket

   they-they did yes of course said
mr singer who was a great organizer but
no man at all in an emergency  the
number now let me see what was the
number he shuffled agitatedly through
a collection of scraps crumpled in his palm
 ah yes that was it-one hundred and
thirty-seven

   one-thirty-seven  henry muttered
and sat down with a heedless thud upon the
camp-stool just outside the candy kitchen

  the group around them had grown the
news as news always does in similar gather-
his word of honor



ings was traveling with rather more than
the speed of a wireless wave girls were
giggling and men were craning their necks
as the remarkable henry wrote he re-
mained unconscious of them all

    because  am unable to deliver the
automobile called for by ticket one hundred
and thirty-seven or to make other ade-
quate return i hereby agree to work for
the holder of said ticket in any non-criminal
capacity to the limit of my mental and
physical ability for a period of two weeks
from the date hereof unless previously re-
leased by holder of said ticket for causes
not at present foreseen the judge read
over henrys shoulder and added
 phew

  somebody cheered

   i further agree to follow without
question any or all orders given me by the
holder of said ticket  the judge read on
  and to the completion of this contract in
every detail herein written or otherwise
implied i hereby pledge my solemn word of
honor signed henry baird

   can that be made any more sweeping
henry asked shortly

   i dunno how conceded the judge

   is there anything bindin about it
though a harsh voice demanded from
henrys other side

  the judge rubbed his short beard and
smiled meditatively

   i never struck anything just like this in
mythirty-three years practise of the law
he stated  all the same seeing as hes
unable to come across with the cash ill
say to the holder of that ticket that if this
young chap doesnt live up to his agree-
ment come to me and well see if some-
thing harsh cant be done to him

  henry smiled bitterly

   that of course he said  well who
owns me

  the crowd ever growing was surging
quite excitedly now here and there the
mystic figures  one hundred and thirty-
seven were being spoken with rising in-
flection oh-and now somebody was
pushing forward energetically and the
judge opened his eyes and turned away
suddenly with a strange suppressed
squealing little laugh

   well if you was trying to put any-
thing over on new bingham youve got all
that was coming your way young feller
he muttered  the way shes waving it
shes got the ticket

   who has

   miss levison son shes been trying
to catch a man for a matter of forty year
now

  henry turned with a gasp she was
there at any rate yes camels hair shawl
and weird bucolic bonnet and ghastly little
patches of rouge she was there painfully
spare bewigged in a fashion that permitted
baby-curls to stray upon her forehead
henrys employer for the next two weeks
glanced at him once and cast down her
eyes and said faintly

   i-i have it mr singer

   you breathed the organizer and
henry baird knew at least that the man
owned a heart

   this is one-thirty-seven on my ticket

chapter x

ticket no x

a cold chill ran through henry baird
it was all right of course he had
made his agreement without a sus-
picion of the winners identitj but when
ones journey has started toward a mabel
darrow and ended with a lady- why
was mr singer smiling so strangely and
relievedly as he examined the ticket and
shook his head

   im sorry he was explaining  im
such a wretched writer yes it does lock
like a three but it is meant for a five miss
levison thats one-fifty-seven you see
the crowd seemed to absorb the lady
mr singer hurried back blinking the
judge continued his chuckle and again the
crowd was moving with the approach of one
who held aloft a ticket henry peered and
sighed his relief this was the right one
of course and it was a man-not the sort
of man he would have chosen for an em-
ployer perhaps but a hard-featured
sturdy farmer person

   i got it singer he announced

   ah sighed the organizer


all-story weekly

   is this right what theyre saying this
mans going to put in two weeks work
free he looked henry over with care
and smiled grimly  good and husky by
criclcy used to working on a farm

   ill get used to it in mighty short or-
der henry said cheerfully

   you said something that time young
feller muttered the employer were
old-fashioned folks out my way y know-
up at five and at it fifteen minutes later

   that satisfies me said the victim

   ready to start

   well youll have to turn in your ticket
first of course smiled mr singer and
stretched out his hand for it

  the farming person poked it at him and
for a moment his attitude suggested that he
was about to throw a halter over henrys
head and lead him away henry smiled
faint resignation if those knotted hands
meant anything there was a busy two
weeks ahead of him a man with a neck like
that and an adams apple which resembled
a jack-knife inadvertently swallowed and
stuck half-way down would extract the last
ounce of energy from his slave

  oh this isnt one-thirty-seven mr
singer cried brightly

   why aint it the winner demanded
in amazement

   why-why this that youve mistaken
for a one isnt a one at all the other
apologized  its just a scratch where my
pencil slipped and went through you see
the paper was so very soft and i-i wrote
the tickets hurriedly on one of the enameled
tables in the ice-cream place they slipped
around a good deal you know and-er-
yes im dreadfully sorry but this is ticket
thirty-seven-just plain thirty-seven

  the farmer looked him up and down and
cast a lingering glance at henry

   well are you sure about it now he
asked unpleasantly

  yes i remember that ticket slipping
quite distinctly

  with a grunt the farmer person turned
his back mr singer dabbed his forehead
with a wonderfully white handkerchief and
smiled deprecatingly at henry

   people are so unreasonable in a case
like this he reflected

   yes im beginning to feel a little bit
unreasonable myself said henry baird
 this thing of being handed around from
one to the other gets on ones nerves there
is a one-thirty-seven ticket isnt there

   of course

   well lets find out who has it and
have the thing settled henry urged irri-
tably  if im sold to the meat market
or the orphan asylum or the barber shop i
want to know it and have done with it
im-

  here he subsided suddenly largely be-
cause the lovely slender girl with the mass
of chestnut hair was waiting a chance to
speak to mr singer she had been looking
straight at henry now she dropped her
eyes suddenly and blushed faintly the
judge started and covertly poked henry
bairds ribs

   shes got i saw it he breathed

  being human henry found himself
smiling pleasantly and expectantly and
with no effort whatsoever

   thats little adeline danvers worth
about four hundred thousand dollars in her
own right too since her papa died couple
o years ago the judge hissed on  aint a
feller in this town wouldnt trade his im-
mortal soul for the privilege o being sold
to her you betcha 

  the girl was looking straight at henry
and laughing uncertainly

   were the girls joking or-or is it so
about-about this gentleman she asked

    its all so  the judge chuckled

   well i have ticket one-thirty-seven

   heres your slave for two weeks
then the good judge laughed outright
 miss danvers this is mr baird-the first
human being ever sold in new bingham

   he isnt really-

   hes willing to do anything henry
smiled very glibly and cheerily  so that
he can work out two weeks for the holder of
that ticket thats all there is to it you
know

   well youll find plenty to keep you
busy out there the judge explained
 miss danvers has got a big place just be-
yond town

   yes but we-were not short of help
just now that is not-not the kind that
his word of honor



mr baird could furnish i mean-not farm
work im trying to say we have plenty
of men and-

   ill make myself useful henry
grinned  do you want to start now

  do i really have to-to take you

   i think so 

   of course you could sell your ticket to
somebody else mr singer put in help-
fully

   only please dont henry cried from
the bottom of his heart  if you could see
what ive just escaped-

  he faced her imploringly she looked
squarely at henry too and somehow
henry knew that they were going to get on
famously together not that there was the
slightest sentimental touch in the notion
either but this was a real girl her eyes
twinkled deeply at henry baird the funny
little dimple on her left cheek grew more
pronounced

   i did see she said  you-can drive
a car of course

   thats how  landed here henry said
sadly

   then i-yes i think ill let you drive
me home and well see what aunt has to
say about the arrangement were alone
out there you know just aunt and i and
the servants

  henry bowed

   show me the car he breathed

   its parked down there by the north
fence do i-thank you for him mr
singer or just what is the etiquette of a
thing like this

   well all that i shall require my dear
young lady is the ticket itself the organ-
izer beamed

   oh yes of course here it is are
you ready mr baird

   ill have to run down there for my little
trunk henry smiled

   all right his employer laughed and
turned to walk away

  and henry followed almost joyfully
almost-not actually of course he had
started for rockridge and the sole desire
of his life was to get to rockridge but
after two narrow escapes the prospect of a
little breathing spell with a girl like this
and an aunt who was doubtless as charm-

ing was pure balm he looked upon her
mass of hair which was finer than any silk
he looked upon the back of her round neck
which was very near perfection

  -oh cried mr singer behind them
just one moment please

  they turned

   i-im sorry of course but this isnt
one thirty-seven either he said

   what rasped henry baird as he
bounded to his side  of course its one
thirty-seven one-three-seven whats
the matter with that

 nothing except that-that that last
one isnt a seven mr singer submitted
rather weakly  its a five mr baird
its nothing of the kind henry cor-
rected hotly  thats a seven 

  no its a five the organizer insisted
 really it is a five that wigglv line
there which you mistake for a straight line
is the curved lower part of a five you see
i rushed through that second hundred and
the paper slid about so much that- why
you look at it judge grayson youll see
that it is a five

  the judge scowled over the slip

   knowing your writing i should take it
for a five-yes he said heavily  your
strength always kind of gives out on those
down curves anyway such as it is its
one of his fives fast enough mr baird

   i decline to admit anything of the
kind henry snapped with much finality
 that is a seven and nothing else why
if youre going to call that palsied jiggle a
five theres no end to this thing any
ticket in the lot may have won me and
he wrote another set of em for the drawing
didnt he likely enough one thirty-seven
never even won me in the first place
and-

  now there there there said mr
singer who was after all master of the
situation  the set from which we drew
was written by miss pindar and she is the
principal of our high school and one of the
finest writers ive ever seen your number
is one thirty-seven and this isnt one thirty-
seven im very sorry miss danvers but
this is not one thirty-seven

   so i imagined from what youve been
saying the girl said quietly


all-story weekly

  after which because she was a little per-
son of some quality and because whatever
his exterior she knew nothing at ail about
henry baird miss danvers favored henry
with a cool perfunctory little smile and
walked away-and what had promised to
be an interesting incident had closed with a
sickening thud and henry baird so to
speak was once more upon the open
market

   say thats the last time thats going
to happen  he snarled at mr singer  im
doing all i can to make good on a hard
proposition but im not going to stand
around all day and have your hen-scratches
make a confounded clown of me every three
minutes 

   why-why-well now you look here
sir you look right here mr singer
sputtered and shook his finger under hen-
rys very nose  you-

   hes right the judge said shortly as
he laid a restraining hand on the arm of the
organizer  you send the girls out singer
and have em round up the man who has
got that one thirty-seven ticket

   and when you want me ill be within
a hundred yards of this spot henry
barked in conclusion and turned his own
back and strode away

  he was very near the boiling-point
teeth gritting he headed for one of the
big maples beyond the zone of activity
and such was his expression that while
many gaped after henry none followed
him

  there was a seat running around the
lower part of that tree-just the sort of seat
upon which one might settle for a struggle
back to that resignation which should be the
part of a slave it was going to be a strug-
gle too after that last blow and-

   hey there wait a minute wait
just a minute the judge called trotting
after him

  i what

   weve found him he just turned up
mr baird here is the man youre going to
work for

henry stopped with an ungracious grunt
 he was away off at the far end of the
grounds and only just now heard what was
up the iudge explained further  no

theres no doubt about this ticket i looked
at it myself and then gave him your pledge
its his all right and you wont be so badly
off with a feller like him here he comes

  so henry turned without much inter-
est and henry started slightly for there
was something tremendously familiar about
that well-dressed figure with the jaunty
cloth hat pulled down over his eyes yes
and he knew the aggressive check of that
suit too plain horror parted henrys lips
he could not-he would not- believe

  but within a bare two seconds full belief
was henrys nevertheless the oncomer
looked up very sharply from the remark-
able pledge he had been reading as he
walked as if a stone wall had risen in his
path he stopped short his rather un-
pleasant and arrogant and heavily browed
dark eyes opened wide and he stared in-
credulously

  and henry was face to face with his old
friend and enemy mr joseph plant than
whom he detested more cordially few people
on earth

chapter xi

bound out

it must have been-yes it had been-
almost a year since their last meeting
the scene flashed upon henry much as
scenes hash upon the mind of a drowning
man unconsciously he shut his teeth and
straightened up rather resembling a cour-
ageous gentleman upon whom the firing-
squad has already trained its muzzles that
last meeting had been a silly affair striking
him as humorous at the time but in the last
five seconds all humor had faded from the
memory-for henry rather fancied that he
knew joe plant

  henry on that memorable occasion had
been engaged to miss evelyn bond for a
matter of three weeks it is to be presumed
that miss bond had told her fiance the
details of her flitting cyclonic affair with
henry baird-from which happily enough
both had made a quick scarless recovery
it is certain at any rate that mr plant
suspected all and that had he been three
inches taller and a matter of forty pounds
his word

of honor



heavier and an athletic person to boot he
might have tried thrashing henry for the
mere satisfaction such a course would have
afforded his rather mean and self-centered
and possibly even somewhat stupid nature

  being merely himself joseph had looked
up that day from the corner of a deserted
club writing-room where he had apparent-
ly been thinking dark and jealous thoughts
to find that henry baird had wandered in
and for no reason save that it suited his
unlovely mood he had risen impulsively
and spoken freely to henry to the general
effect that hereafter all spaces occupied by
miss bond or by himself would constitute
a barred zone for henry baird

  the speech itself and its unexpectedness
had dumfounded henry for a moment and
when it had reached a lame end with the
dwindling of joes temper he had thought
of no more fitting answer than to snap his
fingers at joe plant in majestic unsmiling
silence

  nor had this simple move been without
its swift and splendid results for joe had
colored to an apoplectic tint had trembled
with rage suppressed and quite melo-
dramatically had muttered something about
repaying henry for that snap sooner or
later after which henry had snapped the
fingers loudly just once more and then
had turned and slowly walked away

  oh yes it had been downright comical
at the time henry recalled chuckling over
it several times that evening he did not
chuckle now he merely looked at joseph
plant and waited-and after a tense fifteen
seconds or so hope darted up in henry

   it was remotely possible of course that
matrimony had smoothed out some of the
rough spots in josephs nature and that he
was contemplating nothing hideous in-
deed now that the first shock was over it
seemed to henry that joe looked quite like
an ordinary human being this late after-
noon he was still staring at the self-
offered slave but there was a faint grin
about his mouth

   hello henry he said mildly

   how do you do joe henry re-
sponded thickly

  know one another hey thejudge
cried

   oh yes weve known one another for
a good many years said mr plant  is
this-er-is this all fact henry

    it is henry said stiffly

   youre pledging yourself for two weeks
to the holder of this ticket

   the details are all written into that
little document you hold in your hand

   yes but theyre so darned amazing and
unusual henry that it takes time to grasp
them mused joseph as he studied it again
  and to the completion of this contract
in every detail herein written or otherwise
implied i hereby pledge my solemn word of
honor thats decidedly broad

    it is

    and distinctly binding

    absolutely so

  joseph laughed shortly-there was some-
thing almost friendly in that laugh too-
and tucked the paper into his pocket he
glanced at the interested throng and at
judge grayson

   all right mr-whatever your name is
thank you for turning him over to me and
all that it isnt necessary for us to perform
for the crowd here i take it lets get out
of this mob henry

  he laid a hand on henrys arm and
headed away and a faint little sigh flut-
tered inaudibly from henrys lips he
hardly dared permit himself expect it but
the suspicion would not down that joe was
about to heap coals of fire on his head
since he could not very well use a henry
baird he would release him even now
henry and his twenty dollars might make
rockridge that evening

    well this said joseph  is indeed a
funny stunt 

   i got myself into it there was no
other way of getting out of it

   hen were you really unable to make
good when your car burned youre-er-
broke-so far as readv cash is concerned
 yes

   well well well muttered mr plant
and kept on moving toward the far end of
the ground where cars upon cars were
parked

   how on earth did you come here
henry asked  youre not staying in new
bingham


all-story weekly

  eh joseph roused from a brief fit
of abstraction no of course not i
just ran in for some stuff and i came in
here for the fun of the thing an hour ago

i-

  his voice drifted off again as they
walked they were down by the cars now
in fact they were beside joseph plants own
heavy and handsome vehicle-and still jo-
seph had not revealed his supply of flaming
coals frowning meditatively he arranged
several parcels in the rear of the car he
paused again staring at them and then he
turned upon henry a perfect impersonal
gaze

   well its a queer arrangement-this
thing of buying a slave in these days-but
i can use you henry said he

   ah henry said quite sharply

   around the place you know helps
hard to get up this way and ive been
working overtime myself mr plant add-
ed in the most utterly matter-of-fact way
and took no whistling

  he had simply accepted the thing as it
stood henry after that first start shut
his lips and sighed again-differently this
time

  joseph stepped into his car and sat down
on the right-hand side

   somebody said that your trunk was
down there hen he vawned

   yes

   better drive down there first and put
it aboard if you will then well start for
home

  he lighted a cigarette without the for-
mality of offering one to henry baird he
leaned back comfortably and frowned at
his reflection in the wind-shield while
henry started the car and steered it down
to the spot where still reposed his shiny
little trunk

  small boys clustered around to help him
as he lifted it to the iron rack at the rear
of josephs car and tightened the straps
then possibly the most remarkable stranger
new bingham had ever known wheeled
about rolled through the gate and into the
street with a resigned

   which way joe

   go up to the end of the street here
and take the dirt road to the left hen

said mr plant  its as good as state
road and shorter

  he crossed his legs and took to humming
while henry piloted the car to the end of
the street and then up the pretty country
road to the left apparently he did not
choose to converse with his prize just then
and henry was as well satisfied being him-
self rather deep in thought

  what was ahead of him a sojourn at
the house plant had taken for the summer
somewhere over tolver way near the new
york state line of course-and a rather
ridiculous sojourn too still the sort of
place that plant would naturally take would
be far removed from congenial people and
plant himself attracted no wide circle of
friends privacy at least would be henrys
and freedom from a lot of gaping idiots
there was a lot to be thankful for in that

  he essayed a sidelong glance at mr
plant never it seemed to henry had
civilization produced a more utterly stupid
self-centered profile than that one an-
other man gifted with imagination would
have been quick with the various possibili-
ties of the situation plant was not simply
because it was not in him to be henry
grunted and gave her more gas

   i say henry plant said

   yep henry muttered toward his
owner

   this-this slave notion its rather
queer-it sounds odd as the very devil
people arent likely to understand

   im not going to advertise it believe
me henry said grimly

   no naturally not im not keen to
be known as a slave-winner glad as i am
to have you just now plant went on quite
earnestly  suppose we drop that into the
silences as it were people from new
bingham dont come over our way twice a
year there isnt one chance in a dozen of
anybodv carrying the news of the fair

   well

   well say-youll say-that youre
working for me and go no farther with
explanations its quite true anyway
youll simply not mention the truth under
any circumstances

   im willing henry said with a dry
smile
his word of honor



   thats a pledge then mr plant con-
cluded

   thats a pledge henry agreed care-
lessly

   shake on it said joseph plant

   thats not necessary when i make a
pledge henry grinned as he shook

   i know that henry his owner smiled
and nodded

  then he fell silent again and the beau-
tiful car hummed on while henry shook
his head once or twice and reflected further
upon the queer things that can happen to
a man who has been selected by queer
things as good ground for their happening

  still-what of it all joe plant was
actually rather decent he was far more
decent than henry ever would have dared
hope could he have foreseen this weird sit-
uation he had some sense of shame too
which was encouraging he shrank from
giving publicity to the fact that he was
using bound-out labor as it were at a
dollar a week henry grinned again and
joe

   yes mr plant said and although it
may have been pure fancy there seemed
to be a new note in that single word-a
haughty note a note of asperity or of some-
thing or other which had not been there
before

   what am i going to do in the way of
work turn butler

   butler no of course not

   id make a crackerjack butler joe

   i have stark fathers old butler mr
plant said shortly

   ah yes henry pursued rather airily
 nevertheless joe i feel that-

   hold on joseph said so sharply that
henry stared  ive been thinking you
know and im afraid that we shall have
to reach a little better understanding this
thing isnt a joke

   no joe sighed henry

   a considerably better understanding
his owner corrected  whatever our rela-
tion or social station or anything else may
have been hitherto youre working for me
now

   yes joe

   not  joe please just make that
 mr plant  hereafter

   eh

   i said mr plant joseph repeated
coldly  it sounds rather better baird
nor was he jesting he looked henry
straight in the eye and henry nodded

   all right let it go at that he said
stiffly

   i think  all right sir is nearer to it
said mr plant  dont misunderstand
me baird im not trying to take any un-
due advantage of you ive simply been
revising my ideas to fit the present situa-
tion and i think i see things quite clearly
now

   joe-

   i think youve bound yourself to obey
orders without question mr plant said
very sharply indeed

  yes 

   then i order you to address me either
as mr plant or sir-if you cant be made
to understand by any gentler means now
as to the work youre to do you were
asking me about that a moment ago you
will be the hired man baird

  henry drew a deep breath

   just-just what does the hired man do
around your place

   the hired man on my place does what
he is told to do whatever that may be
plant said crisply  looks after this car-
drives-cleans up generally-takes care of
the ashes and all that sort of thing-cuts
grass-trims hedges-does odd carpentering
jobs youre something of a mechanic i
believe baird

   something henry agreed grimly
 do you have much trouble in keeping a
hired man-sir

   i shall have no trouble at all in keeping
this one baird mr plant said with some
serenity  ones word of honor is ones
word of honor whether one happens to be
president or merely a hired man

   it is said henry

   yes i know it is baird said mr
plant even more serenely and selected an-
other cigarette

  followed another space of silence while
the car bowled merrily along the pretty
lonely back road and henry pondered
afresh he had apparently been wrong
after all joe plant had no idea of neglect-


all-story weekly

ing the situations possibilities he had al-
ready begun the process of taking it out of
henry as it were or-had he were
not these later details perhaps merely so
many manifestations of the persons innate
meanness henry was rather inclined to
think so just then

  gloomily he studied the narrow road
ahead and wondered when and where they
were to turn off he was none too familiar
with routes in just this region but in the
nature of things they would have to head
west pretty shortly if they meant to strike
the tolver neighborhood

  ah yes and there was the crossroads
now pleasantly smooth and wide after
this rather rutty stretch there was the state
road and henry with a toot of his horn
slowed down and swung slowly toward the
left

   hey stop where on earth do you
think youre going mr plant cried
testily

  the car stopped with a jerk its front
wheels on the state road

  henry stared at his owner

   home i suppose he said with no
undue humility  where are we going

   to the nook of course

   what nook

  mr plant gazed at henry with that pa-
tient forbearance one must now and then
feel for a really stupid employee

   my uncle edwards country place-
the nook-the house he never uses-the
nook he explained

   i got the nook part of it before henry
snapped  where the dickens is this par-
ticular nook

   at rockridge of course said mr
plant

   where gasped his slave

   at rockridge massachusetts eight or
nine miles ahead rockridge good lord
baird dont gape at me in that imbecile
fashion youve heard of rockridge at
least

  yes i-i believe t have heard of it
henry confessed hoarsely

   well my place is on the west hill as
they call it theres the big white house
seven or eight hundred feet back from the
road-the philip darrow place-and-

   yes henry said  yes

   well the nook is the next house of
course mr plant snapped  turn to the
right baird go on

chapter xii

to the goal

one unfortunate thing about human-
itys eternal pursuit of happiness is
the frequency with which the craved
objective coming into sight diminishes in
value as a case in point henry baird
had been straining every nerve to get to
rockridge and mabel darrow hardly more
than an hour ago he had been gloating over
the rather dubious somewhat absurd pros-
pect of living up the last penny of his
twenty dollars in sight of mabel that had
been henrys idea of happiness

  yet now he was making straight for
rockridge with the certainty of staying
next door to mabel-not for a few hours
but for two weeks at least and that without
a penny of expense-and so oddly is hu-
man nature constituted henry was not
happy at all

   never anxious to pose as a heroic figure
perhaps and certainly not ashamed to be
caught at work there was nevertheless
something about the idea of mabel dis-
covering him as the plant hired man that
sent a blazing flush to henrys face-and
then a pallor as cold chills ran through
him-and then another flush he won-
dered feverishly if plant knew just what
kind of torture he was inflicting he stole
another glance at him and found some
small comfort plant did not that un-
pleasant countenance with its too thick lips
and its shoe-brush mustache and its stub-
by pugnacious nose was not one to conceal
the sort of ghoulish triumph plant must
have felt had he suspected the truth

  but he did not suspect the truth of
course that was one thing henry had
overlooked thanks to the tremendous
reticence that had come upon him in this
connection only one soul in the world knew
of his passion for mabel darrow-himself

  nevertheless gloom thickened around
henry very likely they did a good deal
his word of honor



of visiting back and forth at the most
it could be no more than a matter of a
day or two before mabel learned of his
presence after that it seemed to henry
he would have to keep an eagle eye open
that he might disappear before she actually
saw him

  he groaned faintly as he gazed steadily
at the state road ahead he caught mr
plant smiling enigmatically and turned sud-
denly with an expectant grin of his own
actually with some idea of asking point-
blank if it wasnt all a joke of josephs
and mr plant ceased smiling and frowned
at him with

   keep your eyes on the road will you
baird im not anxious to be smashed or
ditched

    all right

   and another thing baird if i read that
smile of yours correctly just now mr
plant said earnestly and rather uncannily
 im afraid that you dont understand
even now that were not-well friends on
the same level if i must put it that way
weve been acquainted for a good many
years of course and weve moved in much
the same circles but thats all done with
now-yes because of your unfortunate cir-
cumstances if again i must put it that
way im not trying to play with you baird
in any sense but youre simply the hired
man now he stared steadily at henry
you take my meaning im sure

   i take it henry said grimly

   drive on baird mr plant ordered
complacently  speed up a bit too you
might its getting late

  so henry speeded up a bit and not more
cheerfully he had had his answer it was
no merry trick of joseph plants it was
just plain cold fact henry had been ac-
cepted as the hired man not that it would
have mattered a particle you understand
had plant been say the scrawny farmer
person who at one time seemed to have
won henry for such a master henry would
have worked and grinned cheerfully even
from five in the morning to ten at night
accepting his fate and not bothering even to
feel resigned

  but that this creature this joe plant
with the soul of a rat and-well there was

no use fuming over it henry speeded up
some more in the hope of scaring joseph
and failed completely

  the beautiful country grew more beauti-
ful in the young twilight comfortable
little mountains piled up ahead and the
grades were getting steeper denoting their
approach to rockridge as henry recalled
from a former trip when rockridge had
been nothing but the name of a place

  here was the little country store and
post-office at the crossroads and the garage
and the drug-store and ice-cream parlor
which with the dozen houses scattered
around them constituted the business sec-
tion of rockridge proper the exclusive
colony was spread widely over the hills be-
yond when one passed this next curve it
seemed to henry one found the country
club and the links far off to the right yes
one did because they were there one also
met handsome cars occasionally driven by
liveried chauffeurs and occupied by well-
dressed people and in passing these henry
shrank down beneath his hat until he could
just see the road beyond the edge of its
brim

  and now they were climbing again in the
wilder section with the trees growing thick-
er and only the gateway to a drive here
and there to indicate dwellings and-
yes that huge white place on the hill
far ahead with velvety meadows stretching
away in this direction-that must be ma-
bels home that-

   i said in here baird plant seemed
to be shouting quite excitedly although
henry had not heard before

   what barked the hired man

   in there now joseph said disgusted-
ly  youll have to back up its too nar-
row here for a turn yes right up that
drive naturally cant you see the nook
on the posts

  i see it now henry muttered as he
obeyed

  lips compressed breathing quite heavily
he headed up the rustic way some time
soon he fancied joseph would use just that
tone-and then be forced to send hurriedly
for a doctor but for the moment come
to think of it his scowl was admitting alto-
gether too much suffering

  henry smiled suddenly and with a ghast-
ly calm in another minute he bade fair
to come face to face with evelyn plant
who had loved him for full forty-eight hours
once upon a time and while he no longer
entertained a tenderness for the lady it
was beyond thought that she could be al-
lowed to see the mental stress put upon
henry baird by the creature she had mar-
ried henry smiled even more wonderfully
as he contemplated the nook

  it was a pretty house if one had to ad-
mit it big and rambling and comfortable
it had been built by some one who leaned
to rough logs and rustic effects soft lights
shone here and there from the windows
henry caught the faint sound of the piano
sending forth the tinkling wandering sort
of music that evelyn affected henry
sighed too it would have been a nice
kind of place to visit here next door to
mabel darrow

   stop at the door joseph ordered
crisply

  henry stopped at the door and stepped
down

    would you like me to assist you out-
sir he asked grimly

   what no said mr plant  you
might get out those packages baird

  his expression was curiously tense and
eager just now as if much suppressed emo-
tion surged about in the plant interior he
stared at the doorway expectantly and al-
though the piano continued to tinkle the
door did open and there hurried forth the
person whom henry identified as the butler

  he was not an attractive butler by any
means although probably in the earlier
sixties he gave one the first impression of
having passed the century mark he was
small and spare and slightly stooped a
patch of long thin gray hair was plastered
down carefully over a cranium otherwise
bald but it was the face itself that caught
and held henrys attention for a little
lean to a degree hooked of nose with a
pair of sharp gray eyes that peered sus-
piciously at one as the head bent forward
it was not so much the countenance of a
man as that of an elderly particularly wary
hawk

  now though he was smiling-if that

pained reluctant expression was meant for
a smile now he was hurrying to henry
and saying  good evening mr joe sir
 good evening stark joseph said
stark opened the rear door of the car
hurriedly and fussily

   the east guest-chamber of course
sir he mumbled toward joseph  ill get
the trunk out and up there sir and-

   leave the trunk just as it is baird
will take it out

   i beg pardon sir said the butler and
peered at henry again

   this isnt a guest stark plant said
smoothly  this is my new hired man
baird taking joness place of course
hell attend to his trunk himself he will
have the room over the garage

  still stark peered at henry then he
cupped a hand around his ear and came
closer to mr plant

   excuse me mr joe he said  im
getting a bit hard of hearing im afraid
what did you say about this gentleman
u hes the new man of all work on the
place-the hired man i just brought him
from new bingham

  and still stark peered at henry baird
but his expression was changing rapidly
the smile had faded out altogether the
corners of his mouth pointed straight down
as before the gimlet eyes narrowed and
focused presumably on henrys soul then
a start ran through the aged butler and he
looked at mr plant

   i beg pardon mr joe he said flatly
 but this is no hired man

   he is though plant laughed  take
in those packages stark and say to mrs
plant that ill be in for dinner directly

    will in a moment sir stark said
firmly  but youll have to excuse me mr
joe for telling you this is no hired man
ive seen and handled help all my life and
this aint one of em sir youd best send
him off again sir

    ill keep him for a week or two jo-
seph said comfortably and smiled kindly
tolerance at his butler

    youll regret it if you do sr if i might
make so bold as to say so stark said stub-
bornly  youll pardon me mr joe for
speaking freely but  was buttling for your
his word of honor



father a matter of eight or ten years before
you were born and im older than you
are

   i dont doubt for an instant that this
person tells a plausible story you were
always an innocent boy mr joe and easy
imposed on with a hard-luck story your
heart being so soft and tender but theres
fine-looking people like this one that just
makes a business of getting into houses for
purposes of their own the silver mr joe
-or worse you understand sir

  joseph shaded a yawn and glanced at
the house-the piano had ceased tinkling

   this chaps honest enough i fancy
he said carelessly

  the aged mouth tightened to a thin
curved line

   ill say no more mr joe the butler
stated  youll learn for yourself sir
you were always like that

  he gathered up the packages and shuf-
fled into the house pausing only an instant
for a final look at henry and a final shake
of his head

  joseph smiled and shrugged his shoul-
ders

   you didnt make much of an impression
on stark he observed

  is it part of our contract that im to
make him fall in love with me

   possibly not but i wouldnt antagonize
him nevertheless youll be more or less
closely associated for a while you know
youll-er-eat together i believe

   hey escaped henry

   im not quite certain about that but i
believe stark permits the man of all work
to take his meals with the cook and the
two maids my last chauffeur when i was
able to get one was persona grata out there
oh yes youll probably qualify

  henry swallowed the thing in his throat
   wheres my room he asked briefly

   right over the garage baird youll
have no trouble finding it when you put up
the car you-ah evelyn

  he hurried forward in the gathering dusk
to her who had been evelyn bond for most
of her life and evelyn plant these last four
or five months he kissed her and evelyn
slipped an arm about his neck and hugged
her husband while henry drummed out a

little tune on the front mud-guard and
waited for whatever was coming

  she was as pretty as ever in her little
evening gown if one fancied that kind of
dark rather languishing prettiness she
held a fixed conviction of course that no
male could look at her without becoming
infatuated and she was a rather daring
and romantic soul in her own way and-
ah she had sighted henry

  forward she came suddenly with both
hands outstretched and her eyes sparkling
their amazement and pleasure

   why henry baird cried mrs plant
 and you never said a word about bring-
ing him joe or-

  pst joseph said sharply just a
moment evelyn it isnt necessary to
shake hands with him 

   it-what joe evelyn cried stayed
by sheer astonishment

   i said that it isnt really necessary to
shake hands with baird my dear in fact
id rather you wouldnt i think one
doesnt do that sort of thing

   but of course one does  mrs plant
laughed in some bewilderment and started
toward henry again

   but of course one doesnt her hus-
band corrected and caught her  you
dont understand of course evelyn baird
is not my guest hes working for me
evelyn stared from one of them to the
other  hes doing what

   working here for me as my hired
man plant pursued slowly and distinctly
 no it isnt a joke by any means i
found him in new bingham rather-er-
strapped for funds eh baird

   rather henry agreed grimly

   and-er-looking for work in a way
eh baird

   in a way henry assented

   so we struck a little bargain and not
having any particular choice in the matter
anyway i fancy baird decided to come on
here and be our man of all work and
that is really all there is to it the room
over the garage baird shall we go in my
dear

  evelyns full astounded lips were parted
 hes not going to live over the garage
joe


all-story weekly

   our last man found it very comfortable
 believe

   but-but henry baird no i dont
understand it and i dont care whats hap-
pened to him its perfectly ridiculous
why we have the east chamber and the one
on the other corner of the house joe
and-

   and those are kept for our guests eve-
lyn in the morning baird you will wash
the car get at it as early as possible for
mrs plant may wish to ride be sure to
finish with that polish in the red can too
by the way its something the chauffeur
chap i had recommended very highly

  he gazed steadily stonily at henry
joe said his wife ill not per-
mit-

   my dear said joseph  you will per-
mit me to handle the male servants of the
place if you please of course it may
strike you as a bit unusual to find a person
like baird-or like baird used to be-in-
er-a menial capacity although that didnt
occur to me when i engaged him the
simple fact is that every man sooner or
later finds his true level according to his
merits-and baird has found his in working
for me so if i may settle the details as
to his quarters and duties-

  he faced her steadily with affection of
course but also with obviously tried pa-
tience and a good deal of plain authority
it appeared that he was waiting for a grace-
ful submissive bending of the wifely will
which it seemed to henry was rather a
foolish thing to expect from a lady of eve-
lyns temper and spirit

   well i dont understand it at all she
said curtly if this is a practical joke i
think youre both very stupid indeed-and
if it isnt i think youre cruel and very ab-
surd joe

  and thereupon she turned and stepped
into the house closing the door after her
joseph plant did not follow immediately
instead he sauntered to henry baird in
the gloaming and with a deal of cool ef-
frontery looked him up and down and
yawned henry smiled sourly

  see here he said with some force
 im willing to pose as the simple hired
man before the general public but you

mean to explain the truth of the thing to

evelyn dont you

    why should i asked plant languidly
 what because we have known each
other for a great many years of course i
have no objection to working joe thats
what i started out to do i have a lot of
objection however to letting you deliber-
ately make an idiot of me

  mr plant gazed blandly densely at him
 i fail to see how that view bears on
the case he murmured

   does that you mean youre going to let
her think that i was reduced to a point
where i-where i just went to work for you
gladly

   i have no idea of explaining if thats
what youre saying

 then ill do it myself said henry

   oh will you really smiled joseph
 i had some idea that you were pledged
hard and fast to silence as to the actual
facts it seemed to me baird that you
had given me your word to call yourself the
hired man here and let it go at that

  he gazed on while henrys color rose
and henrys breathing quickened henrys
clenched fists rested upon his hips and he
glared at joseph plant

   say was -was i just tricked into that
promise he demanded  have you got
more intelligence after all than i gave you
credit for

   no end more baird said mr plant
 no end more

  and then suddenly his teeth bared in a
smile that was almost hideous his mean
eyes contracted even the corners of his
nose crinkled in the excess of satisfaction
that was joseph plants just then

   youll snap your fingers in my face
eh he snarled triumphantly at henry
baird  youll snap your fingers in my
face will you

chapter xiii

at the nook

there is no good purpose to be served
by dwelling at length on the harrow-
ing details cf henrys first evening at
rockridge some of them were agonizing
his word of honor



some of them were pitiful if not actually
shameful

  as to that matter of his hunger for
one thing henry was healthy from top to
toe meal-time may not have been an event
for him but it was inevitably a definite and
necessary pause hence after two solid
hours in the sufficiently comfortable room
over the garage sitting on the edge of the
bed with hands clasped and the lonely in-
candescent dangling overhead henry found
that his mind had shelved automatically all
other considerations and was handling the
food problem alone

  he had but to close his eyes to see tables
glittering with silver and glass and steaming
viands and a roast turkey and-although
he had sworn by a variety of unrecognized
gods never to taste food in joseph plants
accursed servants dining-room and that
not an hour back

  still he could not well live through two
weeks without food perhaps indeed it
was plants low purpose to play upon his
pride and watch him starve slowly to death
henry rose suddenly and really making no
noise at all trod to the rear of the house
the piano was tinkling again at the front

  his entrance seemed to startle the aged
butler who was alone in the kitchen si-
lently he heard henrys barked request for
food silently he produced food and spread
it nicely enough on the kitchen-table
then without comment stark settled
grimly in a chair across the kitchen folded
his arms and watched henry with hawk
eyes while he ate-now grudgingly conced-
ing to himself the quality of the stuff now
hurrying for a space with nervous eyes
upon the farther door lest evelyn herself
appear

  still when it was over when without a
comment of his own he had risen and
marched straight back to his little room
over the garage he did feel rather saner
he sat down again upon the bed to think
and again he began tc travel the same old
circle round which he had whirled for the
other two hours

  either he himself or whitmore terral
had been perfectly accurate either his per-
sonal streak of hard luck was still with
him or it was all due to his genius for the

wrong thing although what wrong thing
had he done this time could he have re-
recalled whitmore and the money no
because that would have meant the cer-
tainty of larkins promised explosion and
the exposure of his poverty to tilbury 
tilbury

  should he have folded his arms and de-
fied them back there at new bingham
once his car had burned and he found him-
self unable to refund not that decidedly
for one thing the defi would have ended
in the local jail and small blame to the
outraged citizens who did the ghastly thing
for another a stand of that kind would
have reduced henry baird to the level of
the common cheap swindler-there was no
escaping that even if he hadnt kindled his
own car

  no if he had done one wrong thing it
was in the wording of his really remarkable
pledge of servitude at the moment much
emotion had possessed henry baird of
course his one desire had been to bind
himself so visibly so thoroughly that even
the rather skeptical judge could take no
exception and while he had certainly ac-
complished that a cooler and more pro-
longed consideration of the matter would
have ended in a less sweeping although no
less binding pledge

  still that was all ancient history now
was it not the pledge itself reposed in
plants pocket and more unfortunately in
plants ugly head henry sighed after an-
other long period of vain meditation and
turned out his light to walk to the far
window and gaze up-hill far away up
there was a single illuminated window-
mabels own perhaps pie gazed on and
sighed more heavily he turned away with
a sigh of blank wonder even now at the
manner in which he had reached rock-
ridge

  scowling he crossed the room and gazed
at plants infernal nook the lights were
all out there the piano had ceased tinkling
a long w-hile ago the trees were stirring
softly and drowsily in the night wind
henry yawned there was the faintest
sleepiest little twittering up there in one
of them too henry listening yawned
again tremendously


all-story weekly

  after the city din the quiet of the coun-
try always lulled him like a drug so
henry shuffling back to his bed wound his
watch in the darkness and laid it on the
shiny little trunk

  joseph had not ordered him roused at
dawn anyway he concluded as he blinked
at the beams above his head

  the sun was rather high for a hired mans
awakening he swung to his feet and
stretched he whistled as he made for the
crude little bath-room and started the icy
water in the tin tub he peered at the xook
through the curtains and laughed aloud
sleep had done wonders for henry

  last night this queer adventure had been
a serious affair it was nothing of the kind
this morning xot that he pulsed with joy-
ful anticipation as he looked forward to the
next two weeks to be sure but he was
going through with them with a laugh all
the same

  if it was joseph plants intention to make
him suffer joseph was doomed to disap-
pointment henry was powerful to a de-
gree and there were few odd jobs about
a place like this likely to weary him to any
extent while the outdoor exercise was
bound to benefit him and if it was humilia-
tion that joseph sought to inflict his
chances of success were even smaller for
humiliation is a mere state of mind and
one in this case which henry calmly de-
clined to entertain

  hence he whistled still as he strolled into
the bright morning he whistled into
starks very face as that aged and close-
lipped individual piloted him into a pantry
off the kitchen where his breakfast was laid
upon a little table henry ceased whistling
and smiled rather thankfully

   i dont eat with the other toilers eh
he mused

   you dont stark said pleasantly  it
aint me or the cook were old enough to
take your measure and make no mistake in
you however you wheedled yourself in here
but youll do no charming of the two young
girls and getting information out of them
or the like of that you know ill have an
eye on here while youre in here

   im perfectly willing to take your word
for it henry said mildly

   dont snoop then and when youve
finished go out the way you came the
butler concluded

  joseph plant was loitering outside when
henry emerged one sharp glance he di-
rected upon the victim then josephs coun-
tenance grew stony and unimpassioned as
any statues

   better get into your working-clothes at
once baird he suggested

   yes sir what are they and where are
they henry beamed

   theyre overalls of course and youll
find them hanging in the garage at the
back wash the car first then i want
that tiled pavement in front of the veranda
thorough cleaned up take the mop and
the pail from the garage

  i yes sir clicked happily from henry
and then what shall  do sir
involuntarily mr plant squinted again
at him for an instant

   ill tell you that when youve finished
the tiles you seem quite contented this
morning baird

   oh yes sir im always happy and
contented when ive plenty to do sir i
think thats the way with most people sir
dont you leave em idle and they get
into mischief i always say give em
plenty of hard work and theyre bound to
be happy

  this time his smile at joseph was almost
a leer and joseph flushed just a shade and
himself sneered smilingly

   well youll just bubble over with joy
before im done with you baird because
ill hand you all the hard work on the
place and one thing more baird

   yes sir said henry and touched his
forehead respectfully

   this isnt play

   indeed it is not sir hard work is
never play sir

  he inclined his head very gravely and
joseph since he was only joseph after all
flushed another shade

   i mean to say that whatever-er-
whatever silly pose you choose to affect
this morning youll remember that you are
what you are baird and that youre bound
here by your word of honor joseph rapped
out
his word of honor



   indeed i wouldnt be likely to forget
anything as important as that sir

   youre bound here to do absolutely and
unquestioningly what i tell you and youll
stay here too dye understand youll
stay right on this property and not budge
one foot over the line without my personal
permission baird my personal permis-
sion get that

   your personal permission sir yes
sir i have that henry agreed solemnly
 was there anything else sir

   yes wash that damned car mr
plant cried and turned on his heel

chapter xiv

honest toil

quite happily then did henry
chuckle as he donned his overalls
rolled his sleeves high turned in his
collar and connected the hose in a small
way he seemed to retain a little advantage
over joseph doubtless in the course of
another day or two he would distover other
ways of stimulating that somewhat soggy
and egotistical brain to anger for the
present however he preferred to wash the
car and ponder upon mabel

  the sense of her nearness had grown tre-
mendously this morning she was over
there-right over there henry his task
finished leaned on the shining car and
gazed longingly through the thick trees be
his personal muddle what it might but for
that definite prohibition of josephs as to
leaving his property henry was inclined to
think that he might have cleaned up and
covertly slipped away across the fields for
half an hour even if only for one glimpse
of her at a distance

  it would never have done though
mabel might possibly understand but her
father- no it never would have done in
any case with that beastly pledge upon him
to say that he was working for plant and
go no further with his explanations

  rather abruptly henrys recent happi-
ness seemed to expire anger came in its
place and a flush considerably darker than
plants own he spoke freely and spite-
fully and quite awfully of mr plant to

    	a-s

the empty garage and then since that sort
of thing was absolutely futile he located
pail and mop and started for the house

  evelyn was alone on the veranda the
book dropped to her lap and she dimpled
quite bewitchingly at the sight of him

   good morning henry said evelyn

   good morning maam henry said
grimly  will these be the tiles that re
quire washing

  evelyn plant threw back her head and
laughed charmingly and with real amuse-
ment

 henry youre so ridiculous she cried
 yes maam henry said obediently
and dipped his mop  is there any special
way youd like these tiles washed maam
 no there isnt i dont want them
washed at all stop it and talk to me
henry shook his head

   im sorry maam i have orders from
the master to wash them he said

  he swished down the length of them-
and turned and swished back pausing to
survey the result for a moment evelyn
had ceased smiling now and lively curi-
osity was in her splendid dark eyes

   its a bet of course she said

   me doing this maam

   yes and dont talk like that henry
you sound-why you sound like a real
hired man 

   yes maam thats what i am sighed
the victim  no maam it isnt a bet
 honestly

   i never lie maam

  he essayed another swish of the mop
this time to find evelyn leaning farther
forward and watching intentfy the cu-
riosity was turning to plain wonder and
there was vague startled suspicion in her
gaze

   henry baird what are you doing
here she asked softly  tell me

  she glanced toward the house in the odd-
est fashion she sat up suddenly too for
the door was opening and slowly and im-
pressively mr plant himself was emerging
he carried a magazine and an unlighted
cigarette he paused at the edge of the
veranda and considered henrys work
critically and superciliously-and henry
understood this unquestionably was the

first of several big scenes mr plant had
planned for the consummation of his great
revenge

  yes that was just what was afoot
henry grinned rather contemptuously en-
deavored to flick a little water on joseph
plant and watched him seat himself in the
other wicker armchair

 youre doing well enough baird he
said kindly as he lighted his cigarette
 what were you asking baird evelyn
 how he comes to be here in this way
yon tell me

  mr plant smiled nastily and sent a thin
cloud of smoke toward the roof

   oh i dont know that it need be dis-
cussed again still there is no secret about
it of course baird is merely working here
for me

   yes but-why

   why do most people work my dear
said mr plant and raised his brows  he
found himself practically penniless and
forced to do something for a living i hap-
pened to be the first to avail myself qf his
valuable services thats really all evelyn
you might be a little more careful along
the edges baird

  and now incredulous still evelyn gazed
again at henry and again at joseph sud-
denly to cry  is it really-so

   painful of course everything consid-
ered but its really so mr plant mur-
mured as he picked up his magazine

  its true that henry is doing this be-
cause-because something has happened to
him and he has no-no money left

   ho none at all joseph sneered ab-
sently over his magazine

   henry is-is he fooling evelyn
demanded

   ho even ho ho i should say he
wasnt henry sighed no maam that
is

  evelyns eyes flashed

   and instead of inviting him here to rest
and get over-whatever it is that has hap-
pened to him-instead of lending him what
money he needs when you have plenty of
your own joe you let henry baird come
here and work as your hired man

   yes joseph conceded his whole at-
tention on the page  why not

   id be ashamed to sit there and admit
it mrs plant said hotly

  joseph smiled unpleasantly at the maga-
zine

   im not though he said meditatively
 in fact i think its rather decent of me
evelyn tough in a way to be sure-
but most of us gravitate to the job for
which were best fitted and stay there
too once weve found it appearances may
fool some of us for a little while but just
how much they matter in the long run-
 beg pardon sir said henry  youre
addressing me sir

   what rasped joseph plant

   the lady stepped inside a moment
back sir

  henrys winner cast a startled glance to-
ward the door henry smiled down at his
tiles

   beg pardon sir but you have a mas-
terful way with the women havent you
sir he said  you shows em their silly
ways like and gives em a good practical
view of the case thats the thing as i
always say sir treat em firm and-

   say that  do you baird mr plant
shouted with altogether undue heat  you
are not here to make comments 

   why im sure sir- henry began
mildly

   youre here to work and by gad
ill make you work joseph continued
 have you got that pavement washed
all right take back the pail and the mop
and then go out to the ice-house and cut
the days supply ill see that you do it
he bounced to his feet and slapped the
magazine to his chair quite viciously
viciously too did he follow upon henrys
very heels as he journeyed humming irri-
tatingly to the garage and then to the ice-
house viciously he smiled as henrys
powerful arms swung out a cake and he
ordered henry to put it aside and go on
digging until he reached the piece that
mr plant desired to use that day down
at the bottom of some four or five tons of
large cakes

  so that henry ever humming tugged
and pulled and shifted ice and shoveled
sawdust and ground cork until the beads
rolled from his forehead and pulled and
his word of honor



tugged further and eventually it must
be admitted his humming died out and his
mocking smile faded away

  it was not the work itself of course
it was the idea of joe plant standing there
and snapping his ridiculous orders henry
paused briefly as he extracted the last cake
and considered ending the whole affair by
wringing mr plants neck joseph hap-
pened to be glancing over his own outra-
geous pledge just then so that henry
groaned internally and dragged the young
floe to the kitchen

  at some remote antebellum time the
woodpile had toppled over mr plant
considering it with an easy smile when
henry returned decided that it must be
repiled this morning coolly and with no
abuse he insisted on a little more speed
too and suggested that henry possibly was
not strong enough for his job after all
causing henry to pause again and then drag
the harder at the logs

  the sun was high when he had finished
in the nature of things plant would have
to pause for luncheon pretty soon but it
seemed that he had no idea of permitting
henry to pause just then

   thats a fair enough job baird he
said evenly  youll trim the north hedge
next

   where is it henry asked grimly

   go right through the trees beyond the
garage pick up the shears on your way
i shall be down shortly to see how youre
getting on

  he pointed and waited for henry to go
and henry went his smile had left perma-
nently by this time he had fancied himself
strong enough to carry off the whole affair
with a laugh but he was beginning to doubt
his strength plants business connections
apparently needed none of his attention

he would be here day and night to hound
henry baird

  nor was he working out vengeance for
any mere finger-snapping alone as henry
realized more and more fully the mean
little thing that passed for a soul in joseph
plant was urging him on to repay henry
for ever having found favor in evelyns
eyes it was his happy purpose to drag
henry in the dirt before her back and
forth and back and forth

  henry paused at the hedge and laughed
wildly his teeth were grinding like mill-
stones his hands were twitching he bit
off the laugh and glared at the hedge as if
yearning to tear it up by the roots was
he capable of going through with two weeks
of it he gripped himself and stared at
the soft ground

  apparently he was -since he hrd no
choice in the matter if a mere ler con-
tract had existed between himself and
joseph he would have stepped across the
hedge then and there and started for free-
dom henry however had forged for him-
self bonds less palpable than air and rather
stronger than steel

  and yet-it was all so infernally absurd
not more absurd than the pledge he him-
self had given to the holder of ticket no
 of course but- henry listened it
was evident that joseph meant to watch
his every waking moment for steps were
approaching they were coming from the
other side of the hedge though he noted
now-soft quick steps accompanied by a
blithely whistled tune

  their owner was passing the two or three
larger bushes just below henry and then
their owner was by them and had stopped
short and henry found himself face to face
with the jaunty immaculate self-confident

the classiest love farce of the season

one honest teak

by robert shannon
in next weeks all-story
elex my advice to any young guy
just startin out in the well-known
world is to play persistence-to
win they is nothin like stayin with it-
whatever it is never say die get me
genius is one per cent brains or somethin
and ninety-nine per cent hard work-
though who wants to be a genius say
nothin and saw wood keep everlastinly
at it they is no such word as-but you
get the idea all that sorta stuff

  old stuff to be sure but ill say
they is somethin in it

  for instance-well look at me to be-
gin where most stories leave off no doubt
outa respect to the readers feelins i mar-
ries into the profession you know what
i mean they is only one regular honest-
to-goodness profession and which is the
theatrical

  ill admit that the time she marries me
the world is apparently in no great danger
of bein set on fire by the wifes abilities as
a actress but she has everythin-includ-
in the old ambish-and no doubt in time
she would of wrent far in fact just about
then she was considerin seein australia
first with a number three company

  but however that may be doubtless the
missus ruins a great career when she mar-
ries me she admits it herself and so do
i in fact here at last is one thing upon
which i and the missus agrees perfectly

except-well whose but that of course
is a mere detail

  at any rate as soon as i and the wife
settles down and begins livin happily or
thereabouts ever or occasionally after-
wards the missus begins it well at that
i guess it was only natural once this
here stage stuff gets into the blood its all
off the victim never recovers

  however in the wifes case it is inter-
estin to note as the guy says that the
disease breaks out in a brand-new form
i wouldnt say but the chances is they
wasnt nothin like it ever previously known
to science

  in a word the wife instead of makin
up her mind to return to the now foot-
lights with my consent of course-or
without it-instead of anythin like that
the missus breaks it gently to me where
she wishes i would break into the great
theatrical game myself can y beat it
and not only that but she adds that she
wont never rest satisfied until i have done
that same little thing

  and maybe you know what havin your
wife not never rest satisfied is like

  well of course i says she must be
crazy and who does she think i am its
a laugh but the wife says i dont get
her she knows perfectly well that i
havent got the brains nor the intelligence
nor the looks nor nothin to be a success
play persistence



as a actor-she agrees with me perfectly
what she means is she wants me to bust
into the dramatic world as a now pro-
ducer or say a manager-thats it-the
manager of a regular first-class theater
playin nothin but the very highest class
productions

  oh boy is that all i asks her she
says it is and whats more i neednt act
like she had asked me to perform the im-
possible because any guy even with no
more ability than i but with any kind of
ambition and now persistence could put
it over and she will certainly never rest
satisfied until i do

  well in a word i falls for it-for two
reasons in the first place  never  is a
good long time and besides though i
dont admit it to the wife i am perfectly
willin to be the manager of a first-class
theater playin nothin but the very highest
class productions as the missus says ill
say i am in fact i have been willin for
some time

  listen its a curious thing but-dye
know-when the missus pulls that mana-
ger stuff she hits on my one ambition
and if i do say it myself i dont know of
nobody which is more qualified to be the
manager of a regular first-class theater
than yours as ever

  of course i havent never worked at it
so to speak but ill tell the world fair if i
had saved every dollar which i have
blowed at the ticket offices i would now
own a little theater of my own on the
level they is nothin about the now show
business and which may be learned from
the front as the savin is which i dont
know and as for the rest-well ill ad-
mit freely that i dont know no more about
it than belasco not a thing

  still though i am certainly strong or
this manager thing somehow it hadnt
never occurred to me to do anythin about
it till-well until the missus says she wont
never rest satisfied till ive put it over
about then i gets right down to br ss tacks
and starts in to look the situation over

  and-well the upshot of it is at the
end of six months or so it begins to look
like in lookin the situation over i had
overlooked the situation anyways ill

  say i am still without a situation as the
manager of a regular first-class theater
playin nothin but the very highest class
productions

  in fact it would seem that every theater
in the world already has a manager and
every one of these managers is givin all
sorts of satisfaction and so of course no-
body need apply so it surely looks like
i am up against one tough proposition and
a fine large chance of becomin manager
of a regular first-class theater playin noth-
in but the very highest class productions

  in the mean time of course i reports
to the missus from time to time and she
continues to never rest satisfied right along
in fact ill say i never seen nobody rest
more unsatisfied for the same length of
time she is surely good at it and she
also continues to remark that if i had any
kind of ambition and now persistence it
would certainly seem as if i could land
somethin somewhere but of course if
i- am satisfied with the kind o work i am
doin now why very well but she tells
the world-and so forth and et cetera

   its a great life

  well things is only slightly worse than
i have described them when one mornin
the missus beats me to the paper and
after givin the days bargains the once-
over and passin up the war news at a
glance she turns to the dramatic news
and-

  jim listen she fires at me
 thevs gonna be a new theater in town

   what dye know about that i says
 where

   corner of- main and russell she says
 and theyre startin construction to-
day

   i know the place i says  i wonder
is it gonna be a regular first-class theater
playin nothin but the very highest class
productions whos puttin it up

   it doesnt say she says  it says
the owners name has not been now di-
vulged

   whatever that is i says  so
theyre keepin it dark eh well believe
me im gonna look into this little thing
its the chance of a lifetime the only
theater in the world without a manager


all-story weekly

of course it aint built yet but opportunity
waits for no-

   heres your hat says the missus

  i grabs the hat and takes it on the lam
for the corner of main and russell a
construction company has put up its sign
on the premises and they is a bunch of
wops with a irish boss startin to break
ground i asks the boss does he knew
where the moneys cornin from and he
says sure from the construction company

  i notes the address and beats it for there
arrivin there i cross-examine a officer of
the company and he says i can search him
who is the owner and proprietor of this
here new theater-the deal is bein handled
by a firm of lawyers

  i	gets these law-sharks address and
makes it in nothin and in about one and
a half minutes they gives me the gate in-
cludin no information of any kind

  can y beat it the chance of my
young life to get right in on the ground
floor of this here brand-new theatrical pro-
ject and grab off that managers job and
not a thing stirrin ill say it would cer-
tainly worse than baffle you

  but anyways leavin the law joint by
request as you might almost say i steers
for my own place of business in the mean
time wonderin what will i tell the missus
because now if ever she certainly has
somethin to rest good and unsatisfied
about and pullin a lot of other deep stun
all of which gets me nowheres pretty
soon i seen a mob gathered in front of a
newspaper buildin and so i figure where
they is some big news from the front and
they have put out a bulletin and so i
crosses the street to see whats doin

  well they is such a crowd that nobody
except the front rows can read the news
and the rest of the bunch like always is
all tryin to push through to where they
can see somethin and so-well i seen
where they wasnt no use of trvin to find
out what its all about and besides it will
all be in the paper later on and so i am on
the point of leavin when somethin starts

  it seems somebody has been pushed and
now resented it out loud and one word
leadin to another a ring forms itself
around the now principals and the war is

on i changes my mind about leavin and
immediately goes to the front it looks
like they is somethin gonna come off that
is right in my line of business

  and somethin did at that i would of
missed it if i had been one second later in
arrivin at the ringside because this here
brawl is surely one of the shortest on
record in fact it consists of one blow
which is delivered by a little guy that is
clearly a now legitimate lightweight and
received by a human box-car a guy that
could give the well-known heavy-weight
champion fifty pounds and shade him by
a hundred and which immediately kisses
the pavement and lays there dead to the
universe

  oh boy exclaims a innocent by-
stander  considerable punch 

   nine ten and-battlin jack-the-
giant-killer wins by the well-known k o
route i announces

  and whilst the winner stands there nurs-
in his mitt and surveyin his deadly work
with a air of now surprise i advances
and layin a hand upon his shoulder i
says

   just a moment please i would have 
a word with you lets-

   whats this he bristles  a pinch

   be calm camilla i hastens to assure
him  it is nothin of the sort its busi-
ness

  what-say he says lookin at his
victim which is now beginnin to exhibit
signs of slowly returnin health  whats
the matter with that guy

   whats-you hit him  informs him

   yeh he admits  but is that all
all i exclaim all believe me
kid it was enough and ill tell the world
fair boy if you got a few more of them
dreamland things left in your system and
if youll listen to me youre gonna be not
only rich but famous

  because-well of course y understand
a guy has gotta live and so whilst awaitin
the opportunity to crash into the old dra-
matic league as manager of a regular first-
class theater and so on i am still doin
business in a slightly different line of the
managin game-of so-called box-fighters
to be exact and this now twenty-two
play persistence



caliber guy with the punch like one of them
french seventy-fives-well it surely looks
to me like right here is my chance to pick
a winner

   rich and famous he parrots  lead
on 

  so then i leads the way to a place from
which now everythin over two and one-
half per cent had then been extracted and
we proceeds to business if necessary i
would rapidly describe this guy as a very
well educated bird which after doin time
in a number of different business establish-
ments for several years at the end of
which he only owes for three weeks board
and lodgin has recently discovered the
now fallacy of riches-when they belongs
to somebody else

  in other words in this guys opinion
money aint everythin in life-they is one
per cent of somethin else whatever it is
outside of that they aint nothin much to
say except that in or outa the movies and
barrin a fresh-laid one-thousand-dollar
bill which is in a class by itself-a guy
showed me one one day-he is one of the
handsomest things on earth until a few
moments ago he has never in his life struck
a good square blow for democracy and
consequently has been unaware of the hid-
den power within him as the savin is
and his name is clarence howard carlton
-oh boy

    well can the clarence stuff i says

   battlin jack  for yours

  at any rate we get together easy
enough and that very day he starts in
learnin the manly art of assault and bat-
try they is a few things which he will
have to learn before we goes out after the
championship but he will pick them up
easy enough-provided he fails to hit the
teacher first

  well i wises up the missus about the
new theater how the owner is a mystery
and everythin and just like i had knowecl
she would from the first she takes the air
from a standin start zooms rapidly up-
ward to within a coupla inches of the
record for altitude and holds it for six
months

  y understand we have now reached one
of them places where considerable time is

supposed to elapse as they say on the
screen durin this time the missus con-
tinues to remain unsatisfied or far worse
with a great deal of success no on the
level home was never like this

  work on the new theater buildin con-
tinues accordin to union rules and regu-
lations but though i tells the missus
cheer-o and i am doin everythin possible
and showin all kinds of persistence and
everythin in try in to solve the great dra-
matic mystery or who holds the owner-
ship-though i offers to prove to the mis-
sus where i have already took part in pre-
cisely four fights in three of which i was
trimmed and all on account of gettin too
nosey about this here new theater project
-in spite of everythin the missus sticks
to it that if i only had a little ambition
about me i would go to work and get the
necessary facts and land that job

  happy days

  and all this y understand is nothin
but the truth for one reason or another
probably for advertisin purposes the per-
son or persons which is back of this new
theater is keepin themselves dark and
you can take it from one in a position to
know they are good at it

  still every cloud has its silver linin as
the weather guy says and the one bright
spot at this time is the way in which now
clarence howard carlton the human
greek god alias battlin jack starts in to
bust up the boxin league-and does it
three weeks after battlin jack signs on
the dotted line durin which time as a re-
sult of tryin to teach him the well-known
art of boxin four guys has went to the
hospital three of them havin some kindo
trouble with their jaw and the other one
sufferin with convulsions i starts him in
one of them regular queensbury things

  another guy also starts in this same
brawl but defaults in twenty seconds on
account of unconsciousness four more
affairs havin ended in a exactly similar
manner though the time varies slightly
battlin jack crashes into the first division
where he continues to mop up in a word
it is conceded on all sides that clarence
howard carlton alias battlin jack is the
fightin discovery of the age-and if any-


all-story weekly

body should ask you whats my middle
name you can tell em its columbus

  so all in all it would look like i should
worry they is a lot of worse jobs than
managin the lightweight champion of
everywhere and unless somethin hap-
pens battlin jack will surely cop that old
championship and as for that i dont
know of anythin thats liable to happen
unless-

  well ill admit frankly that i would of
felt a lot safer if every time the mail guy
drops round clarence had drawed a coupla
dozen less of them little pink things all
smelled up with talcum powder and other
now exotic scents and which is known on
the now columbia circuit and elsewhere
as mash notes

  dyou get me im layin the world at
large sixty to one that sooner or later this
birds fatal beauty is gonna make trouble
-serious trouble-for somebody and i
guess i know who in fact i know i know
who

  and-well i win and ill say too
that i didnt make no error when i picks
the guy which is headed for trouble but
when it comes ill tell the world fair i am
a lot worse than troubled i am dum-
founded

  he springs it on me one mornin shortly
after i and the missus has had another
fairly hot session on the subject of now
persistence to tell the truth im hangin
on the ropes when i leaves the missus and
when clarence hands me this i takes the
count ill say its the limit

  well he wasnt in no condition to listen
to reason anyways and so maybe it was
just as well that i didnt try to put up no
argument i simply leaves him go his
way after wishin him joy and then i
staggers to a couch and collapses

  but after a little i begin to come out of
it and get back some of the old fightin
spirit shortly im tellin the world fair ill
never leave him get away with it without a
battle and then i am discovered sittin on
the edge of the couch with my head in my
hands pullin some of the deepest stuff on
record

  well after a while i gets it maybe if
i hadnt been takin in so many movies

lately in order to save the missuss life be-
cause if i had stayed home she would of
talked herself to death-maybe if it wasnt
for seein all them photo-plays i might of
doped out somethin original

  as it was-not a chance at that
though they isnt nothin new or startlin
about the plan i finally hits on ill say its
a winner

  so then i immediately looks up clarence
and after gettin what information i need
under the now guise of askin him to re-
consider i starts on a still hunt for a scout
by the name of lefty lewis if lefty is
outa jail i know where i had ought to find
him about this time of day in one of three
places each of which is a now public
menace

  well i finds lefty in the second one of
them places-him and three of his pals-
and i wanna say right here and now that
this gang is no friends of mine-andcorn-
in to the point at once i inquires of lefty
if him and his little pals has anythin par-
ticular on for this very evenin

  well lefty says that him and his little
playmates was just considerin makin a
friendly call on a old and feeble woman
wrhich lives all alone by herself and which
is known to have a bunch of dough hid in
the mattress though of course that is
neither here nor there the point is-

   this here aged and feeble dame needs
somebody to cheer her up i says  i
get you and as for that dough bein
neither here nor there believe me if its
there it will soon be here

  however lefty says if i am wise to
somethin why maybe-

   listen i says  you know this
bird battlin jack that ive been pointin
for the championship well listen lefty
i go to work and get this guy all signed up
and everythin with kayo smith and
which as you well know is runner-up to
the champion-and so here is where we
wins our chance at the champ-dye get
it-and what dye know it aint two
hours ago he springs it on me hes gonna
get married

   all these here pugs is crazy says
lefty  its gettin hit around the bean
so much but what of it
play persistence



   what of it i howls  nothin only
he notifies me once and for all where hes
through with the fightin game just like
that get me the dame wont stand
for it

   tell you say says lefty what
dye know about that well ill say its
tough but believe me jim old kid that
settles it these here dames-who is she

   shes in the chorus of the  oh jane
company which is playin the majestic
i says

   one of them stage dames huh says
lefty

   yeh i says  but now listen
heres the dope to-night clarence-
battlin jack is givin one of them farewell
suppers to a bunch of his pals at the now
greenfield inn you know the place its
maybe a dozen miles or so outside the
city

   i stopped there once-till the dog
barked says lefty

   and listen i says  the weddin is
set for day after to-morrow a coupla days
iater the oh jane outfit hits the pike
for chicago and points west and this here
dame is gonna stick till the company goes
on the road-after which she and the bat-
tler starts on their honeymoon

   but look suppose anythin was to
happen to now sorta prevent- say
suppose the battler was to kinda now
mysteriously disappear-and stay so till
its time for the oh jane push to leave
town aint it reasonable to suppose that
this here dame trails right along with the
bunch

   sure she does says lefty shes a
broken-hearted woman but she stays with
the job

   you said it i says

  so then i spills the now scenario-
which i admit frankly is lifted bodily from
the fifth episode of that great serial suc-
cess  the murderers of manhattan or
somethin-to lefty and lefty says un-
less he is all wrong it will work i then in-
quires as to what lefty considers a reason-
able price for this here little job he
names it

  oh boy

   listen i says  you got me wrong

i aint hirin you to exterminate the
kaiser just a simple little job of kid-
 where dye get that stuff lefty
butts in  aint us fellas gotta live
well the price of now kidnapin has went
up like everythin else

  but anyways we gets together at last
and after warnin lefty where this here is
a strictly strong-arm job and that like it
says in sullivan county no shootin is al-
lowed i makes a appointment for the eve-
nin and goes away from there

  now about six miles outa the city on
the road to the now greefield inn they is
a place where a side road crosses the main
turnpike and that night-which like i
have figured on is moonlight-a long low
black motor-car like in all these here thril-
lers might of been observed standin in the
byroad just off the main highway

   the occupants a low-life sinister appear-
in crew countin me and lefty and the
showfer and leftys three little pals is six
in number one of them which occupies
the front seat with the showfer has a black
handkerchief tied around the lower part
of his face ill leave you guess which one
anyways ill say it makes smokin diffi-
cult the others wears their face naked
they are used to this sorta thing and they
should worry

   now listen i says to the showfer
 lets get this thing straight when the
car shows up-

   listen butts in lefty  are you
sure you can tell the right car believe
me we dont wanna have to hold up more
than eight or nine cars before gettin the
right one-it would get monotonous and
besides somethin might happen some-
body might object

   aint i already told you a dozen
times i retorts  from where were
sittin here i could tell that car a mile off
and the battler tells me in so many words
that hes gonna drive out to the inn to-
night with a particular friend of his that
owns the car-and they wont be nobody
else along and this guy drives a white
japalac eight-dye get it a japalac
eight tourin model painted white why
say in this here moonlight that white
car will show up like a battle-ship


all-story weekly

   all right says lefty  its up to
you but get this you cant expect me
and my pals to work for nothin and if
any mistakes is made all additional hold-
ups comes extra

  can y beat it

  but anyways i then goes on to tell the
showfer that when i gives him the office
he is to drive out onto the turnpike and
stop the car so as to block the road-like
as if our car was stalled then he is to
get out and start lookin at the engine or
somethin and-in the mean time the jap-
alac eight containin the battler and
friend will of came up and stopped near
by and then it is up to lefty and his gang
to get busy  leave it to me says lefty

   and i concludes  after we have
grabbed off the battler and is on our way
back to the city dont nobody address me
by name nor any other ways with this
here camouflage over my face and my coat
collar turned up and everythin he wont
never recognize me but if he ever does-
good night its all off and believe me
boys that bird can hit

   and no shootin allowed moans
lefty

  well that about completes the plans for
the evenins entertainment except that
lefty is wise to a place where he says the
battler can be kept comfortable as well as
dark till this here lady of the now en-
semble has departed for the great metrop-
olis of the west by that time the battler
will of come to his senses and so really i
am doin him a great favor and in time he
will thank me for it these stage dames
-but-well of course the missus-

  but anyways we havent sat there more
than a coupla weeks like it seems when i
hear a motor off in the distance pretty
soon we seen the glare of the headlights
before the car rounds a turn then the
lights themselves and then-

   lets go i says

  we moves out on to the turnpike and-
well i must of misjudged the distance or
the speed of that japalac eight or some-
thin because anyways they piles into us
i left the car by way of the wind-shield
takin it with me for reference and after
planin gracefully through some twenty or

thirty feet of ordinary atmosphere some-
thin goes wrong with the now fuselage
or somethin and i crashes heavily on my
face in a ditch which is floored with the
hardest rocks in the world and lined with
barbed wire-the kind with extra long
barbs like was used in the war

  unfortunately on account of landin on
my head i fails to lose consciousness i
would certainly of preferred it bacause it
surely feels like three of my legs is broke
or else one of them in three places-i aint
sure which

  anyways after a while i manages to
stand up and now peer over the edge of
the ditch oh boy the first thing i
seen was a yela japalac eight dye get
it and the next thing i lays eyes on is
the three biggest guys in the world puttin
the finishin touches on lefty and the
bunch

  and i might just as well admit right
here as well as anywheres else that i made
a bad mistake when i picked that yella
car for a white one-though of course the
moonlight was to blame for that but i
made a worse mistake when i fails to in-
quire-as to just who the battler was to
entertain that night at the greenfield inn

  as a matter of fact the battler had in-
vited every well-known fighter in the uni-
verse and listen that yella car car-
ries the three leaders in the heavy-weight
division and outa all the cars in the
world i chooses that one to pick on can
y beat it

  anyways one glance or two and i real-
ize right away where this is a bum night
for the grand old sport of kidnapin the
wind or maybe the moon-anyways
somethin is wrong somehow i feels it
right in my bones-which i seem to have
more of than usual and all of them adver-
tisin the fact that they are present-that
i aint gonna have no luck and i fades

  i makes two miles on one leg then a
livery car bound for the city comes along
and i tells the guy which hospital i wanna
go to and he drops me there the doc
looks me over and says i got a coupla bad
sprains but nothin serious a coupla
days attention and ill be all right noth-
in serious
play persistence



  noth-but let it go anyways i con-
cludes the days activities by phonin the
missus where i am and i have been in a
now slight motor accident but nothin se-
rious and if she wishes to view the re-
mains to come round in the mornin just
now what the victim needs most is-rest

  but listen next mornin clarence alias
battlin jack beats the missus to it he
says he phoned the house and the missus
directs him here and after inquirin about
my health and prosperity and so forth he
says

  listen jim maybe ive got some
news for you now what dye know about
this the now lady im engaged to y
know-well shes been puttin somethin
over on me y know i thought all the
while that her stage name was her real one
and that shes workin because she needs
the money and everythin just like all the
rest of us but instead of that shes only
workin for the experience because some
day shes gonna be a great actress and-
listen jim her father-

   whats this i says  a movie
but go on what about the old man

   he lives right here in this mans town

a coupla more fortunes in stocks and-
listen jim

theater clarence fires at me

last six months about landin that mana-
gers job

ater playin nothin but the very highest

   very well then i says  i accept
shortly after clarence leaves bearin my
best wishes and congratulations and heres
luck to him and his blushin bride and
everythin else i can think of-shortly
afterward the missus blows in

  well i springs the glad news and after
the fireworks and everythin is over-

   jim says the missus  didnt i say
right along that if you only had a little
ambition and now persistence you could
put it over

introductory note

in the spring of  i succeeded with some difficulty in securing passage to
london on a private errand of my own not that the war of the nations against
germany had not deeply and painfully stirred me i had offered myself for service
but owing to some obscure affection of the nerves not outwardly noticeable i had been
rejected so far as i personally was concerned i was resigned for it was the spiritual
aspects of the struggle that had chief engaged me and i was never much of a fighter

     during more than a year past i had been collecting materials for a biography of a
certain great-granduncle of mine-captain lionel heathcote-who had been distin-
guished a century before as a soldier and diplomatist but i had found the data
covering one period of his career to be scant or missing yet this very period-about a
twelvemonth-seemed to be of special importance for whereas up till then he had
been singularly successful in his undertakings and stood at the threshold of a brilliant
diplomatic future he then suddenly abandoned his prospects and sank into obscurity
none of the letters and other documents which i had assembled explained the mystery

    it now occurred to me that the library of the british museum might contain
something bearing upon the subject captain heathcote at the date in question was
about thirty-five years of age he had been sent to london by president monroe to
assist our minister at the court of st james mr richard rush in unraveling a
dispute between great britain and this country over the execution of an alleged british
spy ambrister during the seminole war the captain having been personally present
at the execution which had been ordered by general andrew jackson his mission
had been signally successful not only did he place mr rush under great obligations
to him but he won the personal liking of the british premier lord canning he was


fires rekindled



a handsome dashing young soldier with a romantic and adventurous life behind him
and was now evincing intellectual endowments of a high order the best society of
london opened its doors to him he was accredited with having averted the peril of
another war between the mother country and our own there was almost no distinction
to which he might not aspire

    what could have induced a youth so fortunate gifted and ambitious to put aside
the cup that was held brimming to his lips

    it was in the hope of solving this enigma that i embarked on my journey to
london-the first that i had undertaken beyond the boundaries of my native land
my only sister joan had some years before married a british officer major philip
dalrymple was residing in london and would guide my first footsteps there

    it may be proper to mention that i am now approaching forty years of age have
always been of a studious turn and after leaving the university took a post-graduate
course in mental science and religious philosophy but this left my mind unsettled and
i took up history and biography in the hope of arriving at a spiritual interpretation of
events and of the actors in them i published a few monographs which were kindly
received but not widely read finally the figure of my problematic ancestor appealed
to me as a promising theme and i had become singularly interested in it

     the following narrative consists substantially of the diary or journal which i kept
during my london sojourn that sojourn resulted in unexpected and strange develop-
ments concerning the significance of which i shall leave the reader to form his own
conclusions

   the reader is now qualified to proceed	john heathcote

chapter i

e a a

  a fter ten days of uneasy experiences
 on the atlantic i resume this jour-
a nal this is written at my new lodg-
ings  lower seymour street london

  joan met me at the charing cross
station on my arrival what a handsome
woman i hadnt seen her since her mar-
riage were i ever to marry which is
absurd it would be with one of her type-
brunette dignified sensitive gentle we
had been all our lives affectionate chums
and the ominous posture of affairs in france
seemed to unite us more than ever

  we met this morning by appointment to
seek lodgings for me and this apartment is
the first one we examined the house is a
small and old one of darkened brick in a
respectable but not fashionable quarter of
the city the owner is a widow respect-
able and antique-mrs blodgett the
house she told us had been in possession
of her family for more than one hundred
years and the upper floor had always been
let to lodgers  genteel folks always and
some of em famous she observed a long

row of black-bound books on a shelf in
her sitting-room turned out to be family
archives-in fact account-books which she
and her predecessors had kept of business
dealings with their lodgers how odd and
un-american

  the old lady excused herself from going
up-stairs with us to the vacant apartment
 im a good bit heavier than what i was
forty years ago and goin up-stairs catches
me in the back rosy rotund and
wrinkled she is in white cap and apron and
black dress-sacred to the memory of a
spouse who died back in the eighties
so joan and i went up the dark little car-
peted staircase and entered the room by a
door on the left of the landing

  as i crossed the threshold and almost
before casting my eyes over the room i
had a singular sensation on which i am
disposed to dwell a little

   but i know this place perfectly well
i exclaimed to myself but audibly

   considering this is your first visit to
london remarked joan smiling  you
lose no time in feeling at home

  i smiled too  nevertheless our place
at home isnt more familiar


all-story weekly

  that  been-here-before feeling she
rejoined  isnt there some psychological
or physiological explanation of it

  without replying i sat down in a big old
easy chair covered with worn and patched
black leather springless but still com-
fortable

   ive sat in this chair times out of
mind i said and i was about to add-
 with a beautiful woman in my lap but
checked myself what had come over me

  in the partition opposite the front win-
dows there were two doors between them
a dark oak bookcase reaching to the ceil-
ing the shelves filled with dusty old
volumes the wall-paper was dull-green
faded by time to quite a fashionable shade
in the corner of the room to the right next
the door on that side hung in a tarnished
frame an ancient lithographed portrait too
dim for its subject to be discernible at my
distance at the other end of the room
near the other door stood a massive table
covered with a thick cloth of a yellowish
color

   joan said i  let us try an experi-
ment begin with that portrait over there
unless i mistake its of the prince regent
afterward george iv and down in the left-
hand corner his signature is written with
something added- my respectful admira-
tion i think

  with an amused laugh my sister stepped
over to the corner her first careless look
at the portrait became close and interested

   i declare john youre right she said
at last turning round to me in perplexity
 it is the prince and his signature too
the sentence is so faded i cant quite make
it out but what does this mean

   i dont know the wall-paper is dif-
ferent though it used to be green too but
with some sort of arabesque pattern in yel-
low on it but now take a look at those
books i can name two of them at least-
 keatss endymion  and  moores irish
melodies 

  she stared at me with a wrinkle between
her brows and then slowly approached the
bookcase  the titles on the backs of
most of them are almost illegible she mur-
mured  oh here she muttered after a
moment taking out one of the volumes and

opening it at the title-page  this is witch-
craft she added meeting my eyes in dis-
may

   is it the  endymion 

   xo but its  moores melodies  john
you came here this morning before i met

you

   i certainly did not you know your-
self i hadnt finished dressing when you
arrived i got up and came to the book-
case  and heres the other book i said
pulling it out and showing it to her  now
listen while i describe whats behind those
doors 

   i wouldnt dare open them she said
you frighten me

    i feel a little terrified myself i replied
 but theres a very agreeable vibration
here for all that  dont believe in rein-
carnation and the theory about nonsimul-
taneous action of the two lobes of the brain
is a rather desperate guess but i con-
tinued pointing to the door beside the por-
trait  the kitchen is in there with the sink
on the right where ive often helped the
girl wash up the dishes -i opened the
door and we looked in and confirmed my
assertion- but this is the door of the bed-
room with which i am better acquainted
i laid a hand on the door-knob

   dont john entreated joan  if you
do im going to pray that youll be dis-
appointed 

   its too late heres what we shall see
on the left therell be a window and beside
it a dressing-table built into the wall-quite
an unusual construction right in front of
us there will be a large alcove half as big
as the rest of the room with another win-
dow at the end of it it looks out into the
area where a young lime-tree is growing
in the alcove is the bed an old-fashioned
four-poster with curtains shall i tell you
any more

   open the door  said joan recklessly

  i did so the fixed dressing-table had
been newly upholstered with blue and white
dimity and the curtains had been removed
from the bed-there was no other variation
from my description i walked over to the
window in the alcove

   theres the lime-tree i observed
 only its ever so much bigger than i re-
fires rekindled



member it its taller than the house now
it used to be hardly as high as this window-
sill

  as i stood looking down into the area
i was visited by another perception - or
reminiscence

   this window you notice i said to my
sister  is fitted with folding-shutters solid
panels in the style of three generations ago
there are three panels i am going to show
you in the center panel some initials cut
into the wood i cut them myself one
autumn morning with the sun falling in
over my shoulder as it does now there
are five letters-three above and two just
below the top ones are e a a the
under ones j h are you ready

   i dont believe it joan exclaimed

  i pulled open the shutter there pre-
cisely were the initials

   let us get out of this house at once
said joan catching me by the arm and try-
ing to draw me away

   by no means here i stay as long as
im in london ive never liked any rooms
so well as you say im at home here
oh here at last is a discrepancy

  i had been scrutinizing the letters and i
now pointed to the two last

   that seems to be an l instead of a j
i said  the tail is on the right instead of
on the left

  there you see cried my sister tri-
umphantly  that disproves the whole
thing 

   wait a moment-i can explain it i
returned after a moments thought  dont
you remember when we were little father
and mother used to call me  lionel  but
i wasnt christened till i was eight or nine
years old and then they decided to name
me after our grandfather john why you
used to call me lionel half the time 

  joan admitted this reluctantly  but
what of that she added  you were not
here when you were eight or nine years old
or any other time and there are plenty of
people whose initials are l h besides
who is e a a

   ive been trying to think it seems
just on the tip of my tongue but it wont
come off but i know she was a woman-
she is maybe-for when was all this

   the letters have been there for ages
theyve been painted over scores of times
and that tree must be at least a hundred
years old my dear its nothing but a string
of coincidences-lucky guesses dont let
us think any more about it it gives me a
most uncomfortable feeling please dont
stay here - i shant have a moments
peace

  but i said that a string of guesses or
coincidences was no just cause for uneasi-
ness  i feel a peculiarly agreeable in-
fluence here ive made up my mind to
lease the apartment for a year and in order
to settle the matter i shall pay mrs
blodgett in advance now ill go back to
the hotel and have my things sent over here
i cant thank you enough for guiding me
here remember youve invited me to
dine with you to-morrow from what im
told a dinner isnt too easy to get in lon-
don nowadays

  joan sighed  nor breakfast nor lunch
either i know youll starve to death or
be carried off by evil spirits you must
arrange with mrs blodgett to give you your
meals here you have a kitchen at any
rate lets go down and talk to her 

  mrs blodgett readily agreed to ration
me observing that her maid-of-all-work
kittie was  a cook born and bred  so
that at any rate the radical simplicity of
my habitual diet would present no diffi-
culties in the back of my mind while we
talked was an undefined notion that i had
been before served in that house by an-
other skilful cook but her name had not
been kittie nor had she anything of kitties
amiable and blowzy aspect possibly this
may have prompted my interjecting an in-
quiry made however in a tone becomingly
playful as to whether the house like other
good old english houses i had heard of
enjoyed the reputation of being haunted

  good mrs blodgett seemed a little in-
dignant

  never nothin of that sort sir she
asseverated  me nor my forebears has
never had no such complaints but always
expresses emselves perfectly satisfied

   im sure i shall be satisfied i as-
sured her conciliatingly  and if the ghost
were a nice one i shouldnt complain


all-story weekly

  the negotiations thus happily concluded
joan and i parted she going to her cottage
in st johns wood and i to wind up my
affairs at my hotel i was more impatient
to get established in my lodgings than i
allowed my sister to think now that i am
here i am conscious of a secret inexplica-
ble delight

  it had pleased me to know that so far
as my landladys word could be trusted i
had the monopoly of whatever  haunting 
could be predicated of the house i should
have felt jealous of any participant in the
occult sensations i had experienced the
influence vibration or whatever it may be
termed which had met me in the rooms
and had been so singularly accredited by
the fulfilment of my various little surmises
-especially in the really remarkable case
of the initials-had been poignantly invit-
ing and so to say caressing it was per-
sonal sweetly familiar and above all dis-
tinctly sexual or feminine

  it is upon me now more powerfully than
ever

  i can compare the sensation only with
that of a lover who should visit the apart-
ment of hisbeloved mistress everything
speaks of her traces of her touch her pres-
ence are on all sides she seems to be mov-
ing about in thebedroom preparingherself
to go with me to some little festival i can
almost hear her humming snatches of a
lightsome song at this moment i can al-
most believe she is standing at my shoul-
der and yet i am alone the door is
locked and i am perfectly aware that all
this is-

  i was going to write  nonsensebut i
wont do it it is simply something that is
entirely unprecedented in m experience
and that i dont understand

  some years ago i was induced by an
open mind or by curiosity to investigate
occult phenomena and to find out whether
i were  suggestible in that direction
hypnotism clairvoyance telepathy spir-
itualism buddhism psychometry and other
cults-i explored them ail and with a will-
ingness to be convinced rather than the con-
trary but my results were negative noth-
ing seized me i felt no assurance of an
authentic revelation phenomena for which

i couldnt account did take place but they
aroused no emotion deeper than curiosity
and not much even of that some obscure
physiological-perhaps pathological-force
seemed to be at the base of them all and
the mindsof the faithful didnt strike me
as of an elevated order the further i
delved the less of spirit did i seem to find
at last i fell away feeling that i was wast-
ing time

  another thing bearing on the present
situation is the fact that i have never
known or been attracted by women with
the exception of course of my mother and
sister this doesnt mean that i am in-
sensible to woman-the ewig weibliche-in
the abstract im a man and dont con-
sider myself a sexual freak but my health
was delicate in my youth and my habits
secluded and studious my father died
when i was a child and my mother joan
and i lived in a place somewhat removed
from ordinary social access i loved and
love beauty feminine or other but as a
spectator i can feel the allurement of
woman in poetry and art but i was never
subject to any personal attraction to in-
dividual women and at my present age
i never expected to be

  therefore upon the whole i should hold
myself to be a person as little likely as any
one else in the world to be subject to occult
influences or to a personal sexual passion
i am not of that habit or constitution

  and yet here i am alone in london my
face flushed and my breathing disturbed
by something intensely feminine and per-
sonal which nevertheless has no apparent
actual existence of the verity of the emo-
tion aroused in me there is certainly no
question but for any rational or conceiva-
ble grounds for it i speculate in vain

  no doubt an alienist would call me in-
sane but i know better

  when i went into her bedroom-our bed-
room-there was an effluence there a
fragrance not of flowers or of commercial
scents but of her-that gave my nerves a
delicious shock of anticipation and joy it
was exquisitely individual and when i
struck a match to light the bedroom candle
these ancient conveniences survive in mrs
blodgetts establishment i was near be-
fires rekindled



lieving that its light would show her face
on the pillow of the bed it showed the
pillow only but the persuasion of her pres-
ence remained

  that persuasion or conviction wanes or
increases but upon the whole i think it
becomes stronger it is not however-so
far at any rate-accompanied by any idea
of what she looks like my imagination-or
memory-fails to define her features or
form i feel only that she is utterly lovable
and that i love her and i cant help be-
lieving that i shall know and realize more
and more of her as time goes on

  is this a memory of something that has
been or a premonition of something to
come or is it independent of past and
future or is it a hallucination

  it is not a hallucination hallucinations
deceive the physical senses but what she
communicates to me penetrates to a depth
in me far beyond the sphere of sense

  i wish i knew her name  e a a
must be her initials but what do they stand
for exquisite adorable  angel per-
haps

  its late-time i was asleep by the
way i had a message from joan this after-
noon saying that poor philips horse had
been shot under him and that he was in a
base hospital with a broken leg she was
to cross over to france and go to him to-
night and didnt know when she might be
back so our dinner to-morrow is off i am
grieved for her and for him but i confess
i am relieved on my own account fond as
i am of my sister i wish to keep this ex-
perience all to myself

  i shall sleep in e a as bed to-night

chapter ii

echoes from the past

several days-probably a week-
since i last wrote here i am taking
small heed of the flight of time i dont
have to and sometimes as with hashish
eaters moments and days-or ages-ap-
pear inextricably confounded the soul
has measures of its own

  the weather is fine and soft my land-
lady tells me it is often so in london in the
 a-s

season-that is during the summer session
of parliament i had a line from joan that
philip is getting on but saying nothing of
coming back here it looks as if the crisis
of the war was at hand i may see some-
thing of it even in london though hitherto
there has been nothing more than a rather
ineffectual attempt to bomb folks in the
streets from german zeppelins perhaps
the war is but the material analogue of a
mighty spiritual change in the world the
glass through which we have seen darkly
during so many centuries may be about to
dissolve leaving us face to face with the
reality of things

  ive been arranging my work on the
biography i found the librarian or curator
of the british museum library to be a
very pleasant gentleman miraculously con-
versant with the millions of volumes under
his change and kind enough to take an
interest even in my little investigation he
opines that the old files of the london
times and morning post are likely to af-
ford my best browsing-ground together
with pamphlets play-bills and other fugi-
tive scraps thrown off by the world as it
revolves and he can if necessary gain me
access to state archives of the period

  there are also collections of personal
correspondence between persons of more or
less importance during the first part of the
last century working upon material so
ample there is good hope that i shall hap-
pen upon something germane to my pur-
pose my ancestor can hardly have passed
through his year in london without leav-
ing some foot-prints on the sands of the
time thickly trodden though they were
his figure and fate engage me more than
ever i have a gratuitous notion that in
learning to fathom him i shall be gaining
a better understanding of myself

  its a mere notion and not a plausible
one so far as outwardly appears captain
heathcotes character temperament and
life were almost the categorical opposite
of my own but sympathies sometimes run
perversely just because i cant be and do
what he did and was i take my revenge
upon nature by entering imaginatively into
his being and doing or it may be some-
thing a little less obvious than that it


all-story weekly

may be that i am not so much innately in-
capable of such a career as his as i am
lacking in the circumstances that sur-
rounded him and in the opportunity that he
met and availed of

  i have lived in peaceful times and have
been a near invalid withdrawn amid books
and meditations with a shrinking from con-
tacts with actualities-especially from ag-
gressive contacts but vivid narratives of
action peril and adventure always attract
me and the adventures related of my an-
cestor very particularly i seem to feel my-
self in his saddle as he rides on his head-
long escapades im at the tiller of his boat
in the storm i plot in his brain the escape
from the spanish stockade i fight his duel
and kill his man anon i convince the
wise and cautious president that jackson
was in the right as to the spy and i take
ship confidently for england pledging my-
self to conquer the prejudices of the british
premier

  now i plunge rejoicing into the splendid
tide of london society its dinners its balls
its receptions its great ladies and famous
beauties and all the while i am sitting
motionless and mute at my desk a hermit
a dim-eyed student an old bachelor

  no doubt heredity is a truth and per-
sonal traits skip a generation or two and
crop out afresh to be repressed or stimu-
lated by conditions education customs ac-
cidents in some remote and double-locked
chamber of my subconscious being may
abide the germ of qualities that flamed into
splendid results in captain heathcote i
might have been he in a sense i may be
he but then ought  not to be able to
solve his mystery even without the help of
the british museum i fear my relations
with him are not quite intimate enough
for that i am an admirer but not a
psychometrist  cant identify myself with
him so closely as to divine his doings out
of whole cloth so to say or if i could i
couldnt summon effrontery enough to pass
it off as sober history

  though for my own private edification
i might stretch a point

  a romantic impulsive audacious young
scapegrace he must have been he was
but fifteen whenrebelling against the strait-

ness of existence on the new england home-
stead he shipped before the mast on a
salem vessel bound for the east indies
round the horn stray hints of him came
back from ceylon hong-kong sumatra
and the philippines by and by he turned
up at panama he crossed the isthmus
and in the course of a year or two made his
way up through mexico to texas then a
spanish possession in mexico city he
fought two duels-was wounded in one and
killed his man in the other

  about  he was in new orleans and
there is some basis for the belief that he
commanded a privateer in the war with
england there is no doubt that he was in
the battle of new orleans and by that
time was on cordial terms with jackson-
although jackson was much the elder the
two were kindred spirits in new orleans
he met the girl whom he married after a
whirlwind courtship i fancy her given-
name was dolores her family spanish he
was now about thirty years old

  their matrimonial experience was prob-
ably far from being tame and uneventful
he must have been a hard man to manage
and she hardly qualified to exercise judi-
cious management he seems to have been
well supplied with money and treated her
generously from that point of view but
their temperaments clashed they quarreled
and made up he never brought her to new
england but at the time of the seminole
war they were residing in baltimore and
it was there that she gave birth to a child
which died in infancy while captain heath-
cote was helping jackson singe the king of
spains beard in florida and tread on the
mighty toes of great britain dolores does
not appear afterward in the story i incline
to think she rejoined her family in new
orleans

  and then comes that interval of mystery
and i exactly a century later am in lon-
don as he was walk the streets and view
the scenes that he knew and am doing my
best to get in touch with him outwardly
alien from him as the poles i feel a bond
between us that unites us closer than twin-
brotherhood it sounds absurd and may
be pure illusion but i record my belief for
what its worth
fires rekindled



  something happened to him right in this
neighborhood that changed him vitally and
lastingly the more  mull over it the more
am i disposed to suspect that some love-
adventure was at the bottom of it

  london social morality under the sway
and example of the regent was not puri-
tanical in that society he must have met
renowned beauties and they might be dis-
posed to make a pet of the gallant young
american what more likely than that he
lost his heart to one of them in that case
anything might happen if the lady of his
choice proved less than adamant-and the
chances are she would-discovery and ex-
posure may well have followed

  the english wont stand for an open
esclandre-if lovers stay under the rose
they are not meddled with but if they
emerge they must pay the costs if the
intrigue had not gone too far-if it was
stopped say on the brink of an elopement
-the lady would probably be removed out
of harms way had it come to a duel
news of it could hardly have failed to leak
out and the riddle i am puzzling over
would have been answered long since as
it is i grope in thick darkness

  meanwhile i find the old london news-
papers-especially the advertisements-
rather fascinating here is the life and
atmosphere of the time as if i were back
in the era of the  first gentleman of
europe in the morning post every day
there is a paragraph under the title  court
circular it briefly records the doings of
royalty-at least the visible and trivial
ones  the prince regent accompanied
by ladies and gentlemen of his entourage
walked yesterday on the slopes of windsor
palace where does he walk to-day and
in what company

  under the heading  parliament we
are told that lord canning replying to an
interrogatory from the front opposition
bench declared that the posture of the
florida incident had undergone no altera-
tion this must refer to the seminole war
and preceded the arrival in london of my
ancestor but the  personal notices  are
more interesting-they give rein to the im-
agination  lady rowena grey of ormis-
ton lost her fan on the way home from the

performance at the drury lane theater
 the publisher begs to announce a poem
- endymion -written by mr john
keats  on the banks of the thames
near twickenham a small well-appointed
villa is to lease on reasonable terms  a
private gentleman will lend all or part of
five hundred pounds on proper security
 the concert at which a was to appear
has been postponed till tuesday pm 
ock  avub the moorish sorcerer gives
advice daily from nine morning to six
evening or by private appointment a
letter awaits a at the usual place l
and so on inimitably

  as i pore over these scraps i hear the
early nineteenth century existence hum-
ming as busily as to-day preoccupied with
itself i see women in high-waisted frocks
through the diaphanous skirts of which their
garter-buckles sparkle gentlemen in colored
coats and trousers strapped under their
boots and funny truncated-cone hats
perched on their abundant hair coaches
trundling on heavy wheels and swinging on
huge springs with coachmen and footmen
bewigged and powdered

  is that george bryan better known as
beau brummel pacing down the row with
a long cane and a lorgnette no it must
be some imitator-the great beau was
forced into exile at calais a year or more
ago but here comes a splendid cavalcade
with ii r h the prince regent at its
head uniformed and plumed and bowing
to the pretty lady in the coach-a compli-
ment little apt to improve her reputation
and yonder jogging easily along on his
black barb with his heroic nose and his
enigmatic smile - here is the great duke
himself the crowd makes way for him
and does him reverence they will never
cease to honor the conqueror of bonaparte

  how little do we think of all these fine
folks now-almost as little as they thought
of us yet in their own eyes they were as
real and important as we are in ours-they
who now are nothing as we in our turn
shall soon be nothing but as  read these
old newspapers which they in their day
read i hear their stir and feel their reality

  there was one paragraph in the morning
post which i was impelled to copy out in


all-story weekly

full i can give no reasonable excuse for
doing it its ten thousand to one that it
possesses no significance for me  asgard 
has a scandinavian look and i get no
scandinavian vibration from the  e a a-
on my window-shutter nor from the lovely
undefined presence that seems to pervade
my apartment but i have associated that
presence with an idea of singing i dont
hear her sing but i feel she is a singer
i cant somehow imagine her as anything
else and her last name must begin with
a i wonder whether its her married
name i have an impression that it is
heres the paragraph

  at buckingham palace on tuesday afternoon
last mrs asgard the distinguished soprano had
the honor to sing before h r h the prince
regent and a small company of his friends h
r h afterward declared himself pleased with
her performance mrs asgard afterward drank
tea with h r h and his guests

  thats all but when i shut my eyes i
can almost see a slender upright figure
with a laughing sparkle in her eyes stand-
ing up before the group of lords and ladies
and singing-singing i believe she wore a
black silk frock trimmed with blue and her
neck and arms were wonderfully white and
she had auburn hair oh how she sang

chapter iii

the writing in the book

the developments that i am trying to
trace are so peculiar that i find diffi-
culty in keeping these memoranda up
to date but i mustnt let them escape

  i had dropped in on my landlady the
other day to discuss the price of milk and
as we chatted my eyes happened to fall on
that row of black-bound books on her shelf
which as she had told me contained her
accounts and those of her predecessors
with lodgers going back for upward of a
century

  if the mrs asgard mentioned in the
newspaper paragraph should happen to be
the e a a whose initials i had found on
the window-shutter a large  if to be
sure then she had lodged here and her
name would appear in one of those books

  mrs blodgett readily agreed to my re-
quest to be allowed to take some of the
volumes to my room for examination  in-
deed youre most welcome mr eathcote
but in course prices of things in old times
wasnt like what theyve come to be these
days

  i didnt explain that the object of my
curiosity was not comparative prices in
all there were about thirty of the series
mostly small vos the series began in
 and i carried to my room the first
half-dozen of them

  the newspaper paragraph about mrs
asgard had been dated in the spring of
 not without a tension of the nerves
did i open the volume corresponding to that
epoch i prepared myself for disappoint-
ment the odds against success were in-
calculable

  the thumbed and soiled pages of the
entries for that year were written in an
angular hand precise and painstaking but
unbiased as to spelling the top lines were
inscribed with the name of the landlord
caleb blodgett in account with the lodger
for the time being i turned leaf after leaf
slowly

  on the page dated march   came
upon the following

caleb blodgett in acct with mrs e a asgard

  my heart gave a jump and i dropped
back in my chair breathing as if i had run
up a hill i sat up again and read the words
over and over again there was no mis-
take mrs asgard and e a a were one
and the same person and she had lived in
these rooms it was mrs asgard the dis-
tinguished soprano singer who had sung at
buckingham palace and been honored by
royalty it was she whose influence had met
me on the threshold of the apartment and
had been with me ever since it was she
who had lain in that bed sat in this chair
leaned on this table it was here that she
had received her lover

  there could be no mistake the name of
asgard was too unusual even without the
preceding initials and the date it was tan-
talizing not to know what those two initials
stood for but doubtless they would be
elucidated in due time after having been
fires rekindled



brought so far along this wonderful path i
had faith that i should arrive at the end
i eould well-nigh believe she was whispering
counsel in my ear and putting in my hand
the clue that should lead me through the
maze

  but i presently subdued myself to a more
deliberate survey of the situation

  mrs asgard even assuming her to have
achieved eminence before she was thirty
and to have fulfilled her alloted span of
three-score-and-ten must have died at
least a quarter of a century before  was
born

  hitherto so powerful upon me had been
her influence i had been blind to this
flagrant fact it had seemed to me that she
must still live and might at any moment
walk into the room even the bucking-
ham palace record hadnt opened my eyes
to a realization that this was a physical
impossibility

  but her name in the old account-book
brought me to my sober senses a gulf a
hundred years wide stretched between us
the recognition of it awed me and yet as
i mused upon it i found a sort of consola-
tion too

  for her influence-the perception that it
aroused in me-had always been that of a
young woman in the bloom of her career-
such a woman with bright auburn hair and
sparkling dark eyes as my fancy had con-
jured up standing in the presence of royal-
ty the century that intervened while
denying all hope of confirming this vision
in the flesh yet assured me that her fresh-
ness and beauty were beyond the reach of
time that she was an immortal reality
secure and unchangeable she had actually
existed in this world and she could never
die she was a spirit and for the sake of
the spirit i was willing to forego the flesh
since it is the spirit that true-lovers love
and the flesh only as it is the spirits
transient vehicle she was with me now
and we loved each other

   but here another reflection cast its shad-
ow over me apparently mrs asgard had
been a married woman who and what
had been her husband he couldnt be
l h and the intervention of l h pre-
sented still another problem

	i remembered however that in the early
part of the nineteenth century the title of
mrs was often borne by unmarried wo-
men especially on the stage-and for that
matter asgard might have been merely a
stage name but if as i was disposed to
believe there was a husband he could
hardly have been with her in london-his
presence there would not have been com-
patible with that of l h she and her
husband must then have separated she
retaining for professional purposes her
married name that she was a widow did
not seem probable for in that case why
shouldnt l h have married her true
he also might have been already married
but at this point i dismissed the specula-
tion perceiving that it was the identity of
l h that really concerned me

  it concerned me because the hand that
cut those initials on the shutter must have
been the hand of her lover and of her ac-
cepted lover too and that was a hundred
years ago the reason i had failed to con-
sider this before was my first impulsive and
irrational persuasion that l h and i were
one i could no longer hold to this and
what therefore was my standing with
e a a what rights in her could i
claim how could i supplant him and
how could her spirit which had loved him
while she was still in the body now adapt
itself to mine

  i could see no escape from this dilemma
but neither on the other hand could i feel
troubled by it for there are certainties of
the soul that disdain proof and confer the
gift of belief they convict as pusillanimous
the pleas of reason and they disclose in-
terior truths they are the more convinc-
ing because beyond our fathoming

  in my life nothing else had been to me
so real as was my passion for e a a
i could not question its verity and inas-
much as the inmost essential of love is
reciprocity i could as little question hers
for me how to reconcile this with the ap-
parent fact that l h had forestalled me
i knew not nor was it necessary what i
knew i knew

  i felt nevertheless that knowledge of
him would increase my knowledge of her
and must constitute the next step toward


all-story weekly

solving the enigma the good fortune i
had thus far met with encouraged me to
hope for more l h-who was he

  my first unthinking notion that the let-
ters stood for lionel heathcote-some in-
explicable prototype of myself-must now
be pronounced untenable the man had
been a contemporary of hers and probably
not greatly her senior it was likely too
that he had been a personage of some im-
portance to be admitted to her acquaint-
ance possibly since she was a singer he
may have been a musician or composer
but running over the names of such as
might have fitted the conditions i realized
that the field was too extensive for guess-
work but i might consult my omniscient
friend the librarian at the museum

  this suggestion directed my thoughts to
the books on yonder book-shelf by some
inadvertence i had never examined the
 endvmion  and the  melodies my
divination of which had so startled joan
that divination indicated that there should
be some direct connection between the
lovers and them

  i got up and drew out the volumes and
brought them to my table they were first
editions and might be worth a good price
in the market i opened the  endvmion

a thing of beauty is a joy forever

  there stood the deathless line in old-
fashioned unpretentious type making its
virgin appearance in the world innocent of
fame ready to go forth on its mission of
delight to all lovers of beauty few eyes
had seen it then which now is known to
myriads the poem of love and of lovers
thought i to myself vague wayward
faulty exquisite strange a mirror wherein
the enamored may behold their ideal
rather than its reality or if the reality then
as haloed and softened by the ideal beauty
dawns through it like summer moonbeams
through pearly mists love glows amidst it
like the blush of roses on the moist brows
of a bacchante

  the voice of youth innocent sensuous
and musical echoes about it soul and flesh
are interwoven in its mesh each glorifying
the other a book indeed fit for the read-
ing of the lover and his beloved sitting

cheek to cheek breathing its aroma tasting
its sweetness even as paolo and francesca
in the dim florentine chamber lifting
their eyes intermittently from the page to
one another they know how true it is that
a thing of beauty is a joy forever-a truth
hidden from others revealed to them

  the poem chances to be a favorite of my
own solitary youth rhyming with youth-
ful dreams never to be fulfilled it wrought
an impression upon me for which its actual
contents could not perhaps wholly account
and even now writing of it in this london
room i have a dreamy sensation of being
something more or other than my usual self
and perceive that such a vein of apostrophe
is not normally mine may it not have
been in this very chair that she and he were
seated when they first opened the book and
cut the leaves

  as i passed from page to page seeking
remembered passages it was like entering
the guarded temple of two lovers and tread-
ing on consecrated ground here they had
met in their secrecies here were depicted
scenes and thoughts uttered which made
them flush as at the thought that some
spirit of the air had found its way into
their privacy but the mysteries of all
lovers are open to one who loves

  that opening verse of the poem had been
underscored with a delicate pencil line and
as i went on i discovered that most of what
i called my passages had been similarly
marked these markings were however of
two kinds easily distinguishable each from
the other some had been made with the
delicate touch that told of a feminine
hand others with as it were a masculine
emphasis and impetuosity the latter
designated verses in which the amorous
nature of the young poet had achieved most
effective expression the former drew atten-
tion chiefly to magical cadencies and spir-
itual subtleties together they seemed to
draw aside a veil permitting a living and
intimate insight into the form and quality
of these two characters the poem blended
the two into one

  as i was lingering over the latter part of
the second book a belated impulse caused
me to turn to the flyleaf there if any-
where should be confirmation of what i
fires rekindled



had been seeking there it was written in
a bold somewhat unformed hand that i
read

i inscribe this booke of love
to the heart of my soule
from her lionel

   this book of love -almost the phrase
i had used just now-and signed with the
name by which i had been called in my
childhood

  i was profoundly stirred oh if the
writer had but added his other name and
hers but my advance through the ob-
scurity must be gradual already it was
carrying me beyond my rational depth and
seemingly toward the fulfilment of a mys-
tical prophecy of the spirit

  that ardent irregular handwriting what
was this incredible message which apart
from its external purport it seemed to have
for me

  after a while i closed the book and took
my pen and a sheet of paper without at-
tempting a facsimile of the original but in
my own customary hand  wrote the same
words in their order and then reopened the
volume and compared the two

  to an undiscriminating glance they were
quite unlike the original was larger than
my copy and lacked its trained evenness
it had been done by one unversed in niceties
of penmanship who wielded the pen with
something of the freedom of a broadsword
but students of chirography are aware that
careful analysis may reveal unsuspected
likenesses between two apparently dissimilar
scripts they observe the manner in which
letters are formed the manner in which
they are joined to one another the spacing
of the words the slope of the lines and
such like unconscious details the hand-
writing of a boy of twelve will look dif-
ferent from that of the same person grown
to manhood and yet an expert may be
able to identify them the inner nature
the temperament cannot be wholly dis-
guised and it is this which betrays the
secret

  i had received no special training in this
curious science but a professional miter
acquires habits of close observation and
as i examined lionels writing and my own
i detected surprising affiliations had i

lived his life even the external resemblance
might have been greater i think in a
preceding page of this journal i have drawn
some such comparison as this between my-
self and my great-granduncle-and to be
sure his name was lionel but how can
i venture into the lawless region of surmise
which such a thought suggests sanity
warns against it

  and yet what could be more opposed to
recognized laws of being than are some of
the experiences that i have already met
with in this house i cannot disown these
the supersensuous impressions which i re-
ceived on my first entrance here were veri-
fied by physical proof so far as they were
related to material facts and my percep-
tions-i might almost say my visions-of
an adorable personality hovering about me
are too deeply rooted in me to be ignored
on their own plane they are consistent and
they bring with them the memory or the
consciousness of innumerable logical ac-
cessories- words backgrounds attendant
figures small incidents-of almost over-
whelming verisimilitude and naturalness-
for i know not how to avoid that word

  there is a maid-servant in that kitchen-
i dont mean mrs blodgetts actual kittie
but a dark-haired clever young woman who
cooks delicate little meals brushes her mis-
tresss hair that glistening floating auburn
web helps her as tire-woman and accom-
panies her on her little professional excur-
sions-whom i know well and could in-
stantly recognize out of a thousand though
i know she doesnt exist to bodily sight or
touch havent i tipped her with in-
numerable half-crowns and even with a
guinea upon occasion she is the sole
trusted confidant of our secret

  what am i saying why shouldnt i
write down what my thought dictates i
believe i or something in me that craves
to do it could begin here and write a com-
plete narrative of adventures which befell
me-or something in me-when george was
regent in england i have only to yield to
the-to this urgency within that strives to
seize and direct my pen and the thing
would be accomplished

  no the time is not yet come i am too
much bewildered and too agitated to risk


all-story weekly

such an experiment-such a surrender if
there be in me a something a force an
entity distinct from however closely allied
with my normal self which desires to con-
trol me to possess me to use me for ends
of its own i am determined to resist it until
at least i can gain some further under-
standing of its nature and of its relation to
me

  i have already fallen too much under the
dominion of these fancies  will try the
effect of rigorous application to the research
for which i came hither the dusk of the
long english summer day has fallen and i
will go out and walk amid the crowds of
london streets and try to free myself from
this enchanted mood

chapter iv

 a small villa near twickenham

i live too much alone and my mind
feeds upon itself it might have been
wholesomer to plunge into the present
life of london enter into the thoughts and
feelings of the people keep my ears alert
for the alarm of zeppelin attacks read the
daily accounts in the newspapers of vicissi-
tudes at the front accept opportunities to
attend sessions of parliament make myself
a sympathetic and informed part of this
greatest crisis of known history i might
have lived thus had joan remained with
me-and i have more than once considered
seeking out her and my brother-in-law in
france and seeing actual passages of the
terrible struggle but ive done nothing of
all this

  it may be want of resolution to obey
what any common sensible person would
call the dictates of common sense but it
may be that i am governed by the injunc-
tions of a sense that is not common or at
least is not commonly heeded in animals
it is called instinct in man intuition in
either case it is a spiritual leading the
simple structure of the animal mind disables
them from rejecting this leading but mens
minds have become so sophisticated by in-
ferences deductions doubts by all the
subtle jugglery of cause and effect that they
mistrust the hints and guidance of the spirit

and laboriously reason their way through
life as tropical explorers chop their path
through the jungle with a machete they
are confirmed in this procedure by the
pucklike suggestions of all manner of
anomalous impulses often of physiological
origin or the fruit of idle and selfish pro-
pensity having been misled or betrayed
by these they shake their heads at the fine
call of the inner voice they can no longer
discriminate between the authentic and the
bogus

  common sense tempts me at times but
intuition holds me still i will see this
adventure through to the end and though
i am still groping in the mists of perplexity
and conjecture the results which i have
attained warrant me in persevering

  for a time indeed after my last writing
here i turned my back on mrs blodgetts
rooms and the british museum alike and
went exploring in london neighborhoods
one sunny morning i took a taxi out to
richmond on the thames dismissed it
there and proceeded on foot the principal
street of the town conveys a pleasant
antique impression and some of the ivy-
grown mansions and precincts had a familiar
aspect which disappeared however upon a
more categorical examination conscious-
ness has a sort of penumbra made up i
suppose of anticipation or of remembered
information which if left undisturbed in
its harmless function plays pretty tricks of
this kind

  i lingered on the hog-backed bridge and
could fancy that i had leaned on that gray
stone parapet before and enjoyed the soft
mirror which the river held beneath the
dense overhanging foliage of the winding
margin toward the north on the other
side of the bridge i saw the oak-covered
acclivity of richmond hill come down to
the water on the left and on the right green
lawns of private villas bordered by the
foot-path there is a quality in cultivated
country loveliness which given similar ele-
ments renders one scene reminiscent of
what one has seen before nature in her
infinite variety pretends to repeat herself

   passed on to the twickenham side
walking slowly and enjoyingly as if with a
beloved hand in mine it might be about
fires rekindled



a mile to the ancient church with its grave-
yard that stands as the outpost of the
village at the turn of the road

   before reaching this however i paused
before the gate of a villa itself invisible
behind its environing trees and shrubbery
when had i been accustomed to enter this
gateway and pace up that curving drive to
the villas door

  the gate stood open and i went in in
a moment or two the villa was revealed
built of gray stone with pointed gables and
projecting lower windows on the right was
outspread a down of silken turf a couple of
acres in extent protected from the road by
a hedge and a row of trees when and
with what companion had i known this
place

  i advanced toward the house which
seemed to be unoccupied but at this junc-
ture an elderly man with a stoop in his
gait came round the corner of the building
-a gardener apparently and eyed me
narrowly suspecting me perhaps of being a
german spy  is the house to let i
asked him by way of accounting for my
intrusion but before he could answer me
i found myself to my own surprise con-
tinuing  i used to live here a good many
years ago i said  and if you have the
keys i should like to look over the place
again 

   my sober appearance and matter-of-fact
speech relieved his misgivings perhaps he
mumbled something to which i paid no
attention and producing a bunch of keys
led me round to a side door and i entered
but i halted in the passageway  the
house has been altered i exclaimed
 there used to be a partition here there
was no doorway here in my time the
staircase seems different who has been
been living here

  my annoyance must have been percep-
tible in my tone the effect of the changes
was as if a clumsy hand had been intro-
ducing  improvements  into a picture by
an old master the walls had been re-
painted whatever was still recognizable
had a forlorn appearance-a mellow past
shamed by the invasion of a smart present

i appreciated more than ever the conserva-
tism of the blodgett dynasty

  the man mumbled explanations the
present owner had come into possession just
before the war he had made the improve-
ments for the better accommodation of the
bride he had been bringing home before
they could establish themselves he had been
called to the colors and was killed in the
first battle of the marne the widow had
gone back to her own family and the house
had stood vacant ever since

    has the second floor been altered too
i asked

    yes sir-all over more or less 

 i wont go any further i said  id
like to take a look at the garden though
 youll find the grounds pretty near as
they always was sir remarked the man
as we came out again

    this lawn is said to be one of the eldest
in england-it goes back to henry viiis
time i said pausing on the brink of the
broad silken carpet on which the sunshine
lay lovingly and the shadows of the trees
seemed to melt into it  there was a sun-
dial over yonder that had stood for five
hundred years

  theres no finer lawn in england
returned the man youll find no deeper turf
anywhere he picked up a stake and a
mallet that were leaning against the house
and with half a dozen blows drove the
stake three feet into the green surface he
drew it out again and showed me that the
pointed end had not yet reached through to
the soil the turf closed over the wound
like water it was all a dense mat of finely
interwoven roots the result of the constant
mowing of centuries

   yes  remember we put up a marquee
tent out there and the pegs left no trace
when we pulled them up i said  lets
have a look at the sun-dial

    its a bit crumbling sir but it  hold
out maybe a century yet observed the
man as he followed me across the grass
which sank elastic beneath our tread

   the sense of companionship which i had
lost inside the house had now returned she
and i had occupied the place during one
summer only and much of our time had
been spent in this verdurous and flowery
enclosure she dressed in white frocks the
sun sparkled on her hair we had plucked


all-story weekly

flowers of antique fashion in the garden
adjoining that faithful dark-haired wait-
ing-woman of hers had spread out rugs to
protect us from the damp and here had we
lain luxurious when the dial marked noon
and the blue shadow of the great lime-tree
had crept silently toward us over the fairy
grass-blades

  leaning back against the shaft of the
dial she had looked upon me with her
brilliant laughing eyes and had sung and
sung-ballads love ditties frolicsome arias
-oh never was nightingale to be compared
with that marvelous voice perfect love
perfectly enshrined and here i stood once
more surely would  but turn my head a
trifle i should see her at my shoulder
lovely loving fresh and radiant as ever

  the man had wandered off i could see
him stooping about in the garden at the left
cutting roses white tulips and purple chrys-
anthemums from their stalks i put my
arms round the ancient dial and rested my
head upon it i had not looked forward to
this i had thought that our house in lower
seymour street was our only trysting-place
but it all came flowing fragrantly back into
my memory now was it in truth a
hundred years ago- on the banks of the
thames near twickenham a small well-
appointed villa  yes i remembered it
all was that a nightingale singing among
the lime-trees

  the man came back after a while with
the flowers a friendliness had grown up
between us he seemed to have understand-
ing i ruffled his composure a little with the
present of a sovereign the flowers from
her garden stand on my table as i write

chapter v

the enchanted nightingale

the librarian when i next visited him
handed me a small book with greened
edges bound in brown leather some-
what defaced by time

   i wont be positive but this may be of
service to you he said  very few copies
are known the volume contains four num-
bers of a magazine which was issued about
 it follows ostensibly the plan of

addisons spectator but it was really a
rather bitter political compilation directed
against the prince regent and his party it
was suppressed soon after the appearance of
the fourth number the articles are mostly
in the form of fables or fairy tales-a crude
symbolism thinly disguising personal refer-
ences the real name of the editor is not
known william godwin has been sug-
gested but the evidence is far from con-
vincing there is a satirical skit in sonnet
form which has been ascribed to lord
byron with small visible justification ex-
cept that its very savage but such specu-
lations wont interest you for the rest you
will judge for yourself

  this excellent gentleman always spoke as
if he were reading from a book he now
handed me the volume and departed to
encourage other students

  i took the book to a desk and opened it
without any lively anticipations

   the divinator by thoth jr was
the announcement on the title-page i
glanced over several articles until i came to
one in the form of a story called  the
enchanted nightingale the substance of
which i took down

  a daughter of the king of mesopotamia
princess ai-leen by name on a visit to
egypt sang so marvelously that she was
summoned before the pharoah who en-
chanted by her melodies offered her the
position of favorite in the royal palace she
however declined his offer declaring that
freedom was more to be desired than riches
or titles the pharaoh unaccustomed to
rebuffs meditated how he might be avenged
but because the princess had become great-
ly loved by the people and he being a
prudent monarch he did not deem it wise
to seize her openly and therefore bided his
time hoping to ensnare her by guile

  meanwhile there arrived in his dominions
from the princesss own country a gallant
young nobleman already renowned for war-
like exploits and accredited with letters
from the mesopotamian monarch to the
pharaoh his crest bore the device of a
lion and his title among his own people was
el-leon or as we should say sir lionel

  the occasion of the knights advent into
egypt was the crucifixion at the hands of a
fires rekindled



mesopotamian general of one am-bristah
a citizen of egypt and a subject of the
pharaoh who had thereupon threatened
war against mesopotamia but sir lionel
laid proofs before the pharaoh showing that
this am-bristah was a spy and outlaw and
that his execution was justified according to
the law of nations the pharaoh whose
army at this time was exhausted by long
conflicts with the ethiopians was secretly
glad of a pretext to avoid sending an expedi-
tion against mesopotamia he therefore
accepted the explanations of sir lionel and
even received him into special favor

  now it chanced that the young knight
wandering upon a time on the terrace of a
certain pavilion on the banks of nile heard
a sound of singing passing sweet so that
even the nightingales paused to listen con-
cealing himself behind a palm-tree he pres-
ently beheld an exceeding fair princess with
golden hair and clad in the robes of meso-
potamia who sang to the moon with a
music that ravished the hearers very heart
when the song was done the knight came
forward and knelt before her avowing him-
self her countryman and the slave of her
beauty and asking her wherefore she dwelt
in this remote spot instead of delighting the
court of the pharaoh with her divine gift
in reply she related to him the story of the
wrath of the monarch of egypt against her
because she had disdained his offers and
how she remained thus secluded lest he do
her some violence

  upon hearing this the knight laid at her
feet his homage and fealty and swore to
protect her against all enemies he told her
moreover that he had studied the art of
magic and would if she were willing trans-
form her into a nightingale and thus safe-
guard her against whomsoever went about
to bring evil upon her and withal he right
heartily besought her to grant him her love
as guerdon then the princess whose eyes
had been already filled with the knights
manly beauty and her heart won by his
devotion yielded him her favor and the
twain exchanged vows of everlasting love
kneeling before the altar of ashtoreth

  then bidding her close her eyes sir
lionel wove a spell upon the princess ai-
leen and lo she was transformed into the

form of a nightingale in whom none save
the knight might recognize the princess ai-
leen albeit she sang more sweetly than
ever and he took her to a secret bower
that had been made where he daily visited
her in secret and they loved each the
other and were exceeding happy

  but now the great goddess isis of the
egyptians from whom no secrets are hid
was wroth with the lovers because they had
taken their vows on the altar of ashtoreth
instead of on her own and she compassed
their destruction and first she appeared
before ai-leen in the guise of an humble
emissary of the people and told her that all
danger was passed because the pharaoh
had forgotten his passion and had alto-
gether ceased from anger toward her fear
not therefore o highly gifted one she
said  to cast aside thy disguise and go
forth and behold the people await thy
coming in the great temple that is built
upon the street of the high priest even
dru-ri there to acclaim thee and do thee
honor so spake isis and the princess
ai-leen gave ear to her words

  then did isis pass straightway into meso-
potamia to a great magician there named
asg-ard who before her flight into egypt
had held ai-leen in bondage but she had
escaped from the tower in which he held
her prisoner and had fled into egypt and
isis said to him  know o asg-ard that
thy princess abideth in egypt with her
paramour the knight el-leon and also
singeth before the people in the temple
dru-ri if therefore thou wouldst redeem
her gird thyself and depart straightway
into egypt even to the pharaoh for he is
covertly at enmity with the princess because
she scorned him and he shall aid thee to be
revenged upon her by means of a spell
cast upon her by el-leon she hath been
disguised under the form of a nightingale
but on a certain night she will cast aside her
disguise and appear in the temple before
the people and there in her tiring-room
after the singing thou mayst come upon her
by surprise and do further as seems good
to thee

  having thus spoken the goddess isis
vanished behind her veil and the magician
girded himself and went down into egypt


all-story weekly

  now all came to pass according to the
word of isis for ai-leen trusting in the
false emissary and sir lionel agreeing
thereto prepared for her appearance before
the people in the temple but the magician
gained audience of the pharaoh and pros-
trating himself before him unfolded the
word of the goddess then pharaoh mused
a space and answered  the boon is granted
thee but hear the condition if thou in
any manner betrayest my privity in this
matter i will disown and denounce thee
and deliver thee up to the people for they
have taken theprincess to their hearts inso-
much that even i the pharaoh dare not
have my will of her but if thou observest
this condition and attainest to lay hands
upon her and the matter be brought before
me for judgment i will hold thee blameless
declaring to the people that she was thy
slave beforetime and that thou hast but
done what was just with thine own and
against sir lionel likewise will i protect
thee saying that he is a robber coming
hither from a far country to spy out our
land of egypt and doing what was unlawful
to her to whom i had shown favor for
he too hath the art of magic and if he
discovereth thy purpose will doubtless strive
to overcome thee

  then answered the magician  thy coun-
sel o pharaoh is written on my heart and
i will in all ways be obedient thereto so
pharaoh and the magician contrived to-
gether how their plot against the princess
ai-leen might succeed

  now ai-leen knowing naught of these
things and believing that the pharaoh had
ceased from anger toward her put on fitting
raiment and went to the temple on the day
appointed where was assembled a great
multitude to listen to her singing so she
sang before them and the multitude praised
and extolled her saying  there is none in
the land of egypt fit to untie the strings of
her sandal and they rejoiced exceedingly
among themselves

  after all was done and the multitude
gone their ways ai-leen went to her tiring-
room to disrobe herself the room was in
the top of a high tower the stairway to
which was well guarded howbeit the
magician by his arts had prevailed to come

thither before the princess and even then
lay in wait for her and when ai-leen
entered he sprang upon her and pinioned
her and would have borne her back to
imprisonment but she struggled strongly
against him and sent forth her voice in a
piercing call to her lover to come and succor
her and behold he her lover sir lionel
was even then ascending the stair to convey
her with him to their bower and hearing
her outcry he made great haste and burst
open the door of the tiring-room and saw
his beloved in the hands of asg-ard and
the wrath of sir lionel was kindled exceed-
ingly against the magician and he put forth
his strength and caught him by the throat
so the two wrestled together with ai-leen
between them but sir lionels strength
was great and he began to prevail over the
magician

  but when the magician saw that he was
overpowered he took from his girdle a
dagger and smote ai-leen through the
heart and her spirit left her body and she
died then sir lionel in his mighty rage
and anguish grasped the magician in his
arms and hurled him through the window
of the high tower and he fell to the stones
of the pavement and was dashed to pieces
and sir lionel cast himself down beside the
body of his beloved and wept in his agony
and the servants of the temple found him
there

  and all this while pharaoh patiently
waited in his private chamber to hear tid-
ings from the magician and he gnawed
the nails of his fingers because the tidings
came not

  but at last there was the noise without
of one crying and running even of aroyal
messenger who came into the presence of
the pharaoh and prostrated himself and
said  o king live forever  am the
bearer of grievous tidings she whom thou
didst honor the sweet singer the princess
ai-leen lies slain and likewise he that was
with thee of late is crushed upon the stones
at the foot of the tower of the temple and
the valiant warrior el-leon cherisheth her
body in his arms and will not be comforted
and the people are angered because of her
death and say that thou didst conspire with
the stranger to destroy her and they cry for
fires rekindled



justice against thee and great multitudes
with spears and swords are even now on
their way hither to demand of thee an
accounting

  and as he finished speaking there came
from without the roar of the multitude at
the gates of the pharaohs palace and he
trembled and was afraid

  and he said in his heart  verily this is
an evil happening for el-leon knowing
that i desired the princess will inflame the
people against me saying that i compassed
her death by the hand of the magician
what therefore shall i do o isis save
me 

  and the goddess who heareth all things
answered  go forth and meet the people
bearing thyself as one without fear make
oath before them that thou art innocent of
this deed laying all blame thereof upon the
magician who is dead and cannot deny
thee and to el-leon say that thou grievest
with him in his grief and but that the
magician is already dead his life should be
forfeit for the slaying of the princess ai-
leen the sweet singer of mesopotamia
this do and fear nothing thus spake the
goddess from behind her veil being content
with her vengeance

  then went the pharaoh forth to the mul-
titude and spake to them according to the
word of isis and they believed him and
departed but sir leon was sore perplexed
and neither believed nor disbelieved but
stood with his hand upon his sword ques-
tioning in his heart  shall  leap upon him
and slay him or let him go

  but as he stood there there was heard a
sound as of a bird singing even a nightin-
gale though no bird was seen and to sir
leon the singing was as that of ai-leen
his beloved and he heard as it were her
voice saying  be comforted o my lover
for wrongs are not requited by the sword
and i am free and will be with thee forever
return in peace to thine own land i will
abide in thy heart and discourse with thee
there and our spirits shall be united nor
shall aught disturb our happpiness any
more and other things more wonderful
than these did the voice of the enchanted
nightingale sing or say to him but of these
the chronicler revealeth naught

  and the great goddess isis smiled behind
her veil

chapter vi

the veil of isis

the librarian walking his beneficent
rounds again paused at my desk

 did you find any matter in the
little book pertinent to your investigation
he inquired in his friendly way  ive only
glanced through it myself but i recalled
catching the name lionel-your ancestors
name i think you said-and the year being
 i fancied there might be something
referring to his mission here

  is there any record to your knowledge
i asked in return  of a singer from abroad
-from the united states possibly-a mrs
asgard aileen or aline asgard-who gave
a private performance before the regent
at buckingham palace and afterward fell
into disfavor with him perhaps from not
having been compliant enough with the
royal gentlemans wishes i have some
grounds for suspecting that my ancestor
may have had some relations with her and
that she was killed under mysterious cir-
cumstances in her dressing-room at drury
lane theater such an event might account
for some obscurities

  the librarian crossed his arms laying one
finger across his chin-his attitude when
searching the alcoves of that encyclopedic
memory of his

   seems to me there was a tragic occur-
rence about that period - mrs asgard
aline asgard an american im almost sure
there was a cause celebre-and that the
regent was suspected of a connection with
it but the investigation was discontinued
if im not mistaken-suppressed you know
presumably for that very reason court
intrigues are apt to be problematic and
were especially so in the regents time
asgard i think there was a norwegian
musician or composer of that name may
have been the ladys husband though she
herself was as you suggest a country-
woman of captain heathcotes my im-
pression is-but i confess im very vague
on the subject-losing my memory i sup-


all-story weekly

pose-that both asgard and aline asgard
were involved in some accident or catas-
trophe at a theater but of captain heath-
cotes share if any in the affair  could
hardly-er-hardly-

  of course of course i muttered
 youre very wonderful as it is 

   ill tell you though he rejoined
brightening under the eulogium  there
ought to be some mention in the legal
records or state archives of that date of any
transaction of which the law might take
cognizance documents you know have a
way of turning up if one camps on their
trail-as you americans say-persistently
enough and i think within a day or two i
may be able to furnish you with data
which-

   youre very kind i said  but the
light you have already shed on the darkness
may be enough to help me out of my diffi-
culties the prince regent-

  ah a sad dog a sad dog said the
librarian shaking his head  no woman
was safe from him and he showed consider-
able ingenuity in covering his traces too
still we wont despair as your american
poet emersonsays

        there is no sequestered grot

       no mountain tarn or isle forgot

       but justice journeying in the sphere

       daily stoops to harbor there

though it might be said that emerson him-
self as a poet has never yet had full justice
done him but his time will come his time
will come

  so the good gentleman hurried away and
i came back to my lodgings here and found
a long letter from joan awaiting me

   she has been nursing philip in one of the
base hospitals he progresses favorably and
he has incidentally seen much of the mar-
vels and the tragedies out yonder she
speaks of a wonderful pressing through of
the spiritual from the material in many of
the wounded and sick soldiers she talks
with many of them men who had never
before had any notion of anything above
their bodies she thinks it isnt a religious
revival in the ordinary sense but a new
era a new dispensation of the spiritual
world on earth men lying on the battle-

field have seen spiritual armies sweeping
by they have been led by spiritual guid-
ance to do things incredible some of them
have a strange look in their eyes as they
lie on their cots as if they were beholding
visions relatives of those who have died
have seen and spoken with what they be-
lieved to be their spirits this state hasnt
the characteristics of a contagious excite-
ment or delusion joan says but is quiet
and confident as if they spoke of every-day
and unquestionable things

  yes it may be that the thunders of arma-
geddon portend that after so many blind-
folded ages the veil of isis is being lifted
at last some of us atlast may consciously
be admitted to intercourse with souls disin-
carnate and hear nightingale notes of para-
dise how can i doubt it

  the french marshal seems to have
stemmed and turned the tide and the people
that pass me in the streets have the light of
victory in their faces the air that blows
toward us from the death-laden trenches
bears the scent of immortal roses in the
east the light of a new morning kindles the
mountain-tops

  the veil of isis-the veil of mortal
sense perhaps but though on this plane
of existence the body does but clothe a
spirit which was before and will be after
how can mortal sense make us aware of
spiritual beings or these have knowledge
of us to each its own to mingle them
would be confusion

  and yet the insight or inspiration of a
poet has affirmed that on his journey
through the world man  by the vision
splendid is on his way attended and that
nature may not at all times avail to make
him  forget the glories he hath known and
that imperial palace whence he came and
surely i have at moments caught  the
visionary gleam-the glory and the dream
it would be treason to the highest that is
in me to deny it

  aline asgard the sweet singer the wo-
man with dark sparkling eyes and red-gold
hair how has she beckoned me onward
now from this side now from that by what
paths of surprise and seeming accident but
always approaching nearer each glimpse of
her more veritable than the last with each
fires rekindled



advance the confusion seems to be dissi-
pated like night mists under the rising sun
and a truth and reason superior to our facts
and logic to appear what has wrought the
miracle is it love is it lack of love that
keeps us from heaven but one mystery
succeeds another and the final gate is never
passed what is love all my awakening
understanding tells me it is life but if i
ask what life is i am dazzled by rays pro-
ceeding from the source of the infinite

  aline and her lionel now that i have
so painfully learned her name i think i
always knew it but the recovery of it
renders her more distinct than before then
am i lionel is he something-some one-
hitherto unacknowledged who is more my-
self than i have ever been is he the
impulse the stirring the yearning to be
expressed far within the closed chambers
of my nature whose emergence some unex-
plained fear has always prompted me to
oppose fear of what-his rivalry but
how can the rivalry between the outer and
the inner self be other than wholesome and
purifying or i be worthy of aline if i
flinch from putting to the test my birthright
in her

  it is sunday afternoon and there is a
rhythm and swell of far-off music-the con-
gregation of some neighboring church as i
think praising god for the promise of
overcoming the worlds evil with good i
have opened all my windows and the door
of the bedroom a warm july air draws
through the apartment and the sunshine
falls aslant on the faded old carpet i am
probably alone in the house kittie the
chambermaid has her half-holiday and
good mrs blodgett though there be no
male of her kin at the front is none the less
conscientious in regular and punctual at-
tendance at her place of worship

  as i sit here in the great chair i am
reminded of a day in my boyhood at home
when i awaited in my room-i was con-
valescent from an illness i think-the re-
turn of my mother from an absence my
father had long since died and the relations

between my mother and myself had always
been very close and tender we had seldom
been out of each others reach but she
had been away and was now on her return
i might hear the wheels of the wagon at
any moment i sat there in a tenseness of
happy anticipation impatient but in a sort
of latent joy

  similar to this is my state now i am
sensible of the gradual oncoming of some
revelation or fulfilment  cant formulate
any forecast more precise i dont dread it
i welcome it and yet there is a kind of
awe in it perhaps it may be the approach
of death but no there is in it too
much of the fire and triumph of life for that

  i can write no more at present

chapter vii 

the veil grows thin

since our parting i have lived in a place
midway between an abyss and a moun-
tain where the sick and wounded of
earth go to be healed if seeds of health be
in them or if not to perish the dead go
down into the abyss those freed from death
ascend to their felicity but for our love

o	heart of my soul i should have chosen
death but because our love could not die i
live and our reunion is near

  i tried to tell you of my coming but for
a long while my voice was muffled and i
was bound hand and foot when i would
speak my tongue stumbled as if its use
were forgotten i must as it were train a
dull and sluggish learner to utter my words
and do my will of myself  should have
failed but you helped me beloved your
light and beauty and music molded the clay
and warmed and guided it and now  know
that the stumbling-block was in truth some
ignorant image of myself which animated
and instructed by our mutual desire should
at last understand and serve

  of what is to come for us we know and
need know no more than that in every
thought emotion and sense we shall be one

    	this is not in my usual handwriting though beyond question no other hand than mine can
have written it it covers several pages of my journal immediately succeeding the foregoing entry
such phenomena are of course familiar to modern experts in the  occult but new in my personal
experience-j h


all-story weekly

but the impulse rushes upon me to recover
our beginnings so that the foundations of
our house of happiness may be established
and its symmetry complete for whatever
is immortal has its root in time and the
loveliness of its fulfilment is not compre-
hended till its source be known

  on a spring day with some chance com-
panion i sat me down among a multitude
in a hall of audience where musicians fiddled
and blew a careless soldier indifferent to
beauty unconscious as yet of his own soul
but as i sat there immersed in my vain
musings the instruments were hushed and
a voice clear pure and ravishing ascended
and soared out of the stillness gathered
power magically shivered deliciously in my
heart rose again to slenderest pinnacles of
ecstasy and tinted the air with tremulous
rainbows i looked up and saw a slim
figure white-armed with ruddy hair and
dark jewel eyes under wide clear brows
she stood erect and serene as a moorish
column robed in shimmering black pranked
with blue ribbons on shoulder and flank
i had marched to drum and fife but music
was created for me in that hour and she
that sang was musics incarnation

  all that had preceded that hour was an
abandoned and meaningless desert and i
was born when she had gone out i read
on the program  mrs emma aline
asgard aline aline the name printed
itself on my soul like a slender lily in an
illuminated missal her other names did
not concern me-garments worn before the
world-but aline was mine in the primal
morning we belonged to each other and all
temporal accidents since then for her or for
me were trifles without substance which
the breath of love should blow away

  let me go to her but that fat bedizened
tailors block in the royal box had sent her
a message-she had won his gracious appro-
bation an american soldier who had seen
his lobster-backs scuttle and crave mercy
couid be heedless of court etiquette i
stepped before him and took your hand in
mine your eyes laughed and sparkled and
you said  at my house-warming thurs-
day i kissed your hand saw the jowls
of his royal highness grow purple and went
out what cared i for favor at court for

the success of my mission who had made
my tryst with you

   but on that day our words were few for
 again a crowd surrounded you only our
 hands and our looks met and we foresaw
 i think what was to come  to-morrow
 i shall be alone hours after at sundown
 i found myself leaning on richmond
 bridge having walked thither conscious
 only of your radiance in my heart in the
 trees of kew over the still waters nightin-
 gales sang but your voice was sweeter than
 theirs 

   i waited in the quiet room with its green
 walls damaskened with gold i had brought
 a little gift for you of a book lately writ
 by a young poet after reading in which the
 night before i had written to the heart of
 my soul from lionel it was the poesy
 of love and therefore ours i laid it on the
 table and beside the table was a great arm-
 chair and i said  in that chair will we
 two sit and read the book together then
 the door of your chamber opened and we
 were face to face as we looked in each
 others eyes you knew that the arms of
 my soul were around you and you swerved
 back a little not in fear but in a lovely
 coquetry as who should say  ask a bless-
 ing ere you drink   bowed myself before
 you in the true reverence of a knight before
 his lady in my rough journey through the
 world i had little heeded law or measure
 but in you i knew my law and my gospel

    stand there exquisite and adorable
 i said  and let me drink you with my
 eyes

   so you stood there within arms reach
 in your soft dark raiment a lock of your
 red-gold hair dropping to your shoulder
 now glancing up in seriousness now lower-
 ing your lids with a half smile and a long
 breath rounded your bosom like a doves
 and then subsided

   at length my gaze still unquenchably
drinking you you began to palpitate and
said plaintively  never before did a mans
eyes so burn me is it lest you forget me

    how can i not gaze on you who have
been prophesied to me from the beginning
of the world

    i had thought i came into the world to
 please ears rather than eyes
fires rekindled



   you came for the delight of all senses
and each whets the others appetites you
are poetrys soul and music till you sang
was but a hope you have created me and
though as yet i do your skill small credit
have patience and finish your work

  you laughed like the mounting thrill of
a bird and tossed your head flowerlike
 was it for the making-over of grown
men do you think that i crossed the
ocean

   you lack still one step of your journeys
end i said  come what is one step to
the wide ocean

  then you searched me with a grave and
deep look

  it is the longest step in the world
you said

  it is the world itself i answered
 come put it behind you 

  you crossed your arms over your breast
clasping each shoulder with the other hand
as if on the brink of a gulf your eyes still
searching me

   we have been prisoners too long i
said there is but one freedom and i
held out my arms but you said

  i am content as i am why do you
disquiet me

   it is love that disquiets us both and
now only love can give us peace i an-
swered  you bade me stand here and
here i am and here i stay unless some one
takes me you said with tears and smiles
at once

  after that there was no need of words

   i am to sing to-day-you must go
now you said but in the very saying it
your arms came round my neck and your
lips were so close that mine felt them speak

  there was a portrait of the prince upon
the wall with his compliment writ on it
 knew that you had been commanded to
the palace that afternoon and he had sent
you this portrait by the messenger my
anger rose up against him

   are we to be parted at this pleasure
i demanded

  you made me sit in the great chair and
perched yourself on my knee

   hear me only beloved of my soul and
body you said  you and i have con-

    	a-s

sen ted for our loves sake to forget the
world but we cannot forget it if we begin
by fighting it the prince is the world let
his picture hang there but you are flesh
and blood and spirit to whom only will my
door ever open since the reality is ours
we may leave the world its shadows i
left the cruel cage that tortured me on the
other side and you too took your liberty
shall we tempt them to molest us by pro-
claiming our happiness to be free to
meet our meeting must be secret silently
step by step like nymphs and fauns in the
forest we can withdraw while the worlds
thoughts are turned elsewhere but if we
shout defiance we shall be pursued and
hunted down dearest let me sing my
songs for a time they protect that of
me which even you could not protect and
when i see my audience listen breathless
i feel a better right to be yours than if
that power were lost to me my only
pleasure in honor is to honor you if we
became outcasts only my naked self would
be left for your compensation my art
is my shield and my crown what answer
could  make to god if i abandoned it
all the more do i need it since your love
has made me sacred in my own eyes at
best peril waits on all who take the law
into their own hands what the end may
be we cannot tell let us not tempt it
wantonly 

   i sighed and kissed you  may i come
here after you return i asked you

  then you ran to your harpsichord that
stood by the partition and played and
sang

 come in the evening or come in the morning
come when youre looked for or come without
warning

kisses and welcome youll find here before you
and the oftener you come feere the more ill
adore you

   so i let the prince hang there and went
out and walked london streets my mind
full of wonder and my heart of worship
till evening and then came back and hung
about the shadows of the corner like a
foot-pad till i saw your coach drive up
then i ran up and as the door opened i
caught in my arms the muffled figure that

alighted-but it was not you but your
dark-haired maid nellie how your laugh
made music in the silent street as you came
after so in we went i stepping lightly
lest old caleb blodgett the landlord hear
me in spite of his deafness and afterward
nellie-a quiet and skilful handmaiden
who like all who come near you adores you
-made a little supper for us most of
which i that had fasted since breakfast
and was full of happiness and hunger de-
voured you feeding me white-fingered and
sparkling-eyed while you told of your tri-
umph-indeed the table was heaped with
the flowers they had showered on you
when nellie had cleared away the dishes
and said her good-night you lay in my
arms a while in our big chair and kissed
me for the book of poetry and for joy
and for love oh how sweet and slender
you were in your rustling silken frock
through which i felt the warmth of your
fragrant body

  one day we had been for sport to have
the famous ayub tell our fortunes and
then out to our villa at twickenham where
the lawn was softer than the cushions of
the grand turks harem and nellie
brought us a dish of tea beside the old
sun-dial under the tree where the night-
ingale sings at evening

  you said  we should have asked him
for a spell to change me into a nightingale
so that you could have taken me about
with you safely

  he told us to beware of a man from
across the sea i said   think he and
i will meet some day-the last day of his
life

  sooner let it be the last day of mine
you murmured turning pale  lionel to
kill him would part us forever

   not that he is your husband but that
he mistreated you but for that he might
live for what i care but why do we
speak gravely of the maunderings of a
lying charlatan had master ayub warned
us against a prince we might have given
heed

   the prince t would as little fear a
stuffed doll as that poor creature be-
sides you said kissing a white rose from

the vase and fastening it to my breast
 it is months since an audience has heard
me sing and the prince has forgotten me
grand turks have short memories love of
my life

   could any man that has looked in your
eyes and heard your voice forget you
you would be remembered in the dust of
the grave

  when the english summer was done we
planned for italy there had been many
letters beseeching you to sing once more
and betimes one morning while i at the
window idly cut the letters of our names
on the oaken window-shutter and you sat
before your mirrow binding up your glitter-
ing hair you said  dearest heart shall
i give them one song more

  i looked around at you sitting there in
your soft blue morning-robe your naked
arms lifted and your supple hands busied
with the golden braids the outline of your
delicate cheek pure against the shadows
of the further chamber and the image of
your face in the mirror which reproduced
its hues but faintly as if it were your
own wraith looking back at you from an-
other world and thinking of the glories and
eternities of joy which that little room had
held for me in the gift of yourself my
heart swelled with a loving tenderness well
nigh beyond bearing surely god has
made us for each other and if in the
years while we were blindly seeking each
other we had turned aside from the true
path it was but that the union to come
might be more perfect

  in the summer days now past while
under the magic of love you had muted
your nightingale notes from the ear of the
world and made yourself invisible in our
nest under the lime trees foregoing fame
and applause for loves sake-we had dwelt
together in a fairy-land enchantment that
seemed to remove us forever from memory
or desire of outer things yet i had
learned to recognize the sovereignty of art
in the artist who needs to express the gift
as the plant its blossom and if the expres-
sion be too strictly or too long withheld
forfeits also something of the vigor and
delight of spiritual life and that hint of
fires rekindled



yours that you be permitted ene song-one
public triumph more struck me with re-
morse that i had selfishly bound your di-
vine genius to a privacy too close

  i put an arm about your neck and as
you leaned back your head upon it kissed
your upturned lips

   your glory is mine beloved i said
 go forth and lead captivity captive the
great theater shall be prepared for you
you give me a hundredfold what you give
them renew your reign over them and
shame them of their earthly dynasties the
skies of venice will be the brighter above
us for the fogs you dispel in london 

  you may have caught an accent in my
extravaganza that raised some ghost of a
doubt of its full integrity but our embrace
overbore it and my owh heart repudiated
it if i had misgivings i banished them
your eyes held mine for a moment in one
of those looks that explore beyond mortal
plummets but i blindfolded you with
kisses and you were reassured one song
more and then for italy

  events not yet born in earthly time
create currents in the spiritual atmosphere
which we sometimes heed but oftener dis-
regard twice when i had been on my
way to you i had been aware of a tall
figure walking near with heavy eyebrows
and bushy grizzled hair-something for-
eign in his aspect once when i had
borne a communication from our minister
to his royal highness this same figure
 fancied had appeared at the end of the
corridor but had turned aside before we
met and closed a door behind him

  once our minister himself had said to
me in private  a certain personage i
think has not forgotten a slight you put
upon him some time since dont rely too
much on formal professions of favor we
diplomats must always be circumspect

  but i was confident and full of pre-
figurings of our happiness to come-a long
lifetime of undisturbed communion mean-
while all preparations were made in the
great theater for your farewell song and
all london was eager to hear you and
though on the morning of the day it was
given out that previous arrangements made

it impossible that the royal box should be
occupied it caused no abatement in the
enthusiasm of the people who had made
you their uncrowned queen and little con-
cerned themselves with the movements of
other royalties

  on the morning of that day i had been
closeted with our minister to close up some
affairs before taking the leave of absence
for which i had already applied and which
would be longer than he imagined

  at parting he pushed aside the papers
and looked kindly upon me

   captain heathcote he said  young
as you still are you have shown qualities
which justify the forecast of a distinguished
career for you-it may be a very great
one but i have observed faults too-
chiefly such as belong to youth and a free
temper-which in affairs of state might
seriously impede you to a young man
certain hopes certain purposes may appear
cogent which the judgment of later years
might rate less high a man must choose
finally between personal and public in-
terests in your case i might perhaps say
between himself and his country-his love
for what concerns himself alone and that
impersonal passion that we call patriotism
he may imagine that secrecy and discre-
tion may enable him to follow the one
without abandoning the other but experi-
ence of the world proves that things the
most secret are often proclaimed from the
housetops no barriers or silences can safe-
guard them and in casting up his last
account and striking the balance he may
find that the impersonal passion would have
been the wiser pardon this little homily
from a man older than yourself you may
neither need nor heed it but i beg you to
believe that only the most cordial interest
in your fortunes prompted me to utter it

   i so understand it i said  i thank
you and shall not forget it and whatever
fate lies before me i shall rejoice to have
met you and won your good will

  with that we clasped hands and said
farewell

  in years to come i thought when we
had long rested secure in our felicity i
might relate to you this interview and
we would smile at the wisdom of this

world which to gain success in life would
leave life itself out of the reckoning but
i would not speak of it to-day when you
were bending your thoughts and summon-
ing your energies for the signal event of
a few hours hence

  as i went up the darksome stairway
of our little london lodging the sound of
your voice at the harpsichord testing it-
self at passages of the coming performance
came to my ears like warblings of the birds
of eden oh unmatched and unmatch-
able one a moment of that music were
worth an age of an existence unknowing
of it yet was it but the imperfect ex-
pression of the lovely and beloved source
from which it came

  at my entrance you sprang from your
seat and gathered yourself into my arms
like a beautiful and tender bird all atremor
with art and love

  hearts darling you said how
immeasurably more precious than all other
things are you to me ive been thinking
that perhaps it was wrong and foolish of
me to wish this last meeting with the
people it was only that i desired you
to be proud of me-to feel that in giving
you my poor self i was bringing you some-
thing higher and better but ive had
doubts fears of i know not what tell
me the truth dearest and if it be your
pleasure we will even now send a message
to the theater and set out to-night for
venice 

  i laughed and kissed your sweet breath
away

   because we are to take our ease in
venice is no reason for foregoing your
victory to-night i said  you are over-
wrought by the anticipation as always
when you sing your best lie quiet here
in my arms and rest and be at peace
to-night when all is over you will laugh
at these misgivings and rejoice that you
overcame them

   oh blessed afterward i wish it were
now

   think how i am worshiping you
while you sing i said  and outdo even
all you have done before feel my kisses
on your lips giving them courage to en-
chant the world all will be well

  from my place in the theater i saw you
stand slender and alone before that mighty
audience while those divine notes hushed
them to breathlessness and lifted them to
ecstasy when the last strain had died
away there came a wondering silence and
then an outbreak like storm-waves suddenly
thundering upon an entranced shore above
that enormous tumult i saw your dark
eyes sparkle in a smile from your pure
face all the multitude was on its feet
and men were struggling to cast garlands
on the stage before you

  i turned and fought my way against the
throng striving to reach the stair that led
to your tiring-room where we were to meet
though much delayed and buffeted i came
to it at last and began to mount the
narrow windings toward your aerie ere i
was half-way up i heard a scream that
plunged through my soul like a rapier-
your voice in deadly peril i leaped up-
ward swifter than a bodiless thought and
flung myself against the door it was
torn from its hinges and i plunged inward

  note-the narrative breaks off here and is not
resumed-j h

old memoranda-ll

i have several times reread the forego-
ing attempting to trace in some part
of it participation conscious and inde-
pendent of my own mind in a certain
sense which i cant precisely define the
entire contents appear to me deeply fa-
miliar-as if they treated of events sights
emotions which had been both forgotten
and were yet when thus set forth in-
teriorly recognizable but i cannot charge
myself with having knowingly formed a
single sentence and i shall provisionally
regard the writing-which more resembled
the script in the old volume of  endy-
mion  than my own-as belonging to the
phenomenon which physic professors term
 trance-writing

  in a sort of structural coherence with
my own previous entries in this journal
however it seems to claim a place in the
fires rekindled	

logical continuity of an experience which
i shall not at present characterize beyond
remarking that it is inexplicable on or-
dinary grounds and unprecedented i will
add that i find myself unable to supple-
ment from any sources of my authentic
memory the narrative which some inad-
vertent movement of my own or external
accident may have interrupted  might
no doubt on a basis of probable conjec-
ture complete a description of the episode
but i am particularly solicitous to suffer no
invasion of that kind to corrupt the in-
tegrity of this record

  for days past i have been intending to
revisit the museum library but was with-
held by an obscure reluctance which i this
morning only overcame in the interval
i discontinued writing and tramped over
some of the environs of london-hamp-
stead highgate blackheath greenwich-
with no declared object in view and with
no result unless it be an improvement in
my appetite and general physical condi-
tion but to-day on a sudden impulse i
renewed my edifying intercourse with the
librarian

  you enter like an actor on his cue
he declared  ive been mousing about
in odd moments as my habit is-and
its wonderful sir how prolific odd mo-
ments may prove-and this very morning
i happened on something which i think
may have a bearing upon your inves-
tigation 

   the period of the regency as you
know is a trifle difficult for the explorer
whether by chance or design many prom-
ising  leads  land one in a cul-de-sac the
regent had many private interests and
affairs which were also half public if you
know what i mean and in his desire-
natural no doubt-to conceal the private
part he might find it necessary to obliterate
the public record along with it but to
come to the point-i have unearthed a
little bundle of memoranda kept for his
private use by a member of the bar from
about  to  among which are in-
cluded notes of information supplied by
hissolicitors in various cases that came into
his hands parts of the memoranda are

missing and in others there are erasures
or lacunas but taken by long and large
they give one as i might say a line

   now one of these copies of informa-
tion refers to a tragic incident which took
place at the theater royal drury lane
in the autumn of  in which the name
of your ancestor occurs i have the papers
hene under my arm take a desk and
ill indicate the passages that seem espe-
cially pertinent

  i sat down accordingly-i have never
seen the librarian seated-and bending over
me with the papers on the desk he turned
them over as he proceeded

   performance drury lane principal
attraction mrs e aline asgard american
husband a norwegian composer from
whom she was separated on grounds of
cruelty-h-m h-m mr asgard had ar-
rived quietly in london-h-m in conse-
quence of information to effect that h r
h had betrayed interest-ah an erasure
-here we pick it up-had granted several
private audiences to asgard in conse-
quence of which under sanction of h r
h asgard laid plans to-page missing
here i fancy-h-m all here we begin
again obtained access either before or
during performance to her private dressing-
room in upper story of building-coach in
waiting below-as she entered room seized
and attempted to gag her-vide testimony
of mrs as maid-captain lionel heath-
cote overhearing screams hastened up the
stairs and entered room

   well my dear sir there you are
examine the report at your leisure dur-
ing the struggle as you will see the lady
received an immediately fatal wound
when attendants of the theater entered
they discovered her lifeless in captain
heathcotes arms the window of the room
shattered and soon afterward the dead
body of asgard on the pavement below
legal questions to be determined-by what
person or persons were these homicides in-
flicted or was either or were both of them
cases of jelo de se what connection if
any had or did captain heathcote hold
in respect to mr and mrs asgard

   maid testified in effect that asgard
killed his wife and that in the struggle


all-story weekly

following captain heathcotes appearance
asgard fell or was forced out of the window
but prosecution contends maids testimony
untrustworthy as being interested party-
and so on and so on quite a pretty
little nut for legal teeth to crack you
see but study the documents for your-
self-i merely glanced over them you will
notice that on the eve of trial the govern-
men withdraws charges against captain
heathcote and indicates acceptance of the
double suicide theory query whether this
action was inspired from a higher source
in order to block investigation which might
expose connivance or conspiracy of eminent
personage-but all that is crossed out

   you will note that united states min-
ister richard rush who had taken an
attitude in support of captain heathcote
expressed himself satisfied-and so forth
and so on the captain is thought to have
returned to his own country-as was per-
haps only natural-to be expected you
know his availability as a diplomatic
agent would be invalidated by such an oc-
currence of course and so the waters close
above the scene of the tragedy and the
river flows on as before quite a little
romance with a tang of mystery as the
novelists would say but i must be run-
ning along-if i can be of any assistance
let me know-ive merely outlined the situ-
ation ah i see professor hvndman
beckoning me-he wants that palimpsest
yes professor

  the amiable interminable chatter ceased
and i was left to myself with the old bar-
risters memoranda i leaned my elbows
on the desk and closed my eyes

  i had listened to the ripple of his talk
with my outward ears but within i was
enacting the drama itself with a passionate
intensity and particularly that omitted no
detail either objective or subjective i
heard the scream i was bounding up the
stair t was in the room the gray-haired
ruffian was writhing in my grasp his left
hand clinging to her who was the heart of
my soul whose red-gold hair flying loose
brushed my cheek whose dark eyes even
at that moment sent into mine a look of
love unutterable in a blur beyond was
the crouching moaning figure of nellie

  ha a knife-as my fingers found his
throat the blow fell and the blade sank
to the hilt not in my breast but in hers
in the whirl and frenzy that followed there
was a crash of glass a splintering of wood
and i stood panting and alone with her
worshiped body at my feet one white
arm flung out face downward the turgid
lamplight glittering on her hair i kneel
down slowly and tenderly lift her oh
the hilt of that murderous knife stiffly
protruding like the stump of some black
plant of hell from her sweet breast be-
loved face that has so often been pillowed
thus on my arm in slumber or in waking
but in love always body still warm
still supple and exquisite as in our kindlings
and trances of delight but gradually chilling
and stiffening in the trance that lasts
forever

  in that hour no whisper or admonition
of immortality found way to me but i was
buried in a blackness of despair in which
my own soul seemed to be conquered by
death in that blackness i sought her in
vain

  after a time the duration of which i
could not measure i lifted my face from
my hands and looked about me above
rose the hollow of the great dome of the
library around were the studious alcoves
and the circular sweep of the desks with
figures bent over them busied with books
or writing other figures pacing leisurely or
hastening muffled sounds soft echoes the
present sunk into the past but the present
still but the vision of a century ago was
as yet more vivid and real to me than the
life of the passing moment it faded by
imperceptible degrees

  i yawned and stretched my cramped
arms and legs mechanically collected the
papers into an orderly pile reached for my
hat and got up heavily from my chair
a neighboring student said something to
me but i stared vacantly at him and made
no reply presently i found myself stand-
ing in the chilly outer air at the top of
the gray stone steps that descended to the
street was it i that stood there or some
other wearing my shape i peered this
way and that with a sense of estrangement
from what met my eyes but my lodgings
fires rekindled



lay somewhere over yonder i went down
the steps and mingled with the human
flow along the sidewalk as i mended
my pace the unreal impressions fell away
and i reached my door in a normal mood

chapter ix

the rending of the veil

an unexpected message from joan who
 has arrived back in london with
philip the armistice is concluded
she and her husband are proposing to visit
america and she asks me to come to them
to-morrow-they wish me to go with them

  i feel no present inclination to do so
it is true that i have no intention of
further pursuing the investigation for which
i came here like saul who went forth in
quest of his fathers asses i have found
a kingdom-a kingdom of spiritual revela-
tion the discovery of which has worked
changes in me that are deep-lying but
which i believe have not yet arrived at a
satisfactory conclusion-something i dont
know what still awaits me this may be
a baseless assumption but i shall remain
here until it is either exposed as such or
some alternative is confirmed however i
will call on the dalrymples to-morrow it
will be easy to excuse my refusal of their
invitation

  i have just lighted my lamp and my
watch tells me that two hours have passed
since i wrote the preceding passage at
this time of year london daylight is brief
but those two hours have sufficed me to
complete the longest journey mortal man
can undertake and return to the place
whence he set forth in homers story the
touch of athene causes ulysses to recover
the youth that he had lost many years be-
fore and the youthful love that was its
inspiration

  i can read into that episode a meaning
truer and broader than any i had perceived
in it hitherto the transformation is not
magical but may take place in the life
of the humblest it may be suggested in
the statement that love and beauty are
not subject to the accidents of time but

in measure as their temporal manifestation
alters and decays these deathless qualities
retire into their own purer sphere where
they shine and bless immortally

  the event that has just happened is as
natural and simple as the genesis of flower
from seed-miraculous only as any func-
tion of nature involves miracle that is by
the concealment behind the screen of cause-
and-effect of the intrinsic infinite marvel
i cannot term it unexpected because at
the moment of its arrival i recognized it
as inevitable-the perfect consummation of
an approach subtly heralded from the be-
ginning nothing is changed except that
the horizon which was confined to a span
now finds its arc sweeping beyond the
galaxy and as no ones character can be
understood until death places the episodes
of his life in their right light and propor-
tions so the nature of spirit remains enig-
matic until the riddle of death is solved

  the state of which i have just had ex-
perience has been succeeded by another-
the  every-day  state of a man in posses-
sion of his proper senses and subjected to
his customary limitations the difference
between the two immense though it be
evades description because it is a difference
not of scene but of quality this homely
little apartment of mine its furnishings
and trivial characteristics didnt withdraw
from sight and touch they remained as
matter-of-course and obvious as they do
now but something additional which has
now ceased to manifest itself became mani-
fest and in its due season will return
obeying the rhythmic law of its order

  i know it will never be lost to me be-
cause it is in union with my own being-as
would the turning round of a greek vase
by turns reveal and withdraw a figure
sculptured upon it i cannot see and touch
now what was sensible to me a few minutes
ago this argues no change in the object
but only in my faculty of apprehending it
my vision cannot penetrate the marble
vase nor can it-save in its periods of
exaltation-pass through the veil between
physical and spiritual

  i set down these obvious reflections
merely as a sop to reason but reason as
i have said before is superseded by the

certainties of the soul these are on a
superior plane which corresponds with the
lower as does wisdom with light but we
cannot demonstrate from one to the other
an more than we can prove the mind in
terms of the bod-though the latter be
nevertheless but the cast in matter of the
former

  the bodily senses are the debatable
ground-the no-mans land-between the
two camps it is conceivable that they are
designed to function on both sides-that
man in his full estate should be as freely
conscious of spiritual as of physical phenom-
ena but we have either lost or have
not yet attained that double faculty and
in consequence of this defect we are prone
to regard the radii of our senses as de-
termining the limits of creation it would
rather seem that most matters of true im-
portance lie beyond it

  i linger at the threshold of what i have
to tell like a child that covers his eyes
with his hands lest the too-much beauty
of the christmas tree overpower him

  when the dusk made me lay aside my
pen i fell into a fit of pleasant musing in
this roomy old chair the singular in-
cidents of the preceding months passed
before me from that first shock of what
joan called the  been-here-before feeling
to the barristers memoranda of this morn-
ing discoveries in the realm of material
facts had all along fitted in with dis-
closures impressions suggestions from the
spiritual region in a sympathetic coopera-
tion like the systole and diastole of the
heart it was as if matter and spirit had
alternately taken me by the hand as it
were and both had led me toward the same
goal but the goal itself-what was it

  aline i knew had met me at my first
coming here and had ever since been near
or remote probably according to the pos-
ture of my own mind though upon the
whole each approach had been closer than
the last first a vague impression then
an imagination not distinctly defined later
a memory as of some one actually seen
and known later yet a vivid and poignant
vision which had caught my breath and
wrung my heart i had seemed to hold
her lifeless body in my arms but not

even then had i been led into confounding
an event of the past with the living present
there had been no hallucination

  as aline had advanced toward me on the
one hand lionel heathcote had come for-
ward on the other my flesh and bones
had progressively become the vehicle of his
manifestation in the narrative that he
had through me addressed to aline his
possession of me had been for the time
practically complete but during that time
i-what  must call myself was uncon-
scious of his action-i was in the condition
known as trance but during that brief
and terrible scene at the theater there had
been no question of distinguishing between
him and me and whether i should say
that i was he or that he was i is irrelevant
since we were one and the same-or to
come yet closer to what seems to be the
truth my memory had become identified
with his

  but what can be predicated of a person
whose memory is that of another true
i also have what i must call a memory of
my own-a connected series of personal
events from my early childhood to the
present there is no confusion between
this memory and that of a hundred years
ago the only interpretation appears to
be that the one is the continuation of the
other and that would mean in plain
words that lionel heathcote after the
natural termination of his own proper span
of existence was once more alive in me
and was intent upon establishing a con-
scious and full communion with the spirit
of the woman he had loved and lost in
the london of a century since

  this is as far as i can go toward placat-
ing uneasy reason it is all in vain and
it does not really concern me i am con-
tent with the revealed truth

  as i sat quietly in the dusk i felt all
at once with a delicious tremor of the
heart that aline was in the room if i
turned my head a little to the right i
should see her a very little would suffice
only that i feared to make even the slightest
movement lest it cause her to vanish i
had had impressions somewhat similar be-
fore and they had failed to develop this
influence however was more powerful
fires rekindled



than any preceding one it was that of
her substantial breathing propinquity-
something that might be touched and heard
as well as seen and indeed the faint fra-
grance always associated with her presence
was clearly perceptible she was there

  faith is the key of miracle  have
faith i said to myself

  i turned my head at last and looked
steadily in the direction where i felt her
to be

  the dusk had become darkness there
but to my unspeakable joy i at once dis-
cerned the figure that i sought it was
she she wore a flowing negligee of dark
blue silk with lace upon it and a wide
sash encircled her body just below the
breasts her arms and neck were bare and
with her face seemed warmly and softly
luminous her hair was wound turban-
wise about her head one lock hanging
down in a thick coil in front of her left
shoulder her eyes in shadow rested upon
me with a speaking intentness as if await-
ing a signal of recognition there was a
beautiful lightness in her pose not as if
she were unsubstantial but were filled like
the upgush of a fountain with a wonderful
vigor of life

  at moments however she seemed to
recede or to become dimmer i recognized
that these alternations accorded with the
strength of my faith thereupon with an
indrawing of breath i summoned into my
gaze all the longing of my spirit  come-
come i believe-i believe

  she responded she was nearer i caught
the sparkle in her eyes and her well-re-
membered smile trembled upon her lips
i cannot convey the emotion which her
drawing near created in me-a vibrating
triumph of the heart like the shivering
of sunlight on the ripples of a brook the
look which we now exchanged recalled
those ineffable privacies of love when
earthly hindrances fall awav and we pass
beyond the veil to intimacies which mor-
tality is powerless to recover in such
periods there is an upsurging of the soul
and love clothes itself with a body com-
petent to fulfil its celestial aspirations it
is doubtless the body which will invest it
in the kingdom of love hereafter

  she was within arms reach my joy was
tinged with awe as i realized the mystery
that impended she put forth her hand
and i felt her finger-tips pass down my
face and then her warm palm against mine
my arms opened and her body entered into
them and tenderly nestled itself up to me
with the lovers yearning to be one flesh
now the babv-smoothness of her cheek
touched mine and rubbed against it with
the childlike movement that i knew so
well presently slightly shifting her posi-
tion she lifted her head i was conscious
of the sweetness of her breath and then she
slowly set her parted lips on mine the
hazel darkness of her eyes passed into me
under her half closed lids in the dream-
gaze that deepens joy into seriousness
and there followed an interval when the
soul too potent for further companionship
with the body withdrew into its invisible
chambers and performed there its holy
rites

  gradually we awoke to a mitigated in-
tercourse

   lover of mine it has been permitted
us at last she said  we know and feel
each other your aline could never be-
come herself till she was yours

   aline soul of my heart in what
underground caves have i been groping
fearing to know what i could not under-
stand let me never go back there

  she gave a little lt-such a laugh as
i used to liken to the oubbling of golden
wine from a flagon of silver so soft was
it so full of sumptuous mirth

   must lionel still see before he be-
lieves she asked

  love you are in my arms i now
said  the weight and litheness of your
body-i feel it i breathe you i shall
never doubt any more

   ill tell you a secret she said her
whisper thrilling at my ear  tis an old
story that seeing is believing but remember
this-that belief is sight

   i have learned it but aline now
that i have you again ill never let you
go

  a loving little cry like a bird-note broke
from her as my arms tightened strongly
about her when she next spoke she used


all-story weekly

the tender quaker form of speech that we
had been wont to use in our love-talks

   doesnt thee know that thee and i
are immortal

  but that recalled to me the gulf between
us

   that is true of thee but i am still
on the other side i answered

   thee does not know very much she
retorted playfully and lovingly  that
thee is in thy mortal body does not change
thee and i tell thee again that this
is immortality but immortality is the
flood-tide which ebbs and flows like the
sea but after ebbing always flows again
the flood-tide of life beloved whether the
mortal body be with us or no

  i wondered at this and asked

   can there be immortality on earth

-or anything in heaven but immortality
she nestled closer and her bosom pressed
to mine so that i felt the beating of her
heart which throbbed with a low con-
tinuous speech reiterating love-nothing
but love yet conveying meanings and com-
munings such as no speech can utter or
mind conceive though echoes of it may be
divined in the varying intonations of an
infants murmur between rest and waking
between her soul and mine there was a
mutual interflowing as of sunlit oceans

  this was the intercourse of spirit with
spirit our mortal utterance in a thing of
space and time one word painfully suc-
ceeding another and step by step like the
building of a pyramid constructing the
thought or vision we would impart but
the speech of spirits is immediate revela-
tion as when if a curtain be lifted the
whole breadth and depth of the landscape
is revealed the ear in such interchanges
acquires the sovereign gift of the eye and
mind keeps pace with mind

  thus aline and i in our dear long-
delayed embrace lived again together

the

 scenes and thoughts and emotions of the
 past through it all we could now recog-
 nize the movement of a tender power that
 knows the end from the beginning and
 never ceases to incline the traveler thither
 -as a river gleaming through mountain
 mazes and sometimes threading under-
 ground caverns fails not to lead the wan-
 derer at last to the ocean in the passages
 that had seemed most fearful that eternal
 current still flowed on we had gone
 astray we had suffered purgations but we
 were safe at last

    but our union is not yet complete
 dearest i said  why is your spirit free
 and mine still obstructed by the flesh
 when shall i be fully delivered

    i-know only that the obstruction will
 vanish by and by she replied smiling on
 me  such joy as ours needs at first
 its intervals our moments of meeting are
 our immortality which flows and ebbs and
 flows again but at last perhaps they will
 be endless moments we were impatient
 before we can be patient now the pen-
 alty for the laws we broke has been suf-
 fered thee knows how bitter it was but it
 has passed the hurt is healed and soon
 there will be no more partings

   she stirred in my arms as a bird about
 to take flight

    but thee will come back to me i
 asked in fear

    we do not really part she said
 touching my lips with hers  though i
 seem to go thee will know that i am still
 here love is presence

   she pressed her sweet hands over my
 eyes as inour old times she would some-
 times playfully do after a while i no
 longer felt their pressure i sat in dark-
 ness but i knew-and know-that i am
 not alone

for an entirely new slant on the author of the untamed readnext week

the fear of morgan the fearless

by max brand
a short story but a crackerjack
harrington boyd stopped at
the head of the stairs the spec-
tacle in the broad living-room below
made him numb silently he drew back
into the shadow he had to steady himself
the revelation was so astonishing so thun-
derous in its unexpectedness

  elizabeth and elliott sewell his friend
and guest it took him some time to grasp
the situation

  when his brain resumed functioning
boyd found himself dully wondering how
long since they had come thus together
elizabeth hadnt it been understood
since she a distant cousin had come to live
in his mothers home-in his home-that
she would be his wife there had been no
doubt in his mind about that hadnt he
been waiting these last two years for her
to-to grow up and now-

  their embrace he told himself was too
close to be anything new elizabeth was
too snug and content in sewells arms

  of course they had counted upon his re-
turning by the front door they would
have heard him and been warned then
warned-that was the way boyd looked
at it his obsession for the girl broached
on egomania he never had dreamed of her
in the arms of another man

  he had a motor breakdown to thank for
what he considered his discovery it had
left his hands thick with oil and grease he
had entered the house by the rear and gone
straight to the upper floor to scrub-up
thus by accident had the light been brought



to him-light which must change his whole
life

  it struck him that they had been stupid
to leave the table-lamp burning but for
that he would have been unable to see them
he would have gone on down into the
living-room had the place been dark and
they certainly would have heard him

  preoccupied with his obsession for the
girl boyd believed they had something to
conceal

  a movement as he approached would
have aroused no suspicion in him why it
would have been the most natural thing in
the world for them to have turned on the
lights to see who was coming he would
have thought nothing of that he had been
so sure of her and of sewells honor and
friendship it was dishonorable of sewell
of course to come into his home like this-
a love pirate

  yes they had been shortsighted to leave
that one lamp whose shaded light had re-
vealed the lower half of their bodies as
they stood together

  elizabeths whisper as she withdrew from
sewells embrace floated up to boyd she
stepped into the gloom beyond reach of the
lamp sewell laughed

  boyd flushed the blood rushing to his
head brought the impulse to rush down and
denounce them to kill them then and
there

  as his legs moved to obey he checked
himself if he did that how would he escape

  coldly he began to review the situation


all-story weekly

he wouldnt have a chance before a jury
he did not see why he ever should stand
before a jury why not avoid that

  another light was switched on down-
stairs

   better turn em all on laughed sewell
 make a sort of beacon for the wanderer
shall we tell him to-night sweetheart

  boyd did not make out elizabeths an-
swer

  quietly he retreated along the hall his
calm in the face of this upheaval amazed
him he had become so entirely centered
upon elizabeth always he had thought-
xo he never even had contemplated eliza-
beth as belonging to any one else she had
become so much a part of his life that this
intrusion of sewell was analogous to the
violation of his home it called for primitive
action-for a tearing with the hands ex-
action of a positive penalty

  but now like his world he found his
ideas turned topsyturvy true he was
possessed of an intent to kill sewell-and
elizabeth instead of flaring to an immedi-
ate execution of that purpose however his
fury was strangely chill he had to think
of himself unless he too was to be sacrificed

  back at his bedroom he shut the door
noisily and again headed for the stairs in
case they hadnt heard the door slam he
broke into a whistle he did not wish to
arouse any suggestion that maybe he had
seen them half-way down he hailed them
with a cheery hello

  elizabeth was in a window seat sewell
was in a chair at a table pretending to read

  elizabeth crossed to meet him he
marked her composure his own was no
less but he kept his eyes from her lest she
should see the smoldering hate boiling to
the surface at that moment he realized
that his feelings toward her had been wholly
reversed

  the arm she put around him meant noth-
ing nor did he respond to the closer con-
tact when as was his habit he slipped an
arm about her

  to boyd her caress was hypocrisy it
was beyond his warped conception to un-
derstand that she might have a genuine af-
fection for him-the affection of a relative

  while they walked over beside sewelllthes

caught a glance between them into which he
read relief that they had not been stumbled
upon in the intimate pose which he had
seen from up-stairs their every action now
fed the fire within him

  sewell looked at his host stretched and
smiled

   lordy elliott -boyd was amiable-
it must be lonesome for you up here i
never thought of that until this minute you
looked so desolate and bored sitting there
its good of you to come out and keep us
company

  subconsciously sewell sensed something
behind the friendly speech he stared be-
fore answering but boyd was bland he
appeared tired that was all

   sewell burrowed deeper into the chair

   you dont mean that harrington he
declared  you dont know how i treasure
these little visits up here its darned good
of you to bring me along this quiet -
he waved outdoors- is the thing to rest a
chap after the city believe me you had
a real thought when you built away by your
lonesome

  as an uninterested spectator might have
done boyd admired the way in which eliza-
beth and sewell carried it off had he been
in their place he feared he would not have
remained so at ease still wasnt he him-
self playing up well they chatted on

   will you ring elizabeth he asked
after a while  i could stand a-

    ill get the ice she smiled  the ser-
vants are out

  that was what he wanted to know how
they had taken chances with the servants
around that they had been absent sim-
plified affairs from his standpoint too his
mother was away visiting there would
be none to come forward and say that he
had witnessed that scene between sewell
and elizabeth he did not want to be
linked in any manner with that fact that
elizabeth and sewell had been more than
friends

  throughout the couple of months that
remained of the season his relations with
sewell were unchanged sewell continued
to visit boyds country home he was left
alone as before in the company of elizabeth
when the circumstance so turned
smudged names



  but boyd did not go out of the way to
throw them together that would have
lacked finesse it would have put them on
guard it would have betrayed him given
an inkling that he had a suspicion at least
that they had come together he wondered
why they did not come into the open and
hoped they would not

  throughout long days he planned what
was to happen how he could proceed safe-
ly with the elimination of sewell that
was the initial consideration sewell had
to go first nights he lay awake perfecting
his scheme and multiplying the hate he
forced himself to conceal

  at times when he gave way to introspec-
tion he could not entirely comprehend his
own callous craftiness there were occa-
sions when he became aghast at the brutal
deliberation with which he purposed en-
compassing this mans death not only the
mans but elizabeths for he maintained
that she too must pay-as though she ac-
tually had been his wife rage would
overcome him and with it the temptation to
go search out sewell and have it over

  then the cunning that had taken posses-
sion of him would reassert itself the de-
sire for self-preservation would predomi-
nate

  his cause he would tell himself was just
had not sewell stolen in on his love since
the law would not punish him for that it
was necessary to take the law into ones
own hands when a person was executed
according to law the executioner was not
punished why then should he who simply
was taking the place of the executioner be
punished

  thus he persuaded himself as time wrore
on and his plan reached the last details all
that remained was to await the opportunity
to put it into effect with assurance that he
would escape sewell opened the way he
sought to interest boyd in a company he
was forming

  they discussed it a number of times in
conjuction with sewells other associates
boyd said he would think it over he
wanted to be alone with sewell when the
closing arrangements were made

  the conferences at which the other men
had been present would serve him well

they would show that he had been on
close terms with sewell that the meeting
which would be sewells last on earth had
been logical and legitimate

  raising the curtain on the finishing step
of his exploit of murder therefore boyd
phoned sewell to meet him he did not
mention the reason had sewell known
that he might have called some of the
others to attend that would have balked
boyd

  boyd and sewell had luncheon together
nearing the actual commission of his ven-
geance boyd experienced a brief feeling of
nausea while they talked through the
meal he wondered if he were quite sane it
did not seem so for more than three
months his mind had been clamoring on
this one demand for the death of sewell
trembling on the verge of the act he was
icy cool

  even the hatred he had nursed toward
elizabeth and sewell had passed there was
nothing in him except a passionless determi-
nation

  he was willing to concede that he was
mad that would help him in after years
when the satisfaction of his deed had per-
haps worn away he could down any
pangs of remorse by remembering that he
had been insane

  he brought up the subject of the new
corporation casually

   if you care to run over to your office
now elliot he remarked  ill sign up on
that deal youve been pestering me about

  sewell leaned across the table eagerly
he had been praying that boyd would
come in-boyd had the capital they re-
quired

  you will thats fine old man it
saves us hunting around for while weve
succeeded in convincing you that the propo-
sition is good-and it is good-we might
have difficulty with others when it came
to a question of so much money

  harrington boyd nodded the months
of scheming had wrought little change in
him except in his eyes in them the un-
controllable desire for sewells death re-
flected itself often he had developed a
habit of gazing through half-shut lids

  it was so that he now regarded sewell


all-story weekly

that his victim might not read the unholy
pleasure that burned over the prospect of
the killing

   it looks all right to me responded
boyd  there doesnt have to be any-
thing formal about it elliot a memoran-
dum will do i guess we know each other
well enough to get along with that

   but sewell demurred  dont you
think wed better have the other members
there and make it forma at the start they
might-

   dont worry about that well go over
to your office now and fix it up ill give
you my check and later on the formal pa-
pers can be drawn up when i obtain my
stock

  he knew that sewell was a stickler for
formality that had been reckoned on by
him sewell proved it by insisting that the
others interested be summoned

   if you and i cant put a friendly mat-
ter like this in shape without a session with
a bunch wholl insist on making speeches
and what-not announced boyd  well
call it off honestly elliot you make me
tired with your red-tapish ways

  sewell couldnt afford to let boyd with-
draw boyd knew that also that if he
did drop out he would lose this heaven-
sent opportunity they compromised when
he yielded to sewells insistence that they
record the transaction by a signed memo-
randum

  they were entering sewells office when
boyd suggested

   tell her he pointed to the secretary
in the outer room  that youre going to be
busy and dont want to be disturbed
sewell turned to the girl who occupied
this office with another stenographer

   you can handle anybody that calls
miss ford he said  i dont expect any
one of importance dont bother me un-
less i ring

   very well mr sewell said the girl
and acknowledged boyds bow she knew
him as an intimate of her employer

  inside with the door closed sewell and
his backer went over the project boyd
was to put in  working capital he
wrote a check for that

  sewell called miss ford and dictated the
memorandum to be made in duplicate

   by the way elliot said boyd as they
waited for her to return  you havent
been out to the house for a long time
were having half a dozen folk there two
nights from now want to come

  the transient gleam in sewells face gave
boyd a devilish glee sewell woilldnt be
able to look like that much oftener pretty
soon-pretty soon his expression would be
welded for all time at that moment boyd
confessed that he was crazy

  sewell perceived a strangeness in his
manner his answer was slow in coming
for the first time in weeks he had seen
clear into the depths of boyds eyes he
did not enjoy the sensation it left a clam-
my feeling

   i-i would like to he stammered and
cursed himself for having succumbed to a
foolish impression he straightened from
the rigid attitude into which that spark of
fear had thrown him

  boyds eyes were masked again he
leaned back in his chair ignoring the
others hesitation

   all right he said  ill tell elizabeth
that youll be there

  miss ford came in with the memorandum
and stood while sewell read it over boyd
toyed with a wicker letter basket on the
desk putting a paper-weight in the center
of it he tried to balance the basket on the
point of a long paper-spike he continued
absorbed in this occupation after the girl
had gone

   wait a minute he laughed when se-
well handed the paper to him for his ap-
proval   wait till i get this thing set

  they laughed together at his efforts

  no good without having accom-
plished the balancing feat boyd gave up
he put the weight back in its place and
the basket the spike he shoved aside

   youd never get a job as a juggler har-
rington grinned sewell  stick to financ-
ing

  boyd laughed again and sewell joined
him that was in line with his program
the girls in the next office would relate with
truth what good terms the two men ap-
parently had been on
smudged names



  glancing at the paper which merely re-
corded that he had turned over sixty-five
thousand dollars to the new corporation
boyd signed the first copy

   thats o k he passed it back

  sewell attached his name boyd folded
the document and put it in his pocket he
signed the second copy

  sewell was still bent over after having
done likewise when boyd exclaimed he
pointed across the room raising his head
sewell turned to follow the direction of
boyds finger

  like lightning boyd picked up the paper-
spike and rammed it with all his force into
sewells eye the one gasping cry that
burst from his victim was drowned in
boyds boisterous laughter

  without the loss of a second he grasped
sewells sagging body and flopped it across
the desk one arm he doubled underneath
the other he thrust out upsetting an ink-
well in the process so that the hand lay in a
pool of ink

  when he was through the dead man lay
face downward as though he had fallen on
the spike in a fainting spell

  stepping back boyd surveyed his work
everything was as he had planned the
only item that could upset his program was
the premature entrance of some one into
the room the appearance of a third party
before he had time to get out

  that was an improbable contingency
sewells secretary was the only person likely
to enter and she had been instructed not to
do so unless he rang to boyd the course
seemed clear enough

  unhurriedly he took up his hat and went
to the door lie halted there listening in
calculating his procedure he had marked
the positions occupied in the outer office by
the girls he knew exactly how much they
could see of the inner office when the door
was open sewell would not be visible to
them provided they were at their desks

  the sound of a typewriter came to him
through the door that was all he as-
sumed the girls were in their accustomed
places the road then was open

  with no trace of nervousness he opened
the door a swift glance confirmed that
the girls were at their desks

  boldly he held the door open and ad-
dressed a parting remark to sewell-a re-
mark that called for no answer miss ford
looked up as he pulled the door to he
smiled at her and commented on the
weather

  the door clicked shut a step away he
turned and reopened it a few inches in-
serting his head he spoke again-to the
dead man he laughed and in the midst
of it muttered then spoke in his own voice

  finally closing the door he nodded to the
girls and went out

  half an hour later miss ford went into
the room and found her employer dead

  llarrington boyd was questioned by the
police of course he was the last person to
see sewell alive he went through the in-
quisition with a good assumption of horror
over the death of his friend but without a
tremor

  miss ford and the stenographer miss
mitchell were there as he related his
visit boyd turned to them in remarking
that sewell had been well when he departed

   you remember he looked full and
frankly at miss ford and her companion
 that he spoke to me as i went out

  the girls faltered not that they thought
boyd had anything to do with the death-
that it was not an accident as the authori-
ties were ready to believe but somehow
they had been wondering whether sewell
really had spoken at that time they could
not have sworn to it yet they could not
have sworn that he had not

   when i reopened the door reminded
boyd he did not speak anxiously he re-
ferred to it as a trifling point  when i
reopened the door and said i would expect
him at the house two nights hence and he
replied that he would be there you remem-
ber that miss ford and you miss
mitchell

  why-why- miss ford looked
dazed she was shaken by what had taken
place practically at her side with only the
thickness of a door between sewell had died
horribly her puzzled glance was returned
by miss mitchell

  now that boyd mentioned it they werent
at all sure that sewell had not spoken


all-story weekly

while boyd they recalled was laughing
with his head through the partly opened
door

  the district attorney addressed the sec-
retary he put her hesitancy down to the
shock he never entertained a thought that
boyd was not telling the truth

   do you recollect that miss ford he
asked

   why-why- she stammered again
and strove desperately to make sure in her
own mind before she declared one way or
another  i-i think he did

  think the district attorney made
further allowance for her excitement  you
heard him surely

  the girl caught boyds eye it would
be terrible if she should cast any reflection
upon him by her indecision she could not
do that and she really had thought that
sewell had answered boyd since boyd had
recalled the point she could not have been
mistaken she became convinced

   ye-es i heard him mr boyd was
laughing at the time and i didnt catch
what mr sewell said but i heard him
and you miss mitchell

  she answered more readily whatever
uncertainty she had known had been re-
moved by miss fords statement on top of
boyds had miss mitchell been told that
shewas imagining something that she was
responding to suggestion she would have
resented it but-

   yes -she believed- he said-he
said  ill be there i think it was it
sounded like that

  she looked at boyd and he nodded

   i dont remember his precise words
he interjected  but he said hed be out to
the house as i asked him probably he used
the words miss mitchell quotes

  the coroner and his physician entered
they had just finished an examination of
the body

   how do you figure it happened
queried the district attorney

   way the police look at it the coroner
scratched his head  is that he became
dizzy and was leaning on his hands on the
desk when he collapsed howard here
he indicated the doctor  agrees that is
about the only way it could have taken

place do you remember where about his
desk that spike was lying mr boyd
boyd shook his head regretfully

   i dont there was the usual clutter
of things and i paid no attention

   i cant quite make out how he fell so
straight on the spike said the doctor
 even though it did strike a soft place the
eye it is odd that his weight falling for-
ward to a certain extent didnt knock the
spike off its base youd expect it to be
deflected but it ran straight in

   one of these-ah inexplicable acci-
dents doctor commented boyd  poor
old sewell and he was so enthusiastic
about putting over this new company

  the doctor agreed  a freak that
couldnt happen once in a thousand times
he said

  as they talked further one of the detec-
tives who had gone out on the alarm
drifted into the group he didnt take
much part in the conversation but his gaze
dwelt on boyd his attention was due
only to a professional interest in the last
man to talk with the victim

  boyd went home to dinner that night
elizabeth arrived a few minutes later he
was in the sitting-room rereading the ac-
count of sewells death when he noticed
her presence she stood in the doorway her
face shrunken with horror a newspaper
crumpled in her outstretched hand

   hello elizabeth he tookhis feet off
the stool and sat up  i see you know
about friend sewell

  the woman advanced a step swaying
she wet her arid lips tried to speak and
choked

  he went to her side offering his arm

   let me help you elizabeth somewhat
of a shock eh

  her eyes bulged and she drew away from
him then he knew that she saw his hand
in the death of sewell

   you- she pressed a hand to her
throat to control the twitching muscles
 you-

  his wide open eyes feasted on her and
strangled her words she observed to the
full the light that blazing up at times had
frightened her these last few months till
- smudged names



now she never had been sure that it was
there with the realization came the in-
stinctive knowledge that he had learned of
her and sewell

   you-knew she whispered  i-i
loved him

  boyd nodded

   you did-this he barely heard the
words with their indescribable terror as she
held out the newspaper

  boyd shrugged his brutality was not
assumed his callousness was not a pose
it was simply that he had no emotion he
knew no more compunction of his act than
-than sewell had known when he stole
elizabeth or she when she accepted se-
well

   he trespassed my dear elizabeth he
 stated and considered that sufficient

  trespassed she started indignantly
  on whom

   on me elizabeth his look devoured
 her  you were-mine

  she dropped on a lounge but could not
 take her eyes off him his utter calm as
 much as his claim upon her astounded and
 hypnotized

  he sat on the arm of a chair swinging a
 foot only his stare was murderous

   shall we dine he actually smiled

  she shivered a thought made her lean
forward

   and the police-

  boyd laughed scornfully not unpleas-
 antly

   theyre all through they say it was
 an accident

  the woman started up

   you think that her hands reached
out the fingers curving like claws  you
are wrong i-i can tell them it was not
an accident that you killed him

  he smiled again tolerantly

   and even if they believed you my dear
 elizabeth they could do nothing a wo-
 man cannot send a man to death or to pris-
 on on her unsupported word im afraid
 he chuckled  there would be a steady pro-
 cession if that could be done

  the color flamed to her cheeks

   i can give them a motive i can tell
 them of-of -a speck of blood trickled
 on her lip as her teeth ground into it- of

    	a-s

the jealousy revealed by your insane claim
on me

   even so elizabeth his tone was pa-
tient but sardonic  but you forget that the
two girls in sewells office heard him speak
to me as i passed out he-er couldnt
very well have spoken with that spike in his
head and  couldnt have stuck it there
after i left him you must admit that

  silently she watched him the tense-
ness left her body her arms wilted at her
sides she saw the truth of what he said

  the two girls had committed themselves
to the statement that sewell had exchanged
words with boyd after boyd was out of his
office no matter whether they reversed
that declaration a jury would have to give
boyd the benefit of the doubt with two
important witnesses - the only witnesses
aside from herself - contradicting them-
selves there would be an absolute absence
of direct evidence there could be only
one verdict

  she saw how boyd had played his easels
to accentuate the friendship between him-
self and sewell down to the investment of
a large sum in sewells business

   besides he broke in on her thoughts
 i would deny that i had known of any
reason for jealousy of sewell-that  had
any occasion for jealousy it would be
hard to prove that i had you and i were
not engaged you had not announced an
engagement to sewell - that might have
been a trifle for you to go on but you kept
the affair so secret you see your motive
as you call it would be smashed at the very
outset it would develop into a case of you
trying to send me to prison or to the chair
without an iota of corroborative evidence
my social and business connections with
sewell would all tend to swing the weight
to my side the fact that you on your
own admission were madly in love with
him would bear up a contention that you
were unhinged by the tragedy

   furthermore my dear he added  i
might suggest that you were a fit subject for
an asylum and possibly get a court to agree
with me

carried her to her room he was at the
bedside when her eyes fluttered he waited
till she was fully conscious

   i have wondered elizabeth he said
mildly  why you threw me aside-for
sewell

  she could not meet his eyes this time
her head moved in its frame of black hair
against the snowy pillow her twisting
fingers ripped the lace of the counterpane

   i dont know she whispered  it
just-happened

   i see boyd arose  arent you
coming downto dinner no

  he walked to the door and turned

   theres one other thing i think its only
fair to tell you elizabeth he paused and
she quailed before the fiendish glance that
seemed to sear her  i didnt warn sewell
but its different with you you understand
that some dav i shall kill vou too un-
less-

  when her brain stepped whirling he was
gone he would kill her too unless-
she understood unless she saved him the
trouble

  it was ten oclock that night when the de-
tective called at boyds home lie was the
one who had listened while boyd had con-
versed with the coroner the district at-
torney and the doctor in the afternoon

  just a couple of questions he apolo-
gized as boyd met him in the hall and led
the way to the library

   yes boyd was not alarmed some
formalities for the record he supposed lie
gave his visitor look for look unruffled

   you finished a business deal with se-
well to-day didnt you you signed a pa-
per with him - an agreement about the
money you were putting in

  boyd did not gather what this had to do
with the case except that it was a part of
his-his propaganda so to speak they
couldnt know that he gave no hint that
the question perplexed him

  i have a copy here he replied want
to see it

   no-no the detective nibbled at a
finger nail maintaining his apologetic de-
meanor  if you will he changed his
mind  let me look at it please

  boyd started from the room  ill get
it its in another coat

  returning with the paper he evinced no
curiosity about why it should be examined
the less he said without being secretive
the better it would be so far he had taken
a half-and-half way - giving information
freely without volunteering too much he
counted himself secure they couldnt put
anything on him

  the detective smiled

    its only a detail but which of the pa-
pers was signed first this or the one se-
well kept

  for the fraction of a second boyd hesi-
tated he asked himself what bearing
this could have he decided it could not
affect the issue

   this one he answered truthfully but
could not help adding  why

   instead of answering the detective asked
 and after you and sewell had signed
both papers you visited a while

  once more there was that infinitesimal
lapse before boyd spoke

   yes we chatted a few minutes before
i left

  his brain was darting here and there for
the object of this interrogation what could
this none-too-intelligent-looking man be
aiming at what if anything did he ex-
pect to attain by all this it could mean
nothing the two girls had heard sewell-
there was the king-pin of boyds assurance
which they would have to dislodge if it came
to the test

   could you say how long you talked
after the papers were signed-both papers
 oh- sewell professed to think  its
difficult to place definitely a tmatter like
that-unless there is an incident to give it
significance in this instance of course
there wasnt

   i know agreed the detective  but
we want to fix the time as close as we can
how long would you say-roughly

  there was no trace of eagerness in the
mans tone or manner he bore the atmos-
phere of one doing a wearisome duty

   i should say boyd ran his hand over
his forehead to hide the contempt  ap-
proximately ten minutes

   ten minutes his visitor hitched for-
smudged names



ward in his chair  not more than that
it was about ten minutes before you left
him

   yes easily ten minutes not less

  the detective got up

   thanks thats about all

  his right hand went into his coat-pocket

  boyd also stood in his heart he ad-
mitted that he had been a little anxious
he still couldnt make out what the signing
of the memorandum had to do with the
matter but he told himself this police-
man and his fellows hadnt any more idea
so what difference did it make

  he offered his cigar-case

   have one

  the detectives hand leaped from his
pocket a handcuff snapped on boyds ex-
tended wrist before he could recover from
the surprise his other wrist was encircled by
the steel

  with fallen jaw he gaped a minute
passed before he could regain his voice

   what in the name of-

  the interruption came crisply

   for the murder of elliot sewell

  a portiere in the doorway shook and was
pushed aside elizabeth clung to it her
face was deathlike yet it lighted with
triumph

   i was going to save you the trouble of
killing me as you promised harrington
she said quietly  when i heard you talk-
ing now-i shall stay and help convict
you

  boyd snarled and swung to confront the
detective

   youre crazy man like this woman
take these things off

   at headquarters wrell do that- his
glance went to elizabeth he didnt know
where she figured but if she could tell any-
thing he reckoned the case would be bomb-
proof

  an ice of fear went creeping through
boyds bones but he held himself together
it was ridiculous his position was too
unassailable he had builded too firm an
alibi they never could convict him yet-
the detective was very confident

  the sweat beaded on boyds forehead
his tone was good considering the dryness
of his throat and his accelerated pulse

   what is the basis of this silly per-
formance

  the detective smiled not vindictively
elizabeth was tottering

   it isnt as silly as you think it wont
hurt to teil you remember that you told
the agreement was signed by you--and se-
well a good ten minutes before you left
him

  boyd glared but kept silence

   all right you remember also that
under sewells body on the desk was his
copy of that paper

  elizabeth close beside the detective was
straining forward to catch every word her
lips were parted expectantly dull spots
of color came and went on her cheeks

   what of it boyd rasped

  the detective picked a cigar from the
floor where it had rolled from the fallen
case he bit into it

   we-ell he drawled  remember in ad-
dition that sewell had on a light gray suit
and his voice quickened  that i tested
the ink you both used write as heavy as
you can with it even using a stub pen
and that ink wont stay wet more than six
minutes get me now

  there was an element of admiration in
his glans but boyd missed that as he let
loose a frightful oath he saw where they
had him

   thats it concluded the detective
 the signatures you say were written at
least ten minutes before sewell died are
smudged on the front of his coat you laid
him over that paper before the ink was
dry

  boyd looked at elizabeth she laughed
hysterically

    some day  she mocked wildly   i
will kill you too 

  he pulled his nerves together he was
scrry that his job was only half done he
had planned so elaborately to take full
measure of vengeance if he had known
that his scheme was to go for naught
through such a puny oversight he would
have killed them both that night he saw
them together but after all he had elimi-
nated sewell that w-as something

   lets go he said quietly  she will
complete your case

author of  on the night ol the storm etc

preceding chapters briefly retold

when owen vaughn celebrated new york detective accepted the invitation of his friend and
coworker margot dale to attend mrs john bashford whympers musicale where the
musical sensation of the season seiiorita dolores arsenjo was to play her violin he had
looked forward to an evening of pleasure unmixed with business

    at the close of the concert while margot listened to the raptures of young lieutenant bate-
son and the audience seemed to have been swept off its feet by the weird effect of the final num-
ber a prized possession of the hostess a costly chinese vase was suddenly discovered to have been
thrown to the floor and shattered

    on examining one of the broken bits vaughn found it was not the original vase which he
knew well but a clever reproduction moreover he also learned that senor jose arsenjo who
arranged his daughters concerts had particularly stipulated where the vase was to be placed the
night of the concert asserting his daughters playing was subtly influenced by the atmosphere
imparted by a work of art vaughns professional curiosity was at once aroused mrs whymper
secured an invitation to an arsenjo recital at the home of mrs foulkes which vaughn attended in
disguise here he found that an atmospheric  prop a genuine blakelock disappeared at the final
number of the concert and a clever fake had been substituted for the original vaughn found the
paint of the signature was still wet a suspicious box of flowers for the artist gave the detective his
lead bateson had again been present and when her accompanist was taken ill bateson played
for seiiorita arsenjo it was evident the young american had fallen for dolores arsenjo

    at the next arsenjo concert at the home of his friend dr durant vaughn secured a place of
advantage in a small room which communicated with the drawing-room the detective learned
that just before the mysterious final number arsenjo by means of a miniature atomizer dis-
charged some subtle gas over the heads of the audience this was the famous  spell which all
but robbed the audience of consciousness and which invariably made dolores arsenjo faint at the
end of the evening next he saw miguel the ecuadorians factotum take down the three henners
valued at fifty thousand dollars which he replaced with three copies

    hardly had his man disappeared with the pictures when arsenjo reappeared and announced
that his daughters priceless stradivarius had been stolen and he suspected bateson in fact he
went to vaughn the next day and engaged him on the case with the suggestion if the detective
were to search the lieutenants rooms he thought the violin would be found

    michael mcsurely whom vaughn had sent to shadow arsenjo returned with a story of how
he had followed the spaniard to a house on staten island where he had left a parcel which was
about the size of the blakelock painting in the midst of the detectives calculations seiiorita
dolores arsenjo was ushered into his private office

  i have heard you play seiiorita

she sank into the big armchair  air

             this story began in the

    vaughn do you know why i wore this ugly
    veil i didnt want the public in general-
    and my father in particular-to know i in-

       he looked at her straight  not yet

the head of arsenjo



    her gaze did not waver  the strangest
 things happen at my recitals mrs whym-
 per lost her kang-hsi while i was playing
 at her house-and last night just after my
 recital at dr durants my precious violin
 was stolen ive vowed not to play another
 note till its found youll get to work
 this very morning mr vaughn-this very
 hour

    what if im too busy already he
 queried smilingly

    but youre not-you cant be think
 what the world would lose if i never play
 again that may sound insufferably ego-
 tistical but honestly  dont care for my
 playing my peculiar limitations are so
 stupid-limitations which make it impos-
 sible for me to play in public-that is jor
 the public-for vast throngs i mean i
 should like to play in the streets-in the
 public parks-so the people-everybody-
 might hear

    you interest me senorita what are
 these  limitations  that forbid your playing
 before large crowds

     i faint dead away at the end of every
 recital i give-before the end indeed isnt
 that ridiculous-incredible

     it surely seems so you look to be in
 excellent health do you faint any other
 time

     no never thats the astonishing part
 of it

     what are your sensations

     i seem to lose consciousness very gradu-
 ally-everything grows light and airy
 around me people who rave over my
 playing declare it affects them in a similar
 way its very mysterious ive asked my
 father about it- she paused

     and what does he say

     his theory is that its caused by some
 undiscovered vibration of music isnt that
 remarkable

    very remarkable indeed assented
 vaughn dryly

     another odd thing-i never faint unless
 im playing one of his compositions
 vaughn smiled  if you really want to
 play before large crowds why dont you
 leave his works off the program then you
 wouldnt faint-

    but he wouldnt allow it he has the

queerest ideas about the common people
he says they cant understand music-

   play for them anyway give a recital
without his knowledge rent carnegie hall
charge a nominal admission and play under
an assumed name-

   how perfectly fascinating-it would be
just like a story or a play her brow
clouded suddenly  but i shouldnt dare
my father would be sure to find it out-and
hes a horribly stern man as for that
im taking a great risk in coming here to
see you last night i wanted him to tele-
phone the police the violin had been stolen
he refused we had quite a little argument
-were both rather self-willed- she
gave a highly expressive shrug  he said
the thief might be some one whom we
would dislike to prosecute so we had better
wait a few days to give him the chance
to see the error of his ways and bring back
the violin this sounded downright silly to
me then i asked him to consult a private
detective-i even mentioned you as a well-
known one-but he insisted hed manage
the case himself i decided to do a little
managing of my own do vou blame me
 not at all laughed vaughn  its
your property that was stolen now what
were the circumstances in connection with
the violins disappearance

  she narrated them with some detail-not
however even mentioning lieutenant bate-
sons name indeed she expressed the frank
opinion that one of dr durants servants
might be the culprit

 dont you think my theory reasonable
he smiled  hardly senorita i have
already made up my mind as to the identity
of the thief-and moreover i feel sure i
can recover your violin by to-morrow

  she looked her incredulity  so soon
why youre cleverer even than i thought
she was frankly thrilled and begged him
to take her into his confidence but he in-
sisted he never made a report on a case
until the report was ready and so with
this she was forced to be content shortly
taking her leave and promising to call again
to-morrow afternoon  unless she quali-
fied gaily  my father has discovered ive
been here and so keeps me a prisoner in the
house but hell have to- lock me in to

have his way good day mr vaughn-
and good luck but remember the case
may not be quite as easy as it looks so
work hard

  vaughn looked up batesons address in
the city directory and found that he had
rooms at a bachelor apartment-house in the
west fifties immediately after luncheon
he called luckily the young soldier was
in his greeting was cordial but he looked
rather surprised at sight of the detective

   sit down mr vaughn he said indi-
cating a big armchair by the window
 will you smoke with me

  both lighted cigars and while bateson
chatted on politics and the war vaughn
was making up his mind how best to broach
the subject that had brought him at last
he decided to be perfectly straightforward
not for a moment had he believed the
young man guilty of the theft arsenjos
absurd story bearing on its face the un-
worthy motives that had engendered it
under the circumstances to have followed
the usual crafty procedure of a detective
in  scenting out  a case would have been
an insult both to bateson and his own pro-
fessional ability and knowledge of human
nature so without any ado he casually
remarked in the first lull in the lieutenants
talk

   by the way have you heard that seno-
rita arsenjos violin was stolen last night at
dr durants

   what bateson looked his blank as-
tonishment  they must have discovered
it after i left but go on-tell me

  vaughn thereupon told him of the calls
of arsenjo and dolores at his office that
morning he gave arsenjos version of
everything that had happened from the end-
ing of the recital to the discovery of the
alleged theft he did not however refer
directly to the spanish-americans  sus-
picions bateson listened with breathless
interest but through innocence or a par-
donable stupidity-perhaps a combination
of both-he failed to see the quite obvious
implication presently vaughn was forced
to say

   senor arsenjo thinks he knows who the
thief is

   good who is it

   you

  the cigar that bateson was lifting to
his lips dropped to the floor he flashed at
vaughn a wondering look-then burst into
a laugh

   i see its a joke

   not so its quite serious

   serious good god man do you
mean to say- he drew a long breath
 well somebodys crazy thats all
vaughn smiled  youre right arsen-
jos the madman

   but-heavens how can he be mad
enough to accuse me

   shall i be frank lieutenant

   certainly lets get at the thing

   arsenjo says youre badly in debt-

   thats not true i discharged my last
obligation some months ago at the most
i owed less than three thousand dollars and
none of my debts were ones i need blush
for they werent gambling debts or money
spent on women-i didnt don this khaki to
disgrace it some foolish speculations in
the street turned out the way foolish specu-
lations usually do-thats all so this man
says i stole-think of it stole-and her vio-
lin-to get money to pay my debts eh

   exactly

   good heavens what a fool pie wants
to discredit me in his daughters eyes but
doesnt he realize he cant get away with a
thing of this sort did he really expect
to prove me a thief on his unsupported
word

  vaughn was amused at his incredulity
 certainly not he says you have the vio-
lin in your possession-

  what bateson sprang to his feet
 he dares say that and youve come to
make the search- he flushed hotly
 well-

  vaughn rose and laid a friendly hand on
his shoulder  now listen youre not
going to make me say in so many words
that i believe youre innocent that would
be taking arsenjos ridiculous charge too
seriously i didnt come here to make any
search i simply wanted to put you on
your guard-

  bateson burst into a laugh  by jove
its the best joke of the season come
vaughn enjoy it with me- but he
the head of arsenjo



sobered suddenly and his mouth took on a
grim set look  well take him seriously
to this extent at least-well make the
search

   nonsense i wont make any search-
 then i will his angry gaze swept the
room  where shall i begin hows this
wardrobe for a starter maybe i hid the
violin in there he cried ironically going
to it and flinging open the door

  vaughn watching him amusedly saw him
start back in wonder gaze intently into the
wardrobe then bend down and with ginger-
ly fingers bring forth a violin-case he
opened it and took out-senorita arsenjos
stradivarius

   you-you knew it was here he
gasped

  vaughn smiled  this is where he said
id find it-

   but-how came it here

 get your thinking apparatus to work-
ing man arsenjo had it brought here of
course-probably by the mestizo miguel
 the dog ill have him prosecuted for
this-

   no you wont hes done this mad
thing simply because senorita dolores-to
be perfectly frank-has flatly refused to
obey his commands regarding her attitude
toward you surely you wont drag her into
this ugly business-

   good god no i hadnt thought of
that but what shall i do take the vio-
lin to the senorita and tell her all other-
wise how can i explain having it

  vaughn thought a moment will you
put yourself in my hands

   unreservedly

   good ill take the violin all i ask
of you is to keep mum-most of all to
senorita dolores are you likely to see
her to-day or to-morrow

  bateson blushed like a schoolboy  we
were going to make a desperate effort to
run the blockade and go for a motor ride
but maybe the loss of the violin has so up-
set her-

   nonsense laughed vaughn  shell
need you to console her but remember
you dont know a thing you must be the
most astonished man in new york when
she informs you of the theft

   trust me chuckled bateson  ill
do my tutor proud

   so it was all arranged vaughn pressed
for time left at once taking the violin to
his office where he locked it in the safe
he found mcsurely waiting for him mac
had looked through the newspaper-files and
had found the names of the society people
who had had senorita dolores give musi-
cales at their homes during the past season
they numbered some eight in all three
were out of town

   vaughn immediately telephoned the five
ladies who were in the city and brought
all his resources to bear to secure interviews
with them at once this was naturally
a difficult tiling to accomplish society
folk are quite the busiest people in the
world in their own small way and had
vaughn been less prominent in his profes-
sion he would have found it impossible to
get to see so man- without having made
previous engagements but when with
portentous gravity he informed them that
he was working on one of the most impor-
tant cases of his life a case in which they
themselves would probably be directly in-
volved they were frankly impressed and
so without much parleying agreed to see
him

   he prepared a set story to tell all of them
until he was ready to  spring  the case
in its entirety he did not want any inkling
of it to reach the public either via police
channels or newspaper scare-heads so while
he admitted candidly that this mysterious
thief de luxe had been working in the arsen-
jos train he carefully refrained from impli-
cating the senor in the robberies thus
stating the purpose of his calls he had no
difficulty in interesting the five ladies-and
alarming them-to such an extent that they
told him everything they could remember in
connection with the recitals-particularly
regarding the character of senorita arsen-
jos  atmosphere -and allowed him to in-
spect all their objets dart-paintings mo-
saics ceramics statuary-which might have
been exchanged for more or less clever re-
productions

  by noon of the next day he had inter-
viewed the last of the five ladies-as well
as those of their footmen who were on duty


all-story weekly

at the front door on the recital nights-
and had completed his investigations with
the following interesting results

  each footman distinctly remembered the
stock incident of a messenger bringing a
box of flowers for senorita arsenjo toward
the close of the recital this man always
insisted on seeing arsenjo arsenjo never
failed to answer his summons sometimes
he talked to the man in the hall sending
the servant away on some errand or other
once senorita valdez had suddenly become
ill requiring the footmans services and on
two other occasions footmen had been sent
to the nearest dealers to get resin for the
violinists bow-arsenjo always tipping like
a prince

  each of the five ladies had lost some
priceless objet dart or oil painting through
arsenjos highly specialized system of ex-
change the losses including a bouguereau
 venus a cezanne landscape a chinese
mandarin vase and an unfinished rodin
bust of victor hugo the copies had been
made with remarkable skill the victor
hugo bust being especially noteworthy
the original-vaughn had seen it some
months before at a private exhibition-was
of an odd yellowish color similar to the
balzac head in the rodin corridor at the
metropolitan museum of art and in the
reproduction the peculiar shade had been
imitated perfectly the entire head had
been molded with a versimilitude that was
almost uncanny vaughn stood before
the splendid cheat a long while lost in
ungrudging admiration what a strange
genius the mestizo miguel was he had
declared he could paint anything make any-
thing do anything-and this amazing piece
of work proved it

  that evening vaughn was called up on
the  telephone by arsenjo the south
american was rather belligerent

   well he demanded

   well sharply repeated vaughn who
was human enough to be offended at his
tone

   have you no news havent you been
to see lieutenant bateson yet yesterday
morning i gave you the case why this
delay in presenting a report

   i present a report when it is ready

not before perhaps senor arsenjo youre
in such a hurry youd prefer to put the
case into somebody elses hands
immediately the sehor became much less
choleric  certainly not my dear mr
vaughn i dont regret giving you the
case-far from it only my daughter is
worried about her violin-quite naturally
besides im somewhat perturbed myself
bateson has been hanging around my house
again he had the audacity to take dolores
motoring- there came a splutter of rage
over the wire  i had ordered my servant
miguel to keep them apart at all costs-
but they held their tryst and rode off under
his very eyes

  too bad exclaimed vaughn in sur-
prisingly sympathetic tones you must
have been rather angry senor

   rather angry came the derisive echo
 i was furious-insane i horsewhipped
the dog until he bled-

   what  vaughn was really astonished
 who is this miguel what sort of man
is he to stand such treatment

  arsenjo was unwontedly communicative
 man he sneered  we in ecuador
dont call the indian dogs we have enslaved
men this miguel is a mestizo i have
civilized him-educated him-made him
what he is your so-called  free-and-equal 
america has put foolish notions into his
half-breed head hes actually beginning to
think hes a human being but i fancy the
horsehide will make him remember that a
slave in ecuador is a slave everywhere else
on the globe a cruel laugh sounded
 but come mr vaughn you have seen
bateson

   yes

   good you found the violin

   yes

  ah youre convinced now he stole
it

   i have grave doubts

   what after finding it in his posses-
sion

  vaughn gave a short laugh  a pick-
pocket not wishing to be caught with the
goods drops the watch he has  lifted  into
your pocket does that prove you the
thief no sehor-

  bang went arsenjos receiver into place
the head of arsenjo



  what an angelic temper chuckled
vaughn  he horsewhips miguel and now
hes trying to drive me it will be a wonder
if this same temper doesnt provoke some-
body into killing him-

  the telephone-bell cut short his soliloquy
he took down the receiver-and as he had
half expected found arsenjo once more on
the wire

   mr vaughn you must pardon my im-
pulsiveness came the oily words  please
attribute it to a loving fathers natural
anxiety take whatever time is necessary
-but remember that suspense is deadly
youll let me know when anything hap-
pens

   certainly

   thank you- in the same smooth
tones and that was all

chapter viii

miguels mystery

lte that same evening bateson made
an unexpected call at vaughns apart-
ment he was in a gay mood he
informed vaughn that he and dolores had
had the  best drive yet going up the
hudson as far as peekskill and not return-
ing till long after dark

   i may as well tell you old man he
blushingly went on  that dolores and i
are engaged to be married rather sud-
den of course - we havent known each
other very long but the circumstances of
the case-her fathers attitude and so on-
demand quick action-understand

  but vaughn shook his head soberly
 ill be perfectly frank my dear fellow
dont you think youd better not do any-
thing rash you must admit senorita
dolores is rather unfortunate in having the
father she has his irregularities are not
confined to the scurvy trick hes trying to
play on you hes a man of pretty big
operations in a few days ill have a story
to tell that will make new york gasp-

   what  exclaimed bateson astonished
 why not tell me now

   not yet meanwhile dont you think
it wise to go slowly

  bateson did not reply he turned away

and bit his lip then facing about suddenly
 look here vaughn-i hate to ask this
question im surprised you havent an-
swered it already without my having to put
it in words it almost seems like a lack of
belief in the girl i love to ask you-
vaughn read his thoughts i believe
the senorita is entirely ignorant of every-
thing-

   thank god i knew it i know human
nature-

   wait my impulsive young friend i
didnt say i knew-i said i believed-

   well i know-and thats enough for
me shes goodness itself-

   will you listen broke in vaughn over-
whelmingly  i want you to promise to
wait at least a week-

  but bateson gaily snatched the word
from his lips  a week certainly id
have to wait that long anyway he
laughed happily im going back to camp
to-night and wont return to town till next
saturday an army man you know cant
always be as precipitate as hed like the
love-smitten young fellow apostrophized
senorita dolores for some fervid moments
much to vaughns sympathetic amusement
then glancing suddenly at the clock he de-
clared hed have to go or miss his train so
he gave the detective a hearty handshake
and hurried away

  on arriving at the office the next morn-
ing vaughn was surprised to find a caller
awaiting him-dolores she looked pale
and hollow-eyed and her manner betrayed
an inward agitation that seemed rather dis-
proportionate to the loss of the violin valu-
able though it was

   my dear senorita he said reassuring-
ly after cordial greetings  i know youre
worried about your violin but im quite
confident-

   im not here to see you about the violin
mr vaughn something so much more ter-
rible has happened- her voice broke
can you-can you imagine me as not senor
arsenjos daughter

   what he cried  you mean it

  she smiled faintly  can you imagine
me as-well an american girl

  he looked at her yes he could imagine
it her blond beauty her spirit her inde-


all-story weekly

pendence her courage-all these were typi-
cally american as for any resemblance to
arsenjo-physical or mental-there was
none he had remarked that in the be-
ginning

   can you imagine it she insisted

   with the greatest ease

  involuntarily he reached toward her and
grasped the little hand that lay limply in
her lap she smiled bravely then half
shuddered in spite of herself

   now mr vaughn i may as well tell
you at the start that this is purely a profes-
sional call-i want to put you to work on
the  case of dolores arsenjo -or what-
ever my name is forget my violin or let
one of your assistants hunt for it you
must find out who i am

   suppose you tell me the thing from the
beginning he said

   theres not much to tell-that is
senor arsenjo told me only a very little
he was furiously angry or he wouldnt have
said even that much- she drew a long
breath  we had been having an unpleas-
ant discussion about lieutenant bateson
he warned me never to see him again of
course this roused me and i daresay i said
some cutting things suddenly he amazed
and horrified me by falling on his knees-
actually-and declaring his love for me-
not the love of a parent he hastened to ex-
plain but the-the other kind-the love
of a man for a woman  and i have the
right to love you like this he cried  for i
am not your father not a drop of my
blood flows in your veins all these years
 have loved you madly-jealously- 
she paused her face white  i-i
thought  could tell you what he said-but
 havent the courage he talked like a
madman at first i was too dazed-horri-
fied-to speak-to question him about my
parentage but at last i broke in upon his
insane ravings and begged him to tell me
the truth he must have read my mind-
must have realized the wild joy i felt at the
thought of my utter independence of him-
for he sprang up declared he had been ly-
ing and rushed from the room

  vaughn was considerately silent a mo-
ment

   now tell me something about yourself

-your life at quito-your childhood he
said

   my earliest recollections are of a long
low blue-tinted house in quito with barred
windows and a patio in the center-and
senor arsenjo who with his wonderful
head fascinated me as a child that head
arturo michelena the famous venezuelan
artist begged the privilege of painting it a
sculptor in florence used it as a model for
one of his homeric figures and miguel
who is a sort of universal genius has sculp-
tured and painted that head dozens of
times miguel is our confidential servant
you know he is a mestizo-a half-breed
i think him an artistic madman-

  the term struck vaughn  artistic
madman-

   hes so passionately fond of art in all
forms so hopelessly ambitious to be the
greatest painter sculptor designer in the
world when he was a little child his first
sight of senor arsenjos perfect head thrilled
him as some children are thrilled at the
sight of firearms-he began painting it and
modeling it in clay and has done so at in-
tervals ever since

   very astonishing commented vaughn
intensely interested  a most curious mania
who is this miguel

   the son of one of the indian peons on
senor arsenjos cacao plantation indian
peons in ecuador are virtually slaves of
their masters or landlords miguels father
was practically a slave but senor arsenjo
was attracted to miguel on account of his
artistic gifts so he educated him but
reverting to the sehors head-dont you
think it a beautiful one mr vaughn

   very beautiful indeed answered
vaughn dryly  but that noble brow will
never solve the mystery of your paren-
tage-

  true enough she laughed well-
my childhood in quito was like that of other
children of my class i attended day school
at a convent and studied music under senor
arsenjo who was a really excellent violin-
ist and composer-

   a professional musician

   oh no-just a very clever dilettante
he devoted most of his time to his enor-
mous cacao business when i was twelve
the head of arsenjo



i had an english governess the senor sent
to london for her he told me that much
of our life would be passed in english-
speaking countries and i must learn to speak
that language as perfectly as i spoke span-
ish later this governess accompanied us
to paris-where i studied music for several
years-and then made a european tour
with us

   sehor arsenjo was with you all this
time

   yes

  and the mestizo miguel

   yes-as the senors body-servant

   ive heard of the sehors cruel treat-
ment of him why hasnt he left arsenjo

   i dont know-unless the sehor has
some hold on him-or unless he has been
dangling before miguels eyes the bait of
an artistic career which has always been
the poor mestizos dream miguel believes
implicitly that arsenjo is the greatest man
in the world the greatest developer of ar-
tists that i daresay is the reason he has
remained with him besides a quinchua
of ecuador is born but to obey the whites
to suffer any and all indignities at their
hands

   well said vaughn after a moments
thought  i rather think well have to turn
to the mestizo to learn something of your
parentage miguel-

  the telephone on the desk rang

   yes queried vaughn taking the re-
ceiver

   miguel is here to see the young lady
who is now with you

   miguel vaughn repeated astonished

  he here cried dolores

   in the outer office he wants to see
you-

  why how very remarkable i won-
der- she rose

   have him come in here suggested
vaughn  i want to see him-speak to
him

  she agreed and he directed the telephone-
operator to have the visitor shown into the
private office in a moment miguel stood
before them smiling hat in hand vaughn
suddenly remembered the two times he had
met him at the fouldera gallery but the
mestizo gave no sign of recognition he

was perfectly at his ease-or his acting was
worthy the cleverest broadway star

   what do you want miguel inquired
dolores

  miguel still smiling flashed a covertly
curious glance at vaughn

  dolores irritated frowned and continued
sharply  it must be something rather un-
usual for youre not in the habit of follow-
ing me about to speak to me

   i wanted to tell the senorita answered
miguel with eyes continually shifting to
vaughn  that i am her friend

   yes but why did you come here to
tell me

  he laughed softly  i would not follo
senorita if she came any other place-

   you mean miguel you wanted to see
me put in vaughn

  there was a flash of white teeth  yes
i never see you bejore never in my lije
the crudely strong emphasis laid upon
the words showed he was lying of course
he remembered seeing vaughn at the foul-
dera gallery-but why was he insisting
on the contrary

  miguel continued suavely  i want to
see mr vaughn for he is friend of yours
he help you i like him because he help
you i want to help him help you the
senorita understand

  dolores did not attempt to hide her im-
patience  certainly not what are you
talking about

  his smile - which despite its good
humor had a slightly mocking quality-
vanished suddenly he grew portentously
grave  miguel hear what the master say
to senorita last night-

   what she cried

   i hear him say he is not your father
but your sweetheart-

   miguel she flushed crimson

   i mean no harm when i say that the
master he mean no harm he- he
hesitated glancing furtively at vaughn
 he tell you the truth because he want to
do right thing

  both dolores and vaughn gazed at him
in astonishment what was his object in
defending the man he hated and why in
the same breath was he assuring dolores
he was her friend


all-story weekly

   miguel she said coldly  you must
know your opinion doesnt interest me in
the least your impudence in following me
here is unpardonable i shall have to apolo-
gize to mr vaughn-

   wait interrupted vaughn pleasantly
 there is a misunderstanding im sure
miguel means well perhaps he wants to
prove his-shall i say gratitude-to both
of you the  masterj and his adopted
daughter

  mr vaughn speak truth cried the
mestizo eagerly  you say just what  say
if i talk english as well as- he paused
smiling at vaughn then continued slowly
a mocking gleam in his eyes as well as i
make copy of victor hugos head
vaughn almost betrayed himself by a
start was not this reference to the repro-
duction of the rodin bust-the original
of which had been one of arsenjos biggest
pieces of booty-a challenge

   miguel said dolores  come to the
point when you say youre my friend do
you mean you know something of my child-
hood that youll tell me

  he nodded

   oh miguel she begged  tell me
now-

   not yet senorita i speak next satur-
day

   why must i wait

   i must have week to get all facts ready
then i tell them to you-and mr vaughn
mr vaughn is your good friend i tell mr
vaughn then he tell you

   why tell me at all queried vaughn
puzzled  why not tell just the senorita
 ah but it is your case you must have
glory i want to be good friend to the three
of you-the master whom i love ah like
dog love master like slave love master-to
the senorita who is good young lady-and
to you who are famous detective that never
lose a case and the only way i can be
friend to all of you is to wait till next sat-
urday

  vaughn eyed him intently  you say
youll tell us what you know but do you
know anything

   everything his tone had a convin-
cing ring  i tell senorita of her father
who came down from america to panama

and then to guayaquil and then to quito
where he meet the master next saturday
i tell all all adios and bowing the
mestizo turned and went swiftly toward the
door

   miguel entreated dolores

  but with his soft laugh he had already
gone

   what cruelty to make me wait she
sighed bitterly  what do you advise

   we must wait till saturday-

   but how can i remain under senor
arsenjos roof all this time she cried
shuddering  this man is not my father
he-

   senorita valdez is still with you isnt
she

   yes but she is no protection-she is
afraid of him

  vaughn studied  if you were to leave
now you might never learn the facts of your
parentage-arsenjo might silence miguel
forever-

   you mean he might kill him

   why not

   why mr vaughn-thats the same as
calling him a criminal-a- she fixed her
wide eyes upon him  do you know some-
thing about him is he involved in some
case youre working on

  he rose and then with grave friendliness
took her hand  my dear senorita-

   youll tell me-now she begged

   im not ready-yet

   but all this makes me more eager than
ever to leave him surely mr vaughn
you wont ask me to remain under the roof
of-oh what has he done

   isnt there some member of the house-
hold you can trust vaughn asked
 havent you a maid

   she left me only yesterday-

   just the thing he cried turning to the
telephone with a triumphant laugh  ill
provide you with a maid who will be mother
sister protector to you until you leave ar-
senjo-margot dale the cleverest woman in
new york and incidentally my good
friend

   a-detective queried dolores eager-
ly  a miracle-worker like you

  he nodded as he called margots number
fortunately she was in and in a few mo-
the head of arsenjo



ments he had explained his pressing need
and secured her consent to enact the role
of doloress maid for the next week

   miss dale will report for duty this
afternoon he said hanging up the receiver

  dolores was delighted with the arrange-
ment and when she left she was entirely
willing to stay out the week under arsenjos
roof

  vaughn hurried to margots washington
square apartment where he told his clever
coworker a detailed story of the case to
date she was lost in wonder at its rapid
development and was naively glad to be
 in  on the inevitably thrilling denoue-
ment now so imminent so in less than an
hour after vaughns departure she had
metamorphosed herself into a trim ladys-
maid taken a cab to arsenjos riverside
drive house and been  employed  by the
amused senorita toward evening she tele-
phoned vaughn with reassuring cheer
everythings all right owen couldnt
be better dont worry-im in a phone-
booth in a drug-store and nobody is listen-
ing seiiorita dolores has taken me to her
heart arsenjo has given me only a passing
glance not so with miguel-the sinister
half-breed flashed on me an inquisitive look
from those outlandish eyes of his but i
dont think he suspects anything why
shouldnt i be here the senorita cant get
along without a maid

  he laughed  of course not now lis-
ten margot if you have the chance try
to lay a stealthy hand on some of arsenjos
atmosphere-in other words the mysterious
drug he uses at the recitals but be very
careful-and keep an eye on the mestizo
good-by

chapter ix

behind the green curtain

the next day vaughn resumed his in-
vestigations into those of the arsenjo
recitals which had been given prior
to the one at mrs whympers he had
already interviewed five of the society
women at whose homes dolores had played
of these two had returned from week-ends
in the country and he immediately made

engagements to see them the remaining
one was in the far west he had her at-
torney secure her permission for him to
search her town house for spurious objets
dart which arsenjo might have exchanged
for valuable originals and by friday he
had finished his investigations

  the results were only what he had ex-
pected arsenjo had made away with
some priceless piece of booty from each
house where dolores had played-and by
methods similar to those he had used at
mrs whympers and mrs foulkess the
case was completed but vaughn decided
to wait until the morrow-the fateful sat-
urday on which miguel fhad promised to
make his disclosures-before swearing out
warrants for the mestizo and his master
on that day too lieutenant bateson
would be in town

  the week did not pass without several
incidents which threatened for a time to
precipitate matters and discount the com-
ing denouement for one thing arsenjo
waxed furious on the subject of the
 stolen  violin he telephoned vaughn a
number of times without getting any satis-
faction and at last called at the office im-
periously demanding the instant arrest of
lieutenant bateson as a thief

  vaughns answer was a challenge
 you dont have to wait on me swear
out the warrant yourself-ij you have the
courage

  this did the work arsenjo immediate-
ly calmed down mumbled a few meaning-
less phrases about having too much respect
for an american army officer to resort to
such rigorous measures personally then
assuring vaughn he would await his good
pleasure smilingly departed

  early the next morning margot tele-
phoned the detective some rather startling
news arsenjo had confided to dolores the
whole truth about the disappearance of the
violin admitting that he had  framed 
the theft sending the instrument to bate-
sons apartment by miguel who had gained
entrance with a pass key

   the man is just about crazy or he
never would have told her said margot
 he knows you have something up your
sleeve and thinks it better to forestall you


all-story weekly

and throw himself on her mercy he
frankly admitted the frame-up was an act
of sheer lunacy but his excuse was his
wild love for dolores and his wilder fear
that bateson might take her from him

  thus margot in telling vaughn had an-
ticipated any revelations arsenjo himself
might make and when the detective full
of the story drove to his office and found
the south american waiting for him his
involuntary smile might have betrayed the
fact that he knew all if his visitors per-
ception had not been less acute than usual
as it was arsenjo plunged without pre-
liminaries into a full confession of the
framing of bateson he spoke without re-
serve and expressed regret that he had re-
sorted to such a sorry business

   im perfectly sincere in saying this
he insisted  this is proved by my mak-
ing a clean breast to you i also intend to
make an apology to lieutenant bateson

  that evening vaughn had another un-
expected telephone message from margot

   strange things have been happening
out here on riverside drive for a day
or so miguel had been mysteriously miss-
ing and this afternoon when he returned
arsenjo proceeded to horsewhip him the
mestizo bore the brutal beating smilingly
-it almost seemed triumphantly-then he
confounded the slave driver with the ex-
planation of his absence he had been to
the dutch house on staten island and had
found conchita-i gathered she is the wo-
man who takes care of the house-ill in
bed so ill indeed that he declared she
would undoubtedly have died if he had
not stayed and ministered to her the
telephone happened to be out of order
and so he couldnt inform arsenjo of his
whereabouts

  but the most interesting thing of all was
this-one night while he was there burg-
lars tried to break into the room-he em-
phasized the word strangely in this room
arsenjo no doubt keeps his booty at the
news of burglars the south american grew
wildly excited but miguel reassured him
saying he had frightened them away he
then explained he had wired the room in
some way so as to install a burglar-alarm
-an invention of his own

   arsenjo thanked him sheepishly and
expressed regret he had resorted to the
horsewhip  no no master dont be
sorry replied the mestizo with a queer
gleam in his eyes  it is great honor to
be whipped by man with wonderful head
like yours all i ask is that you go out to
dutch house in the morning to see my
burglar-proof room you will arsenjo
smiled and promised what do you think
of it all owen

  vaughn laughed  it sounds too fan-
tastic to be true maybe miguel was ly-
ing about the burglar-proof room at any
rate its too late to protect arsenjos booty
de luxe-

   are you going to clamp down on ar-
senjo to-morrow

  i see no reason for delay-

  but i do owen think of that poor
child dolores and her sweetheart lieu-
tenant bateson she adores him imagine
her shame when all the details of the case
are known the public will link her with
the robberies and the disgrace will kill
her im begging her to go with me to
some secluded place in the adirondacks
for a couple of weeks-and if youll wait
till the first of next week i think i can
manage it what do you say

   well decide the question to-morrow
answered vaughn  to-morrows to be
the big day anyway lieutenant bateson
is coming to town and miguel is to tell his
story

   do you want me to go over to the
dutch house with arsenjo and miguel i
can arrange to have dolores ask arsenjo
to take us in the car for the ride and i
might happen to make an interesting dis-
covery or two

   a good idea vaughn agreed  if
possible try to take a look into the room
where the booty is kept

  evidently margot was determined to
keep vaughns telephone busy that night
half an hour later she called him up again

   everything is arranged beautifully
dolores and  are going over to the dutch
house-and to-night well remain there
till to-morrow morning i had dolores ask
arsenjo to take us miguel is to drive us
out in the moonlight
the head of arsenjo



   fine laughed vaughn  youre a
clever girl

  at ten oclock the next morning he had
another telephone message from margot
who to his surprise was still at the dutch
house on staten island

   i thought you said miguel declared
the phone was out of order he began in-
voluntarily

   it was but that remarkable mestizo
repaired it listen owen dolores has a
splitting headache-shes really too ill to
drive into town besides im not feeling
well myself miguel is ready to tell her-
and you-the whole story of her child-
hood as he promised but cant you come
out here to hear it miguel will go in for
you in the car and bring you back what
do you say

   im willing but where is arsenjo
 he too is unwell miguel reports he
had his coffee in his room as ugual

   has dolores said anything about see-
ing bateson i dare say hes in town this
morning

   shes going to ask him to come out
here this afternoon

   indeed he gave a short laugh  it
seems the whole center of action is shifting
over to the dutch house on the island
odd how fate works have you had a
peep into the booty room

   not yet be sure to be ready when
miguel calls by-by

  the next moment vaughn tried to get
lieutenant bateson on the telephone the
lieutenant was not in however he had
returned to town last night the house op-
erator declared she said further she had
seen him drive away an hour ago with a
dark-faced man who had called for him in
a large car

  the dark-faced man was of course mi-
guel-but margot had just said the after-
noon had been chosen as the time for the
lieutenants visit what was the meaning
of this

  toward noon miguel called to drive
vaughn over to the dutch house the
mestizo suave smiling presented a rather
arresting picture in a new suit of smart cut
and material heretofore he had been
dressed in chauffeurs cravenette or house

livery and vaughn wondered what had
caused this sudden blossoming

   mr vaughn ready to go to dutch
house queried miguel noting the detec-
tives puzzled look and evidently enjoying
it  the senorita tell him i am to drive
him out

   im ready answered vaughn  and
im going to take one of my men with me
and he signed to mcsurely to accompany
them

  miguel at first rather taken aback at
having an extra passenger soon was smil-
ing blandly as ever he made a rather
queer request of vaughn when they reached
the car

   you do me favor you ride in front
with me i say something fine to you on
way out

  vaughn agreed

  the drive down broadway to the ferry
and the sail across the bay were made in
silence it was not until they had reached
staten island and were speeding up rich-
mond terrace that miguel said the  some-
thing fine  he had promised

  first he flashed a glance back at mc-
surely who was stretched comfortably in
the big tonneau smoking a satisfying cigar
then bending toward vaughn he said in
low tones

   now listen i take you to window of
booty room and let you look in

  vaughns composure usually was shock
proof but now he gave a perceptible start
miguel chuckled

   mr vaughn like to take peep into
booty room the master keep his treas-
ures there the ivang-hsi vase - the
blakelock-the three henners-all the rest
-are there i would take good mr
vaughn who never lose a case inside booty
room but the master kill me if i do that
so best i can do is to give you peep

  so this mysterious miguel this half-
breed knew all he was most emphat-
ically  in  on the case vaughn aston-
ished asked a quite incidental question
first

   how does arsenjo happen to leave up
the window curtains of that room

  miguel smiled  he knows nothing
about it i attend to that
m

all-story weekly

   vaughn gazed at the dark profile in-
tently  why are you going to show me
the room to revenge yourself on-the
master

   the copperish face took on a deeper
copper  why should miguel revenge
himself on the good master

    dont you realize that what youre do-
 ing will help land senor arsenjo in
 prison

    ah but im going to beg the good mr
 vaughns mercy  take all blame myself
 i help him steal things anyway-you know
 that arrest me for crime i confess all
 i go to prison let the good master go
 free the senorita can marry young sol-
 dier you get glory from case and all
 end happy like story book you-
 careful there cried vaughn giving
 the wheel a sudden jerk and thereby swerv-
 ing the car from the curb toward which it
 had been veering  youd better drop this
 absurd talk and attend to driving

   no further word was spoken until they
drew within sight of the dutch house then
miguel pointed to a window in the north
wall

    booty room he said laconically
 not as easy to get into as it looks i
make set of adjustable bars to put inside
window to fool burglars i also wire room
to sound alarm he chuckled  i am
wonderful man yes

   the day was warm and pleasant and
vaughn had half expected to find dolores
and margot outside on the lawn to welcome
him but not a living creature was in
sight the silence-the loneliness-some-
how had a chilling effect on him sudden-
ly he remembered that lieutenant bateson
had preceded him here by some two hours
in his wonder at miguels desire to save
arsenjo he had entirely forgotten the
young soldier-and the odd fact that do-
lores had sent for him so much earlier than
she had at first intended
i  where is lieutenant bateson he
asked abruptly as miguel shut off the
power and approached the house slowly
and noiselessly

    with the master

   with-him

    yes

   so the senorita didnt have you bring
him out so early after all

   no the master have me bring him
out

   what for

  miguel flashed a smile-then his face
grew grave  the master who is best man
in world want to tell lieutenant he is sorry
for sending me with violin to lieutenants
house so lieutenant will be proved thief
so he send me to him very early to-day
with letter begging him to come out at
once the master want to beg his par-
don

  this sounded like the truth arsenjo
had told vaughn only the other day of his
desire to apologize to bateson but why
had he not gone about it in a simpler way
why had he asked him to make a trip of
twelve or fifteen miles out into the coun-
try

  vaughn put the question in so many
words to miguel

   the master is sick he cannot go into
town this morning so he ask the lieuten-
ant to come out here

  this sounded reasonable vaughn asked
 did the senorita see the lieutenant
when he came

   no i take him straight to the master
the master want to see him first

   what were they doing when you left
and came to town for me

  miguel burst into a harsh irrelevant
laugh  having grand quarrel

   a quarrel what about

   the master in most beautiful humble
way tell the whole truth to lieutenant not
only whole truth about violin but whole
truth about not being father of the seno-
rita the lieutenant struck dumb he
say nothing he just glare-like red sun
in storm then he find hoarse voice and
ask the master why this terrible thing
the master go very red then very white
then very purple and he scream out he
love her love her love her at this the
lieutenant grow purple too and they start
grand quarrel

   and then vou left

   yes

   why didnt you remain to see what
happened
the head of arsenjo



  miguel chuckled  mr vaughn ask
too much of poor miguel if i stay  sure-
ly kill lieutenant for saying cruel words to
the good master i dont want to become
murderer-so i hurry away

  the machine came to a halt near the
north wall vaughn cast a sweeping glance
around still there was no sign of life
about the place-and once more he was
seized with the same mysterious forebod-
ing he had experienced on first beholding
the house

   come said miguel  we take look
into booty room he turned to mcsure-
ly who was yawning after a snooze
 you too he added smiling  more-
merrier yes

  the three alighted and approached the
window miguel was slightly in advance
he glanced into the room-then gave a
sudden horrified cry vaughn and mc-
surely half pushed him aside and looked
for themselves

  what they saw froze their blood

  lieutenant bateson his hair disheveled
his clothing half torn from him his face
distorted with rage was bending over the
decapitated body of arsenjo a huge
knife red with blood was clutched in his
hand like a madman-a savage-he had
cut off his victims head

  good god gasped vaughn turning
sick and giddy and instinctively glancing
toward mac

  mac himself looked sick-sicker even
than the chief as for miguel he looked
the sickest of the three he leaned against
the wall and seemed on the verge of col-
lapse

  vaughn still faint almost nauseated
turned to that window of horrors

  blank green met his eyes the curtain
had been drawn bateson had looked out
and seen them

chapter x

booty and blood

vaughn throwing off the deadly
sickness that had overcome him at
sight of the murderer bending over
his decapitated victim turned to miguel

    	a-s

who was leaning limply against the wall
and roused him with a shake

   come he said  lead us inside

  the master wailed the mestizo
 my master he is dead lieutenant
cut his head off oh what awful wrath of
god and he fell on his knees and made
the sign of the cross

  vaughn gave him a rather ungentle pull
 here get up and take us into the room

   yes put in mcsurely  get a move
on half-breed he may give us the slip
he already knows were here or he never
would have pulled down that curtain

  miguel shuddering and muttering inco-
herently staggered to his feet and then led
them around to the front portico and into
the long broad hall nobody was in sight
not a sound could be heard the house-
inside as well as outside-still seemed to
have that curious air of being uninhabited

   which is the door snapped vaughn

  miguel pointed to the second of two
doors in the left wall it was closed
vaughn closely followed by mcsurely
hurried to it opened it and entered the
room the mestizo showing signs of col-
lapse reeled in after them

  the curtain was drawn but the room
was well lighted by the unusually brilliant
sun outside there on the floor lay the
ghastly headless body-but the murderer
had disappeared

   look there cried miguel pointing to
the window

  lying on the floor immediately under
the broad old-fashioned casement was
bateson his face pale but calm was to-
ward them his eyes were closed

   bateson called vaughn sharply

  no answer vaughn went to him shook
him called his name in his ear-then real-
ized the truth the man was sunk in un-
consciousness deeper than that of sleep
he had been in a terrific fit of rage as the
hideously distorted look of his face as seen
through the window had proved and this
no doubt had culminated in a sort of syn-
cope seeing the onlookers outside he had
rushed to the window drawn the curtain
and dropped senseless

   where is masters head cried mi-
guel  what did murderer do with it


all-story weekly

  the decapitated head vaughn shud-
dered in spite of himself what a fiendish
unheard-of murder he looked around for
the head as did mcsurely and miguel-
everywhere it was gone so was the big
blood-stained knife what had bateson
done with them where had he hidden
them how had it been possible to hide
them in the moment-the mere instant-
that had elapsed between the onlookers
view into the room and the drawing of the
curtain vaughn searched the murderers
clothes-no knife the hands were
stained with blood there was even a dark
sinister trail of blood on the light-colored
floor-matting from the corpse to the win-
dow but the head-that magnificent head
of arsenjo-and the knife that had severed
it were nowhere to be found

  the masters head wept miguel
 the beautiful head that i paint so many
times where is it dog he screamed
rushing to bateson and kicking him mad-
ly  dog i kill you for this i-
vaughn pushed him away from the pros-
trate lieutenant and sent him reeling across
the room then with mcsurelys help
he pulled down the draperies from the
locked double doors that led to the next
room and covered the murdered mans
body and the pool of blood beside it

   now we must notify the richmond
police station he said  i suppose the
phone is in the hall miguel

  there was no reply had the mestizo
collapsed at last both vaughn and mc-
surely glanced about the room expecting
to find him stretched prostrate in some
corner but oddly enough he had disap-
peared

  vaughn uttered an impatient exclama-
tion  where has that lunatic gone

  at that moment the engine of the motor-
car outside began roaring vaughn ran to
the window raised the curtain and looked
out miguel was at the wheel turning the
machine around vaughn tried to raise
the window it was locked he broke a
hole in the glass with his elbow and then
called out

   wait where are you going

  to police station to bring back police
to arrest murderer of my master 

   come back im going to telephone
the police-

  but with a wild cry the mestizo was off
racing down the road at top speed

   hes gone clean crazy commented
mac disgustedly

   small wonder said vaughn with a
look at bateson stretched at their feet and
then at the covered thing in the center of
the room  mac you stay here with bate-
son bring him to if you can-but hold
him you have your gun mac nodded
 good now im going to phone the
richmond station-that mad miguel may
not be able to find the place or may steer
into a tree on the way there and he
hurried out into the hall

  there was no telephone in sight
vaughn knocked on the door immediately
opposite no answer he opened it and
advanced into the dining-room here he
found the telephone he immediately
called up the richmond borough police
station briefly stated the facts of the mur-
der so far as he knew them and requested
the captain to send the patrol at once

  returning to the hall he remembered
with a grimly amused start that though he
had been in the booty room he had not
seen any of the booty-indeed he had
even forgotten to look for it since the
ghastly sight through the window his mind
had been dominated wholly by this most
monstrous of crimes a sinister spell was
upon him-even as upon the entire house

  he glanced around then up the broad
stairway-curiously almost with a sense
of dread where was everybody-do-
lores margot the housekeeper conchita
had the crime been committed without
rousing a single soul or aware of it-
and terrified by it-had the inmates of the
house fled up-stairs and locked themselves
in their rooms it was conceivable that
dolores and the housekeeper might have
been frightened to this extent not so mar-
got she was used to danger and had the
calm courage that comes of it

  vaughn hesitating no longer bounded
up the stairs and knocked on the first door
it was opened at once by margot

   owen when did you come whats
the matter you look pale as a ghost
the head of arsenjo



   where is senorita dolores he asked

  she pointed to a half open door leading
to an inner room  shes been very ill-
so have i for that matter we must have
eaten something that poisoned us shes
asleep now but owen what has hap-
pened

   have you been asleep too he que-
ried grimly  has everybody in the house
been asleep

  she looked her amazement  why no
dolores and i have been up here ill she
almost lost consciousness in the awful nau-
sea that seized her shortly after breakfast
-and ive felt nearly as bad as for the
senor and conchita i dont know what
theyre doing-but i dont think theyre
asleep

   and-bateson

   he isnt here-yet hes coming this
afternoon owen what has happened
you-

   margot he said  arsenjo is dead

   what 

   and bateson killed him

  owen she gasped impossible
lieutenant bateson-  oh i cant believe
it

   i couldnt either if i hadnt seen him
knife in hand bending over his decapitated
victim

   decapitated she cried horror-struck
 he really cut off- oh it cant be-

  he briefly told her of the circumstances
that had led up to his looking through the
window and the frightful sight he had be-
held and then took her down-stairs to the
scene of the crime the covered corpse
on the floor the blood stains on the mat-
ting the unconscious slayer under the case-
ment-these things brought the tragedy
home to her as a grimly obtrusive and un-
deniable fact once accepted as a fact
her cool impersonal professionalism reas-
serted itself and while mcsurely described
the grisly scene they had witnessed through
the window amplifying vaughns rather
meager details she bent over the prostrate
bateson and tried to bring him back to
consciousness

  meanwhile vaughn in a half mechanical
way had begun to hunt for the murdered
mans booty-the fruit of his robberies de

  luxe it was not a difficult search in
boxes and packing-cases hidden behind
tapestries and various pieces of furniture
he found mrs whympers kang-hsi vase
mrs foulkess blakelock the bouguereau
venus the rodin victor hugo-
everything save the three ilenners what
had become of them miguel had brought
them here

  he turned suddenly and looked at the
motionless covered thing on the floor ar-
senjo would not have to pay the penalty
now but miguel remained and miguel
had been particeps criminis the grim set
of vaughns lips became grimmer as he
thought of how unrelentingly he would put
the mestizo through

   owen called margot softly  hes
waking

  bateson was indeed opening his eyes
he looked around blankly not seeming to
realize his whereabouts or recognize those
about him deathly pale he suddenly
grew paler still his skin taking on a livid
green

   im sick he gasped trying to rise
nauseated help me to the window

  he staggered to his feet mcsurely as-
sisting him vaughn knocked out the rest
of the broken pane and he leaned out and
relieved his stomach

   that is not assumed at any rate mur-
mured vaughn to margot  ive never
seen a sicker man

   i dont wonder hes sick-after that
pointing to the covered corpse

  in a few moments bateson relieved
reeled from the window and dropped into a
chair he then sighed heavily and closed
his eyes

   bateson called vaughn sharply

   yes came the dreamy murmur

   youd better stay awake the police
will be here shortly

   the police he was still drowsy
 what for

   to arrest you

   me what for his eyes were wide
open now

  for the murder of arsenjo

 what arsenjo dead and i-
what is this youre telling me he rose
fell back upon the chair weakly then man-


all-story weekly

  aged to gain his feet again  where am
i and who are you ah-vaughn
what are you doing here and i-why
am i here ah i remember-miguel
wheres miguel lie came for me he
said arsenjo wanted to see me wheres
arsenjo what has happened anyway
did i faint theres a strange feeling in
my head-and oh that horrible sickness
at my stomach

   superb acting whispered margot to
vaughn  why does he resort to it he
jnust know its worse than futile

  the puzzled look in batesons eyes deep-
ened  why are all of you staring at me
what has happened where is arsenjo
 here cried vaughn bendiiv down
and sweeping the covering from the  ead-
less body

  a sir henry irving could not have done
it more dramatically with more of a re-
pressed passion of accusation and again
a sir henry irving could not have ex-
pressed more effectively batesons com-
bined astonishment and horror as he ex-
claimed hoarsely

   that arsenjo that headless body
good god who did it

   you

   i

 you and vaughn covered the
corpse again

   man youre joking i havent seen
arsenjo miguel brought me here to see
him i admit-but he didnt appear i
was ushered in here by miguel and told to
wait then suddenly-or gradually-i
really dont know which-i became death-
ly ill-strangely-horribly ill then i
must have lost consciousness-since you
found me here you did find me here i
take it

  vaughn astonished by this gigantic pre-
tense of innocence did not answer bate-
son continued agitatedly

   i had already made an engagement to
come out here this afternoon to see seno-
rita dolores so i was surprised when mi-
guel brought me this message from ar-
senjo asking me to come this morning
he fumbled in his pocket and brought out
a crumpled sheet of paper and handed it
to vaughn who took it mechanically and

  glanced hastily at the three rather ill-writ-
ten lines

  i have something important to say regarding
the violin i wish to confess all please come at
once-and say nothing to any one about it
miguel will bring you	arsenjo

  vaughn folded the paper and put it into
his pocket

  bateson went on naturally i came
i didnt set eyes on arsenjo till just now
that is true as god is my witness miguel
-or somebody else-committed this bar-
barous crime

  vaughn disgusted by this barefacedness
took up the challenge  miguel why

i	saw you with the knife in your hand
your victim at your feet

  saw me gasped bateson when
where

 ten minutes ago-and here of course
on the exact spot where the body now lies
 you looked through the window

   yes

   and saw the knife in my hand

   yes what have you done with it
 i repeat i had absolutely nothing to
do with this dastardly murder im not a
madman-a fiend even if i wanted to
kill a man do you think id cut off his
head why-

  that reminds me interrupted
vaughn grimly  what have you done with
the head

  bateson flushed hotly  didnt i just
say-

  he broke off abruptly there was a
sudden sound at the door and dolores
pale hollow-eyed a bit disheveled came
into the room

 lieutenant bateson and mr
vaughn too she exclaimed blushing
rosily  this is a pleasant surprise i
hadnt expected you so early-at least you
lieutenant i- she seemed quite em-
barrassed - almost confused indeed
 margot i was hunting you i awoke a
minute ago and came down by the back
stairway i found conchita quite ill the
poor creature thought she was about to die
she said she hadnt seen you and so-
she broke off glancing perplexedly from
one to the other  what is the matter
the head of arsenjo



all of you look as though something dread-
ful had happened where is senor ar-
senjo her gaze suddenly fixed itself on
the covered heap on the floor  what is
that she gasped advancing a step to-
ward it  it looks like-like-

  margot went and put her arm around
her  my dear come up-stairs with me
 no what is that-that thing on the
floor

  bateson beside himself gave a wild
laugh  senor arsenjo he burst out
despite vaughns desperate signal for si-
lence  hes dead-murdered in cold
blood his head is cut off and these
people say  did it they even say they
saw me do it good joke eh he
laughed again then realizing the uel
shock he had given her apologized pre-
cipitately  forgive me for speaking with
such brutal frankness but all this has
driven me half mad i can only say i am
innocent and-

  but dolores succumbing to the blow
sank back in margots arms in a dead
faint vaughn directed mcsurely to carry
her up-stairs margot accompanied them
leaving the detective and bateson alone
the accused man having recovered his
composure stood motionless a moment
gazing thoughtfully at arsenjos covered
body then giving in to a sudden impulse
approached vaughn and held out his hand
appealingly

  vaughn hesitated then half turned away
 im sorry he said  but after i
saw-

   say no more bateson interrupted
proudly  of course youve telephoned
for the police

   yes

  he made as if to speak further bit his
lip gave a weary shrug and strode to the
window where he stood motionless look-
ing out the policemen found him thus
when a few minutes later they dashed up
in the auto patrol to take him to the sta-
tion he smiled with a sort of tragic
amusement as vaughn pointed him out as
the man who had committed the murder
but thereafter he wore the expression of a
stone man he refused to say a word in
his own defense or answer any questions

dven during the examination of the ghast-
ly headless corpse by the medical officer
he stood motionless his arms folded his
gaze steady there was nothing theatrical
about his attitude

  the detectives searched the premises for
the missing knife and head-that superb
head of arsenjo which had elicited the
wondering admiration of everybody who
had beheld it-but could find neither the
sarcastically smiling bateson was then
bundled into the patrol and vaughn and
mcsurely were taken along as witnesses
the corpse was to be left in charge of a
policemen until the arrival of the dead
wagon

  the patrol had scarcely pulled away
from the house when one of the detectives
turned to vaughn and inquired

   wheres our chief witness-that half-
breed you told me about who brought
bateson out here and heard the quarrel
in the welter of developments vaughn
had forgotten miguel entirely  isnt he
at the station he asked  he motored
there you didnt meet him on the way-
dark-black-eyed - enormous shoulders-
driving a big foreign car

   no-didnt meet anybody

   he perhaps missed the way no
doubt well see him at the station or meet
him as he comes back he was so upset
he hardly knew what he was doing

  but they ran into no wild-eyed mestizo
tearing back to the sinister house in the
woods and when they reached the police
station the desk captain declared he had
not been there

  then for the first time bateson spoke
with a derisive smile he turned to vaughn

   dont you think this precious mestizo
as you call him has run away

   i do

   you remember i told you he had prob-
ably killed arsenjo well doesnt this look
like it

   why so

   whats he running away for if he isnt
guilty of something

   he is-but not of murder and
vaughn smiled  he was particeps crim-
inis with arsenjo in a series of bold and
stupendous robberies he knew i was


all-story weekly

working on the case so hes seized this
chance to give us the slip im sorry-
youre not as sorry as i am cried
bateson hotly  that dog killed arsenjo
and now owing to your colossal negligence
or stupidity-maybe both-this murderer
will be enabled to get back to south amer-
ica-while i an innocent man may be
railroaded to the electric chair on the un-
supported testimony of you and your un-
derling sleuth

   thats just about what will happen
lieutenant bateson answered vaughn
quietly  that is as it applies to you as
for miguel well do our best to apprehend
him but let me tell you this-if he takes
the witness stand your conviction is all the
more certain his testimony will supply
the motive jor the crime mcsurely and i
saw you commit so even if you prove
we have glass eyes the state will still have
a pretty fair case against you

  that evening vaughn received the fol-
lowing letter by special delivery

mr vaughn

  i send you this quick so you will not worry
you are such good man and such wonderful won-
derful detective if i do not do this you wonder
where mestizo miguel is and what he is doing
and if he ever come back you wonder so much
you get sick in head yes that is bad so i take
all this trouble to write you and pay extra
postage besides when you get this i am far
away you never see me again i am gone for-
ever-with the three hcnners ah you jump at
this and grow red in face you kick yourself
and call yourself fool

  did you really think miguel fool enough to
stay here and go to prison for robberies i help
my master yes for he was good man but i do
not like prison bars-no in prison i cannot
paint or do any of the other things i want to do
so i take just the three henners-that is all give
the rest back to owners with miguels compli-
ments-i take three henners sell them for one
hundred thousand dollars become great artist
and live happy ever after and you get glory
from case just the same

  i have double reason for going away now i
am crazy with grief because the master die he
was good man i cannot stay where everything
remind me of him if i stay i break into jail
and kill man who murdered him he cut off the
masters head think-that head that was the
only one in all the world but i know bateson
die for it for you see him do it

  the senorita is good young lady but i owe her
nothing i love her not-i hate her not her
mother is dead when her father bring her to

ecuador a little baby he is good young man
but he has no relative on earth he tell arsenjo
arsenjo good man too but he can play trick on
young man he sell young man cacao plantation
that is rotten swampland that grow nothing
young man go there and get fever and die but
he beg arsenjo to take his baby arsenjo has spell
of remorse he take her that is all i know
she know rest	

  here i say senorita know nothing of robberies
she is innocent as baby so is senorita valdez
sometimes the master give her medicine without
her knowledge to make her sick at house where
senorita play so he can call footman away from
front door so i can make exchange of copies for
originals and then get away while footman gone
but senorita valdez know nothing about it no-
body know anything about it but the master and
me

  good-by mr vaughn you are great man-
you never lose a case i hate to leave you yes
i like you ever since i first meet you in gallery
where you find me copying three henners ex-
cuse me if i laugh you were working on case
then-and you think you make wonderful dis-
covery when you find me painting three henners
excuse me if i laugh adios

chapter xi

miguels the man

early the next morning dolores ac-
companied by margot called on
vaughn at his office her calm de-
meanor surprised him she had recovered
from her illness of yesterday and showed
no effects of the shock she had sustained

   i know everything she said smiling
faintly  margot has told me about the
robberies-all

   i had to laughed margot in answer
to his look of surprise  she forced it
from me-she guessed at the truth so clev-
erly and persistently

   to-morrows papers will have the
whole story he said gravely  but there
wont be one word of reflection on seno-
rita dolores

  she flushed  thank you mr vaughn
i am innocent but oh how blind-how
stupid i have been i didnt come to talk
about this though i came to ask a favor
i want you through your influence with the
police to secure me an interview with lieu-
tenant bateson will you

  this was her first reference to arsenjos
slayer vaughn was disappointed he
the head of arsenjo



had hoped the shocking nature of bate-
sons crime had cured her of her fondness
for him

   i know what youre thinking she
said  youre wondering how its possi-
ble i want to see him after what has hap-
pened i believe absolutely in his inno-
cence

   what protested vaughn  but mc-
surely and i saw him-

   i dont care he says he is innocent
and i believe him you dont know him
as well as i do hes incapable of lying
you and mr mcsurely have made some
terrible mistake thats all i know you
think youre telling the truth your senses
played some tragical trick on you

  vaughn smiled and promised to try to
secure her the interview with bateson

   oh how can i thank you she cried
brokenly  this is the greatest of favors
by the way will you ask if i can see mi-
guel at the same time i want him to tell
me of my childhood as he promised

   miguel is not at the police station

   wasnt he taken along and held as a
witness

   miguel has run away he disappeared
immediately after we found arsenjos
body the police are scouring the city for
him he took miguels letter from his
pocket and handed it to her

  she read it eagerly

   you must find miguel mr vaughn
he is the man who can clear up the mys-
tery of the murder

   but there is no mystery to clear up
when an act is seen-

  but she interrupted him excitedly in-
sisting that if miguel could be found and
made to speak all evidence against lieu-
tenant bateson-even the direct ocular evi-
dence afforded by the view of vaughn and
mcsurely through the window would col-
lapse  im not saying miguel himself
committed the murder she qualified
 but i do say he knows enough about it
to clear lieutenant bateson

  vaughn did not discuss the matter it
was too absurd but her ingenuous belief
in the man she loved rather touched him
for all that and he listened patiently
enough to her amusingly formidable mar-

shaling of reasons to prove that seeing is
not believing-that human sight of all the
senses is the least trustworthy and when
she and margot left he again assured her
he would try hard to secure the interview
with lieutenant bateson that very after-
noon

  he succeeded dolores had a long talk
with her sweetheart margot who accom-
panied her to the police station gave
vaughn a rather affecting report of the
meeting  honestly owen they behaved
gloriously-not a tear not a word of pro-
test against fate not a word of reproach
for you both are facing the music he-
roically they feel a terrible mistake has
been made by somebody-most probably
by you-but they dont blame you lieu-
tenant bateson said to me i believe every
word mr vaughn says he simply had an
optical illusion 

  that evening vaughn called at the riv-
erside drive house dolores who had
come in from staten island and taken up
her residence in town again-with her
faithful margot as indispensable friend and
companion-greeted him cordially and
gave him carte blanche to hunt through
arsenjos effects for the drug which had
been used at the recitals going to the
dead mans room and forcing a drawer in
a japanese cabinet he found it-a curious
grayish substance a sort of rough dried
paste made from various leaves particles
of which were still showing it filled sev-
eral good-sized tin boxes and had a sicken-
ing sweetish odor which savored of the
miasmatic equatorial forests with it were
a number of small atomizers in one of
these was an opaque liquid which had the
same odor as the pasty substance in the
tin boxes

  chemical analysis proved the drug to be
unique the chemist-one of the most
skilful in new york-declared he had
never run across such a peculiar and pow-
erful anesthetic and when vaughn ex-
perimented with the liquid on mcsurely
and several of his office force including
two young women the evidence was com-
plete-beyond doubt the drug was the one
arsenjo had used the sensations of mac
and the others were strikingly similar to


all-story weekly

those of the smart auditors at senorita
doloress recitals

  the next morning the newspapers pub-
lished the whole sensational account of
arsenjos amazing robberies and this
story following that of the murder which
had appeared only the day before added
the finishing touch to new yorks wonder
in cafes tea rooms clubs hotels the dou-
ble cases of arsenjo-the slaying and the
thefts-were  the only topics of conversa-
tion

  several days later dolores made another
call on vaughn this time she was unac-
companied by margot her glittering eyes
indicated latent excitement but she seemed
to have gained a new independence of
spirit a new strength vaughn wondered
what had happened he soon learned
plunging at once into the subject that had
brought her she gave him a distinct shock

   mr vaughn yesterday i returned
mrs whymper every cent of the four thou-
sand dollars she paid senor arsenjo for the
recital i gave at her house-i returned
every cent everybody paid to hear me
play

   what

   this is not all i reimbursed dr du-
rant for the loss of his three henners which
miguel took away dr durant didnt
want to accept a penny-he protested most
gallantly he insisted he still thought me
a great violinist her voice broke a trifle

   you must have a good deal of money
was vaughns dry comment

    havent a cent now she laughed
 i had over a hundred thousand dollars
which senor arsenjo had given me in my
own name

   whats become of the rest then

   ive given it all to the red cross

   but-dont you think that rather reck-
less generosity one must live you know
 on that money she flamed  re-
member how it was acquired part of it
was stolen part obtained through false pre-
tenses besides why cant i earn some
money

   you can he agreed enthusiastically
 give some recitals youd be a star at-
traction just now for months the public
lias been longing to hear you play and

you could fill carnegie hall every night
for a week at double usual prices

   there are just two reasons why im
going to play-not for small huddled com-
panies of the socially prominent but for
as big crowdsof plain every-day people
as will come to hear me she said gravely
 i want to show the world i can play even
without any drug to impart day dreams to
my hearers-and i want to earn money
enough to pay owen vaughn miracle de-
tective for the very difficult work im go-
ing to ask him to do

   have you a new case for me queried
vaughn covertly amused

   yes-one that will tax even your pow-
ers a murder case

   murder why who has been killed
   senor arsenjo

  arsenjo but you said its a new
case

   listen mr vaughn i want you to
forget everything you know about this case
except that senor arsenjo was murdered
and that miguel disappeared immediately
after the crime i want you to forget that
lieutenant bateson was out at the dutch
house at the time-that you saw him with
the knife in his hand-that he has been
arrested and is now facing trial-in short
that he exists at all then i want you to
assume that miguel is the murderer there
is your case will you take it-at your
own price

  vaughn listened to this astonishing
speech with mixed feelings the absurdity
of doloress proposal might have awakened
his derision had it not sprung from her
desperate desire to save her sweetheart
from the electric chair

   you keep on forgetting the unforget-
table fact he said gravely  i saw lieu-
tenant bateson-

  but she interrupted him with gay bel-
ligerence  you must forget it too now
listen heres a fair question if you hadnt
seen-or fancied you had seen-lieuten-
ant bateson with the knife in his hand
wouldnt you feel justified in strongly sus-
pecting miguel as the murderer

   not necessarily where is miguels
motive

  the head of arsenjo
the head of arsenjo



vaughn gave a start  you mean-
she was trembling with excitement
 listen you know what a mania miguel
had to paint that head he was always
raving about it

   but he didnt have to commit murder
to paint it arsenjo had let him paint it
many times

   you dont understand-you really
dont know miguel the time came when
he was content no longer with merely
painting the head-he had to possess it
 horrible incredible miguel wasnt
a madman

   but he was and he killed arsenjo
for his head how are we to explain the
heads disappearance otherwise lieuten-
ant bateson hadnt a motive in the world
to hide it-youll admit that

   yes

   then what became of it it has never
been found

  vaughn motionless sat gazing at the
eager flushed face-but with unseeing
eyes beyond dolores-through her indeed
-he was gazing-envisaging as though
under a spell the head arsenjos matchless
brow the crown of white hair the cruel
sinister face beneath that head it had
astounded him when first he had beheld it
-now it gave him a thrill always carry-
ing with it a strange sense of fatality it
now seemed to be drawing unto itself like
some monstrous magnet all the brooding

grotesquery of the murder making of itself
at once the motive and the mystery of the
crime

  mystery it was the first time vaughn
had admitted to himself there could be
any in connection with a murder he had
seen committed dolores saw the changed
expression of his face and clapped her
hands like a happy child

  youll do it youll take the case
he gave a start the head faded he
came back to himself-and laughed  but
i know bateson killed arsenjo

   listen she interrupted feverishly  if
you insist on refusing this case will you
take another

   what sort of case

   find miguel

   but the police are already trying to
find him

   i want you to find him find him for
me im not asking you now to admit
you might have made a mistake when you
thought you saw lieutenant bateson kill

he was known among places he
frequented as  die sport yet
there was nothing about his person-
age to indicate that which the average man
looks for in a sport he had the appear-
ance of a broker rather than that of a sport
jyet sport in the finest sense of the word
was frank twoomey-a gambler who was
absolutely on the level
fe- the sport had finished his breakfast in a
troubled frame of mind for he had reached
the end of his money and the indications
were that he would have to dismiss his
valet give up his rooms at the hotel and
find some settled employment moodily he
started down broadway

  at thirty-seventh street his thoughts
had become particularly bitter he was
walking head down when he ran into a man
coming his way he was about to apologize
when the man reached out and grabbed his
hand nearly shaking it off

    well well if it isnt frank twoomey
i would have known you anywhere you
have not changed one iota since the old
school days

  twoomey glanced up the puzzled ex-
pression on his face quickly changing to one
of welcome  by jove if it isnt my old
roommate russell swift

  to swifts question  what have you
been doing all these years twoomey an-
swered  oh just drifting mostly made a
pile but have got rid of most of it tell me
about yourself

   i finished up at the university and
then went to work for the woodward iron
company in birmingham i did fairly well
-got advanced to superintendent then
threw my lot in with the ocean steel com-
pany in gadsden was given quite a bunch
of the stock and bought a great deal more
when it was selling around fifty cents
then the war started and you know ocean
steel took a jump up to forty-three dollars
every one said sell but i held on and we
got the british orders and zowie she went
up to one hundred and ninety and has
been around that ever since-

   i was pretty lucky too in a lumber
deal you know how lumber has advanced
since the war and now i have more than
any one man has a right to and dont ever
have to work again if i dont want to have
my yacht up here and am taking a vaca-
tion the first since i left school but give
me a more definite line regarding your-
self

   as i said before russ i have clone
nothing much just sort of speculated
around made some here and dropped some
there for some reason which the sport
could not explain to himself he did not
want to let his old friend know the exis-
tence he had been leading since they parted
ways it was the first time in his life he
had ever denied or in any way evaded that
he was a gambler and he felt ashamed

   lets have a drink frank just for old-
times sake how about it
his lordship rolls the bones



   lead me to it russ

  at the bar where the ordered their
drinks some loungers saw twoomey and
nodded hello sport at which frank
blushed like a sixteen-year-old girl receiving
a compliment russell noticed the blush
saying  whats the matter old boy they
used to call you that at school and you
never turned color remember how you
used to bet your money boy you cer-
tainly had the nerve in those days have
you still got it and without waiting for
an answer plunged into a story of the
others gambling spirit at college

   drop it russ i dont like to be re-
minded of these things

  well well so the old boy has quit
gambling eh and dont want to be re-
minded of it

  a stranger at the bar at this remark
turned to see to whom it had been ad-
dressed and burst into a loud laugh

  twoomey quietly addressing the stran-
ger said  i dont know who you are nor
do i care but it is evident that you are
laughing at our conversation we both
happen to be southern gentlemen one
more pleasantry from you and i will take
the matter up personally

  twoomey spoke in a quiet but convincing
tone the stranger said  pardon me but
i mistook you for a gambler who used to
run a crooked joint on forty-second street
this gambler was called the sport and had
the public fooled into thinking his was a
straight place but i am mistaken and
you can see how comical the remark sound-
ed to me thinking you were the profes-
sional when your friend said you had quit
gambling

  twoomey simply turned his back as if
neither the conversation nor die stranger
any longer interested him the stranger
flushed moved as if to say something
looked at the sturdy shoulders of twoomey
remembered the dangerous look in the eyes
paid for his drink walked to the door and
said mockingly  good morning mr
southern gentleman

  at the same time there entered the place
a man in a light-gray suit flashy tie and
a large diamond stud seeing frank he
walked stranght up to him saying  hello

sport i hear you are about down and out
if that is so i would like to talk business
to you as the bunch that are running things
cant get a play from the big suckers but
if you come in your name will get them all
in and we will do the operating and trim
them to a fareyewell

   you dont have to know about the
works at all just get your twenty-five
per cent every day the suckers will break
the door down coming in if they know you
are connected with the house as they know
you have never pulled off anydiing shady
what do you say

  frank who had been toying with his
drink during this address picked up his
glass raised it to the level of the speakers
face and threw the contents at him saying
 thats all abe

   all right twoomey came back from
abe angrily  some day you will be sorry
you are so darned proud  and with that
he walked out a great deal faster than he
entered

  russell said  what is the matter
sporty boy did he want you to back a
crooked stock-selling game

  frank seeing that russell thought he was
in the brokerage business said  yes he
wants me to go into a wildcat scheme to
fleece the public has tried twice before to
get me you see i have a pretty large
following who believe in me and would buy
anything i recommend

  russell looking at his friend with an air
of pride remarked  well i dont blame
them for wanting your name in any enter-
prise there never was a squarer man
ill tell you what we will do lets go out
to the yacht club and get on my boat and
enjoy life for a few weeks

  frank thought for a minute then said
 delighted but first i must get in touch
with my man

   all right bring him along and give me
the privilege of watching him dress you in
the morning

  as they started to the club frank felt
better than he had for years while he al-
ways looked upon his  profession  as a
square one he had always felt deep down
that he was not the man his mother thought
he was andhe did not always like the class


all-story weekly

of people with whom he was familiarly
thrown to-day this had been rankling in
his breast now for the first time in years
something of his old self-respect came back
to him

  when they arrived at the club they
found two notes awaiting russell one was
an invitation from reggie westervelt a
large stockholder in the ocean steel invit-
ing russell to a stag affair at his house for
that evening to meet lord terrence earl
of donneghalv who was over here with the
british mission another was for a dance
secured through the courtesy of westervelt

  russell immediately called westervelt on
the phone and told him he would have to
decline the invitation for the stag as he
had just met an old friend whom he had not
seen since leaving college westervelt
would not take  no  for an answer and
insisted on his coming and bringing his
friend

  when russell told frank about it the
latter exclaimed  what are you in ocean
steel that a man like westervelt should
urge an invitation on you

   oh nothing much russ said  only
president

  that evening while putting the finishing
touches to his toilet frank inwardly
prayed that none of his former patrons
would be miere and if so he hoped that
they would not recognize him his name
told nothing he was known only by his
nickname the sport to the great majority
of men who frequented his former palaces

  true when warren h west had first or-
ganized his steel and ship-building com-
pany he had offered twoomey a lucrative
position and a chance to buy stock in the
company he had done this out of friend-
ship for the gambler in whom he saw a
man of more than ordinary ability he
had also told him that at any time he
wanted to start in the business world to call
on him

  but to-night frank wanted to sail on his
own it was with a slight feeling of
misgiving that he entered the waiting car
and he felt that if it were not the same as
welshing a bet he would even now back
out

  both men seemed to be in a pensive mood

as the car drove up-town toward pelham
bay park where westervelts home was lo-
cated as they passed through the town
broadway with its myriad lights never
seemed so cold so distant to twoomey as it
did now heretofore he was the most ardent
of new yorkers to-night he wanted
quiet wanted to get away from it all-from
himself and all his past and start anew

  what caused this discontent he could not
analyze it was not being broke for he
had russell who would let him have al-
most anything he desired it was unex-
plainable as they were held up by the
traffic policeman on the corner he heard a
soldier making a speech asking men to join
the army if not able to join then at least
do something useful for their country

  then the sport knew what was the mat-
ter he felt that he had never done any-
thing useful for his country or fellow man
there was more to life than merely being
on the square he made a mental resolu-
tion to go into some work that would be
useful either in the army or where he could
serve best in the morning he would see
mr west and get his advice

  on their arrival they were announced
mr swift and mr twoomey of alabama
with one quick glance franks eyes swept
the room to see if he could recognize any
one who in turn might recognize him

  he saw two men whom he knew one
was an author a very good friend who
lived in washington square and with
whom twoomey had passed many a pleas-
ant evening the other was the stranger
who had bade him  good morning mr
southern gentleman  in the saloon that
morning there was that about the mans
appearance that frank did not like if he
had seen him at one of his former  clubs
he would have classified him as a disagree-
able loser

  an announcement was made that lord
terrence had been delayed and would ar-
rive later but that dinner would be held
for him the guests then turned to the
billiard and card room frank drifted
onto the porch he could plainly hear
the conversation in the front room

  his friend the author roy masters was
talking ad here as in other places when
his lordship rolls the bones



he talked others listened eagerly the man
was magnetic he was telling them the
majority of people did not realize the seri-
ousness of the war that we were in for a
long and a hard fight that the war would
revolutionize business that these changes
would call for men who had the ability to
organize and lead the men who had gone
to the first officers training camp would
never regret it

  a young officer who had just finished
the first camp at plattsburg laughingly
said that as long as the army was being dis-
cussed he would gladly give an exhibition
of skill with army equipment and taking
out a pair of dice from his pocket saying
 no officers equipment is complete with-
out them offered to bet a hundred dollars
he was right

  in less time than it takes to tell a
real crap game was on frank watched
through the window for a few minutes then
thought he would drift in and make a bet or
two it was not until he reached the table
that he thought of his depleted finances
as he reached the table the dice reached his
place at the same moment

  he hesitated a moment whether or not
to shoot or to let the dice pass to the next
shooter and to his credit the thought of
 handling  the dice never entered his
mind though they were shooting on a soft
navaho blanket with which the billiard-
table was covered and men much less ex-
pert than twoomey could easily evenroll
on such a surface

  just as he was getting ready to say he
did not shoot the man on his right said
 well mr man who gets mad if told he
looks like a gambler have you nerve
enough to make a shot

  frank merely smiled threw down one
hundred dollars which was covered by the
speaker whose privilege it was to fade the
bet and threw the dice

   six-ace seven called a voice from the
other side of the table  the shooter wins
frank breathed a sigh of relief at least
he could shoot again and if he lost be none
the worse off as he could leave the table by
the time the dice got back to his place

   shoot the man on his right said
dont pike shoot the two hundred and

give me a chance to do something besides
break even on your shot

    all right said frank  two i shoot
and threw the dice out  eleven  called
the man at the far end of the table
 shooter wins again

   quite a slicker came from the man
who had faded the bet but laughing cries
came up from around the table  why the
shooter doesnt even look at the dice when
he picks them up and throws them the full
length of the table in fact they bounce
away from the cushions back on the table
more nettled by the way in which the
rest of the men repudiated his insinuations
than he showed he said  well shoot the
four hundred and if you hit then i will
fade that too mr southern gentleman
frank laughed reached for the dice say-
ing  it all goes as he threw the dice

   tray-ace-came from across the table
- four well it looks as if you let it ride
once too often

  the man on his right was jubilant

   two to one on four he began  now
mr southern gentleman if you think you
have the nerve you can take that bet in
any amount up to ten thousand dollars
frank looked at him quietly for a min-
ute the speakers face was flushed he
could see eight hundred dollars on the table
about to come to him as four is a two-way
point-that is can only be made in two
ways either with two deuces or three ace
while seven the number which loses when
the shooter has a point figures a much
higher percentage on the dice and under
ordinary circumstances a four is not made
one time out of five

  frank said in his usual quiet tone  i
was not here sir when you were announced
perhaps you heard my name called any-
way it is twoomey in the future instead
of calling me mr southern gentleman call
me twoomey now if you wish to bet ten
thousand to five that i do not make a four
 will call the bet i presume that you do
not carry that much cash with you neither
do i so we will write out checks

  the man on twoomeys right gave him a
nasty look be evidently had no intention of
making such  bet thinking that twoomey
would not have nerve enough to take the


all-story weekly

short end of the bet he turned to twoo-
mey and said  how do i know your check
is good

  twoomey replied  you dont know it
but i am taking more of a chance than you
i dont even know your name

  at which the fader flushed turned and
looked twoomey directly in the eye saying
 colis is my name my father controls
the m and b t railway now do you
think my check is good

  frank replied  sir i have never ques-
tioned your check if you will recall you
will see that it is you who have had doubts
as to whether a check was good or not i
always take a man to be a gentleman until
he proves himself otherwise

  as soon as the young man had said his
name was colis frank immediately re-
membered where he had heard the name
he had lost money in a gambling-house
during his college days and had squealed to
the police trying to make the house give it
back to him but without success he had
also got into trouble with a chorus girl in
one of the musical shows and men around
town had said colis had acted like a cad
the house where colis had lost his money
was one that frank was not interested in
but through those various channels in which
different club owners kept each other
posted he had heard the incident

  from his answers and his general atti-
tude several men around the table were
drawn to frank during the argument one
or two of these men thought he did not un-
derstand anything about dice from the
careless manner in which he was throwing
them they tried to keep him from taking
the bet explaining that in gambling-houses
the odds on a four were two to one and
that broadways most famous gambler the
sport always said where a man won one
such bet he again lost five and that if the
percentage did not figure more than two
to one the house would not be giving such
odds

  frank thanked them then said  gen-
tlemen i wish to call the bet not so much
for the money involved but frankly i do
not like mr coliss manner

  he reached for the dice rattled them
hard in his hand and threw them across the

table hardly had the dice left his hand
before colis called out  my dice which
made the shot no roll there is a gentle-
mans agreement that when one of the play-
ers calls no dice or my dice then the dice
do not count on that shot

    four-tray called the voice from the
other end of the table  colis you certain-
ly made one grand little call then you
called yourself out of about sixteen thou-
sand dollars by that little piece of nasti-
ness

   for be it known that one rarely calls the
dice when a shooter has a point unless he
thinks the shooter is using a crooked shot
and as twoomey was throwing the dice
without apparent interest this could hard-
ly have been the case as it was colis
would have wpn the bet had he not called
 my dice

   colis answered  well i am fading this
snake and i guess i can call them if i want
to eh

   frank merely smiled not saying a word
when the dice were handed to him he said
 well maybe i will make the four after
that bad call i believe luck is my way
and threw the dice out again

    my dice again came from colis

   the dice stopped on five-ace

    six called the man at the far end of
the table  say colis let the man shoot
dont you think we want to shoot at this
end of the table if you dot want the
bet get off i am sure twoomey will allow
you to withdraw the bet wont you twoo-
mey

    well i guess yes said frank

   every one laughed for they all thought
that twoomey had no chance whatever of
winning the bet just at that minute the
earl of donneghaly was announced the
earl entered the room bowing to his ac-
quaintances and walked straight up to
frank twoomey with outstretched hand

    well frank my boy it is a pleasure to
see you he said  i have been meaning
to look you up every day for the past two
weeks but have been so busy with wash-
ington that i have not had a chance

  twoomeys face was a study in con-
fusion he opened his mouth as if to say
something but no words issued therefrom
his lordship rolls the bones



he turned white then red and finally
reached out both hands and clasped lord
terrences hand and reverting to his soft
southern accent said  well suh i suah
am glad to see yeh

  then his face became more composed

   i was shooting dice sir he added
 and was being faded by a mr colis who
bet me ten thousand to five thousand that
i could not make four after catching it for
a point and mr colis seems to think i
was trying to do something to the dice as
he calls  my dice  on every roll will
you lord terrence as a personal favor
shoot the dice and make that four

   certainly my dear friend i will be de-
lighted to all parties willing though i am
not sure whether i can make any point as i
usually lose at your blasted indoor sports
roy masters who never never overlooks
a point in relating this afterward said he
noticed at the time that twoomey did not
ask lord terrence to shoot the dice but
asked him to make the jour and that made
him look twice at the earl roy turned to
colis whom he never liked to say  i
know little about shooting but if you care
to give any more of that two to one i will
take the same bet as twoomey has

  but the dice had already left the earls
hands slowly they rolled toward the center
of the table sticking almost together

   tray-ace - four called every one
around the table

  twoomeys voice quiet as usual with
no trace of exultation in it came float-
ing over  lord terrence if any one but
you had rolled that shot i might believe
they were what is known among gamblers
as  even-rolled the dice  mean how-
ever you made the four and i win the ten
thousand also the eight hundred originally
bet let us now enter the dining-room

   i am sorry old chap that it finally
got you you are the one i would have
staked my life on as being straight but
that was rich was it not the earl said

  frank laughed  you would have won
your stake at that sir he said  i would
like very much to see you to-morrow

 at my hotel at eleven replied the earl
the next morning at eleven sharp a neat-
looking young man entered suite  at the

ford the earl of donneghaly waved his
secretary aside gathered the young man to
his bosom and said  oh lad why didnt
you quit when i did and stay straight

   why terrence mcgowan said twoo-
mey  you dont think i am crooked do
you i never beat a man out of money
crookedly in my life the nearest ap-
proach to it was last night when i put up
a check for five thousand dollars when i
did not have that many pennies in the bank
i meant for you to make that four honestly
if possible when you shot i knew that
you misunderstood me and thought that i
wanted you to make that four even-roll or
any other shot but that colis was a nasty
loser at that

   i have here a receipt from the red
cross for ten thousand seven hundred dol-
lars every nickel that i won last night
leaving me only a little over a paltry hun-
dred dollars to my name and now for
heavens sake satisfy my curiosity regard-
ing this earl of donneghaly stuff as i am
dying to understand it

   ah frank there is not much to ex-
plain i came from the nobility and on the
death of an older brother who was child-
less inherited the title five years after leav-
ing you ah but lad lad you must pardon
me you havent changed a bit giving
away your all because it is tainted ah
frankie me lad flush or broke its all the
same with you sport you are

  well the rest you all know how twoo-
mey emerged from a training camp with the
title of lieutenant in aviation of the
chances he took  over there  how he be-
came an ace and how at the close of the
big war he married a first cousin and ward
of the earl of donneghaly and came back
to his own united states to live

  one night he and his wife met masters
and greetings were exchanged before leav-
ing roy said  i say sport some evening
i want you to show me how to  four come
to washington square and give me a les-
son but frank only laughed

  his wife said  frank why do so many
people you used to know call you sport
were you ever sportily inclined

   im afraid so my dear frank said

anthor ol rajah of hell island  malay gold  nnala omalley etc

chapter x

the bronze buddha

 elpy was all alone and he was rid-
ing hell-to-leather the malay
guards ran out as if to stop him
but kelpy saw me on the terrace and he
turned the horse and headed for me i
knew something must have happened for
he had lost his hat and there was blood
on his face and his pony was white with
slathered foam

  as he clattered out on the terrace kelpy
swung about in the saddle as if he could
hardly keep his seat then he reined in
suddenly and the horse slipped and they
came down in a heap almost beside me

   whats happened

  i ran out to help him but kelpy stag-
gered up looking like death

   miss graves  he gasped  get her
away-quick 

   shes gone i said  she discovered
tilings-buck took her to the schooner no
one suspects anything i stayed here to
warn the rest of you-

  kelpy gave an awful laugh

  too late me lad he said staggering
 a rare plucked un you are-but they
jumped us in the bush marshalls dead
they got fong and graves - i broke
through to get warning to miss-graves-
at that kelpy just coughed and sank
down dead he had a bullet clear through
his body from side to side and i guess it
was only sheer will-power that had kept him

in the saddle until he could get here with
warning he was some man kelpy was

  the malay soldiers came crowding
around they poked me back with their
guns and two of them lifted kelpy and
carried him off out of sight while the rest
got the horse up and led it toward the
stables they left me alone there on the
terrace and it was plain enough that i was
to stay there so i stayed

  i could see now that the old devil of a
sultan had laid his plans pretty well and
that he had caught us all from what
kelpy had said i judged that fong and
graves were prisoners and still alive
where i was coming out did not worry me
particularly because i was supposed to
know where the treasure was i was safe
enough for the present and i hoped that
buck had got leora down to the schooner

  by this time it was late in the afternoon
the sun was setting and the palace was
all flooded with red light just as it was
when we first saw it more of the malay
soldiers came over to the gates and then
the sultan himself came out and started
toward me behind him stalked lim perak
the body-guard and two soldiers came
ahead of him and stood near me with
grounded rifles

  sultan lumpur had shucked his frock
coat and all the rest of it he was got
up in the most gorgeous malay outfit you
ever saw with jewels glittering on him and
a big kris in his belt and two pistols show-
ing he looked like a monkey dressed up

this story began in the all-story weekly for june 


four quarts of rubies



for vaudeville purposes and as he came
toward me i was in two minds whether
to pull out my gun and shoot him or not
i was pretty well worked up over what had
happened you pee

  luckily for all of us however i remem-
ber something buck had said to me one day
when we were talking about cards  dont
forget one thing dave he had said
 there are just four aces in the pack but
all four of em wont do a man any good
if he doesnt know how to play em one
little ace circumflexed in the hand of a wise
guy will paraflute the other three in the
hand of a fool

  the gun that laid under my gold-spangled
vest was an ace-not a very big ace but
the only one i had if i played it now i
might kill the sultan but it would get us
nowhere but if  sat back with my one
ace i might get a chance to take a pot
with it so i laid low and said nothing

  sultan lumpur had no doubt seen kel-
pys finish from the palace for he came
up and looked at me-a sharp bird-bright
look that pierced into me-and then he
looked at the flare of blood on the stones

   sit down mr perkins he said  ton
my word a charming afternoon what
haw haw-miss graves not back yet eh
no matter there is to be a gorgeous full
moon to-night we must have a water fete
what by all means

  he was perfectly  grave yet there was
an icy undertone in his voice that fright-
ened me he took a chair and so did i
he looked me over very carefully and
nodded then sent the two soldiers away
he probably figured that i was unarmed
and helpless and that lim perak was all the
guard necessary i did not say anything at
first and he chuckled as he watched me
thinking i was frightened so i was but i
was more mad than frightened

  now a whole flock of servants came from
the palace one of them brought an ele-
gant red silk coat lined with tiger-fur and
the sultan climbed into it and then reclined
in his chair again it was warm enough
but i guess his blood was old and thin
the other malays got out a table and
spread it and fetched silver and glass and
dishes and set up a royal spread

   	a-s

   well i said when the silence got un-
bearable  what do you aim to do any-
way youve killed kelpy and marshall
and youre figuring on marrying a decent
white girl-but thats where you slip up
sultan

  he looked at me and cackled

   you are a very foolish young man mr
perkins he said  but i presume you-
haw-know to what you owe your safety
 sure i answered  because you want
the treasure of the buddha and i know
where it is and no one else does
exactly young man exactly his
wizen monkey-face grinned all over  and
you shall find it for me then you shall
go free but-whats this eh

  this was a horse coming at a good speed
it was the horse candelario had ridden but
a malay came on it he jumped off near
the lake and ran to the sultan when he
got to where we were on the first terrace
he got down on his knees and bobbed his
head on the ground

  he and the sultan had a talk in malay
and lumpur was the most furious man you
ever saw he turned to me dismissing the
malay

   what do you know of this senor
candelario tells me that miss graves and
mr buck took a boat at the malay village
and went down the river

  that relieved me a heap and i sat back
with a grin

   i thought old buck would turn the
trick i says  weve been wise to you for
quite a spell sultan only we did not think
you would act so quickly if you get miss
graves off the schooner youll have to go
some 

  his wrinkled brown face spat at me he
was like a snake some ways

   they will never reach the schooner
young man he said  they will find fish-
ing proas stationed in the lagoon all around
the schooner to guard against just such a
contingency and the good kind senor
candelario has departed to bring miss
graves back to me 

  that made me feel cold clear through
i could just picture buck heading down-
river smack into the hands of those pirates
and candelario coming along a bit later


all-story weekly

however buck was a pretty hard guy to
get into a corner so i trusted to luck that
he would slip through somehow

  all of a sudden i saw the sultan sit up
and rub his hands and grin all over i
looked up-and saw fong tsai and graves
coming the professor had a bandage
around his head but fong although he
must have put up a fight was unhurt the
wound traddle had given him had not dis-
abled him to mention both men had their
hands bound behind them and they were
escorted by four malay soldiers

   good evening gentlemen said the sul-
tan cackling as they were halted before
us  we are charmed that you arrive in
time to witness our entertainment-

  professor graves lit out on the sultan
for fair not cussing but giving him a talk
that had a steel edge lumpur just grinned
and seemed to enjoy it

   xo use professor said fong tsai
calmly  this brown devil has got us i
believe however that miss graves is quite
safe

  the sultan cackled again and turned to
me

  tell them mr perkins he said
 my word old top-tell them perfectly
ripping what

  i told them about buck and leora going
and what the sultan had said about trap-
ping them at the schooner fongs face
changed slightly and  judged that this
was mighty good news in spite of the trap
which the sultan had laid

   hut mr perkins broke in the sultan
smoothly  why did you not go with
them

    stayed to tip off our friends  said

   xoble young man sneered lumpur
 as reward you shall now assist at our
entertainment our fete deau

  graves started in to talk about the rights
of americans but at a sign from the sultan
the guards shut him up then he and fong
were taken off to one side but as they
went i saw fong watching me so i gave
him a wink perhaps he understood about
that ace under my arm for he smiled his
inscrutable smile and kept quiet

  well what followed was the most gor-
geous affair ive ever witnessed partly

maybe because there were no restrictions
here-the lid was off and everything went
i judge the sultan had toned things down
considerable while leora was on hand not
wanting to shock her

  the sun was down and up in the sky
a nearly full moon was hanging over the
tree-tops and just turning from silver to
yellow reflecting itself in the water the
sultan began to gorge himself sending food
to me and fong tsai and graves likewise
and down on the lower terrace appeared
all the ladies he could mutter up i reckon
with the orchestra to boot and believe
me those damsels were a scream they
were dressed-well i had better skip that
part they had lots of flowers anyway and
for as much as half an hour they did fancy
dances all over the place and enjoyed them-
selves immensely

  meantime the sultan drank pretty stead-
ily sitting there like a little brown monkey
in his fur robe and watching everything
i took a little wine and nothing else except
an orange-a nice ripe juicy orange which
i kept juggling in my hands i had a no-
tion what to do with that orange if the
time ever came

  presently the sultan gave an order and
the servants cleared away everything then
put cigars and cigarettes on the table and
withdrew lumpur sent cigars to fong
tsai and graves and passed me one but
i had already smoked one of his cigars that
morning and i said id stick to my pipe

  then it came-without any warning

  the sultan clapped his hands and gave
an order the dancing ladies quit cavort-
ing all at once and crowded around the edge
of the lake out from the center of them
stood one who was all solid with flowers
ropes of them from head to foot the moon-
light was bright now flooding the whole
place with silvery radiance and i could see
the girls face-she was kapit ai perang

  i did not know what was coming of
course but i felt mighty queer the sultan
said something in malay and the orchestra
started up and all the girls gave a laughing
yell and closed around kapit ai perang so
that she was hidden from sight then
they broke apart and we heard a single
shrill piercing scream-and there was noth-
four quarts of rubies



ing left of bucks pretty friend except a
lot of flowers floating on the water

   it is a pity that mr buck missed the
entertainment what said the sultan

  it made me sick-yes it did i cannot
think of that poor girl yet thrown out
among the crocodiles and the flowers float-
ing on the rippling water without feeling
sick i came pretty near pulling my gun
and letting that devilish lumpur have a
bullet but i held back i was not sure i
could hit him anyhow because i was ten
feet away and had never shot a revolver
before

   now mr graves and the sultan
cackled at me  we shall have a bit of en-
tertainment for you watch very closely
for i do not think you have ever seen any-
thing like it in america

   dont worry about me i said  ive
seen a heap already sultan and if i was
you id just let things run along without
bothering much

   there is nothing like politeness to a
guest my dear young man he purred
 and we must finish with this matter be-
fore senor candelario returns what is
more to the point you will get an excellent
idea of the exact fate which awaits you in
case you do not prove obliging in the affair
of the jewels-he he

  he seemed considerably tickled over what
was going to happen for some reason i
tried to stave him off

   by the way i said  what became of
our friend traddle sultan did you
bump him off or did you really send him
to the schooner

  lumpur looked at me and wrinkled up
his face

   mr traddle he said  seemed as
though he might ultimately prove useful
i sent him down to my own barge i pre-
sume that senor candelario enlisted his ser-
vices in bringing back miss graves the
two gentlemen were very friendly what
well well we must return to our muttons
there was no use trying to make him
forget what was on his mind so i sat back
and played with my orange and waited

  the sultan gave an order and the ladies
and orchestra all faded away off to the
sides of the round lake lim perak was

standing beside the sultans chair and a
little behind he was gorgeously got up
in malay fashion and he looked like a
big burly boy out of a circus side-show
only he had a strip of naked brown stomach
just over his sash

  well when the stage was all cleared
with the moonlight flooding down on the
lake and the big buddha in the center and
the little thin slat of a walk that went nearly
out to the buddha the sultan turned to
the four soldiers guarding fong and graves
and said something in malay i saw fong
tsai start and give a glance at the lake
but of course i did not understand what
was going on at all

  the four soldiers moved forward i
thought at first that they were going to
pitch graves and fong into the water but
then i saw that they were not they
marched the two prisoners to the little walk
that went out to the buddha and two of
the soldiers went out first the other two
following

  the sultan leaned forward from his hud-
dled fur watching everything with a snak-
ish enjoyment lim perak he was watch-
ing me probably having his orders in that
respect the other soldiers and the dancing
ladies were lined up at the sides of the lake
but too far away from the sultan and me
and lim perak to take any particular in-
terest in us they were all watching fong
and graves and the four guards with a
breathless intent interest of course if i
had known what was going to happen i
would have acted but i did not know

  when the six men came to the end of the
narrow walk and were in front of the big
bronze buddha one of the guards reached
down and from some recess drew out a
wide plank he set this across the gap be-
tween the walk and the statue over this
fong and graves walked their bound hands
behind them then one of the guards
skipped after them mighty nimble i could
not make out what caused him to be so
spry until i saw that he and fong and
graves were standing on the base of the
statue-which was about six inches under
water

  the guard shoved them up against the
statue and swung something out of the


all-story weekly

water around them-it was a chain holding
them there then he gave a quick jump
and was back with his friends fong and
graves stood there with their feet in the
water and everything fell silent as death
watching them and waiting

  even then i did not quite understand
until one of the guards leaned down and
struck a gong suspended at the end of the
stone walk right over the water it re-
minded me of a dinner-bell-and then i
did understand just as i saw something
heave and ripple out on the moonlight
water

  fong tsai and graves were chained there
lor the crocodiles to come and get

chapter xi

giving royalty a bath

the sultan leaned over and grinned at
me

 the saurians he said  are a
little slow about coming at times how-
ever-

  right there i played my ace i saw that
it was no time to delay matters because
any minute now one of those crocodiles
might pop up around the buddha in fact
i had already delayed too long and i had
to make up for lost time

  so having to figure on lim perak most
of all just as the sultan spoke i let go of
that orange and i got a pretty good swing
to it it caught lim perak in the stretch
of brown skin just above his sash and it
doubled him up before he could reach a
gun then i slipped out that automatic
of mine and got over beside the sultan in
a hurry he had pulled a gun but he
dropped it real quick

   tell those soldiers to let fong tsai and
mr graves loose i said  and dont waste
any time speak up you brown monkey
because ill shoot you when the first croco-
dile shows

  it was too bad about lim perak i
thought he had better sense than he had
of course the orange had not hurt him to
speak of and he undoubled with a kris in
his hand and came at me regardless that
i had the sultan covered i did not want

to shoot the sultan because we would have
too much need of him and if lim ever got
at me with that kris it was good night for
me

  so i whipped about and pointed the gun
at lim and shot him

  he went down all in a heap and the kris
sped out of his hand and went slithering
over the stones down to the first terrace like
a silver snake in the moonlight the sul-
tan he twisted about at me with his pistol
but i grabbed his hand and tore the weapon
away from him then i yanked him out
of his chair and his fur robe with one hand
and kicked him good

  speak up  said being too excited
to feel badly about killing a man like the
hero always does in a book  and keep
your soldiers back or ill kick you into the
drink 

  he understood me all right because he let
out a yip to his men and followed it up
with some more chattering whether or
not they understood the fix he was in i
could not see but they stayed back the
four men out on the stone walk they turned
and jumped for the big bronze buddha
and one of them leaped over and loosed the
chain fong and graves lost no motion
whatever in getting to safety and they had
barely done so when there was a swirl and
heave of the water and a crocodile poked
his nose out and looked mighty disap-
pointed

  i was in a cold sweat all the while and
i could not help feeling bad over what had
happened to poor kapit ai perang now
that i knew what that big buddha was
for out in the lake it felt like i was grip-
ping a snake when i sunk my fingers in
the sultans scrawny neck i landed an-
other kick where he would feel it most and
told him to have his four guards untie fong
tsai and graves and then beat it while
he told them i frisked him and got a real
collection of fancy knives and three good
revolvers

   well i thinks  old buck was right
as usual this old boy was so sure of him-
self having lim perak and most of the
face cards in his own hand that i laid over
him with my one little ace-

   i say sultan lumpur was speaking
four quarts of rubies



to me ill take the skin from you an
inch at a time for this you beggar-
yes you will i says if you ever
get the chance go to it now you speak
malay and nothing else or ill bait you one
over the head you snake tell your boys
to saddle three horses and fetch them out
to the second terrace down there

  he sang out as directed there had been
quite a hubbub at first but now all the
malays had come to understand what was
going on and they were keeping still as
mice waiting to see if i did anything to
their little tin god

  i caught up that gorgeous fur robe on
my arm still holding the automatic in my
hand and got a better grip on the sultan
with my left hand then i urged him for-
ward down the steps to the second terrace
by the lake  was just in time to meet
fong tsai and professor graves as they
came in the narrow walk their four guards
had gone to join the otjjer malays off to one
side

   wheres kelpy sang out graves

   hes dead i said  fong you go
over to the crowd and get some weapons
fong tsai looked at me and then at the
sultan

   what do you intend to do with him
mr perkins

   you ieave him to me i said  hes
my property and i know what im going
to do you get those guns and dont ask
questions 

  a smile flickered over fongs stony face
then he turned and went but graves came
up to me and to my surprise he was as cool
as ice

   perkins he said  youre a human
wonder im proud to know you upon
my word i am  hope you are not going
to leave that brown devil here however
we owe him a good deal and he may come
in useful farther on

  i had thought of that but he would be
more bother than use i judged besides
i knew exactly what i wanted to do with
him of course neither graves nor fong
tsai knew about bucks flirtation with
kapit ai perang and why she had been
murdered and there was no time to explain
things now so i let it go

   no professor i said  i reckon ill
leave him here but dont you worry about
what we owe him-ill fix that

   well returned graves inspecting me
in the moonlight  whats the idea in keep-
ing that fur robe over your arm

   its about the finest thing of its kind
i ever saw i told him  and i figure that
it would make a dandy wrap for leora

   oh he said  for leora eh

   you bet i came back at him  and
besides i mean to wrap up the treasure in
it because i aim to get those jewels before
i go aboard the schooner

   you seem to have  taken command
here he said dryly

   all right and i grinned at him  if
you dont like it take command yourself
 your work suits me he said laughing
a little keep it up

  and all this mind you with those ma-
lays ringed around the place watching us
and the moonlight flooding down and those
flowers still floating on the water where poor
kapit ai perang had gone down

  then fong tsai came up with three
rifles and he outfitted graves and a minute
later a bunch of malays came with the three
horses fong took charge of them and
sent the brown men back then he and
graves mounted

   well said fong tsai looking down
at me  what next mr perkins

  i took the sultan by the scruff of the
neck and hauled him to the edge of the
water

   sultan i said  i ought to shoot you
but the job is past me-youre so crooked
the bullet would slide off you but you
sent a poor innocent girl down into that
pond and heaven knows how many more
before her besides which you had the
nerve to figure on miss graves as your
next intended youre not a human being
but a monkey and i dont give a damn
whether your folks pull you out or not
so here goes-

  with that i hauled him up and landed
a good vigorous kick against his pants
and sent him flying out into the lake i
did not wait to see him splash but turned
around and scrambled up into the third
saddle


all-story weekly

   beat it i yelled we got off on the
jump

  two or three guns banged out but as i
had figured most of the malays were too
much interested in saving the sultan from
the crocodiles to give us much attention at
first and we got in among the trees with-
out a scratch

  i had never had much experience as a
horseback rider and the english saddles
that the sultan used were not much better
than nothing at all but i got my feet into
the stirrups after a while and managed to
stick on that fur robe flapped around the
head of my horse and must have scared
the liver out of him for he gave a snort
and lit out down the road like a streak of
lightning

  not that i minded a bit how fast i got
away from those malays besides graves
and fong tsai thought that  was shooting
ahead of them so as to keep command of
the party and they had no objections to
that either fortunately the road was a
good civilized one and could not be mis-
taken even in the moonlight

  i must have got a much better horse than
the other two or else he was so scared by
the fur robe that it lent him wings because
he walked right away from them and first
thing i knew i was streaking toward that
wharf where the sultans barge had been
tied up i knew that candelario had taken
traddle and had gone after buck and miss
graves so i reckoned our best plan would
be to swipe the sultans barge

  but as that horse of mine snorted down
near the wharf i could see in the moonlight
that the barge was not there at all mani-
festly candelario had taken it or maybe
buck had done so there was no time to
figure things out because any minute now
the malays from the palace would be along
after us so i yanked the horses head
around and turned him into the path that
went to the malay village a few rods far-
ther down the bank he was slowing down
by this time so when we reached the vil-
lage i stopped him and slid off

  everything was dark and quiet among
the thatched houses and i did not bother
waking any one up but hoofed it for the
shore of the river going as quietly as i

could some dogs barked but there was no
other disturbance if any one saw me in
my malay dress they would perhaps take
me for one of the sultans men

  so without any alarm i got to where
the boats were there was no beach here
and the boats were tied up to the man-
grove trees that grew along the bank there
were big boats and little i saved one of the
small ones with paddles in it and untied
the others sending each one out into the
stream with a push the current was fair-
ly swift here and took them out right
away

  then i heard a deep sullen booming from
far away-it was some kind of a big gong
or drum up at the palace and i judged it
was an alarm so it was too for all the
dogs began to bark and the malays in the
houses began to wake up at that minute
however fong tsai and professor graves
came along and i hailed them

   here i am under the trees-get a move
on i said

  somebody yelled in one of the houses
and then began to hit a gong but fong
and the professor had found me and they
tumbled into the boat and i sent her out
with a shove

   maybe they have boats drawn up
among the trees i said pointing to the
ones that i had shoved out drifting down
ahead of us  but ive attended to most
of them

   youre an excellent general said fong
tsai as he grabbed a paddle  all that
worries me is not killing the sultan

  graves gave a grunt  you neednt be
worried then he said  i expect the sul-
tans heir will be going over the accounts
in the morning because a crocodile bobbed
up close to lumpur while he was splash-
ing around does your conscience worry
you perkins

  i did not answer for a burst of shots
came from the village behind us and the
maddest yells you ever heard the malays
had discovered that we were gone with their
boats we did not bother firing back at
them and their bullets came nowhere near
us so there was no harm done

  taken all in all i felt rather disappointed
over the way we had escaped particularly
four quarts of rubies



after kelpy and his friends had been killed
it looked to me as if we had done mighty
little damage not that i am bloodthirsty
or anything like that but ive noticed in
books that slathers of natives always get
slaughtered it seems to be expected all
i had done was shoot lim perak and may-
be put the sultan in the way of a hungry
crocodile as we went down the river how-
ever graves said that marshall and kelpy
had accounted for quite a few natives before
going under and there had been consider-
able shooting at the time

  however here the three of us were un-
hurt and with a ten-mile paddle ahead of
us in the moonlight so we settled down
to work and kept our boat spinning along
there was no sign of pursuit at all

  as we paddled along i told fong and
graves about what had happened that day
there was a lot of it more than i had
realized before things had certainly
hummed from the minute buck tipped his
hat to poor kapit ai perang all of a sud-
den i remembered what the sultan had
said about his fishing-boats catching buck
and i blurted it out

   do you suppose they could have got
buck after all i said  most likely he
took a boat down and candelario and
traddle they went along in the sultans
barge but whats become of them all

   you seem more worried over them than
over how we are going to reach the
schooner said the professor in a dry voice

   oh i said  i know what well do
that doesnt trouble me a mite but what
about leora see here fong tsai do you
suppose the malays have captured your
schooner

  that was one of the few times i ever
saw tsai really grin it was a wolfish
sort of grin too

   no said he  i only wish the dogs
would try but they know better are
you sure that buck could not reach the
schooner

   the sultan was mighty confident about
it i returned  he said that fishing-boats
were anchored all around her ready to gob-
ble any one who came along that he had
prepared against just such a contingency
lcrdy i hope buck did not run into them

  fong took out his little pipe filled and
lighted it

   spare your anxiety mr perkins he
said  when buck is caught in a trap
of that sort it will be very strange indeed
youre sure he said nothing about any other
place-

  i remembered then and gave an exclam-
ation

   why of course i said disgusted with
myself for forgetting it  hes probably
gone where were going-to hell island
i told him that if anything came up he
would find that secret chamber in the bud-
dha a dandy place to wait i bet a dollar
hes there 

  graves drew a sigh of relief and fong
tsai nodded slowly

   exactly said fong  i think we may
conclude that buck and miss graves are
either there or safely aboard the schooner
but mr perkins i do not think we shall
go to the island-

   now fong i said turning around to
face him for i was in the bow of the boat
 you said yourself that i was running this
party didnt you well ive made a good
job of it so far and i mean to keep it up
im simply going to get those jewels thats
all

  professor graves laughed  youd bet-
ter humor him captain fong said he
 certainly he has earned the right to lose
his illusions about that moving stone if he
wants to-and by george he has captained
this affair like an admiral

   conceded said fong looking at me in
his steady fashion  youre on a false
scent about that hidden treasure mr per-
kins-but go ahead how do you propose
to reach the island without running foul
of candelario

   the same way that buck reached it if
he went there i explained  where it
enters the lagoon this river has a lot of
channels and islands and is mighty wide
isnt it well instead of going straight
ahead well cut off by one of those side
channels and come out on the north side of
the lagoon not so far from the island

   you can land me there i went on
 then you can exercise your own judgment
about getting aboard the schooner once


all-story weekly

you get aboard you can bring the schooner
over to the island or come in her boats
you may have to chase off those malays
-but i judge you can do it

   all right said fong talcing up his
paddle

  we slipped down a few miles farther and
then paddled out of the main channel and
began to find our way along the network of
channels to the north

chapter xii

the stone that moved

gettixg down to the lagoon was a
longer job than i had reckoned on
but we got there at last and it was
pitch dark by that time except for the
stars the moon was still in the sky but
it was so far down that its light did not
reach anything except out in the middle of
the lagoon we could not see the schooner
but out in the moonlight about a half-mile
from us was the sultans barge it looked
to be anchored and entirely deserted the
chances were that the malays aboard her
were asleep the stars did not light up the
lagoon very much and we could see no fish-
ing-boats

  the water was beautiful being all full
of phosphorescence fong was afraid that
the malays would see the light we made
stirring up the water with our paddles so
he paddled us by himself and it was slow
work he had the bearings of the island
however and presently it showed up ahead
of us- a great black mass looming high
against the stars

   think you can find the statue in this
obscurity whispered professor graves

  sure i whispered back if i get
started from that big stone wharf it will
be a cinch to follow the tunnels that were
cut under the jungle i know just what
turns to make too

   i think the wharf is ahead breathed
fong tsai  and there seems to be a
boat lying there-no two boats-

  we slid along silent and slow pretty
soon i could make out that we had come
to the stone wharf all right then just
as fong had said two boats appeared ahead

of us tied up at the stone stairway which
cut up to the top of the wharf the bow
of our boat drifted in beside them and i
gripped the stone and jumped out

  as i did so i stubbed my foot on some-
thing and hurt a corn

  darn it i exclaimed louder than i
had meant to

  then i jumped scared stiff from the
top of the wharf right over my head came
a soft voice

   hello there that you dave i was
just about to peragulate you with a bul-
let-

   buck i exclaimed

   correct said the voice  whos there
besides you

   all thats left of us-fong and the pro-
fessor come on down wheres miss
graves

  buck came slithering down beside me
and i heard him chuckling as he shook
hands with graves and the big chinaman
they were pumping questions at him too

   weve had no trouble said buck
 that is none to speak of tock gump
got it into his head somehow that miss
graves wanted to catch a fish or two so
we got off in a boat before his suspicions
became moraverated unhappily for him-
self he tried to coerce me with a gun and
i had to persimerfy him

   then we dropped down the river to the
mouth of the lagoon but i saw the malay
boats contravering around and suspected
something so we laid up at an island and
waited along toward dark the sultans
barge came down-stream and laid alongside
the boats chatting with them quite a while
i was pretty certain that we would not get
to the schooner so after dark we cut across
to the island here

   and leora asked the professor
 where is she

   in the treasure-chamber under the
statue said buck  i left her there while
i stayed here on guard shes asleep by
this time and snoring

  fong tsai explained what a fool i was
in regard to wanting to look for the trea-
sure buck he chipped in and tried to put
a wet blanket on me by saying that he
had already gone over the room in the
four quarts of rubies



statue and the floor was as solid as my
head

   all right i said  but im going to
look over the place myself just the same
i know more about this treasure business
than all the rest of you gumps put together
and youll look pretty silly when i come
along with my pockets full of rubies and
diamonds

   oh hell  said graves laughing  let
him alone you two just because youre
too sophisticated to have dreams-

   youre right professor broke in buck
 go ahead dave with my blessing but
what about miss graves eh

   she is safer where she is said fong
tsai he briefly explained the situation
to buck we may get aboard the ship
all right but well have trouble picking
these two up the best plan would be to
take perkins and miss graves aboard with
us and hoist anchor

  not me without the jewels i said
 and i can look after leora all right

   go it then said fong irritably
 well come and pick you up later on since
you insist in that case miss graves is
safer where she is than with us as we may
have to clear the malays out of the lagoon
come aboard buck have you a light
perkins

  that was the first time he had omitted
the  mr when he addressed me which
showed that he was angry but a lot i
cared buck had an electric torch which
he handed to me and shook hands as he
did so i grabbed the fur robe and my
automatic and started off with a low good-
by to the crowd

  after that it was just night all around
but i was thankful that i had had my way
at last i had begun to think i never would
get to take a look at those jewels

  the darkness was intense and terrible
i wanted to flash that electric torch but
of course dared not so i stumbled across
the stones and vines and after a while i
came to the tunnel which had been cut into
the jungle even then i missed my way a
couple of times but finally got started all
right

  that was a long and interminable jour-
ney in cutting out the jungle we had

often just cut a wide enough place for a
body to pass through so that often it
seemed as if i was up against a blank
wall once or twice i had to use the torch
regardless but after a mighty nervous time
of it i got along toward the statue for which
i was looking

  it was hard for me to realize that only
about thirty hours ago we had left this
place to go aboard the sultans barge it
seemed as if a million things had happened
in the mean time it was not quite mid-
night yet only yesterday we had all gone
up to the palace feeling blue about not
finding the treasure and now i was back
again with every one calling me a blamed
fool for doing any more treasure-hunting
coming down the river i had been more or
less sleep but now i was wide awake and
looking forward to the jewels

  i got to the statue at last bumping
square on it in the dark and locating it with
my elbow i cussed a little then took out
the torch and flashed it around i was at
the corner of the base and with a few
steps got around to the back the square
hole looming black above me

  putting the fur robe around my neck i
started up it was no slouch of a climb
but the stones were well worn and the carv-
ing helped so that finally i got up to the
hole just as i got my chin over the edge
and was reaching inside for hand-hold
something round and cold was poked into
my face

   sur-surrender  said a voice that was
quavery but meant what it said

   ive done it i said recognizing right
off who it was  dont shoot because that
gun is aimed right at my jaw-teeth and
theres no dentist around this neck of the
woods-

   oh  exclaimed leora  oh its you 

   its what is left of me i said wrig-
gling into the hole  buck said you were
asleep so i was not looking for ambuscades
now look out because im coming in

  i got inside and stood up unwrapping
the fur robe then i pulled the electric
torch and lighted up the place

  leora was standing there an automatic
in her hand and she dropped it in a hurry
i did not keep the light on because my


all-story weekly

general impression was that she had been
asleep and maybe would not like to be in-
spected with her hair down however i
pointed the light at the fur robe and shoved
it at her

   heres a present i fetched along i
said  its a beauty too

  we shook hands just like two pals and
leora got into the fur robe and said it was
fit for a queen so i said that was why i
had given it to her and she did not ask
any questions about where it had come
from

  then we sat down on the stone floor and
talked while i smoked a pipe i told her
all that had happened leaving out a few
things which i judged might disturb her
dreams and she told me about the trip here
with buck and what a fine chap he was

   have you done any looking for the
treasure i said trying to keep cool and
calm  buck mentioned it-

  she reached out in the dark and patted
my hand then drew her fingers away again
i could see that she felt mighty sorry
for me

   yes dave she said  we looked at
every stone in the floor and every single
one is as solid as a rock and set in cement
im afraid that you have dealt too strongly
on what must have been a mere idle pencil-
ing its too bad but its true

  i knocked out my pipe on the stones
and began to feel discouraged about that
treasure her tone was convincing and i
knew she was a level-headed sort of girl
she had done enough poking around ruins
with her uncle too so that she would know
a loose stone if she saw it i could see she
had taken some stock in my theory too

   what about the walls i asked

   all solid

   and the roof

   the roof she gave a gurgly laugh
 why dave who would look at the roof
if any loose stones were there they would
naturally fall wouldnt they

   i dont know about that it was a
new idea to me but it was all i had left
 you take some of these old ruined tem-
ples and theyre built pretty queer leora
whats up above us why the statue of
course now-

   but a loose stone would certainly fall 
she cut in

   it might and it might not i said
judicially  these old heathen folks were
mighty wise hiding their jewels just where
a body would not look i remember one
book that told about down in peru where
the hero found a buried treasure under tons
and tons of masonry that moved at a touch
because when a lever was moved a river
came along and-

  she tried not to laugh but i caught the
sound of it in her voice

  oh dave she said youre the
funniest boy i ever knew

   all right i said getting up  when
it comes to that im a year older than you
because your uncle said one day that you
were just twenty i get to vote when i
reach home which is more than you do
unless you live in california and as for
being funny youll think that maybe i
know something about buried treasure when
i get the stone out of the roof

  with that i slid the button on my electric
torch it flashed for a second then died
out-used up

   well i said disgusted with the luck
 if i ever write a book ill bet  can lay
over some of those folks that do it for a
living i never saw a book yet where the
heros flash-lamp ever needed a new bat-
tery-

   heres one dave-i had a tiny lamp
of my own and leora put one in my
hands  and dave i didnt intend to be
a horrid mean cat when i said you were
funny-

   good for you i broke in flashing on
the lamp  youre a jewel thats what you
are now well take a look at this ceil-
ing

  as i said before the roof of the chamber
was only a scant six feet from the floor so
that i had to stoop in moving around the
little flash-lamp lighted it up fine and the
first thing we saw was that the roof was
made of big square stones like the floor

   theyre set in concrete too arent
they asked leora

  no i exclaimed feeling a thrill run
over me  theyve got seams in between
here lets find the center one
four quarts of rubies



   mr buck and i found the center of the
floor said leora  its right here- and
she pointed to a stone  the one in the
roof will be above it

  i went over and stood on the one she
indicated and she came beside me i could
see that she was getting excited by this
time too right over us was one of the
square stones

   now i said putting out the flash-
lamp  reach up and touch that stone for
luck leora well take for granted that
the roof-stones correspond to those in the
floor-

  i put up both hands in the darkness got
them against the stone and heaved up for
an instant nothing happened then leoras
arm came up past my face and she pushed
on the stone-just a touch too and talk
about luck that big flagstone began to
move and it did not fall as leora had said
it would instead it slid upward until my
hands were touching empty air

  a startled frightened gasp came from
leora-and then i felt her hands grip my
arm-they gripped so hard that they hurt

  be quiet she whispered i heard
some one outside

  i had been all ready to let out a yell of
triumph but i choked it down in ahurry
for as much as half a minute we stood right
still listening i could hear nothing at
all except some queer bird-cries from the
jungle and i started to tell leora that she
had been deceived when she checked me
 hush something is out there-

  we waited again and i got out my auto-
matic in case anything happened thinks
i it may be a tiger or some of those beasts
or maybe a big snake then without any
warning at all a voice broke out close at
hand and it was traddles voice

   damn you candelario you didnt
see any light at all-it was a firefly they
have not been here yet

   all right came the silky voice of the
half-caste  but where did that fool buck
go to with the girl we know he did not
come near the schooner

   probly he smelled danger and waited
up the river said traddle with a curse
 when the others came down they may
have encountered them but we know that

perkins had the secret of this jewel cache
and the chances are ten to one that well
nab the whole crowd here

   at this time of night candelario
sneered  they are doubtless asleep some-
where near the mouth of the river 

   then theyll be here by daylight said
traddle  and remember your bargain-
you take the jewels and i get the girl 

  all this showed up the situation mighty
clear and it did not seem a bit pleasant

  fat traddle and candelario were in part-
nership and evidently they had been in-
formed of everything that had happened
they were slick enough to guess that i
would come here to find the jewels so they
had come to catch me while they had left
the channel guarded as before by the fish-
ing boats they figured that i would bring
the whole crowd here at dawn but since
the two of them seemed to be here all
alone i did not mind particularly

  wait till they come in i whispered
to leora  when traddle pokes his fat
head in that hole ill have a surprise for
him-

  she touched my arm again and then it
was i who got the surprise

   better send in one of the malays
growled traddle  to let down a rope for
us

  candelario laughed  nonsense my
friend see i shall easily mount to that
opening and  shall drop the rope for you
let the malays stay here-

  i did not wait for any more but turned
to leora shoving the automatic into its
holster

  here i breathed theyve got
natives there-we could keep em out may-
be but we can do better than that you
put your foot in my hands and get up
through that opening can you make it
then well drop the stone again and
they-

  she caught on in an instant

  good i heard her laugh softly
 well try it but i cant see anything up
there dave  what if that stone should-
 dont say it i broke in with a little
shudder  well take chances on that
hurry on-i can hear candelario scram-
bling up


all-story weekly

  i locked my hands and she rested her
foot in them and i lifted her up my
scheme had been to get into the secret
chamber above and drop the stone before
any one came but right away i saw that it
was no use just as leoras weight light-
ened telling me she had got a grip above
and was drawing herself up i heard a
puffing and blowing at the entrance and a
gleam of light flooded into the chamber
candelario was coming through the hole
and he had an electric torch in his hand

  they had caught us good and proper

chapter xiii

traddle takes the pot

a swift glance showed me that leora
was just disappearing through a
black opening overhead there was
no sign of the flagstone which had ap-
parently gone straight upward

  i was not thinking of the jewels at all
now because i was occupied with more im-
portant and pressing business until leora
got through the hole in the roof i was hold-
ing her and had no chance to move al-
though i could hear candelario scrambling
into the chamber by the time i was free
to act candelario imd turned his light on
me and was pulling a-jgan of course there
was no longer any hope of fooling him and
raddle as to our whereabouts

  candelario did not try to rise but lay
there on the floor half through the opening
pointing his electric torch at me he grinned
as he jerked his revolver forward and 
noted that his gold earrings were jiggling
beside his brown cheeks all this while-
it was not more than ten seconds i judge-
i was trying to get the automatic out of
my armpit holster but it had caught some-
where and would not budge

  i saw in a flash that i was not going to
get my automatic free in time so i turned
half around pointed it holster and all in
candelarios general direction and pulled
the trigger shooting from under my arm-
pit he fired almost at the same time and
something seemed to yank me around i
did not realize however that his bullet had
hit me

  the torch fell from candelarios hand
the button had been shoved in so that it
continued to burn then from his other
hand dropped the pistol he stared up at
me his sleepy cats eyes looking a whole
lot surprised over something-then he slow-
ly slid backward through the opening with
his hands dragging limply on the stones
i had hit him all right an instant later
his face vanished in the darkness

  i leaned forward picked up his electric
torch and tossed it up through the hole in
the roof so that it would light things up for
leora

  dave came her voice are you
hurt

   havent had time to look i sang out
 im coming up

  i jumped and tried to catch the sides of
the stone opening but missed it for some
reason i felt weak leora saw that i could
not make it so she let down the fur robe
by one corner and called to me to grab
hold then she pulled and i climbed and
in another minute i was through the open-
ing and standing beside her-in another
chamber

  this was no room like the one down be-
low-or rather it was the hollow insides
of the immense statue of buddha for there
was no roof at all that i could see the
flagstone which had been pushed up hung
about seven feet above what was now our
floor it was supported by an iron bar from
above and this was connected with a sys-
tem of weights

  quick i said well have to get
this stone down-and theyll be a long time
finding out where we are i guess can-
delario will not tell them and if we pile
something over the stone-

  i reached up and yanked it down
leora helping me the stone stopped two
feet above the floor and would go no far-
ther but there were some loose blocks of
stone around and i picked up one and
hammered at the iron bar it must have
been pretty ancient-leora said it was pure
iron like the pillars somewhere in india
which resist rust-but at all events i gave
it the finishing touch and it broke the
flagstone mighty near caught my toes as it
came down and i jumped away
four quarts of rubies



  somehow that jump hurt me i dropped
the stone and stood feeling at my side
leora picked up the electric torch that i
had thrown up and directed the light on me

   oh she cried out  youre wounded
-theres blood on your sash-

   ive discovered so i said trying to
crack a smile  i guess candelario man-
aged to do something with that bullet of
his lordy theres a sore streak-
leora was beside me in two steps a little
knife in her hand

  stand still she said firmly ripping
open my silk garments  hold this light
for me and keep it steady my gracious-
theres blood all over you now keep still
a moment and ill have you fixed up im
the best first-aid nurse you ever saw

  a minute before leora had been scared
and trembly but now she took charge of
me as if i was a kid she knew how to
do it too the way she cut up my silk
upper garments and bandaged me was
mighty efficient candelarios bullet had
cut across the ribs on my left side and
plowed a deep gash but there was nothing
broken and no harm was done except a loss
of blood of course leora fussed around
considerable but i gathered that there was
nothing to be scared of

  so finding that i was not going to die
i began to take interest in what was going
on and where we were the place was a
room about twenty feet square and it ran
from the base of the statue clear up into
the head as i could make out by the electric
torchlight it had no windows or openings
of any kind that  could see but up one
side ran a series of jutting stones like steps
that ended in a little round balcony about
where the buddhas face must be around
us everything was still and solemn like a
church because the stone shut out all
noises we could not hear anything from
below either now that the flagstone was
broken from the iron rod and the weights
i was not afraid that traddle and his
malay friends would discover and lift it in a
hurry

   well i said getting out my pipe and
filling up  up above there is a balcony
and that was where the priests used to stand
and talk while the ignorant heathen down

below would think buddha was talking-
thats an old stunt according to the books
there are openings up there so well get
lots of fresh air

   and you were right after all about
that diagram said leora

   you bet  said striking a match
 fong thinks he is pretty smart but i
guess he will look sick when he hears about
it and buck too-old buck who never
thought to look at the roof well lets
have a look at the treasure

  we had forgotten all about it being late
at night-after midnight i judged and we
never thought about being sleepy

  there was considerable rubbish around
there-loose stones and other things it was
musty and damp too but it looked as
though no one had ever been there except
the native who had told findlay about it
since the place was built

  leora and i each had a good torch so
we set to work while the batteries would
last there were some jars standing around
but they were empty and all the rest
seemed to be only rubbish it began to
look as if there were no treasure after all
until i heard a cry from leora who was
over in one corner looking at some stone
crocks

   dave she cried out  come here-
quick

  i ran over-and there it was yes sir
four of those crocks that held as much as
a quart each were filled to the brim with
jewels

  excited i should say we were both of
us we sat down by those stone crocks
and went through them to the bottom and
each one was crammed full of the most
glorious red jewels you ever saw we sat
and played with them like water running
them through our fingers and under the
torchlights they glowed and glittered like
red flames most of them had been mounted
and still had bits of gold or silver with
them where they had been chopped out

   well i said  here we have the
wealth of the indies right in our hands in
books it always makes a body feel delirious
and sort of crazy-but shucks  guess
the fellows who write books never found
any treasure of rubies like this


all-story weekly

   oh some of them have said leora
laughing  and how do you feel dave

   disappointed a heap i returned

   what

   sure i was all fixed up to find a
mixed assortment-diamonds and ropes of
pearls and emeralds and all the rest of
them well theres nothing here but
rubies

  leora laughed again  four quarts of
rubies that ought to be enough dave
what  you do with it all

   who-me why you get one of those
crocks and buck gets another and fong
tsai another and one to me thats only
fair isnt it  wonder how much theyre
worth 

   oh millions and millions i expect
leora let some of the rich stones trickle
through her fingers again  but you must
not divide them up that way dave youve
found them-

   never mind all that i said with
some difficulty owing to the stiffness of my
wound i rose to my feet and yawned
 lordy who would ever have suspected
that this old buddha was hollow up to his
topknot im going up to see everything
there is

   can we get out that way asked
leora

  that made me stop and think when i
had thought i began to feel cold chills
chasing themselves up and down my back-
bone although i tried to keep leora from
suspecting the truth

  we were shut inside of this big stone
buddha like rats in a trap to lift that
big flagstone about three feet square and
a foot thick was past us nor could we
connect the ends of the iron rod which i
had broken so far as we were concerned
we were sealed up in there tight as a drum
even should fong tsai come how would
he know where to find us we could hear
nothing and no one outside could hear any-
thing of what passed inside

  yet upon second thought my fear passed
into mere uneasiness up above there must
be openings and by means of them we
could apprise fong tsai of the situation-
when he came if he were delayed beyond
sunrise we might be up against it for we

had nothing to eat or drink however
thinks i the thing to do is to make sure of
those openings above

  so leaving leora with her electric torch
extinguished i took the other and began
the ascent it was no easy matter either
for the stones stuck out barely a foot they
ran up steeply and there was only the wall
to hang on by to make it worse my side
was beginning to hurt the one comfort
was that leora did not realize that we
stood in any particular danger from any-
thing

  at last i got up to the little round
balcony and then i tell you i began to
sweat in earnest there were openings
here three of them two of them were
high up the other was down almost at the
floor of the balcony and i judged they
went to the eyes and mouth of the stone
face outside but they were small maybe
an inch or less in diameter and by flashing
the light into them i saw that they had
been cut for a foot or more through the
solid stone i could make some kind of a
noise through them but when you remem-
ber that the face of that statue was about
forty-five feet from the ground and away
up among the trees you can see what
chance i would have of making fong tsai
hear what i said or understanding it

  and when i say that i sweated i mean
just that i stood before those tiny little
holes and wiped the sweat from my face
although it was not hot inside the statue
leora and i were up against it hard and
no mistake this time	f

  to save my life  could not see how we
were going to get out of there if only i
had not shot candelario he would have
known where we had gone but i had shot
him and now no one knew to try to
break through that statue was hopeless to
shoot down one of those holes would tell
nothing and they were not large enough
to push a flag through and wave it  besides
such a signal would remain unseen among
the tree-tops

  damn it i said to myself if i
hadnt broken that iron rod we would have
been all right but i couldnt pry that
flagstone up with a crowbar-even if i had
the crowbar
four quarts of rubies



  so i picked my way down the steps
again by which time my electric battery
was used up and it went out before i hit
the floor i told leora to save hers until
later then we sat down and i told her the
exact truth there was no sense in keep-
ing it back any longer and i thought she
might be able to find some way out of the
fix we were in but she could not first
thing i knew she was crying

   it would make anybody cry she said
trying to be brave when i did my best to
cheer her up  to think of being sealed in
this old statue and starving to death

   if we had old traddle here i said
 we could live off him for a month or
more 

  that shocked and horrified her out of her
crying spell as i had judged it would she
caught her breath with a gasp and right
on the heels of that we heard traddles
dirty laugh

   weve got you perkins said trad-
dles voice chuckling  dont start shoot-
ing young man because i have something
to say

  i was scared stiff for a minute hearing
his voice come out of the pitch-darkness
like that then i grabbed leoras lamp
and turned the light on the flagstone sure
enough it had been heaved up a couple of
inches

   be mighty careful what you do says
traddle an ugly note in his voice  ive
got enough men here to force up that stone
and weve a pile of brush ready to light
so if you want to be smoked out go ahead
and start something

  no explanations were necessary can-
delario had been wounded maybe but was
not dead and had told traddle about the
stone in the roof some of the malays were
forcing it up and traddle had figured that
we could be smoked out

  well he had figured it right with only
three small openings up above we saw
right off that we were goners the minute
he lighted that fire a little while before
i had been cussing because nobody knew
where we were-and now i wished that no-
body did know

   come on up here if you want to 
sang out traddle laughed sneeringly

   not yet young man whos up there
with you dont lie i heard you talking
who is leora i trust you were not in-
discreetly referring to miss graves in that
fashion

   what do you want i demanded
 smoke cant hurt us here you fat block-
head-it  go right out the top

   the malays say different said trad-
dle  pass down the jewels then come
down - both of you blockhead am it
well i guess ive got more brains than all
the rest of the crowd put together

  i switched on the light and looked at
leora she was white to the lips but she
met my gaze and nodded slightly she
knew that traddle had us-there was no
use fighting now

   well have to dave she said her
voice low and clear like a bell

   all right i sang out to traddle
 shove up the stone we surrender

chapter xiv

jewels-and jewels

traddle told the truth when he said
that he had brains his devilish idea
about the fire of brushwood was what
put the crimp into me if we had had any
idea when fong tsai would return we
might have held traddle off but for all
we knew fong might not come for us until
after sunrise

  leora gave me the fur robe and i
dumped the crocks of jewels into it and
made a bundle it came to me that if i was
a fiction hero i could drop down on trad-
dle and his malays with a gun spitting from
each hand and kill every last one of them-
but i was not that kind of a hero when
it came to dropping through the hole i
judged i would need both hands to lower
myself by besides traddle would be wait-
ing for me with a gun

  the flagstone began to heave up at one
end then it stopped the malays could not
reach any farther and they were getting
sticks te shove up the stone with we
could hear candelarios voice but not right
close he was wounded and was outside the
base of the statue and he wanted to come


all-story weekly

inside for some reason or other traddle
did not want him

   the half-caste cursed in spanish then he
 began to talk malay

  quit it sang out traddle leave
them men alone candelario theyll fetch
you the jewels-

  candelario was so mad that he could
hardly speak english

    send me two of those men queek he
cried out  i know you traddle you
theenk because i am wounded that you can
keel me and take the girl and the stones
too-but i am for come up there queek
 all right said traddle but cursing
under his breath  tell two of them to
come down and help you up the other
two can get this cursed stone up-this pole
will do

  so they had four malays with them
i judged that traddle did not trust can-
dclario any more than the half-caste trusted
him and that gave me an idea i caught
leoras hand and drew her over away from
the stone where we could speak without
being heard down below

    now i whispered  if fong tsai and
 your uncle heard any shooting going on
 here they would come in a hurry to save
 you see well you stay right here as
 soon as i crawl through that hole you shoot
 your gun a couple of times-aim past me
 and shoot down there at random

  i-i cant do that dave she said
quietly you know they would shoot you
in a minute-

    no they wouldnt  said quickly
trying to make her believe it anyhow  if
you are up here alone traddle wont try
to smoke you even if he did he could not
send up enough smoke to do any harm be-
fore fong tsai got here im going to try
and clear them out of that room down
below-

   youre a dear boy dave she said
 but you must not try such a mad thing-
 hush up i said

    i wont she flung back  and im
not going to shoot

   there was no use talking to that girl-
 she had made up her mind and she would
 not change it an inch so i had to give up
 the whole scheme there was nothing left

except to surrender and see what would
happen

  we went back to the flagstone it was
up a foot at one end and traddle had
lights down below so we extinguished ours
we could see the end of a pole shoving up
the stone and the two malays at the other
end of the pole were having hard work for
we could hear them panting traddle called
out for me to get a move on

   what do you want first traddle i
sang out  me or the jewels

  traddle laughed  when youre out of
the way ill attend to the jewels let miss
graves bring em im takin no chances
on you young fellow

   hoist up that stone some more then
i returned  im wounded and stiff and
i cant do any contortionist stunt

  traddle repeated what i said to can-
delario and the half-caste ordered the
malays to heave up some more-traddle
did not speak their language from can-
delarios voice i judged that he was being
helped up to the hole in the base of the
statue from outside

  the stone heaved up more and more
until the upper end was about three feet
about the floor it was plenty wide for me
to get through

   all right i said  hold her steady
-im coming

  i turned around and shook hands with
leora  keep away from that stone i
whispered  if it falls it  make a smash
see you later

  then something most surprising hap-
pened we were in the dark except for
what light came up around the stone and
suddenly i dont know just how either i
kissed leora or she kissed me or both of
us kissed each other-im not a bit sure
about it

  lordy i breathed wondering if she
was angry  i-i dont give a hang what
happens now-

  get a move on yelled traddle
 think we can keep this stone up ar
night

  i dropped to the floor and stuck my legs
through the opening and slowly let myself
down my side hurt something awful as i
did it because i had to hold myself up by
four quarts of rubies



my elbows until i got my body through
but finally i did it then i lowered until i
was hanging by my hands with my feet
near the floor below

  and for about a minute i stayed just that
way not daring to move two torches were
burning making a lot of smoky light and
two malays off to one side were holding
the pole that supported the stone right
n front of me stood traddle grinning all
over his fat and dirty face and poking a
revolver at me

   now says he  when you drop-i
shoot say your prayers quick

  he meant it too but it was not that
which held me there behind traddle and
to his left was the opening in the base of
the statue and framed in that opening
were the head and shoulders of candelario
he had a gun in his hand and he was aim-
ing at traddle-and he had him dead to
rights

   put up your hands traddle and drop
that gun said candelario softly

  old traddle looked over his shoulder
startled he jumped and turned a pasty
white then knowing that he was gone
anyway probably he just whirled around
and started shooting at candelario and
candelario shot back

  that lower chamber was a regular in-
ferno what with the noise and the smoke
i let go and fell-just in time too for the
two malays dropped the pole and jumped
at traddle as the stone crashed down i
jerked out my automatic and let fly with
all the bullets i had left

  that was all i remember the malays
had cut a pretty stout pole and when the
stone came down the pole came down too
it was iron wood and as heavy as lead and
it caught me square across the head i just
tumbled over in the corner and went to
sleep

   suppose there is no use prolonging the
agony any more because every one knows
that if i had been killed  would not be
writing this story about it that stands to
reason

  well all the while traddle had been get-
ting me to surrender fong tsai and buck
had been at work they had found the
malays all demoralized because news had

    	a-s

come that the sultan had been swallowed
by a crocodile - probably where i had
kicked him in although we never learned
for certain-and the malays did not know
what to do they told fong tsai about
candelario and traddle being on the island
so fong fetched over a boatload of his
chinese and reached the scene of action
just after candelario and traddle started
shooting each other up

  candelario had shot traddle and my
bullets had got the two malays and fong
shot candelario a couple of minutes later
while the half-caste was aiming at my sense-
less body the other two malays outside
were killed by fongs men but not before
they had told about the stone in he ceiling
professor graves and buck were along so
they got leora and the jewels and fong
had me carried to the boat and that ended
the whole business

  when i woke up it was the next day-
my knock-out had passed into sleep  was
in the stem cabin of the schooner on the
sofa and she was at sea buck had wakened
me up on purpose so  could eat something
fong tsai was there and leora and the
professor and on the table was the fur
robe with the jewels heaped up on-it

  we had a great time exchanging greet-
ings and talking over what had happened
after eating something i felt pretty good
and could walk all right leora told them
what i meant to do with the jewels and
everybody said nothing doing old buck he
said that he had lots of money and so did
fong and so did graves

   all right i said and bundled up the
jewels in the fur robe  overboard they
go then

  i got as far as the stern windows when
buck grabbed me and said he would take
whatever i wanted him to-and the others
agreed too then i got a shock

   they are not rubies said fong tsai
 they are garnets mostly-a few rubies
are scattered through but not many in
ancient india you know garnets were
esteemed very highly

  garnets i repeated then-why
they arent worth much are they

   no fortune said professor graves
laughing  what with the rubies among

them i imagine that the whole pile would	singapore and said good-by to fong tsai

bring ten or twelve thousand dollars	there and buck and i came back to the

preceding chapters briefly retold

jim gurney wastrel was asked by lynn the aid of a british government official to make a
 clean-up  of a gang of pearl pirates and all-round criminals led by a woman of unusual
beauty who made their headquarters on the island of tarani in the south pacific jim accepted
and resolved to make a clean-up of his life too he reached the island in a small boat was cast
up on the beach and rescued by barbara the beautiful eighteen-year-old daughter of ronald goff
an english trader she had been brought up free from conventions of any sort and her father
regarded her as a child but she was budding into womanhood and objected to being treated as
a  kid  by jim whose good pal she became

    goff had natives build jim a house near the beach one night some members of the pirate
gang who lived on the other side of the island came to goffs store to trade and their leader
mme miriam jobert a woman of rare but barbaric beauty came to jim and suggested that he
leave the island jim laughed at her and his house was set afire the next day he went into the
mountains and was captured by some of the womans followers but escaped after a fierce fight
and after he had been left to die on the beach

    for jim barbara changed from her usual unconventional attire to the clothing of civilization
but to her deep anger he paid her but passing notice but her father realized that she was no
longer a child

    mme jobert again came to jims hut told him that she loved him and suggested that he
become a member of her band again jim laughed at her when barbara saw the woman with
jim she ran away in jealous anger mme jobert told him that if he cared to come to her he
would find the path open

    jim rescued a book of romance that barbara had flung angrily into the sea and hung it up in
his hut to dry realizing that he must make his clean-up he started for the gangs settlement
on the way a native shot an arrow at him thinking that he was one of the gang who treated the
natives with terrible brutality jim made a friend of him and called him  useful

    from a point of vantage he saw a fleet of sloops come in and their crews land at the outlaw
village as darkness fell sounds of revelry came to him leaving useful he entered the village
and confronted the men in the dance-hall there was a fight and when things looked bad for
jim mme jobert interfered and ordered a man who had been about to shoot the intruder to be
executed then she asked jim to dance with her-and he accepted

    meanwhile a steamer had landed lynn-arrived to check up the clean-up-at goffs store
lynn did not know that jim had been assigned to the job the englishman was greatly impressed
by the fresh beauty of barbara and vaguely jealous of jim who she called her lancelot
while on a trip along the beach they entered jims hut and barbara saw the book that he had
rescued overjoyed at this discovery she became aware that lynn was regarding her strangely

     dont look at me that way i hate you for that smile she cried

chapter xxiv

lynn takes a dare

csxs smiles were rare they had not
that impudent devil-may-care cheeri-
ness of gurneys and mostly they
were veiled behind an impenetrable mask
of outward coldness but at such times as
they really showed they held a sterling
quality of friendliness that none but a sus-

picious misanthrope could possibly with-
stand

  even as barbara vowed hatred for him
stamping her small bare foot angrily her
brilliant eyes met his and gradually dimmed
to a softness which soon became shy apolo-
gy fler heart recovered from the flutter-
ing caused by the touch of her beloved
book so recently in his hands and the re-
sulting glow of pleasure in its possession ir-

radiated her charming face with renewed
comradeship

   i dont think i hate you mr lynn
she remarked gazing at him steadily and
smiling  sometimes  say things that i
dont want to

   then say something which you do want
to miss barbara lynn smiled back

   well then nobody ever calls me miss
she rippled and in a moment their relations
were reestablished firmly  i am barbara
and i want to say that i ought not to have
brought you here to waste your time with
my fancies let us get some food and-
oh do you like fishing or sailing or tramp-
ing best

   i like best that which pleases you bar-
bara and  would very much like first
to have you tell me who is this fortunate
knight whom you call lancelot

   lancelot why he is just lancelot
she cried and her animated face shaded
again for an instant to be immediately suf-
fused with smiles  no other name fits
him you know she added

   h-m then i hope some day that you
will find a name for me as fitting he said
and once more his eyes shone with a baf-
fling cold light he hastened to reply to
her other cjuestion for he sensed that he was
touching upon difficult ground and while
his official life found him eminently fitted
to deal with difficulties his difficulties had
not hitherto included a conflict of moods
with such a springtime sprite as barbara

   i rather think i like sailing to-day he
smiled  if you mean sailing in that corking
little canoe  saw you in an hour or so ago
 all right then well sail out to the reefs
youll find something for lunch in that big
box she indicated a packing-case serving
as a pantry  and there is fishing tackle
too if you care to fish the lazy way

   i think i can postpone the fishing bar-
bara let us sail but you shall tell me
as we sail how to catch fish in the way
which is not lazy

  they put out from the beach in the
canoe she had run back home to get the
boat while lynn collected such things as
she hinted to him and sped back for him
while he was yet walking down the shore
she was not experienced enough in the

worlds manifold ways to see unwarranted
tardiness in his preparations and his cool
exterior showed her no sign of the thorough 
search he had prosecuted in the hut during
her brief absence he had delved deeply
into the question of lancelots identity he
had secured nothing except the certainty
that the unknown knight was a man of few
wants and fewer belongings and a reasona-
ble degree of human tidiness in his habits

   hint of name or race or even color there
 was none but he refused to believe that
 lancelot could be a fitting name for any
 but a man of his own race and a fair amount
 of white mans decency when he stepped
 into the canoe he had covered himself with
 a garment of visible pleasure entering into
 the prospect of the trip with all the out-
 ward glee of a boy just emancipated from
 class-room restraint

   their brown-sailed craft flashed over the
 sparkling sea like an autumn leaf blown by
 warm breezes and as he sat amidships
 watching the girl steer her boat with con-
 summate skill he thrilled in every fiber at
 the vision of her he tore his gaze away
 many times hotly realizing that in other
 circumstances he would never be so rude
 but ever his eyes came back to her and as
 time after time he met her own steady eyes
 fixed upon him with a frank unembar-
 rassed smile in their starry depths he grew
 more at ease in the thought that she was
 too truly a child of natures own free
 family to see in his regard the rudeness he
 feared he was showing

   she did however notice his silence and
 it was such an utter change from his earlier
 chattiness that she almost became sure that
 the sailing was not suiting him and re-
 calling another occasion when lancelot had
 given her a similar feeling only for her to
 find after putting him ashore that his anx-
 iety to quit her boat was due to other mo-
 tives she could not now start the conversa-
 tional ball rolling with her usual spontane-
 ous merriment

    are you seasick she inquired then
 colored at the inanity of the question

  lynn started caught unaware in the
midst of a field of whirling fancies deep
buried his soul was under the accumulated
 coats of years of officialdom but it was still
the clean-up



 a strong soul a strong mans clean soul and
 it stirred within him as never in all his life
 before in the overpowering intoxication of
 his companion and surroundings

  stretching out astern of him the beach
lay in a dazzling streak of silver sand edged
and ruffled on one side by tufting little curls
of surf that sent their musical murmur
clear over to him still on the farther side
the beach was sharply outlined by the dark
fringe of the lower jungle in whose whisper-
ing blues and multitinted greens gleamed
vagrant and elusive flashes of silver-shot
purples and blazing crimson

  reared above and beyond all the black
cone of tarani loomed in stupendous bar-
renness like the bald crown of an ethiopian
titan above a shock of tangled luxuriant
locks that fell to his shoulders seaward
old ocean rolled and played boisterous play
it was hinting in his gambols at the fathom-
less might to strike a deadly blow should a
playfellow scratch in his playing and
above heavens dome hung blue as bar-
baras eyes little puffs of gleaming white
cloudlets coming and passing across the
azure like the dancing lights came and
passed in those eyes

  and there before him within touch of a
barely extended hand she sat and steered
her flying bark a creature unmatched in his
dreams unhoped for hitherto in his mortal
life one foot was curled under her the
other almost touched his the fine smooth
skin gleaming like pale copper where the
sun shafts caught it wayward breezes
clutched at her ragged brown garment and
wrapped it snugly about her as if sent by
the gods to make for them a mold of human
perfection to serve as pattern in the creation
of goddesses her lips were parted like a
newly opened red rose with the dew on it
and her white faultless teeth gleamed forth
a detail of beauty

  and her blue blue eyes-pools of shin-
ing glory they were brimming tvith truth
fearless and as pure as purity itself the
vague shadows that passed across the blue
of them only accentuated their loveliness
lynn was awed by the very innocence of
the girl stupefied by his proximity to such
a creature knowing full well that there was
no conscious allure in those so alluring per-

fections he replied to her inquiry lamely
enough

   no i am not ill-physically then
he too realized the inanity of such con-
versation and more expert than she in
guiding or choosing words recovered him-
self with a well-concealed effort and added
lightly you must think me poor com-
pany barbara it must be the sleepy
swing of this splendid little boat she is 
like a soaring gull

   she is indeed  she cried pleased at his
praise  she is the best boat ever built
lancelot built her for me

  in an instant she was all animation again
childishly gleeful that the silly constraint
had passed a second of doubt assailed her
when she laughed up into his face and saw
more darkness there but he cast aside the
poignant irritation her mention of lancelot
had caused to recur and met her smile with
one of rare brightness

   good man lancelot he agreed  i
hope to meet him one day but now sup-
pose we forget him and talk about our-
selves tell me first what is the method
of fishing you spoke of can we try it

   oh we cannot forget lancelot mr
lynn she protested quickly  you per-
haps may since you dont know him but
i i see him every moment waking or
sleeping in the water and the air in every
beautiful thing under heaven i see his face
and it smiles on me and forbids me to for-
get him no he must not be forgotten sir
but you need not think of him if jou prefer
not

  she held silence for a long moment pout-
ing and fixing her eyes on her feet so that he
should not detect her displeasure and per-
haps suffer another fit of silence which she
so disliked but she flashed a merry smile
at him presently and continued

   but i can tell you of the fishing if you
like and show you too

  she explained her own method of catch-
ing fish illustrating with swift little ges-
tures enthusiastic on a subject that had
only taken on importance since jim gurney
had told her it was something commonly
beyond the power of human swimmers
and as she chattered she knew from lynns
face that he was as doubtful about this


all-story weekly

method as gurney had been until she had
shown him

  the doubt aroused her spirit and she
would speedily show this superior stranger
how little he knew she would find out
also whether he was a man to compare with
lancelot for she would challenge him to a
test plunging her steering paddle deep she
put the canoe about and headed back for
the horn of the reef where she usually fished
and remarked warmly

   i will show you mr lynn i will con-
vince you and then you shall show me what
you can do i find it simple and so does
lancelot

  again lancelot lynn maintained an
outward smile but inwardly he chilled and
in so far as he was capable of emotion with
regard to other men he now felt a gnawing
hatred of this infernal lancelot who absent
yet persisted in forcing his presence between
this amazing young lady and himself there
was also a strong desire to get on the ground
and see to what heights he must attain in
natation to emulate the perfect knight who
might after all he told himself with sar-
castic enjoyment prove to be a copper
skinned amphibious islander

   then let us make haste he urged her
with mock anxiety  you have aroused
my curiosity-and my ambition

  the canoe sped and the blue of the sea
turned to green splotched with black then
the fangs of the reef were close-to and
barbara with a graceful sweep ran her
craft alongside a smooth boulder lynn
stepped out and turned to give her his hand
she had already leaped to the rocks painter
in hand and turned to flash a smile of
derisive thanks into his admiring face

  then with no perceptible pause she
swept a turn of the grass rope about a rock
securing the canoe and stood poised before
him tiptoe on the pinnacle of the rock her
gleaming rounded arms above her head her
tawny hair blowing about her laughing face
in a dusky cloud

   look down she cried  watch this
is my never-failing storehouse of fishes see
there are beauties of silver and gold of
orange and purple which would you like
 id like a golden one he laughed
bending low and scanning the cool crystal

waters he accepted her words in a spirit
of fun never believing that she could mean
to try anything so foolish as catching live
fish with her hands his view of the spar-
kling depths was shattered into a myriad
ripples the moment the words left his lips
and suddenly a glistening brown shape
darted into the watery picture swift as a
sunbeam and he glanced up to where she
had stood only to find the rock bare

  jove he gasped jove what a
dive he stared into the sea again in-
credulous and his incredulity was con-
founded even as he looked for right before
his frankly amazed eyes barbara rose
waist high from her dive laughing merrily
into his face and holding up a glistening
fish of gold and scarlet  here is your
golden fish sir she cried and climbed up
to the rock like a sleek brown seal

  it was pure luck of course he decided
and she could not repeat that performance
he challenged her to get him another fish
and peered into the water in search of one
to specify a line of finny beauties flashed
past the rock and he chose a slippery black
fellow with an eel-like head surely human
hands could never catch and hold that fel-
low in the water he thought

   get me the black one he invited
meeting her eyes with a look that plainly
said  it cannot be done my dear she
gave one swift glance at the fish and now
he was watching for her plunge he saw
her slim body arch like a bow saw the
small strong feet impart the impetus that
communicated to her shapely muscular
ankles sent her curving over to straighten
out arrowlike into a clean splashless dive
which shot her down past the rocks like a
streak of light

  she seemed to pause beneath the water
and lynn chuckled delightedly as his wise
selection for he knew she had failed to hold
the slippery black chap but his wonder-
ing eyes were to open wider yet for like
the fish itself she twisted and flashed in
another direction moving apparently with-
out effort and then in a moment she shot
upward into the air ten feet away but
triumphant in the possession of the elusive
black fish

there she cried panting slightly and
the clean-up



tossing back her wet clinging hair from her
face  can you do that lancelot can
you try it-i dare you and she laughed
maddeningly at him he stood before her
holding the black fish but with no thought
for it

  in his breast was somethingawakening
which threatened to choke him as he
stared at her glistening with sea drops
panting and rosy warm as love itself re-
vealed to his sight in all her beauty by the
audacity of her saturated garment lynns
studiously acquired indifference failed him
utterly and strong human passions surged
through his being

  he stared at her and she sensed some-
thing in his aspect not entirely due to ad-
miration for her piscatorial skill and her
sparkling eyes began to cloud then his
good breeding rescued him from himself
and he remembered what was due to the
daughter of his host

   splendid miss barbara he said in
cool untremored tones  i dont think i
will attempt that to-day but another
time you shall teach me and i may sur-
prise you do you mind if we return now

  they sailed back home and barbara
prattled along in her own merry way scarce-
ly noticing that he was more silent now
than when first starting out he was en-
gaged in a contest with himself he had
sloughed the character of his castaway dresr-
and was again the calm precise man of the
world she noticing nothing of this was
elated at the thought that he unlike her
lancelot had taken her dare

chapter xxv

two men and a woman

barbara kept lynn in mind of the
fact that he had not yet accepted her
dare to a fishing contest and per-
severed for the rest of the day and through
the next but he was queerly unrespon-
sive declined to enter into the fun she was
having at his expense and appeared so
totally different from the lynn of her first
acquaintance that she grew piqued at him
and took herself off alone to indulge in wild
swimming and sailing performances

  she could not however maintain this
attitude very long it was entirely foreign
to her nature and very soon she sought
him out found him pacing a desolate stretch
of shore alone and taunted him

   i frightened you didnt i arent you
afraid of the sea now youre the very
first man i have seen who took a dare and
wasnt ashamed of it

  lynn regarded her steadily for a moment
and something in his cool searching eyes
made her strangely uneasy there was no
menace no unkindness in his expression
but rather a deep unutterable longing which
stirred an unsuspected chord deep down in
her being and brought a wave of color to
her cheeks she remembered those un-
couth men on the sloop who had hunted
her canoe and she readily recalled the
beast-of-prey look on their brutal faces

  she vaguely compared their expressions
with lynns and felt a little afraid then
she looked more deeply and knew that he
was incapable of feeling as those other men
felt instinctively knew that this was a man
of different mold entirely to be feared by
no woman still his eyes puzzled her and
the longer she stood before him the greater
grew the puzzle until she was forced to
speak again since he refrained from an-
swering her

   i think you are ill mr lynn if my
canoe made you ill i am very sorry and
im sorry too for what i said just now

  lynn smiled softly down at her and a
wonderful light glowed in his handsome
face she might never know his feelings at
tliat moment or know of his inner conflict
since he left her after her fishing exhibition
but somehow she knew that he was not and
had never been afraid of any physical test
that his uneasiness was a thing beyond her
present knowledge

  he on his part trained as he was in
quick decisions had not yet satisfied him-
self on a subject sorely debated in the past
few hours from the moment of meeting
barbara goff he had been unable to go di-
rectly lo his appointed work the more he
considered the more intense became his in-
decision until he was angry with himself
in his lonely walk he had argued whether
to dismiss barbara from his mind as if he


all-story weekly

had never seen her and to go about his
business or to put his new but terribly
strong passion to the final test in order that
he might proceed on his duty untrammeled
by outside thoughts

  so he debated and he knew more cer-
tainly the more he thought that his passion
was not a thing of a moment not a physical
sensual passion but a pure white honora-
ble gentlemans first -and final love yet
he was not satisfied that he ought to pursue
that love every detail of his life was
antagonistic to the course of a level con-
ventional current of domestic happiness und
he was so thoroughly aware of it that honor
itself warned him against bringing possible
regret into the life of such a girl

  against this feeling was the rising tide of
his hearts desire and there seemed no pos-
sibility of an end to the conflict  there-
fore he still repressed his longing to pour
out his soul to her and replied to her sec-
ond question in a miserably unsatisfactory
sentence

    thanks barbara i am quite well i
am simply discussing business with myself
and scolding myself for not going about it
she saw the mixed emotions in his face
where others might have seen nothing but
impersonal kindliness but not understand-
ing those emotions never dreaming they
concerned her she answered him with a
bright smile that thrilled him again and
asked with a pertlittle toss of thehead

   your business business is so brisk on
tarani of course yours must be very im-
portant indeed to cause you to look as
gloomy as the mountain before a storm
tell me what your business is and maybe
ill believe you are not ill

   i am what men call an agent he
smiled back

   an agent oh  know you sell things
dont you

   not precisely barbara i try to dis-
cover things he replied slowly and again
his regard made her uncomfortable lie
saw the uneasiness creep into her face and
with a tremendous effort of will he cast off
his own indecision and rallied his wits to
meet her on different ground he laughed
pleasantly and took her arm

   come barbara forgive me for all this

gloominess lets say it was due to my dis-
appointment with tarani shall we then
things can get no worse they must get bet-
ter because i have decided there are hopes
of my discovering something of incalculable
worth on tarani after all take me for a
walk to th cliffs and show me where the
old witch lives

  they renewedtheir initial intimate com-
radeship quickly for barbara could no
more smother her bubbling high spirits than
she could understand fear and under the
witchery of her eager interest in every new
turn of the way lynn became the lynn she
had first known a splendid companion full
of spirits as high as her own

  she led him through the jungle full of
mystic lights and shades odorous with moist
earth and dew-dripping foliage carpeted
with leaf-strewn black soil that gave the
spring of velvet pile out to the goat trail
up the cliff they climbed and her face as-
sumed fresh loveliness as the eagerness in
her eyes intensified for though her com-
panion could not know it yet her heart had
gone soaring upward ahead of her to the
mountain top seeking the absent lancelot
whose lantern had not failed to wink its
good night  alls well but whose anxious-
ly sought figure remained unduly long away

  while they halted midway up the slope
lynn fell back into his early morning un-
easiness and in spite of himself he could
not keep his gaze from her the uneasiness
soon communicated itself to barbara and
she frowned with annoyance for she
thought him a much more agreeable com-
panion in an other mood than that which
seemed to possess him now she leaped up
and ran into the jungle gathered great
bunches of wild grapes and returned to
him hoping to find him back in his better
mood but while his smile was soft and
kind there was again that other mysterious
quality in it that had caused her uneasiness
she gave him grapes and looked her an-
noyance then said decidedly

   these will quench your thirst mr
lynn but i think we will return to the
shore now i am sure you are ill and i
feel uneasy let us go now

  to her surprise he responded readily
and they clambered down by a new path
the clean-up



eating their grapes in silence lynn kept
behind her all the way down and only
joined her when they emerged from the
bush and trod the beach again within a
hundred yards of lancelots castle

  as if drawn by a magnet barbara walked
directly to the hut and seemed unaware
that lynn had stepped to her side and was
looking at her hungrily a faint flush had
crept into his tanned face and the gleam
of his eyes was the reflection of a holv
fire blazing in his breast the sight of that
hut brought him to a swift decision as
nothing else could have done and now
on the ground rendered sacred to the girl
by memories of her perfect knight lynn
put his fate to the hazard

   barbara he said very softly and his
hand sought hers  i told you that i hoped
to discover something of great worth on
tarani i have found it a jewel whose
worth is beyond appraisal

  barbara stared at him and tried to with-
draw her hand his fingers retained hers in
a tender firm grasp and she knew in-
stinctively that unsuspected pow-er reposed
in the man she had called afraid she col-
ored then went pale feeling angry at his
freedom but sensible of that overpowering
quality in his eyes which assuredly gave no
reason for fear but the delicate bloom
came into her face again and her eyes
filmed softly for she was eves daughter
and needed no teaching in the great lesson
of love

  true this was the first time in her young
life that she had looked into a mans eyes
and found what she saw in the clear eyes
fixed upon her but her heart told her with
tumultuous insistence that here was love
tremendous love a lover wooing her for
his mate and she could not meet his eyes
then as from a great distance she heard
him speak on

   barbara i have found the jewel of the
ages i have found love and you shall
not tell me it is not for me you cannot
look up at me girl look into my face and
judge of the strength of my love for you
then let your heart speak in answer for
you

  barbara looked up bravely and there was
no longer any anger in her face rather

did her expression reveal a deep sincere
pity the pity more often found in a mature
mother than in a maiden confronted with
her first wtooer for such can often be cruel
but there was no flame of responsive pas-
sion in her gaze and a chill hand clutched
lynns heart when he read her answer be-
fore it was uttered

  he believed he knew the reason-that he
had made his plea too soon that in spite of
her rich loveliness and womanly charms
barbara was still a child unwarmed by the
fires of passion he almost felt satisfied
that he might renew his suit at some not-
far-distant date with success and before she
spoke he was convinced of it her reply
showed him how far in error he had gone
and astounded him with the depths of feel-
ing she was capable of

   mr lynn forgive me if i must hurt
you she said and her voice and manner
were those of inherent breeding even with
the stab he knew that he had judged her
rightly that she was a woman fit to hold
place before the earths chosen ones  i
like you very much indeed i like jou ter-
ribly and we can be good friends as long
as you remain here if you wish i will
gladly swim and sail with you show you
the mountain and the shore do anything i
can to make your stay happy but -
gently yet with unexpected strength she
released her hand from his- except in the
hand-clasp of friendship please do not put
your hands on me body and spirit sleep-
ing or waking living or in death i am
lancelots all lancelots

  her speech ended in a passionate out-
burst and lynn stood transfixed if he
had thought her lovely before if he had
deemed her wholly desirable he was suffo-
cated now by the surging blood that leaped
and throbbed from his heart at the picture
of her standing before him erect and state-
ly blushing with her confession her breast
revealing the tumult within her shy in her
maidenhood dignified in her limitless love

  lynns emotions warred within him
proof that she was capable of love was there
before his eyes but he could not or refused
to believe that such passion wras to be
squandered upon a beach-comber such as he
now had no doubt this lancelot must be


all-story weekly

  faint irritation moved him to reply and
govern his feelings as he might he could
not avoid a trace of subtle sarcasm creeping
into his response

  i should very much like to meet this
fortunate knight he smiled his smile
was unconsciously indulgent for deep down
in his heart he believed the girl had come
under some childish spell of romance which
had molded her emotions and a spark of
anger at her fathers culpable neglect of
her training began to grow into a blaze
also he resolved to speak plainly to goff
that very day his smile growing more in-
dulgent he inquired  tell me fair lady
does the brave lancelot know of his great
good fortune

  swift resentment flared in her eyes for
she detected the sarcasm in his voice and
words she faced him with quivering lip
and replied so that even he was abashed
 he does not know but what does
that matter it can make no difference
i know i have dedicated myself to him
body and soul and in good time he will
know that is sufficient for me it must
be sufficient for you a stranger

  his desires urged him to ridicule her at-
titude his intelligence told him that
mistaken or not barbara was very much in
earnest in her belief and his good sense
rescued him from a bad situation before
he irreparably offended her he bowed
with courtly grace at her reply and his
changed aspect soothed her gratified her
because it so perfectly matched her mood
at the moment

  her mind was filled with the perfections
of lancelot lynns cultured courtesy
seemed to her just then the homage of a
knight to the lady of an absent brother in
arms she was very willing to respond to
his peace overtures when he begged her
his own good calm controlled self once
more to continue the walk and not to think
too badly of him for what had passed

  so they walked along the edge of the
surf quickly resuming their merry com-
radeship and arriving at a degree of in-
timacy which persuaded lynn that he
might renew his suit at a future day with no
fear of offense they reached the point
from which the trail to the mountain start-

ed and paused debating whether to go that
way or to leave the shore for the sea a
while and while the debate was scarcely
begun lynns ideas of future wooing re-
ceived a rude shock for barbara suddenly
sprang forward toward the trail with a glad
cry on her lips and her companion stared
at her amazedly she radiated supreme
joy heartfelt thanks and crying little
words of worshipful love she bounded into
the bush and out of sight of lynn his
eyes followed her until she vanished then
sought and found the reason for her flight

  high up on the perilous path leaping
from rock to rock with the sureness of a
goat a virile figure rapidly grew in size
as he descended and lynn uttered sharply

   lancelot no doubt now we shall see
fair barbaras perfect knight and judge of
his worth 

chapter xxvi

 you shall be my king

beyond the mountain down by the
shores of the little haven jim gurney
played with fire with the voluptuous
form of miriam jobert in his arms and her
warm fragrant breath on his neck he
danced in ecstasy that became delirium
when she uttered that low seductive laugh
and now it was he who made advances

   lets quit this dancing and walk by the
sea he said and felt her tremble in his
arms fires burned in her eyes fastened
wide and unwinking thirsty triumphant
upon his face and a sigh that swelled her
bosom pressed her form against him mad-
deningly

  subtle enchantress that she was that
sigh usurped the place of speech she
gently released herself from his clasp and
silently led him taking his arm out of the
hut leaving behind her a gestured command
which redoubled the din of fiddle and feet

  beyond the glare of the lanterns they
walked and from time to time their glances
met and held for an instant unnoticing
gurney went where she led careless wheth-
er sea or sky earth or domdaniel were the
destination until after five speechless min-
utes of insensible progress he came out of
the clean-up



his trance to find himself at her side in the
garden of the larger house he had seen from
the cliff

  shadowy figures flitted before them
noiselessly and tiny hidden lamps began
to twinkle like glowworms about the place
until the entire house was softly bathed
in dim radiance he walked up two low
wide steps at her side felt her hand guiding
his and sank down on a broad billowy
couch in a heap of clinging pillows that
surrounded him with the same sensuous
perfume that she used on her person

  he heard her whispering to an unseen
servant then she joined him and sat beside
him leaning heavily against his shoulder
and putting her lips very close to his at
her touch he gasped harshly flung his
arms about her and crushed her to him
seeking her lips she placed a strong hand
on his breast and repulsed him laughing
again that low melodious laugh

   i knew you were a man she whis-
pered and under her lowered lashes he saw
the fires leap  now we shall understand
each other my jim shall we not but
just a little while but a moment and we
will be alone then i shall tell you that
which will thrill you more deeply than the
wine now being brought

  a shadow resolved itself into a silent
native maid and a tray with crystal de-
canter and ruby glasses was set down on a
small table beside the couch the maid
vanished at a word from miriam in the
native tongue and the rapidity of her dis-
appearance spoke eloquently for the force
of the quiet order

   now you shall look into my eyes and
drink to me jim the woman cooed
pouring wine that held globules of rich
light he took the glass from her and
their glances met ardently across the rims
as they drank but he was silent uttered
no toast and she showed pique

   what am i not worthy of a health
she cried and then stopped sharply for he
drank his wine at a draft flung down the
glass and again crushed her to him re-
plying hoarsely

   a health what spoken word can
satisfy this is my toast  and he kissed
her lips

   oh she gasped and a flash of anger
lighted her eyes he heated though he
was detected that flash and it lighted a
spark in his brain undoing in an instant
much of the spell she had wrought on him
he smiled at her saw the anger die and
change into death-calculating submission
and in turn his smile became a slow
understanding laugh

  that which a moment before bade fair
to become slavery of soul now reverted to
what it truly was and had been-mo-
mentary enchantment she swiftly sensed
the change and feared him less than she
feared failure thus instead of her anger
flaring into fury at his laugh she became all
woman soft yielding sorrowful that she
had hurt him

   jim forgive me she pleaded her lips
again close to his  i am not angry i
was taken unawares that is all you
know jim no man has ever touched my
lips before i was frightened now i am
not afraid see i give my lips to you
gladly

   youre forgiven he replied but re-
fused the kiss and now his face was no
longer suffused with hot blood his eyes
and lips wore his old-time natural merry
grin for that flash of anger escaping her
had jolted him partly back to cool reason
 youre forgiven but now im going to be
mad too there sis and his laugh rang
out mockingly as he mocked foes who
sought his life

  the woman leaped to her feet he could
hear her panting furiously and she paced
the dim veranda with swift tigerish steps
back and forth she passed while he looked
on amusedly every moment regaining more
of the grip he had all but lost every mo-
ment taking his own rightful place in the
party that of the dominant partner he
could only surmise what emotions stirred
her then but made a shrewd guess when he
recalled her method of treating disobedience
in her own men and he waited curiously
yet unable to subdue the tide of admiration
for her physical magnificence that had
taken hold of him

   but that wasnt her first kiss ill bet
my red head  he chuckled watching her
closely  surprised her no doubt but


all-story weekly

surprised or not her lips stuck like glue by
hickey if she should try to kiss me in-
tentionally-oh boy

  perhaps some mystic voice warned her
that the longer she lingered from him the
cooler his ardor must grow perhaps too
she set great store upon the opportunity
that had by lucky accident come to her
surely she realized that only the gods could
have drawn her telescope focus from the
distant steamer down to her own settlement
to reveal to her the man of all men she
desired at that moment and that same
mystic voice reminded her perhaps thae
by seeking him and finding him she had
neglected to watch the steamer out of sight
thereby lapsing from a duty in a manner
which she would have repaid with death in
one of her crew

  fury and longing ambition and hate
fought for the mastery within her and
ambition and longing conquered she came
back to him with her splendid head droop-
ing her jeweled hand extended in peace

   i want you jim-want you as woman
never wanted man since the world began
she said and stood there bowed before him
 i need you now when you laugh at me
if you will only look at me again as you
did before god how i can love you

  gurney was his own man again and
whatever physical attraction she might ex-
ercise upon him there was no danger of his
heart yielding for he appraised the woman
by worldly standards remembered how
often he had heard such words as she spoke
flung at brutal drunken sailors at a price
but he enjoyed the game she had carried
him into and was willing to continue play-
ing but reminded her beforehand of what
he had previously told her

   the game of loves a merry-go-round
miriam he smiled at her  id hate to
disappoint a lady in love and maybe i
wont but you forget that not so long ago
you declared war on me then a truce
neither of which was of my seeking you
said you would make me free of the island
but i made no promises did i

  to tell you the truth i dont feel very
friendly toward your outfit whatever i may
feel toward you in the end nothing would
suit me better right now than to wade in

and mop up your bunch of toughs if for
no other reason than their treatment of the
natives

   ah i love you for those words she
cried and seized his hand impulsively
 now we can come together on common
ground jim let us climb to a rock in
the cliff which commands the haven i
have so much to tell you and under the
stars you will listen and know that i speak
truth come i am pleased with you
again

  mildly astonished jim accompanied her
and they scaled the lower cliff and arrived 
at an overhanging rock which dominated
the entrance of the inner channel and
looked down upon the dance-hut now silent
and dim

   my beasts have guzzled their fill she
cried contemptuously  now they seek
their trembling prey

  slowly the grin spread upon gurneys
face for such words from such lips struck
him grotesquely he thought of a poor
devil of a man even then lying bound with
the tide creeping up to him he visualized
his own predicament escaped through no
softening of heart in the author he re-
marked derisively

   such beasts are not lacking an effi-
cient trainer i dont remember trembling
but i was prey all right not so long back
and not of the beasts either

  he knew that her eyes were fixed intently
upon him though he kept his face averted
he felt the warmth of her body the al-
luring softness of her pressing gently
against him as she adjusted herself to her
share of the narrow seat then her voice
came like music to his ears in words that
shattered all his carefully maintained cold-
ness

   it is because to train my beasts i have
been forced to do as i required them to do
that i am a lonely heart-hungry woman
begging for the love of a strong man who
mocks me jim your sufferings at my
hands were as nothingto my own at having
caused them

  i fought with my own heart while i
could but when i knew i had found in you
the first real man of my life i saw in the
future release from this horrible existence
the clean-up



and reached out greedily for you if you
feel angry because my brutes ill-treat the
natives i feel furious but while  must
remain here i must keep them loyal by all
means and cannot restrain them as i
would

   in other matters as you saw to-night

i hold them by merciless measures she
paused turning her face full toward him
and he caught the glow of her eyes under
the stars  jim i am weary of it all come
to me and it shall all cease--you shall do
as you will with this prison settlement and
carry me where you will i shall rely on
your goodness

   that requires thinking about miriam
he replied meeting her gaze with a non-
committal smile  you know im a law-
abiding sort of cuss dont fancy funny
business at all and before i meddled in
with a crowd like yours except to trim some
of em id want to know more about them

i cant see why theyre here at all in the
first place as for what to do with em
id give em to the natives theyve wronged
and use em for fertilizer thats my no-
tion

  intense eagerness marked her vibrant at-
titude as she replied

   take me and do as you say with my
crew jim that is what i long for-to
be free of them utterly-and it is such a
task for a woman to kill one by one such a
gang of ruffians yet they must not go from
here they must never carry my secret to
the world

  again she paused and her agitation was
unrepressed such a mixture in words of
passionate longing cold cruelty and im-
plied treachery had never come to jims
ears before and he sat there on thorns of
expectancy gone utterly -from her spell
cognizant once more of the business that
had brought him there and believing him-
self in sight of the climax her next sen-
tence convinced him that he was right and
a passing word electrified him with its fit-
ness

   listen i will confide in you i shall
tell you my secret jim and you shall help
me to clean up this nest of snakes before
we go you and i to our rightful place in
the world jim you shall be my king

and have no fear you shall live as no king
ever lived for i am richer than sheba

chapter xxvii

miriams proposal

one word she had uttered stiffened
gurney as nothing else could
clean-up she said and it acted like
a powerful tonic yet in a way far from her
desire although she knew nothing of it
then  clean-up  was jims slogan and
the sound of the phrase reminded him
harshly that but a few moments before he
had all but forgotten what its meaning im-
plied to him

  he had come dangerously near to sur-
render in the intoxicating presence of this
woman and the realization of it brought a
hard glint into his eyes and a grim line to
his lips he was careless now whether his
methods were strictly proper or not his
errand demanded a clean-up of the whole
nest and that included the mother bird
too

  he did not believe that it was his duty to
tell her of this outright and he felt easy
in his mind regarding hearing what she
termed her confidences had any slight
uncertainty remained it must have van-
ished the instant he met her eyes for they
were fastened intently upon him and in
their dark depths he saw the fierce cold
glitter of a serpents orbs shining through
the warm softness which was only her out-
ward expression

   tell me whatever you like im lis-
tening but i make no promises he said
then shifted his gaze harborward as if in
fear of losing him she leaned against him
placing her hands on his shoulder and
breathing very close to his face

  he refused to meet her eyes but inclined
his head and he felt hot clinging lips on
his neck the touch made him feel like
shivering but he repressed the feeling and
waited for her to speak when words came
it was in a low vibrant murmur and the
sentences came rapidly giving him a thrill
of exultation as the tale unfolded

   jim i am called queen of pearls she
said  in the house where you kissed me


all-story weekly

jim are gems that will amaze the world
for years my crews have gathered them
paying no tolls hiding here until the day
when my store is full content to suffer
virtual imprisonment here in the prospect
of wealth rather than risk real imprison-
ment with poverty afterward

   that is why i must permit them license
in their orgies but oh jim how i despise
them for a year past  have diminished
their number slowly punishing by death
when chance came holding the rest by
threats

   but i am afraid now they are not
as they were they look at me sometimes
as if they read my thoughts and each time
one of my vessels comes in from the grounds
with pearls or to escape the patrols i
tremble i am only a woman jim and they
are fierce men-

  fierce as pussy-cats jim laughed
softly

  she frowned at the interruption and her
fingers tightened on his arm

   yes fierce as cats wildcats she cried
then resumed her low murmur  to you
jim they are not fierce you have no
fear of any man i have seen it and that
is why i need you if you will help me
together we will keep them here now that
all are here and they shall never leave
tarani alive we just you and i jim will
take our treasure far from here and live as
such a man and such a woman should live
she paused and waited for him to speak
he kept silence and she cried impatiently
 speak

  horror and disgust filled jims soul at
her callous proposition he saw too the
unstable situation he was in for if she
could coolly propose the wholesale murder-
ing of her loyal ruffians he was under no
deception regarding his own fate if he
aroused her suspicions

  he hesitated to reply but felt forced to
utter some word at least sensing the tense-
ness of her pause he turned her with a
smile and suggested

   how would a pretty little japanese
house in moji suit your ladyship

  lightning flashed from her eyes and she
glared at him from a distance of inches
only he gave her look for look his im-

pudent grin firmly fixed upon his face and
slowly the alarm faded from her eyes and
she replied

   i said you might take me anywhere
jim but not japan not japan she
stopped for a short while as if debating a
knotty point then brightened and faced
him again  i have told you much and
will tell you all for i know you cannot
refuse my plea jim i cannot go to japan
my pearls are taken from japanese
grounds-

   stolen jim put in brutally

   stolen if you will the word does not
matter does it

   not much only i must say you are
smarter than most if you have managed to
plunder government treasure for a term of
years and get away with it as clean as it
seems you have

   i am coming to that jim it has not
been wholly what you call smartness i
have a friend who has made it easy and
he expects his reward

   pearls

   no me she cried savagely  he is
an official high in the confidence of another
government a government ambitious to
filch japanese possessions he has power-
ful friends too who have made it possible
for my fleet to carry on their work in se-
curity in return for this security i have
taken care of precious documents for him
here which will surely give his government
the object of its desire so you see my
jim it has been a reciprocal arrangement
but-

  she stopped again and the savage gleam -
shone anew in her eyes  but my friend
expects that at the proper moment his
schemes and the realization of my treasure
shall occur together and then he will carry
me away with him he expects this i
have promised it i was forced to promise
it to secure my position here

   i see gurneys rejoinder was almost
a whisper

  she detected the harsh note and hastened
to add

   but he shall never have me jim i
care nothing for his schemes or his precious
documents i have my treasure and it is
for me alone-me and my man my brutes
the clean-up



here-peste they are swine and shall i
cast my pearls to them no with you
my jim i shall laugh at their destruction
and together we will burn up those foolish
documents and leave only gleaming splen-
did pearls to jewel our love

  gurney looked long and fixedly at her
as at some hideous loathsome thing which
to that instant had fascinated him by a false
presentment of beauty but even if his
feelings rebelled he held firm control of his
features and the cheery grin never wavered
his steel-gray eyes never winked thus he
was accustomed to look at men while he
tongue-lashed them into conflict with him
to their inevitable sorrow

  he drew one foot up to the ledge and
placed a hand beside it and instinctively
she knew that his soul did not leap out to
hers

  she drew in her breath sharply regarding
him with slightly parted lips and waited
for him to speak then she hung on his
words breathlessly the words were those
of the man who had ridiculed her on an
evening down by the farther shore

   unutterably sweet lady you flatter me
by giving me an earful of that stuff please
accept my regrets that i am unable at this
moment to join your pleasant little party
ive been everything going almost but
never a crook and never a traitor to a
fellow rogue why he leaped up and
stood towering over her and his voice
grated metallically- i should be scared
stiff to eat food with you after this poison
would be but a gentle attention to expect
from you when you felt tired of me

  like a tigress she leaped up beside him
and they stood close together on the narrow
ledge in perilous proximity to the abyss
stars like small suns gleamed down upon
them and were reflected in the placid waters
below whence came the whispering voices
of tiny wavelets late night breezes sang
about them in the hollows of the cliff the
sharp cry of an uneasy sleeper stabbed the
air like ringing steel and upon the noctur-
nal chorus the womans contemptuous
laughter burst

   you should be more discreet jim she
said  poison you fear that is for those
whom i hate yes i can poison and i can

strike at this moment the water-tanks of
all my vessels are poisoned thus have i
made sure my escape from those beasts

   but you-you may not live- to taste
poison my friend here on this ledge are
you not in my hands fool mad-brained
fool

  jim grinned happily and the grin swiftly
hardened into grim determination for as
she shrieked  fool  she drew a knife from
her bosom and the steel flashed wickedly at
his throat he matched her quickness and
outdid it seizing her arm in an unbreaka-
ble grip he forced her back to the cliffside
until he felt his feet secure then with no
play at gentleness because of her sex he
twisted her wrist until the knife clattered to
the rock and she cried out with pain

  but she possessed no cowardly streak in
her being the knife fell leaving her un-
armed in his hands unless shecould get at
her pistol she fought him with her free
hand and from eyes to chin her fingers tore
ripping the flesh until the salt blood was in
his mouth and again she tore him laughing
insanely

   so you flout me again you currish
beast but you will not she writhed in
his grasp pressed her body against him and
flung an arm about his neck twisting a foot
about his ankle and pressed her weight
heavily forward until he staggered danger-
ously near the edge of the narrow footing
 see i am not afraid to kill you i shall
gladly go with you and now she strove
desperately to hurl him with her headlong
to death

  hey back up gritted jim fighting
hard against her thrust he fought her as
he would fight a man in similar case not
striking but putting all the tricks of man-
handling he knew into regaining lost
ground and as he pressed his head against
hers leaving his hold of her knife hand to
clasp her around the body he felt her
hysterically powerful figure give and bend
to his pressure until she suddenly relaxed in
his arms with a gasp of despair and sank to
her knees

  he stared down at her and for all his
anger he could not refrain from giving her
credit for her fighting fury he dearly
loved a fighter-a clean fighter-and the

distinction saved him from the mistake of
softening toward her she had not fought
him clean and those poisoned water-tanks
stuck in his memory

  he darted down his hand tore open her
dress and found the pistol that he knew
was there with that gone the lurking glint
died out of her eyes and cunning submission
took its place

   jim my jim you have conquered me
she whispered

   youre dead right ive conquered you
lady he grinned feeling the pistol to find
if it were loaded  you stay put there
a while im taking command now if
you move an inch ill come up and conquer
you some more

   dont leave me jim please dont she
begged in a voice of pitiful softness

  she lowered her lashes until to look at
him she had to raise her wickedly lovely
face and reveal the long slender column of
her perfect throat gleaming like ivory in the
starlight her tumbled figure might have
taken the attitude after long study for
effect so vividly did it disclose her un-
doubted charms and as he gazed down at
her scorning her from his soul gurney felt
an irresistible thrill yet in the contemplation
of her physical perfections

  he gave his thoughts a vicious jerk in
fear for himself and told her  you stay
right there until that star there sets he
pointed out capella blazing brightly low
down in the west about an hour from set-
ting  then you can go home if you like
youll see me again lady unless your good
sense makes you get out of here before i
return take my advice and change the
water in one of your boats and beat it but
dont you dare move a step from here before
that star dips for ill be watching you and
 can shoot almost as straight as you

   jim i am penitent indeed i am  she
moaned had he been less disgusted with
her unexpectedly revealed true nature her
piteous plea must have beaten down his
anger for she was an actress of peerless
art  jim i lied about the poison i was
angry do as you will but come back to
me for i am lost if you desert me now
gurney possessed keen hearing as well as
keen fighting instincts and therein he scored

a point on his splendid foe which she never
guessed he turned and started to climb
down to the camp simply replying to her
that she would see him again soon unless
she took his advice and left tarani and
after his retreating steps her plaintive plea
followed

   jim my jim come back to me

  and his keen hearing informed him of
her true attitude of mind toward him by
carrying down on the trail of the plea
fainter almost inaudible the words

  pig unutterable dog 

  good for miriam he chuckled hap-
pily continuing downward  shes a cata-
mount with ten claws to each foot and
teeth a foot long dripping with venom
makes it easier to wrastle with her though
every time he reached a turn in the path
he looked back and made sure that she had
not moved he saw her face thrust out over
the ledge glaring at him and at such mo-
ments he handled his pistol in her sight
careful to permit the starlight to glint on
the polished barrel at the foot he halted
out of her sight for several minutes then
suddenly stepped out and sought the ledge

  she was still there and whether she was
cowed by his threat or was simply unde-
cided and still hopeful of his return to her
in the manner she desired he neither knew
nor cared he was satisfied to know that
she remained where he had put her and
even if she started down after him in a
short time it gave him time to do what he
had planned

  stealing cautiously into the settlement
he took out one of his own pair of pistols
to reenforce the other assured himself of
the readiness of the spare one and crept
up to the first open door and listened

  sleep uneasy and noisy filled the black
interior

chapter xxviii



 on the trail

jim stepped inside the hut his feet mak-
ing no sound on the sand floor and
groped carefully around the flimsy walls
until he reached the board bunk whence
issued the strangling snores of a stupefied
the clean-up



sailor he had no fear of awakening such
a sleeper to put it to a test he coughed
loudly and received the response he had
hoped for the snores went on without a
check but a little cry of fright issued from
the blackness and jim put his hand gently
over toward the cry

   come here mary i take you to vil-
lage he whispered the frightened cry
was repeated but quieter and he repeated
his order running his hand soothingly along
a smooth round arm he had encountered
which trembled violently growing still how-
ever under the pacifying influence of his
touch

  he was obliged to speak again and to
labor with words to make quite plain his
meaning before the little native girl could
realize her release then her breath was
audible she gave a tiny murmur of relief
and jim felt a small hand creeping along
his arm to his strong fingers to at last snug-
gle into them trustingly

  once outside he quickly satisfied the wo-
man of his intention to help her and her
sisters in trouble and she aided him by
slipping noiselessly into the other huts and
bringing out the unexpectedly emancipated
natives as he stood in the midst of the
settlement with the shivering little brown
women gathering about him he keenly
scrutinized the cliff and the ledge where he
had ordered miriam to remain

  the stars were waning as dawn ap-
proached but still he could see the ledge
clearly and he chuckled at die discovery
that the ledge was empty although capella
scintillated brightly a handbreadth above
the western horizon he looked too at the
heights where useful lay hidden wondering
if the native was as sleepless as himself that
night he could make out nothing on the
darker heights decided that finding the
man to act as guide would take too long
and was not essential anyway since the
women surely knew the road home and
quietly arranged his flock into two abreast
and whispered the order to march

   home kids-beat it

  the women some of them children hesi-
tated just for a moment bewildered by the
simple fact that they were actually told to
go home and for once afraid of the darkness

    	a-s

and what lay behind them but jim passed
the word along by means of the first woman
he had called out told her that he was
coming right behind them to protect them
from pursuit and the column started so
swiftly that he lost sight of them in a few
seconds pie was put to a run to catch up
then easily traced his protegees by their
sibilant whispers for they no more than
their white sisters could withstand the urge
to chatter the moment the danger was out
of sight

  for fifteen minutes they trotted around
the base of the cliff until rounding a spur
they entered the jungle and left behind the
aridness of rock and sand as a gray pearly
gleam shot up to the sky from the east
still no uproar back of them came to alarm
them the settlement lay steeped in
drunken stupefaction

  jim only casually wondered about the
woman he had no false ideas about her
obedience to his command-she was not
that kind of woman-but he felt that he
would like to know just what she was doing
or where she was that she had aroused
her men to follow him was a thought dis-
missed at once for such men were not likely
to plunge out of sleep into a jungle chase
as silently as sober indians

  he did not bother much however what
she did or where she was he felt more
interested in her as herself debating her
many sides in his mind weighing her up
so to speak and coming to the conclusion
that as a woman she was a splendid animal
as an animal she was a disappointment

   i hope she takes my tip and beats it
he reflected as he strode through the odor-
ous lush jungle saturated with dew  if
she dont ill have to handle her the same
as her filthy crew-and i hate to do that
for she has her points by hickey

  the-hurrying line of brown figures ahead
of him had ceased their chatter through
sheer weariness for their previous day and
night ended as it was by broken sleep fitted
them badly for the chill damp journey and
their animation at their freedom soon
quieted jim followed the last of the file
and his thoughts did not hinder him from
keeping a mental record of their course
he realized they had traveled around the


all-story weekly

mountain in a winding arc rather more than
a semicircle but the heavy jungle shut off
any glimpse of the high land which might
have verified his position

  the women seemed less certain just at
that time than they had been in the first
flush of release the woman he had called
mary-it is safe to call any of those wo-
men mary for want of their real name-
halted once and waited for him and he
thought the way was lost but she only
placed a finger to her lips assumed an air
of exaggerated caution and warned him

   big spirit of tarani lib up top and
pointed through the trees overhead then
she scurried on to rejoin her companions as
if terrified lest the spirit had heard her

  jim glanced up grinning at the native
fancies and was surprised to find that the
frowning mountainside again broke through
the forest there and loomed over them like
a forbidding countenance but the notion
of a great spirit did not appeal to him he
simply tried to get his bearings from the
outcrop and resumed his walk

  spirits were less in his mind than the
near certainty that his advance guard had
lost the way but he was startled sharply
by a sound that came apparently from just
overhead a sound which he failed to place
or identify in the flash of a thought he
swung around alert as ever unafraid but
neglecting no precaution in that unknown
region whose hinterland was full of men
emphatically not friends

  then on the heels of the strange sound
came a familiar one a womans voice or it
might easily have been an animals for it
was a cry first then a snarling exclamation
of fury and almost at his feet two bodies
dropped from above falling in a spitting
writhing heap from which he leaped to get
clear sight of them

  a fierce struggle was afoot ended in
short order with a scream and an upspring-
ing of one figure while the other sprang
back in a queer access of fright for this
was the apparent victor in the scramble of
a moment before gurney recognized the
furious voice of miriam jobert in that
scream of rage and he stepped before her
and glared inquiringly from her to shivering
useful the other figure of the pair

   i catch her-she hab knife for you
useful asserted in triumphant tones now
that his friend stood between him and the
awful woman he had attacked  i jump on
back she fall down hard

  gurney swiftly sought on the ground for
the knife useful had mentioned for he saw
miriams gaze darting here and there among
the shrubbery she stood there palpitating
with billowing passions yet even in her
extremity she used the perfect art that was
in her while she glared vengefully at
useful and while her brilliant eyes sought
eagerly for her lost weapon she never lost
sight of jim gurney never neglected for one
second to play to his sensibilities and when
he stooped under a bush and picked up her
knife a murderous wavy-bladed kris she
uttered a low stricken moan stumbled and
sank to the ground at his feet her great
eyes luminous and soft yet glinting in their
far depths with bitter hatred were raised to
his and her red lips smiled pitifully in the
soft light of advancing morning as if to tell
him that her eyes belied her true feelings

  he sent useful on with a grateful word
telling him to take his women home and
keep them there without fear then turned
to miriam her eyes followed his every
move she crouched on the ground half
kneeling and lowered her head as if in
shame when he flourished the kris before
her face a moan burst from her again
and she shivered violently as if fighting
down other more piteous indications of
feminine weakness

  gurney appreciated the situation fully
and enjoyed it he felt certain that the wo-
man was playing some deeper game since
failing in her vengeful errand through the
agency of the loyal useful and now he
regarded her curiously but there was no
softness in him when he considered that
he might have been the one on the earth
and she standing over his knifed body in
unholy triumph

  he was curious to know why she crouched
there at his feet for she had stood stoutly
enough after hurling useful from her he
knelt beside her taking her arm firmly and
shaking it she moaned as if in torture and
her body swayed toward him

   jim jim i have been mad she whis-
the clean-up



pered and her hand dosed on his i am
punished dont despise me jim

  her head fell back and her eyes gleamed
from almost closed lids her face held the
seductions of a wounded circe his lips
closed tightly and for an instant the cheery
devil-may-care grin was banished in the
recollection of the womans man treach-
eries then his infallible humor returned to
him and he relished the present situation to
the full he laughed outright

   lady youre an awful scream he
chuckled  dyou know the sort of stuff
you pull would make your fortune in
the movies pearls stolen documents
treachery piffle my dear theyre all
small-time stuff what you need is an
introduction to the marvelous movie-mob
manager and a job to do vampire roles for
the nickelodeums by gosh

chapter xxix

a meeting

he stood over her gazing down at her
bent head with a cheery grin she
kept her face downcast but he could
see the heave of her shoulders he felt the
scorch of the blazing rage she was glowering
into the innocent earth he tapped the
kris blade with his fingers making the
steel ring and waited for her to make some
definite move she remained motionless ex-
cept for the visible tumult of her feelings
and jim made his blade ring sharper and
quicker as his patience cooled

   come sis jump up he ordered at
length laying a hand on her bare neck
she quivered ecstatically at his touch but
made no effort to rise jim went on banter-
inglv  im surprised that you disobeyed
my orders to stay on that ledge miriam
but then lifes full of surprises aint it
youre surprised by my man useful jump-
ing on your neck and all your jolly grog-
swilling hogs will be surprised to wake up
and find they have to get their own break-
fast

   its a great life lady-but jump up 
cant wait here all day and you must get
on your way he tried to raise her feeling
a little uncertain over her protracted atti-

tude of submission  come on up with
you i want to give you a bit of advice
and youd better take it like a good girl

   im a bit tired of your stunts get
back home to your gang remember what
i told you a few hours ago and get out of
here while you can im coming down to
your camp in less than no time to smoke
out the whole blamed nest i ought to
scoop you in with the rest for you dont
play a sporting game but im a soft-
hearted cuss and hate to fight with a
woman

   dont be fooled though if a woman
turns into a she-wolf ill fight her to a
finish beat it while the goings good
miriam and if you are a nice obedient
little lady perhaps ill give you a letter of
recommendation as a nursemaid or some-
thing so that you need not starve where
you go

  she looked up at him her big eyes full
upon his and to his suspicious astonishment
there was no rage in her face at his con-
temptuous speech she remained on the
ground and her eyes were soft and scent-
ing mischief in her pose he snapped

    well

    believe in you now jim and know
you wish me well she said softly  i do
indeed after all ive done and tried to do
you treat me as a sister and  will gladly
do as you say but i cannot walk jim i
am crippled my ankle is sprained

   bunk he retorted he placed both
hands under her arms and urged her to rise
 get up yes you can try now and no
funny cuts

  she made the effort listlessly and stum-
bled to her feet but fell limply against him
with a whimper that touched his heart

   thats a darned shame sis he sympa-
thized  but youve got to get home or
go to the village whichever is nearest and
i am short on time come ill hold up the
lame side which is it village or camp

  she shuddered as she climbed to her feet
again and he felt that the shudder was not
entirely of pain his arm was about her
waist her arm slipped around his neck and
she essayed a few steps then said  dont
take me to that native piggery jim take
me home please


all-story weekly

  he was not deceived as to her reasons
had he treated natives as she had per-
mitted her crew to treat these he would
never want to stray helpless into their
hands he appreciated her preference and
helped her along toward the settlement
curious as to what his reception would now
be for he believed she would lose no time
in telling her crew of the release of the
native women and his part in it in spite
of her protestations that she intended to fol-
low his advice

  his curiosity faded as they proceeded
for in their intimate proximity the woman
found an irresistible opportunity again to
play upon the harp of his feelings her
rounded sleek arm was warm on his neck
his own arm pressed her yielding lissom
body to his her beautiful face softened in
pain was upturned and pitiful the great
gleaming eyes veiled by drooping lashes

  for all his knowledge of her she thrilled
him yet never again could she thrill him
as he had been thrilled in that moment when
he lost himself in a stolen passionate kiss
he was sufficiently his own man now with
all her thrill to notice that her limp was
at times almost imperceptible that in the
moment when he clasped her more tightly
to him and she responded with a deep sigh
and upward sweep of her eyes she limped
not at all

  he was contained enough to give no sign
that he noticed this he continued on his
way with as much solicitude for her easiness
of locomotion as before and when at length
they arrived at her house and he laid her
down on the great couch and called her
maid she rewarded him with a burning
look of gratitude

   stay with me jim she whispered  i
am afraid of my beasts now that i am
helpless

  but he shook his head  cant be done
sis he replied  you send the maid
out to bring your chief husky tough and
give him orders to change the water in
those tanks that will occupy them all
long enough for you to get about on that
foot again it isnt very bad im sure

   im going over to my place now and
when  come back i hope you will have
taken my advice and cleared out see

now while the maids gone ill take charge
of those pearls you say are here where
are they

  if the woman were shamming an injured
foot jim guessed his demand must surely
force her to throw off the pretense but
she was peerless in her acting and he ad-
mired her for it for he never for a moment
doubted the falsity of her claim to a
sprained ankle he had seen proof enough
of it but she lay there gave no hint of
anger regarded him so submissively that he
admired her art more than ever and said
simply

   why must you leave me jim i have
told you that all my treasure is yours if
you say the word take it take it all
but take me also jim tell me why you
must leave me now

   im going to carry those pearls to my
place miriam to leave them safe he
smiled impudently then im coming back
here to mop up the beach with your hogs
thats why i say clear out before the fun
commences for i feel a bit sorry for you
you might be a queen if nature hadnt
made you a beautiful devil

  she laughed back at him a rippling
mirthful laugh such as a happy child might
utter and as she lay there apparently help-
less she seemed very harmless very human
she said and her voice was like wine and
music

   my jim you are my king take the
pearls the papers-all  shall await you
here for you will return and you are sorry
for miriam pity my jim is own brother
to love and i am content you will come
back you shall find me and i shall yet call
you my man good-by will you kiss me
jim kissed her as he might kiss a chums
first baby it was expected and not posi-
tively poisonous and he gazed down at
her quizzically marveling from what human
strain such a creature could possibly spring
every moment she revealed a new side an
amazing side to her complex nature he
assumed his careless cheery grin and said
 better not wait miriam im not com-
ing over here on any picnic i promise you
now show me where the pearls are and ill
be back all the sooner

  he expected that when the momejit came
the clean-up



she would be unable to longer sustain her
role of injury or to carry out what he be-
lieved to be her bluff regarding the pearls
to his amazement hidden with difficulty
she raised her head and replied

   they are in a chest under my head
jim heres the key- she nodded down-
ward indicating her corsage and he saw a
thin gold chain about her neck  take the
key and the gems are yours the docu-
ments too are there jim see i put my-
self in your hands utterly

  as in a dream he drew forth the key a
stout piece of iron in a softly padded silk
bag the chest was now uncovered by re-
moving the pillows and to his further sur-
prise the key fitted the climax of surprises
was attained when he opened the chest
found bag after bag of magnificent gems
and a small despatch box removed them
and never once saw hint of treachery

  he gathered up the treasure and met
her eyes they were filled with an unutter-
able longing humid and tender she smiled
at him smiled when he left her without
further word bearing away the wealth of a
monarch the fruits of her lifetime almost
of wrong-doing but he did not hear the
words that escaped her twisted lips the mo-
ment he was out of sight

   now all is done that may be done if
he will not relent and come back to me after
this evidence of my trust my brutes shall
wipe him from the earth and with him that
doll-faced girl over there and her idiot
father but he cannot deny me now give
him one hour in silent contemplation of
those gems and he will come back to me
eager and desirous of me he cannot leave
me a helpless woman to crawl away like a
wounded dog and she laughed maliciously
at the thought of how she had fooled him
with her crippled foot

   he on his part climbed the cliff chuck-
ling heartily at the way she had fooled her-
self he labored under no delusion about
her parting with her treasures he knew it
was some trick but a trick which he was
willing to watch to the end and to make
the most of toward noon he mounted to
the summit he let loose a yell of elation
as he started down the other side and
caught sight of his hut and goffs house

then he detected two tiny figures away
down by the sea near his house one was
a man who even at that distance he knew
was not the trader

   back up jim he muttered and halted
to seek a hiding place for his treasure
he would gladly have let barbara into
the secret but that stranger-

  he hastily marked a place beneath a
fiat rock and resumed his descent empty
handed at the half-way he saw barbara
run forward and answered her action with
a ringing yell of welcome she went out
of sight as she passed the jungle-beit and
he plunged into it to meet her

  he caught her and swung her aloft like
a baby shaking her and calling her kid
and bobby and every other name he could
think of which had at any time vexed
her and she was not vexed in the least
but in a very ladylike voice begged tobe
set down and turned a blazing face from
him yet permitted a warm little hand to
remain in his strong grip

  so they returned to the shore and the
moment they emerged from the bush
gurney came face to face with the stranger
and halted in open-mouthed astonishment
barbara stared in wonder as the two men
stood motionless regarding each other

   mr lynn gee  was gurneys greet-
ing but his face was alight with welcome
and he thrust out his hand

   glad to see you gurney lynn re-
plied hiding his feelings under his ultra-
official mask  i wondered whom i would
find down here how are conditions
thus much in greeting and no more
but barbara knew with a tiny feeling of
annoyance and gurney felt with an awk-
ward doubt as to the wisdom of resenting
the attitude of so great a man that lynn
was analyzing them both with the coldness
of a scientist

chapter xxx

a surprise for jim gurney

barbara first broke the tension sud-
denly she remembered that her old
brown dress was no fitting attire in
which to greet her knight she turned and


all-story weekly

sped along toward home without a word
leaving both men smiling at her impulsive
haste

  gurney and lynn left alone had much
to convey to each other and the first thing
jim wanted to know concerned lynns pres-
ence on tarani so unexpectedly

   my life is made up of such things
gurney lynn told him and the level
unemotional gaze of his cold blue eyes
bored into the gray eyes of gurney in a
manner scarcely attributable to business
alone  i go here there and everywhere
at orders checking up on the men i pick
out for my superior

   but you said you had no idea where
i was to be sent reminded jim

   xor had i i had no idea which of
the many men i selected i would find here
but im glad its you gurney-well for
more reasons than one how are things
going

  its a scream grinned jim relieved
to talk business and escape that inexorable
cold stare that in spite of her flight seemed
to embrace barbara as well as himself
 you have a smart nose mr lynn you
arrived just about in time to see the fire-
works

  he went on to outline what hail hap-
pened and wound up by mention of the
loot with which he had been presented

   by jove gurney theres something
queer about this lynn remarked seri-
ously  i must look at those things at
your convenience everything  have ever
heard concerning this woman is against her
handing anybody a fortune on a silver
platter

   that wasnt everything she handed
me gurney chuckled  gee i hate to
throw bouquets at myself but the lady fell
hard for my manly beauty and wanted to
slop all over me she thinks im going
back to her now

  lynn stared at jims merry careless face
showing no signs of hardships in spite of
his adventures on tarani and asked
curiously

   but what of her crew i understand
that you might make a hit with the woman
herself if you used your great experience
in that line -a hint of raillery crept into

his tone- but those men of hers are
no babies i have heard

   babies say lynn babies could lick
the whiskers off that bunch tough
yes to look at and hard cases when their
luck is in but once start to handle em
rough and theyre so easy im ashamed
of myself for hurting them honest

  lynn allowed mild surprise to temper his
cold exterior and replied with a shrug
 then i am certain they are fooling you
gurney i imagined that might be possible
beat you i dont believe they could but
it seems as if they have played a fine game
of fear with you for some deep reason of
that womans

  sure they have jim agreed cheerfully
 im not quite batty old fellow the
woman is playing with me now-and she
might better play with a volcano i know
well enough why she gave me that stuff i
know too that theres no fake about the
scare i threw into her huskies i can
handle em as i like and she knows it
but theres no doubt she wants somebody
to help her beat those pirates out of their
shares and shes picked me simply because
im too tough for them to hurt

   shes tried to cook me and carve me up
and drown me and i believe shes decided
it cant be done oh sure i know shes
planning a trick on me i knew it the mo-
ment i saw that she was faking a sprained
ankle she can walk as well as i can

   this is the way i figure it out if
i go back and agree to beat it with her
for parts unknown everything will be fine
and ill win a lady friend who would make
lucretia borgia look like a creche nurse
money to burn too if i keep my promise
to her and start in to clean up whether
shes still here or not does it occur to you
what use she can make of me having her
loot

   i admit it doesnt gurney your de-
ductions are ingenious though go on

   its easy she knows shed have one
high old time getting those bullies of hers
to start something with me again but if
she showed em her looted treasury and
told em  was the man who had their
plunder theyd fight beelzebub to get it
back see
the clean-up



   it sounds plausible lynn agreed
slowly then  but are you sure the
woman has not impressed you personally
he fixed jim with a piercing stare for be-
hind his official chill his human heart
burned with thoughts of barbara and the
thought reminded him that this reel-headed
merry-faced dreadnought was the lancelot
she all but worshiped

   afraid you might have made a mis-
deal in picking me eh jim grinned back
 you can ease your mind on that mr
lynn perhaps i am taking a little longer
about the job because the woman is what
she is but your job is under way and the
finish is in sight and it  be done accord-
ing to cocker and up to your re-
quirements

  a reminiscent smile swept over his
freckled face and there was whimsical
humor in his steel gray eyes as he con-
tinued you say she may have impressed
me say that dame could impress any
man on earth if she set out to you must
see her shes some eternal feminine by
hickey handsome as paint with a figure
that makes you think of-oh whats the
use

   three months ago jim gurney would
have jumped at the chance to kidnap that
venus and spend her money for her but
not now lynn though i admit she had me
going once or twice theres a darn sight
more in this clean-up for me than you
know of and as i told you when i took
the job if i fail you can say masses for
me thats still good

  gurneys light treatment of the matter
had changed toward the end to a serious-
ness of manner which carried conviction
to the briton and made him easier in his
mind than he had been since discovering
the identity of barbaras lancelot a
glance along the shore showed no sign of
barbaras reappearance and he suggested

   shall we go up the cliff and bring down
those papers safer down here dont you
think id like to see just who is the
culprit in this infernal mess a brewing be-
tween two friendly powers

  gurney led the way without hesitation
and started the climb with a running fire
of irresponsible chatter that went over

lynns head and brought no rejoinder
gurney cared nothing whether his sallies
were replied to or not he simply wanted
to talk for once and lynn too deeply im-
mersed in a problem of his own which had
nothing to do with pearls or papers cared
nothing whether his companion talked or
not

  they climbed with the sturdy precision
of healthy hard men and the journey was
quickly made but before he reached the
rock beneath which he had deposited the
wealth of a monarch gurney was conscious
of a sense of constraint emanating from
lynn and inevitably affecting himself he
stole a look at the briton grimaced aside
at the stern glint in the blue eyes and
wondered if he had been driven up to the
mountain top merely to listen to a calling
down for some unknown fault which could
not be discussed on the beach

  he lifted the rock in silence and stood
aside to let lynn examine the hoard mean-
while gazing at him in calculating wonder
his wonder increased when the briton
made no motion toward the treasure or
papers but suddenly faced him with a faint
but indubitable flush on his cheeks and a
fleeting none the less certain gleam of
awkwardness in his eyes it was al so
foreign to lynns character that gurney
waited in something near awe so serious
did he believe the coming subject would
prove

   gurney -lynn spoke haltingly not
at all in his customary decided terse man-
ner- gurney this is-er-well its con-
foundedly embarrassing y know i want
to-i have that is spent a couple of very
charming days in the company of goffs
daughter and i-er-think a great deal of
her y know-

  gurney grinned encouragingly  good
for you mr lynn he said honestly con-
gratulatory  shes a corking little pal
and i wouldnt think much of any man who
didnt care a whole lot for barbara after
knowing her a day or two i like her
pretty well myself

   like her pretty well echoed lynn
and glared at jim with the crimson flooding
his face and his eyes bright with amaze
 you like her--oh damn it gurney come


all-story weekly

out into the open dont spoof on such
a subject please

   gee whats the fuss gurney was
shaken out of his merry indifference now
for the cold briton seemed to blaze  i
aint spoofing dont you think i ought
to like the girl

  lynn regarded him speechlessly for a
full minute all his official veneer shattered
staring as at some queer creature unex-
pectedly unearthed by a plow his mouth
opened and shut opened again and uttered
stutteringly

   c-confound you-for a-bally ass
like her man alive-dont you know
she-she-oh damn it gurney the girl is
madly in love with you you idiot she
says she is dedicated to you-i truly be-
lieve she must say her prayers to you-
and-she calls-you-lancelot her pcrjcct
knight he finished with a rush

  it was gurneys turn to stare his eyes
met and held lynns for a breath then the
mountain resounded with a peal of laughter
so spontaneous so utterly derisive that
lynn was forced back to his normal con-
dition by the very shock of it

   in love with me me jim derided
 gee mr lynn shes a little spoofer her-
self say shes the best little chum ive
ever known and better than any man in
the water or a boat but as for love-oh
pickles shes only a kid yet and be-
sides ive got no time for playing sweet-
hearts just now

    forget it lynn i shall be ashamed
to meet barbara after this its as much
a scream as mme miriam joberts
amorous inclinations lets take this stuff
and go down we can leave it at goffs
house and you can see for yourself how
darned silly your ideas are when i tease
barbara 

  they returned to the shore and even
gurney was silent lynn wore an expres-
sion not entirely official nor yet so unoffi-
cial as previously but rather the expression
of a man coming out of despair into rising
hopes his keen mind was busy and he
marshaled every fact that had come to
his notice with reference to barbara and
gurney and the more he considered the
brighter grew the gleam in his eyes until

when they entered the traders house and
were greeted by barbara in her especial
splendor he glowed warmly with the hope
that he might now prosecute his suit un-
hindered by rivalry

  he watched the girl narrowly as she came
forward and his hopes sank several de-
grees for now that she was arrayed for
lancelot himself her greeting was reserved
and ladylike as the greeting of lancelots
lady should be her eyes were dusky soft
her lips parted in ripe buds a delicate
blush tinged her pretty face and neck
and she extended her hand to jim as if
meeting him for the first time since his
departure

  lynn scanned gurneys face in search of
reinforcements for his hopes but now he
saw a change vague but still a change in
the devil-may-care red-heads expression
and the change took place while he stared
for jim at first sight gave barbara his
old merry grin of welcome rendered the
more humorous by reason of what lynn
had so recently told him but the moment
his eyes fell fairly on the dainty picture
she made they softened and darkened until
they matched her own over his freckled
impudent face stole a doubt which bade
fair to cause the doubter considerable
worry

  he seized the chance of a talk with
goff leaving lynn in company with bar-
bara to that young ladys dismay but he
found little to talk about even goff re-
marked on his absence of mind and jim
disgusted the trader into leaving him by
murmuring vacantly

   darn it she aint got points to her
elbows theyre round as her pretty
neck

  goff went in and told lynn that gurney
was smitten with the woman of the
mountain

chapter xxxi

goff speaks

barbara had become more of a wo-
man than she knew glad as she
was to be near gurney delighted to
have her lancelot return to her safely his
the clean-up



neglect of her brought a pout to her charm-
ing face a gleam of annoyance to her elo-
quent eyes and lynn reaped the benefit to
a gratifying degree for the girl outwardly
warmed to him to show her indifference
toward gurney and still attired in her
splendid great occasion finery made him
supremely happy by spending a bright
chatty hour in his company

  jim sought out goff again and talked
with him for a few minutes at the end of
which the traders bored face showed a
trace of surprise and the surprise in turn
changed into a brief smile with a nod of
acceptance there was a hand-shake
which caused goff to gesture protestingly
as if unnecessary then jim started off to-
ward his shack to prepare for his promised
smoking-out trip to miriams hornet nest
and thirty seconds after he started light
flying footsteps behind him brought him
about to face barbara bright-eyed flushed
eager

  this meeting was unlike any other be-
tween them jims grin was a pitiful fail-
ure barbara blushed crimson and her
head drooped in confusion speech failed
too all the good-fellowship that had grown
up with them seemed to have vanished
the girls rosy lips were parted as if to
speak she raised her head to look at him
then lowered her eyes again while her
small brown hands clenched and un-
clenched nervously her satin-shod foot
tapped and tapped in the sand gurney
choked on his words but after a struggle
managed to say

   anything the matter barbara does
your father want me

   father why should he want you
she stammered but now she could meet
his eyes and her rounded chin grew de-
termined he sensed remotely that she was
on the verge of an outburst such as he had
been used to laugh at in her now he did
not feel like laughing though he couldnt
imagine why somehow he felt utterly un-
able to rally his control muscles he had
no desire to meet her obviously growing
irritation with jest she shocked him into
some semblance of coolness by saying
sharply 

   there is nothing the matter i mis-

took you for some one else thats all
she turned and began to speed homeward
and his speech came back

  barbara he called after her she
stopped half turned again and looked
back at him with yearning in her eyes
slowly she walked to him and the smile
which played about her sweet face was
full of an infinite tenderness

  in her white dress and old lace she was
as a bride about to meet her groom and
the sight of her sent surging back to gur-
ney all the awkwardness and chokiness of
speech of a moment before he took her
hand tried to speak to her and failed
miserably

  savage with himself he attempted to fall
back on his old resources of raillery but
it was hopeless he could only repeat her
name softly reverently

   barbara

   jim she whispered in reply and both
relapsed into silence but as if by pre-
arrangement they started to walk along
the shore toward gurneys shack and as
they skirted the murmuring surf with its
music thrumming in their souls neither no-
ticed that words did not pass neither
spoke they walked together in a world of
melody content speech was a non-essen-
tial soul whispered to soul and the rest
was beyond their control

 almost at gurneys door barbara
stopped and gazed long and earnestly into
his face he met her gaze abashed by
the sheer pure immaculateness of the
spirit that shone in her eyes and his freck-
led face turned red as fire he was over-
whelmed with confusion and a fleeting
color sped across her own face at sight of
his but she recovered quickly and plac-
ing her right hand in his said simply

   i must go home now jim come to
me before you go away again if you can-
not good luck yes i understand where
you are going perfectly

  she was gone and jim stood staring
after her in a daze then he went inside
the house and began his preparations for
his trip he laid out a jacket hitherto
dispensed with and stitched cartridge-hold-
ers to it by simply running thread in par-
allel lines down the pockets cleaned his


all-story weekly

own pair of pistols and gave a look to the
weapon taken from miriam

  he smiled appreciatively to find that
this was no womans toy but a capable
murderous gun of heavy caliber and short
barrel short of range perhaps but of tre-
mendous smashing power it was a mans
gun and by great good luck his own shells
fitted it

  his armament complete he ate his early
supper sitting outside the hut and as he
ate his mind went irresistibly back along
the beach flashed thence across the moun-
tain and speedily became a muddle of con-
fused thoughts

   of the two jim gurney theres only
one you are fit to touch he mused  a
never-do-well roustabout like youve been
has no right to play with a clean pure lit-
tle lady like barbara the other-sure
jim shes your sort the kind youve al-
ways played with of your own kidney-a
regular seaport queen with no morals to
corrupt and no heart to break

   and then what can i give barbara
even if she wanted to glue to me noth-
ing yet and if i make a flivver of this
job ill never have anything the other
suppose i take her up help her to cheat
her mob and beat it with the boodle lynn
will have a clear course with barbara and
hes the sort for her hes a gentleman
who will treat a lady as such gee i
dunno

  he sat there for an hour his eyes fixed
in an unseeing glare on the wide ocean
his firm stubborn chin set in lines of bat-
tle and there came a spark of inspiration
which set on fire all the tremendous cour-
age in him he started to his feet and
paced the sand muttering fiercely

    flivver my gosh jim whats bit-
ing you to even think of it you cant
and talk of beating it with that brimstone-
blooded she-devil

  he walked on and on carried on the
tide of reflections until he was submerged
in the wave of new emotions that had been
stirred into life in the last hour by barbara
herself

  and back at the traders house barbara
was also the subject of warm regard she

had left lynn abruptly to follow jim and
the briton concealed his chagrin under his
icy official calm but when he saw the girl
turn to come back ablaze with resentment
at something his heart leaped with elation
and he was very ready to receive her and
demand no explanation of her swift deser-
tion of him then she turned once more
obviously at gurneys call and lynn bit
on his lip when she ran to the red-headed
one on winged feet

  confound the chap the briton mut-
tered his handsome face dark for a mo-
ment  such is the luck of fools and
the girl innocent and very worldly unwise
is putty in that idiots hands its not
right by jove

  he went off immediately and sought out
the trader goff was busy in some prepa-
rations himself and for once was lacking
the air of utter boredom that characterized
him he looked up without welcome at
lynns entrance and the briton plunged
straight into the subject next his heart
blundered hopelessly forward as is the way
of his race without preparation urged by
his desires fearless of consequences direct
at his mark

   i say goff i must speak to you about
barbara

  the traders eyes glittered and he
seemed to freeze at lynns brusk tone ap-
plied to his daughter llis eyes seemed to
say  have a care  his face remained
averted lynn stumbled on

   i-er-i-oh hang it goff dont you
see that i love her say something cant
you

   what shall i say returned goff
staring at lynn with mild curiosity
 shall i say  hear hear or  encore or
something what is there to say

   oh damn it pardon me old chap
lynn apologized and pulled himself sharp-
ly together  i love your daughter and
desire nothing in life except to make her
my wife

  he paused and goff expected to make
some response said indifferently  if you
can do that i shall be glad to have you
for a son-in-law lynn i have no objec-
tion barbara has fine stuff in her-splen-
did blood-from her mother y know
the clean-up



lynn not from me-and she wont make a
mistake shes her mother all over again
and her mother was peerless among wo-
men

  as he touched on the subject of his
dead wife the tired apparently aimless
trader of tarani seemed to fill out with
bounding blood his bored voice held a
thrill the fires of a smothered passion that
had been infinite awakened into life and
he concluded in a murmur of reverence

  lynn was touched he knew had al-
ways felt that he could not be mistaken in
barbara goff the girl radiated the in-
tangible yet inescapable evidences of the
thoroughbred her every action and ges-
ture spoke of an inherent influence that
was proof against the insidious advances
of island relaxation which rarely failed to
eradicate all traces of culture in a genera-
tion

  the reflection only made him the more
eager to prosecute his suit and his eager-
ness was chilled at thought of that silent
couple far along the shore he plunged
ahead again feeling a slight bitterness to-
ward gurney that perhaps caused him to
overstep the limits of strict sportsmanship
in his speech

   thanks goff he said quietly  i
wanted your sanction of course and i
am gratified to hear my opinion of bar-
bara indorsed by you but-er-well y
know goff the fact is i am sort of second
fiddle with barbara deucedly annoying
to speak of a chap in this way but really

i	dont believe you know the relations ex-
isting between barbara and that gurney
fellow

   there is very little i dont know if i
desire to know it

  the traders retort caused lynn to gape
for it was made without heat without a
movement of the head coolly and with no
cessation of the work of preparation going-
forward

   and you dont mind stammered the
briton amazed

   no why should i my girl is suf-
ficient unto herself i am pretty much of
a useless article but she-lynn that girl s
own truth and purity of soul are her best
safeguards implanted in her by her

mother is an instinct which cannot fail
her

   but my dear chap -lynn seemed
unable to shake off his amazement and to
recover his own usual poise- can it be
possible that you know anything of this
man gurney

   well

   oh i say its hardly decent you
know but  cannot see barbara trusting
blindly to instinct when my knowledge of
the chap tells me her instinct may be wo-
fullv wrong d you know-

  he went on to sketch gurneys history
to the trader touching lightly on non-essen-
tials bringing into high lights the salient
points of his past exploits goff listened
absently he scarcely gave a sign of hav-
ing heard a word until lynn remarked
upon the peril of barbara becoming too in-
timate with such a man as gurney

   that will do lynn goff remarked
then and something in his eyes warned
that enough had been said  gurney may
have been all you say if you know so
much of his history the chances are that
he has been even a hotter customer than
you think it makes no difference bar-
bara is judge enough for me

    have reared her on this island sel-
fishly perhaps but to the best of my abil-
ity and she has blossomed into the fairest
flower old ocean ever begot from mother
nature in every feature of her in every
line of grace that marks her movements
her mother peeps out with her mothers
love and mothers wisdom shedding their
protection about her she is a maiden
who is also a virgin in heart and the man
who kindles the spark of love in barbaras
breast will be the man of men to her for-
ever

  that man will be more than my
daughters husband to me lynn i care
nothing who he is or what the childs
instinct will take care of his worth after
that  ask nothing of him it will be fu-
tile for her choice will not fall on a bad
man or a weak man or in any way an
unworthy man

   court her if you wish lynn but dont
speak again of gurneys past i see noth-
ing in him or in you but a man of the

present barbara will not make a mis- he walked for a mile through the lush
take i shall as gladly accept you as her undergrowth until the dimness of the
husband as anybody but if it be gurney glades warned him of departing daylight
he will lack nothing of welcome either then with his spirit soothed by the lone-
the trader turned abruptly to his labors some walk full of the murmuring hush of
and lynn left him feeling that no more evening thrilled by a great hope which
remained to be said he strode off above arising since quitting goff brought back to
the beach seeking solitude in the belt of his strong face the beauty which was its
jungle and avoiding letting his glance right he turned and approached gurneys

illusion

by neeta marquis

                       the girl beside me in the car

                             wore yellow flowers against her breast-

chrysanthemums like woven gold

that breathed a subtle pungent zest

the tang of rain was in the air

tristful with winters gray advance

blent with those oriental flowers

                           it stirred vague dreams of old romance

who was it sitting by me there

a languid princess of cathay

gold-broidered were the heavy flowers
which on her silken bosom lay

                          the fingers in her silken lap

were ivory-smooth their tinted tips
touched with the perfumed carmine stain
that warmed the oval of her lips

an eastern olive tinged her cheeks

while all the -poetry of skies

                         shot through with unknown fiery stars

                          made up the wonder of her eyes

aloof mysterious she leaned-

her jet hair dressed with fragrant gums-

                         from her pavilion set within

                         a pleasaunce of chrysanthemums

how strange they smelt-those dim gold flowers
that breathed the sou of old cathay-

                         a wizard-scent transforming thus
                         a street-car on a rainy day
 science is certainly a cold and cruel thing-the original illusion-locust that de-
 vours whole all our fondest fancies most pleasing dreams and gives us in their
 place-itself-an emotionless composition of frigid facts even the most sacred
 passion of the human heart-love-is not immune from investigation classification
 and laboratory experiment cupid is metamorphosed to a-germ a sort of strepto-
 coccus or streptoneura or other anisopleural gastropod the beautiful son of venus
 becomes a common or garden bacterium that placed on a glass slide and magnified
 one thousand diameters looks like a denizen of mr abe merritts moon pool that
 at least is what science-or to be just let us say a certain type of scientist-would
 like to do but can they opinions will probably differ but the answer from one
 view-point is made very clear in our novelette for next week-

one honest tear

                       by robert shannon

      professor bennett richard bogel believed that he had solved the problem of love
 that he could control it as absolutely as a chauffeur controls a car and his beautiful
 and highly cultured fiancee believed it too not only that but so great was her faith
 -in both her lover and his science-that when her skeptical brother offered to bet on
 it and suggested lorette logan the fascinating cjueen of the frivolities and the high-
 est-paid show-girl on broadway as a subject she willingly agreed so the professor
 got out his perfume of eros and then- well that is the story and though it is pure
 humor all through there is a very substantial proportion of solid meat and serious
 philosophy as well do not miss it next week

                                      j

there is a mystifying little man of the east
that many a reader- of the ali-story
weekly regards as a real friend-a quaint out-
of-the-ordinary very human chap who achieves
miraculous results by means startling in their
simplicity in a word swami ram making his
bow to our readers in  into the fourth dimen-
sion published in the cavalier magazine of janu-
ary ii iq this astonishing oriental has enter-
tained our readers at intervals since then his last
appearance being in new jinns for old pub-
lished in the all-story weekly for december 

 so friends of swami ram-and every one
else who likes fiction with dulness left out-will be

 eager to read the four-part serial that starts in
 next weeks issue-

the pagan

by frank blighton

author of the invisible burfrlar  black crosies

 mr north of nowhere etc

 in this swift startling tale swami ram reaches
 the zenith of his achievements of mystery but
 he isnt the only interesting character who plays a
 part in the story and there is an involved coil
 of circumstance a fascinating web of plot and
 counterplot that keeps you guessing from start to




all-story weekly

finish the pagan is the sort of tale that
read on a railroad train makes you ride past
your station or if you happen to be one of the
sex concerned with such matters makes you for-
get all about the high cost of living and let the
roast burn in the oven and just one more warn-
ing-dont start to read it late at night if your
electric bills have been running high youll
never stop until you have devoured every word of
the instalment

  in spite of the learned professors and their
books human psychology still remains the great
enigma one can fairly deduce from the academic
findings on the subject just how a man ought to
act in given circumstances but only machines
fulfil infallibly scientific deductions and even ma-
chines are sometimes intractable how a man re-
acts to and is finally conquered by the very emo-
tion which he had apparently completely mastered
forms the theme of a characteristic max brand
story in next weeks magazine entitled  the
fear of morgan the fearless this is
a tense study of a western bandit who defied the
law and the whole countryside only to fall a vic-
tim to suggestion this story lives up to the brand
standard and will satisfy the legitimate expecta-
tions aroused by this writers work watch for it
next week

i	j	j

  ethel and james dorrance whose serials
have won for them a wide and deservedly fine
reputation among all-story weekly readers
contribute to next weeks magazine a delightful
tale of mixed emotions called  voices in the
dark it is a sparkling lovers  comedy of
errors which promises to sweep the contestants
into the deep waters of tragedy but things heard
and not seen give way before a face to face en-
counter with the agents of the mischief we
cant pause to outline the story but we can prom-
ise you some delightful diversion in this pregnant
instance of human misunderstanding

    jx	

  we cannot speak for other sections of the
country but we know it is an ever-pressing do-
mestic as well as economic problem here in the
east to find a house or a home we are all look-
ing for a modern moses who will lead us out of
the wilderness of rented rooms into the promised
land of homes and gardens we had almost hit
upon the solution so we thought which was to
make us rich and our fellow flat-dwellers happy
when we came to the blasting of our dream in
 gipsy cottage a story by elliott flower
in next weeks magazine we thought we had
found the very thing to turn the trick and then
we discovered this very engaging talc was an em-
phatic and experimental protest against the very
panacea we were about to share with the world
read this story and see from what a sad fate
flower saved you

  a night shift by atreus von schrader
is a human-interest story with a race-horse atmos-
phere and a dramatic situation which combine to
make an exceptionally gripping little tale you
dont need to know racing or be a judge of horse-
flesh to follow this story if you are human the
tale will drive home and all unconsciously you
will find you are enjoying the victory of butterfly
as much as her owners read it in next weeks

doesnt like different stories

to the editor

  yes the editors job is some job and what i
write wont help much but i want to say a word
on the  other side i suppose you hear mostly
the gushy things as the others i suppose dont
write as i seldom do myself i read the all-
story weekly and expect to even if it does con-
tain many stories i cannot read i know it takes
all kinds to fit all kinds of people i suppose we
will always wonder at the taste of others that is
part of our egotism

  i like most stories of adventure in business or
the detective stories e k means or most any
of the well-written stories-except-these  dif-
ferent  stories at them i wonder the foolish
childishness of them never ceases to amaze me-
that grown men and women read and enjoy these
things it does not take a novelist of note to
write these  pipe dreams these  foolish-imag-
ination-run-riot  stories it does take a writer to
write an interesting story of a possible happening
my family of live will not read them except when
out of other reading matter-just to see the folly
and to wonder the girl in the golden atom 
--i dont wish to say whats in my mind

  now i know that neither i nor mine are bril-
liant  we do not claim to be but here are six
that never tried to influence any other for or
against these stories i take some of the best
magazines and papers and want to say that a
writer that has to write unreasonable impossible
things or travel into the future to find a plot or
a situation on which to build his story had better
do something else i read for rest enjoyment or
to pass away time of course i dont have to
read what i dont like and there are evidently
some who like these  different  stories but
thought you maybe did not get letters knocking
on anything-though i suppose the knocker is
always with us i like most of the authors and
i dont expect other people to see with my eyes
no of all things on earth i would not be an
editor you have my sympathy

the battle in the air

  we have received a letter from mr john
martin leahy of seattle washington in which
mr homer eon flint author of  the lord of
heart to heart talks



death is sternly called to account for certain
discrepancies variations of facts and alleged
astronomical inaccuracies in that story which
same have caused mr leahy such deep pain and
mental anguish that he has proceeded to smite
mr flint hip and thigh as follows

to the editor

  in the story  the lord of death there ap-
pears on page  the following remarkable sen-
tence spoken by the doctor who is supposed to
be a very wise gink

  even if he mercuryi is such a little planet-
less than three thousand smaller than the moon-
he must have had plenty of air and water at one
time the same as the earth

   smaller than the moon this is astronomy
with a vengeance i for one would like to know
where in the world the doctor-that is professor
flint-studied that most fascinating science

  in the first place the planet mercury is not less
than three thousand miles in diameter but a little
over and in the second place the diameter of
our satellite is only  miles since as any
schoolboy who knows his astronomy will tell
you the volumes of globes vary as the cubes of
their diameters it would require roughly three
globes the she of our moon to make a mercury

  such ignorance and there is moie of it even
on this same page in question is not only inex-
cusable-it is disgusting if a writer cant get at
least a schoolboys mastery of his subject-well
he ought to write about something else

  not that one expects a fictionist when he
launches out into the deeps of space to be a
proctor or a lowell that is not the point at all
but one does expect him to know that there is
such a thing as a text-book on the science of
astronomy	truly yours

john martin leahy

  seattle washington

  being a mere editor and expert in stars of
various magnitude that twinkle or gleam in the
literary firmament only with but a laymans
casual knowledge of the- sidereal occupants oj
outer space we promptly passed the buck-and
the letter-on to mr flint who as promptly
girded on his arms and with trenchant typewriter
in hand proceeded to the fray thus

to the editor

  i am absolutely astonished more i am hor-
ribly hurt my pride lies shattered on the floor
while my ego positively aches all over hereafter
life is but an empty empty shell with no re-
loading tools handy

  why because mr leahy has dared to ques-
tion the accuracy of my statements i whose
reputation for veracity can be computed only
with the aid of logarithms i who always be-
lieved everything i read in the papers whose life
is run on a split-second schedule and whose meals

are measured with a micrometer i i am
doubted oh gosh this is dreadful

  let us glance at his objection he mentions
text-books text-books forsooth does any one
imagine that i need rely upon miserable books
i to whom the heavens are as familiar as the
wart on my nose i who get all my facts at
first hand who personally surveyed the moon
with a two-foot rule and have just returned from
a little trip to the center of the sun where i dis-
covered that his great heat is due to the presence
there of  highly indignant scholars like
mr leahy does anybody expect me to confine
my vast knowledge to the limits of a measly text-
book huh

  moreover it appears that even mr leahy dis-
agrees with the book the  edition of youngs
 lessons in astronomy  is at my hand and in
plain black and white on page  it states that
the moons diameter is  miles half a mile
smaller than mr leahy claims it to be yah
yah yah

  such ignorance is not only inexcusable-r-it is
disgusting until mr leahy explains why he has
failed to mention this frightfully important half-
mile i shall maintain a dignified silence as to my
own alleged blunder however  may point out
that it is often just such errata which lead people
to study the subject for themselves and if what
i have done produces any such effect then it will
have accomplished something greatly desired i
am sure by mr leahy as well as by
yours infallibly

copy for several years i do not sec many letters
from canada and i wonder at it as i know
many who feel toward your authors as i do i
have very many favorites but i have a few who
are  in a class by themselves as it were max
brand jackson gregory edgar rice burroughs
james b hendryx and j u giesy are some of
them i have not subscribed because i have al-
ways bought from an old dealer near home and
they have been faithful to me but i would not
be without my magazines for a deal of trouble
wishing all success

 toronto canada	miss j brown

  may i anc everybody else have a sequel to
 the untamed  please ask max br- -id why
he ended that story so everlastingly sad i de-
mand a sequel tell the writer of  misery man-
sions that he cant be beat give us another
like it please only not quite so sad some of
the serials i like are the untamed the
moon pool  twenty-six clues  the crimson
alibi oh and the lions jaws-thats per-

fectly splendid you may think it funny when
you hear im only a small girl ten years of age
although im not very small but tall the
all-story weekly is a fine magazine we all
enjoy it very much shall i ever see this in the
all-story weekly

miss pearl haselhuhn

  springfield massachusetts

  we wanted to tell you-my sister and i-that
we have been reading the all-story weekly
since  and can truthfully say we enjoy it
more than any other magazine we have ever read
in our case it seems to be  two minds with but
a single thought  the all-story weekly is the
best ever a merritt  our favorite author and
his  moon pool  stories wqre wonderful please
do not change the all-story weekly in any re-
spect for it could not be improved hoping to
see this in the heart to heart talks as this is
our first attempt we are

misses florence and lucille croswell

  loveland colorado

  enclosed you will find personal check for two
dollars for six months subscription to the all-
story weekly we think it the best ever i
certainly do enjoy reading it and can hardly wait
for the future issues trusting this check will not
cause any delay as it was impossible for me to
obtain a money order at this writing as we are
so far from town i would like to have my sub-
scription begin with the may  issue my hus-
band laughed until he cried when he read  the
fraid cat and i enjoyed it so much here is
hoping there will be another one like it soon

  your story in march  of the mind ma-
chine  reminds me of a yarn told by a chinaman
called  china tom in helena montana in the
os he was a well-known character of great
intelligence and he may still be alive he often
told the story of the history of china having
thousands of years ago had electric cars flying
machines and all kinds of labor-saving devices
even greater than the present age everything
was even more advanced than the present times
so much so that no one was required to work
that the effect morally was so bad that the em-
peror was obliged to destroy it all he claimed
this tradition had been handed down from gener-
ation to generation

one of your readers

weekly for so many years that i have lost count
