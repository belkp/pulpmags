foghorn clancy

americas most famous rodeo expert and handicapper

hi waddies here we are with our
cayuses all saddled and ready for
another trail ride and more trail
talk once again we will ride ovsr parts of
the once dim and romantic trails of the old
west and as we ride we will recall some
of the many thrilling events that took place
along those trails events without which
there might never have been a west as it is
today at least not people with thousands
and even millions of prosperous happy and
law-abiding citizens

  the trails over which we will ride or at
least a part of them were once rough trails
not only rough but dangerous trails where
the six-gun was the law and where every
man was a law unto himself

  it was up to the individual to take care of
himself he had to sense the approach of
danger and be ready to meet it and most
men felt when they carried a well oiled six-
gun or pe-haps a couple of them with a
rifle for longer range shooting they were
equipped and ready to mt most any emer-
gency that might arice

they werent afraid

  one would imagine that under the com-
tions that existed in many parts of the west
in the early days that the citizens would be
living in constant fear that any man would
be afraid to ride through the rough country
alone but they were not

  they were sometimes a little fearful of
being ambushed or of being set upon by a
band of indians where the numbers would
be more than they could hope to cope with
but as a rule they were unafraid simply
cautious they watched for signs of danger
and rode serenely on

  one man who won much of his reputation
by riding alone was pete kitchen a pioneer
arizona cattleman many stories have been
told of his alertness marksmanship and
cool courage

 he was never caught napping he was as
ready with his gun as he was sure of his
mark the indians were never abvj to
ambush him grim experience had taught
him to be careful to watch for indian sign
and not only to look ahead while riding
through the country but to take note of any-
thing and everything to either side of the
road or trail

 he never traveled the same road twice
within a short space of time if he went
to a certain place by one road or trail he was
apt to return by another

a wary plainsman

 there is a story that has been hand d
down and which is said to be true that
gives an idea of just how vary this pioneer
plainsman was it is said that one day while
riding along a trail through greasewocd
cactus and mesquite all hough it was a warm
day when most horsemen on a trip of a good
many miles might have tv en dazing in the
saddle pete was wide awake and had his
double-bavrelled shotgun hiown across the
bow of his saddle

  he might at a casual glance have seemed
oblivious to what was going on in that sec-
tion but he was far from it his keen gaze
detected a jight stirring of t bushes in
front of him a little way to the right

the sixth sense

  that sixth sense of danger that he always
seemed to possess must have been with him
on that ride but he gave no outward sign
thai he had observed anything unusual

  swinging his gun very quietly into posi-
tion for quick use he rode steadily on to-
ward the bush just before he reached it a
man leaped suddenly into view with his
revolver drawn and called throw up
your hands

instantly with both barrels of his gun

cocked pete covered the fellow and said
throw up your hands the man dropped
his weapon to the ground and threw up his
hands and yelled

  dont shoot pete i wasnt going to
kill you i was only going to rob you

  just what i was going to do to you
said pete shell out

  the fellow did so but the amount of
money produced was only thirty-five cents
pete threw him back a quarter and told
him to clear out of the country and the
fellow must have taken the warning as he
was never seen by kitchen again

another arizona pioneer

  there was another character who was
wont to travel alone over dangerous trails
and country a kind of lone wolf of the
west he too was an arizona pioneera
trapper and hunter he was old bill
williams a half mythical half mysterious
character of those early dangerous days of
arizona when the apaches held sway and
all but drove the white settlers from the
country

  no one seems to know where he came from
or just when he departed this life but he
did enough so that there is a mountain a
town and a river fork named for him

  no apache could follow a trail like old
bill williams the cleverest indians at track-
ing the palefaces could not follow his trail
he was at home in the woods in the moun-
tains or on the prairie

an expert strategist

  he was a great shot and a strategist

below the pecos ridge a foil valley becomes a shambles when
two outfits wage a desperate feud-until wayne morgan
rides into action to make peace with grim gun logic

chapter i

war at rifle rock

ust outside of town two riders
pulled up after a brief con-
sultation one of them an
indian nodded and rode off
headed for the distant peaks
leading the extra horses the
other a cowboy waited a few
moments then urged his roan
forward with a soft drawled
word he rode easily supple
body swaying to the movement of the horse
mild blue eyes looking ahead to the town

  apparently there was only a single street
with a few houses straggling out to either
side the street was dusty and rutted and
strangely empty the cowboy saw two
groups of horses hitched before two saloons
which were far apart a single buckboard
waited in front of the general store he saw
no other signs of life

  his mild eyes narrowed a trifle and a
steely glint came into them something was
about to explode in rifle rock that was sure

  he passed the little white church his swift
glance missing nothing there he had a
glimpse of a tall young cowboy talking to a
girl she was beautiful dark-haired dark-
eyed the two stood so that they could not

the masked rider exposes a passel of

be seen from the street the strangers wide
enerous lips held the shadow of a smile
ut that disappeared as he once more felt
the tension in the town

  he ambled on up the street passed the
first saloon and pulled in to the rack of the
second he swung out of saddle and his
eyes swept over the brands on the horses
tethered nearby

  most of them wore an m bar c but there
was a smattering of other brands some of
them vented

  the cowboy took the hat from his thick
black slightly curly hair and beat the dust
from his levis with the hat he shifted his
crossed gun-belts from which depended
twin sixes then turned and walked up the
steps and on to the porch of the winchester
saloon

  pushing through the batwings he stood
just inside blinking a little blinded by the
sudden transition from bright sunshine to
cool shadows gradually the room came into
focus

  there was a long bar lined by men who
had turned and faced him at the near end
a tall gaunt man with gray hair stood
with a shot glass in his hands next to him
was a smaller young man with a dark
scowl on his pinched face

most of the rest of the saloons cus-
tomers seemed to be cowboys in from
the range though the new arrival instantly
recognized the breed of others who sat at the
tables across the room the mark showed in
their gaunted wolfish faces the thin lips and
hard narrowed eyes he did not have to see
the low-tied holsters to recognize those men
as gun-slammers

  howdy pilgrim the man behind the
bar said to him jovially i reckon yuh want
somethin to cut the dust huh

  thats right

  the stranger walked to the bar spurs
jingling two men made way for him and
the bartender swiftly filled a shot glass and
sat it before him

  ride far the barkeep asked

  some the strange cowboy admitted

  a glance at the har mirror showed that
the gunhawks at the table were watching
him narrowlv then he saw the old man at
the end of the tar push his glass away and
pull his hat lower over his wrinkled tanned
face

  better be a-ridin limp the old fellow
suggested to his companion ill find rita
and well slope for home

 the younger man nodded and dropped
some silver dollars on the counter the cow-
boys at the bar hastily downed their drinks
and pushed through the batwings after

the old man the gunhawks the barkeep
and the newly arrived rider remained quiet
and unmoving

  few strangers come to rifle rock ami-
go the barkeep remarked in a friendly
tone aint nothin much to call em here

  well me this stranger remarked light-
ly im just a wandering waddy stopped
by because i reckoned there might be a job
down this way the handles wayne mor-
gan

 glad to know yuh morgan im king
gardner own the saloon here the bar-
tender-owner frowned and rubbed his fin-
ger-tips along the black line of mustache
above his thin bloodless upper lip reckon
yuh come to a mighty poor place for a job
cowboy

  aint there no spreads hereabouts mor-
gan asked surprised

  just two gardner answered

  he was a short thin man but morgan
had noticed the pantherlike movements that
spoke of flowing muscles beneath the white
shirt and flowered vest gardner had green
eyes flecked strangely with brown his face
was long and oval almost pale from lack
of sun

 his smile was wide and flashing but
morgan had noticed the shadow of cruelty
that lurked in the corner of the ups

  snake gardner called across to one of
the tables yuh know of any job in these
parts

  a red-headd giant with broad shoulders
lumbered to his feet he came to the bar his
narrowed gray eyes weighing morgan drop-
ping briefly to the twin sixes at the cowboys
slender hips his eyes traveled upward along
the lean muscled body the gray shirt the
tanned face

  morgan might have been called handsome
his jaw was lean and long and hard his
full lips seemed on the verge of smiling but
there was also the suggestion that they could
set in grim hard lines his eyes so mild
and blue were spaced well apart

  theres unhands to be hired and i reck-
on thats all snake finally answered and
spat into the sawdust he shifted his gun-
belt

  sounds like a trouble range morgan
frowned slightly

  the gent that just left here gordon
sighed is zack mccloud owner of the
m bar c the other spread is the diamond
h run by buck henry and his son them
two sprpads is right on the edge of smokin
one another

 why morgan demanded

  rustlins both blames the other mor-
gan yuhd best ride out of rifle valley and
forget a job around here
scheming land-grabbers who disrupt the range

 morgan nodded though the nod might
have meant anything in the mirror he
caught the quick signal of the man called
snake for a fleeting second gordons
lips set and his head jerked perceptibly
snake turned on his boot heel and walked
out the door the rest of the men started
drifting toward the porch

  nothing had been said but morgan felt
the tension growing king gardner talked
to him with only half attention for the sa-
loon mans green eyes were centered on the
street something was about to happen

the store and paused a moment in the door-
way to light a cigar

jsw y sheer luck morgan happened to
glance up the empty street just at the
instant a rifle cracked a flat sound like two
boards slapping together mccloud stiffened
and the cigar dropped out of his lips he
hinged at the waist like a puppet falling his
men stared at him for the moment too
stunned and paralyzed to move but none of
them except morgan had seen the wisp of
smoke behind the false front of a building

wayne morgan

morgan knew it as well as if he had been
told

  i reckon ill be ridin along he said
abruptly

  gardner turned sharply

  no hurry he said swiftly here have
a drink on tbe house

 no thanks morgan answered he
moved toward the door

  gardner took a step toward the end of the
bar as though he intended to stop morgan
he pulled up short eyes narrowing with a
sudden thought then moved toward the big
window and looked out on the street

 morgan saw the m bar c men gathered
around the buckboard out there the girl
he had seen beside the church came along
the street joined the group and climbed into
the buckboard zack mccloud came out of

down the street next to the other saloon the
gunsight

  the gunsights batwings flew open and
cowboys streamed onto the porch morgans
swift glance cut to the m bar c men the
girl sat frozen staring at the old man
sprawled on the walk the man named
limp suddenly spun around his hand
slapping down to his holster

  they killed him he bawled wipe out
them diamond h sons

  his six blurred up and he threw a slug
at the gunsight a cowboy there yelled in
pain and surprise

  morgan ducked back inside the winches-
ter as gunfire broke out with a deadly roar
gardner still stood by the window a strange
half-smile on his face that vanished as
morgan bulged in morgan paid no atten-


masked rider western



tion to him but ran for the back he jerked
open a door sped down a short hall then
jumped outside

  he cut sharply to the right from the
street the sound of the battle between the
spreads rose to a crescendo morgan tight-
lipped sped on heading for the gunsight
and the building just beyond where the am-
busher had lurked

  he was still some distance away when he
saw a man holding a rifle come sliding down
the pitch of the roof the man jumped from
the eaves hitting the sandy ground on
hands and knees morgans hands blurred
down to his holsters and his guns snaked out
he placed a warning shot close to the mans
head sand spurted and the bushwhackers
head jerked up

  morgan saw a red-stubbled face coarse
and brutal the thick lips were pulled down
at one comer by a scar that disappeared un-
der the heavy jaw-bone

  muddy eyes glittered venomously

  over the roar of the guns from the street
morgan did not hear the new six that joined
in the thunder from somewhere in back of
him he was not aware of it until his hat
sailed from his head and a second slug
sang hornet-like close to his ear

  he plowed to a halt whirled crouching
his guns glittering up he saw no one and
for a moment his jaw dropped then he
cut back toward the bushwhacker who had
dropped from the roof he saw the man dis-
appear around the corner of the building
morgan cut after him the eyes cold and
hard sixes gripped firmly but before he
could overtake his quarry the man had
reached the street and slipped around the
corner of the building

  morgan raced after him he didnt under-
stand any of the trouble that had broken
out but he did know that the stubble-beard-
ed gunslinger was the man who had downed
zack mccloud he whirled around the far
comer and he saw a blank store front dusty
windows and a closed door to which he
leaped it was locked

  a bullet smashed into the panels close to
his head and morgan ducked he whirled
around facing the street another bullet
cut close and morgan realized then that he
had drawn the fire from the men in the
gunsight

  the buckboard disappeared up the street
in a cloud of dust m bar c men kept up a
constant fire on the gunsight but they
worked their way down the far end of the
street intent on leaving town morgan did
not return the fire from the saloon but
ducked around the far comer of the build-
ing he had no quarrel with the diamond
h and could not understand why they had
fired on him at the moment any man with
guns in his fists was an enemy

  he shoved the sixes back in their holsters

and ran around to the back of the building
out in front the firing slackened then
stopped altogether approaching the win-
chester from the rear wayne morgan halt-
ed looked back to where he had first seen
the bushwhacker he rubbed his chin re-
flectively

 rifle valley promises to be plumb in-
terestin he was thinking two spreads
feudin with one another bushwhackers
hidin behind false fronts and a couple of
slugs that come at me from nowheres looked
like now why was someone plumb serious
in keepin me from nabbing that killer and
who tried to salivate me

  he stared speculatively at the closed rear
door of the winchester and thoughtfully
shook his head his wide lips set a little
grimly then he walked on into the saloon

  king gardner was still behind the bar
and the gunhawks were coming back into
the saloon

  morgan looked at all of them sharply
any one of them could have tried to get
him out back

  but morgan had one bit of satisfaction
he had not caught the ambusher but he
would know the man if he ever saw him
again

chapter ii

hangnoose party

n the gunsight buck henry
wiped his bald head and let
out his breath in a loud
whoosh of relief he was a
small man short and stubby
fierce blue eyes blazed at the
world from beneath grizzled
white brows his face was
round tanned the full cheeks
almost without a wrinkle
despite the fringe of white hair that tufted
just above his ears

  his gun-belt was looped under a round
paunch he shoved his gun in the holster
and turned from the shattered window

  theyve gone he said the shootins
over jed take the boys and hit the grit
for the ranch get there pronto

  his son to whom he spoke still held a colt
limply in his hand his steady eyes were
clouded and troubled he was tall and slen-
der but he had bucks round face and his
blue eyes a lock of thick brown hair
dropped rebelliously over his forehead and
he impatiently brushed it aside

  buck he said they figger we salivated
zack there was a deep note of pain and
trouble in his voice

  buck henrys lips tightened and he nod-
ded

  shore they figger like that but when
limp denton went plumb loco and started

	masked rider western

slingin lead there wasnt no time then to
walk out and say we didnt have anything to
do with it

  rita will hate us buck i was just talkin
to her- jed broke off short and cursed
whats the use id like to get the jasper
who shot mccloud

  i aim to boy buck blazed its the only
thing thatll keep the m bar c from gun-
smoke we got to get that man whoever
he is now you get the boys and ride to the
ranch no tellin when limp denton will
bring his boys back to the range

  jed shrugged and spoke a brief word to
the diamond h cowboys two of them were
wounded slightly but able to ride angered
by the attack they were for riding after the
m bar c but jed harshly ordered them to
saddle and hit for home they rode warily
out of rifle rock with jed at their head

  buck henry watched them go and sighed
with relief when they left town without
trouble he dropped some money on the bar
before the dazed proprietor

  thatll pay for the damage done here
gus he said i hope i can collect it from
the m bar c some time

  as he walked out and down the planked
sidewalk toward the distant sheriffs office
he was wondering where the lawman had
been during the brief fracas mort hatcher
it seemed was always sheriffmg somewhere
else when trouble broke

 buck henry hesitated before the win-
chester frowned at the batwings for a sec-
ond on sudden decision he walked inside

  king gardner smiled at him from the bar
a strange waddy stood by the window a
man with mild blue eyes and crossed guns
tied low henry spotted the red-headed
gunslammer snake bannon seated at a
table in the far corner henrys lip curled
a little but he walked directly to the bar
the strange cowboy half turned but said
nothing

 you saw the shootin king buck
henry demanded

  reckon there wasnt anybody in rifle
rock who didnt buck gardner replied
his smile left and lines of sorrow came into
his face zack wasnt the kind of gent who
deserved back-shootin buck your boys
shore went loco thfre

  henrys fist doubled up on the bar none
of my boys done it king he announced
flatly i was with the whole bunch in the
gunsight first thing we heard was a rifle
shot we rushed outside and limp denton
started slingin slugs at us naturally we
didnt stay to argue none

  king gardner didnt sav anything but his
silence showed his disbelief buck henry
aw that and his face flushed an angry red
snake bannon cleared his throat noisily and
rose from the table he advanced to the
bar one hand close to his colt his thick

lips were spread in an insulting smile

  we was all right here henry snake
said we could see every one of the m bar
c rannies right over there across the street
with the buckboard the shot came from
down yore way aint nobody we know but
diamond h that dont like mccloud

  buck henry spun around bristling snake
waited the leer still on his lips and his
fingers taloned slightly above his gun henry
caught the gesture and gained control of his
anger

 i dont savvy this whole deal he
snapped i know my boys is clear ill prove
it to yuh

  how snake asked arching his thick
brows

 i dont know yet-but i will henry
glared around the room and his eyes rested
suspiciously on the stranger where you
from he demanded

  yonderly the handles wayne morgan
ridin chuckline

  buck henrys eyes dropped to the low-
tied holsters and suspicion grew stronger
in his eyes

 gunslammer by the looks of yuh he
growled part of snake bannons crow
here

  yuhre readin the wrong sign amigo
morgan drawled i aint a gunslammer and
i aint with bannon if the mccloud thing
is in yore crew i was right in here when
the shootin happened

 then how come i saw yuh with drawn
gun next to the gunsight when the lead was
flyin henry demanded

  i was chasin the gent that shot mc-
cloud morgan answered flatly

k dead silence held the room and all
attention centered on morgan henry
didnt seem to feel the sudden tension he
looked angrily at morgan then snorted in
disgust and turned brusquely away

  i reckon yuh was bein a strange wad-
dy he said shortly gardner next time
denton or any of the m bar c boys is in
tell em the diamond h didnt salivate zack
i dont reckon theyll believe it but at least
theyll have heard my side

  ill tell em gardner answered he
pulled his eyes away from morgan managed
a thm smile at buck henry and shrugged

  tell em just the same henry snapped
and walked out

  distantly all attention centered back on
morgan gardner moved down the bar and
snake bannon came close morgan met their
harsh stares levelly a slight question in his
eyes

  did yuh see the gent that shot at zack
bannon growled

  morgan took his time in answering he
saw that gardner held the bar cloth in a
tight grip the gunhawks edged closer
raiders of

forming a careful ring about him but no fear
showed in his face he grinned broadly and
spread his hands in a disarming gesture

  what else could i tell that proddy ban-
tam did yuh want me to say i was gun-
nin for diamond h

  just what was yuh doin bannon asked
suspiciously

  i started to hightail when trouble broke
aimin to get out of a fight that was none of
my business when lead is slung around
plumb careless-like who wouldnt have colts
in his fists now if yuh dont mind i reckon
ill ride out of town while its peaceful
gardner flashed a quick glance at bannon
and shook his head slightly the big red-
headed renegade sank back on his heels but
his face still mirrored scowling suspicions
morgan pushed by him and walked out the
door he swung into saddle and headed the
roan out of town going at a fast gait

 back inside the winchester gardner
scratched his head

  let him go he said to snake bannon
if he leaves town there aint no need to
worry about him

  in the meantime buck henry had crossed
to the sheriffs office mort hatcher sat at
his desk busy cleaning and oiling a gun he
looked up and his bloodless lips flattened
when he saw henry he placed the gun on
the desk top

  yuh shure ought to be proud of yoreself
henry he growled i ought to arrest the
whole diamond h lucky zack wasnt
killed

  thats the first good news ive heard
buck henry said with obvious relief then
his anger surged up

  hatcher towered a good foot above buck
he was a beefy man with huge arms and
legs with good features and a high-arched
nose and a crop of crisp dark hair he might
have been considered good-looking had it
not been for his muddy eyes which were
shifty now one cheek was rounded with
an enormous quid of tobacco the star
gleamed brightly on a dirty black vest that
covered an even dirtier shirt

  despite the mans size buck henry bristled
up like a bantam rooster

  get this straight mort and dont yuh
forget it no diamond h bullet got zack
now that sounds plumb likely hatcher
grunted disdainfully aint nobody else
thatd profit from his death the shot shore
came from the gunsight

  buck henry held himself stiff and taut
hatcher he repeated im tellin yuh we
didnt shoot zack

  then who did hatcher looked up mud-
dy eyes glinting the sneer on his thick
lips was plainer

  i-dont know it wasnt us

  hatchers hand slapped down on the desk
top

rifle rock	

  im waitin to see what happens to zack
he announced if he dies i reckon ill be
ridin out to the diamond h with a posse
mebbe by then yuh can brand this unknown
killer gent yuhd better-or every hombre
out therell wish he hadnt been born thats
all buck and yuh got a warnin

  buck henry stared speechlessly at the law-
man suddenly realizing in what a bad spot
zacks death would place the whole dia-
mond h he opened his mouth to speak
then snapped it shut without another word
he stamped out of the office and down the
street back toward the gunsight he mount-
ed his horse and neck-reined it around
headed for the diamond h

  he rode at a slow gait buried deep in
thought he hardly saw any part of the long
familiar trail for his thoughts milled cease-
lessly around the shooting of mccloud but
he got nowhere

  he had an impulse to turn back and tear
rifle rock apart searching for the man who
had done the ambushing but he had noth-
ing to go on no idea who the man might be
buck henry cursed deeply and fervently
and tried to dismiss the problem for the
moment

  he approached a deep cut in the road that
led westward through diamond h range to
the distant pecos ridge and the mines be-
yond the road narrowed here and the wide
canyon was brush-choked boulder-strewn

w ooking ahead he could see the wide
plain beyond the cut appearing almost
blood red in the setting sun already purple
haze had touched the distant pecos ridge
and soon would spill down into rifle valley
as the sun dipped lower beyond the granite
peaks henrys thoughts centered on the red
glow in the sky like blood he thought the
blood that might easily flow between the two
spreads

  grab some air hombre a rough voice
snapped

  henry jerked his head around he caught
the gleam of light from a rifle barrel shoved
through the bushes heard a crackling to his
right and left and realized that he was sur-
rounded his arms climbed slowly upward
and he stopped the horse by a pressure of his
knees

  now thats right neighborly the rough
voice said with heavy sarcasm pull his
fangs boys

  men appeared out of the brush each wore
a neckerchief over his mouth and nose and
had his hat pulled low buck henry recog-
nized none of them the cloth muffled the
voice of the man with the rifle yet there was
something vaguely familiar about it

  a masked man came close six-gun lev-
eled on henrys chest he gingerly emptied
the ranchers holster and stepped back

  he aint goin to bite no more he called
masked rider western



  the rest of the men worked out of the
brush circling in closer until they ringed
buck henry with menacing colts the rifle-
man a big man with broad hurling shoul-
ders and masked like the rest stepped clear

  what yuh want with me henry de-
manded in a level voice

  were payin a debt hombre the rifle-
man answered in a chilling tone yuh shot
zack so i reckon well stretch yore neck
at the end of a rope he snapped an order
to his men bring the hosses

  henry felt a cold chill finger his spine
but allowed none of his fear to show his
eyes sparked and his mouth set grimly

  some of the men disappeared back in the
brush fresh cracklings told of horses be-
ing led to the road buck henry watched
as the men swung into saddle at no time
did less than three colts cover him he
noted the coil of rope on the saddle of the
big masked man

  up the road a piece hombre the man
ordered buck we got a big old cottonwood
already picked out i dont reckon therell
be any more drygulchin after weve left
you as a warnin

  the rancher slowly lowered his hands the
masked riders closed in around him and
in silence they rode up the cut and came
out on the plain

  there buck henry saw the grove of trees
and the big cottonwood standing out from
the rest despite all he could do he felt his
throat constrict as though the burning
choking rope was already around it

chapter iii

trouble trail

ilently the masked band sur-
rounding the diamond h own-
er rode up to the big cotton-
wood and halted buck henry
face pale but set in firm un-
compromising lines waited
hoping for the smallest chance
to make his bid for freedom
but the men around him did
not give him any loop-hole
the big hulking leader led the ranchers
horse to a position under a stout limb he
picked up the coiled rope and swiftly started
forming a hangmans loop -the rest waited
in a deadly silence the man finally fin-
ished turned the rope over as though ex-
amining his handiwork he looked up

  i reckon yuh know why were doin
this he demanded

  i dont buck henry snapped

  yuh tried to kill zack mccloud or or-
dered the shootin done aint no decent
citizen goin to sit around on his hunkers
and let yuh get away with it

decent citizens buck henry sneered

yuhre a bunch of mangy polecats i had
nothin to do with the shootin of zack
there was a moment of silence then the
big man leaned out of the saddle and with
a quick flip of the wrist settled the noose
over henrys neck the rancher reached
for it but instantly two of the others grabbed
his arms and forced them behind his back
he felt the rope lash across and around his
wrists it was done quickly

  the big man adjusted the noose placing
the knot under henrys left ear then moved
back sitting his horse silent and grim

  i reckon yuh can say yore piece he said
grudgingly but make it fast and short
we dont aim to waste much time

  buck henrys eyes blazed at him but he
said no word he made no struggle to free
his hands he sat straight and stiff like a
courageous man

  the masked man waited a moment then
shrugged he lifted his eyes to the big limb
and had flipped the rope over it when a
rifle slammed with startling suddenness the
big mans horse bucked with violence throw-
ing the man over its head the animal fled

  instant confusion struck the masked band
sixes were jerked from leather and blasted
in the direction of the shot then two six-
guns came into action from another direc-
tion a masked man screamed swayed
then grabbed the saddle-horn the big rene-
gade came to his feet and his guns too
were going

  the rifle cracked again and a man dropped
to the ground like a poled ox the men
fired wildly buck henry held his skittish
horse with pressure of his knees a wild
light of hope in his eyes

  grab that hurt man up the big man
yelled hoarsely get out of here its the
diamond h

  the would-be hangman vaulted up behind
another rider sending a blasting fire into
the trees under its cover the fallen man
was picked up and slung over a horse the
band wheeled and set spurs racing off to-
ward the deep cut in the roadway hidden
six-guns and a rifle sent them on their way
a few twisted around to return the fire
but most of them leaned low over their
horses and spurred them on faster

  the pounding drum of hoofs faded away
buck henry sat quietly the rope still around
his neck his arms pinioned tightly behind
his back he looked eagerly toward the trees
but could see nothing in the dense brush
twilight was falling and the shadows clus-
tered thick beneath the trees then out of
their depths came the eerie call of the moun-
tain lion a sound buck henry had not heard
in years he felt the few hairs above his
ears prickle and rise

  abruptly a man on a magnificent black
stallion rode around a heavy clump of bush-
es the rancher stared at him mouth agape
raiders of rifle rock



the man was tall and slender with broad
shoulders deep chest tapering down to a
narrow waist circled by two gun-belts he
wore a black high-crowned hat and a black
cloak hung from his shoulders almost con-
cealing his body

  the rider came closer buck henry saw
then that he wore a black domino mask be-
neath which wide full lips smiled the jaw
was long firm henry continued to stare as
the man came closer and spoke in a deep
voice

  yuh came mighty close to trouble friend
lucky i happened to be around

 buck henry found his own voice who
are you he demanded

  im called the masked rider here and
there

that looked small beside the big black
stallion

  the masked rider buck henry breathed

me looked again at the masked man
-the blue eyes behind the domino mask
looked friendly enough now but buck sensed
that they could look as chill as the black
bores of leveled colts the waning light
caught faint reflections on the blue steel of
the heavy guns holstered snugly to each lean
hip

 so this was the famous robin hood of
the ranges the outlaw the masked rider
whose name was spoken fearfully through-
out the west to mention him around
chuckwagon fires in lonely bunkhouses or
the saloons of the cowtowns started heated

                    blue hawk

 the mans long powerful arm reached out
and pulled the noose over the diamond h
owners head he dropped the rope to the
ground henry caught a flicker of move-
ment close at hand and his glance jerked
in that direction

  he looked straight at a bronze-faced indi-
an dressed in a white shirt and trousers
with a sash around his waist in which he
carried a sheath-knife his long dark hair
almost touched his shoulders and was tied
back from his face by a bright-colored band
of cloth henry judged him to be a yaqui
of that tribe of fierce fighting men from be-
low the arizona border he wore no six-
gun but there was a rifle in the saddle boot
beneath his right leg he rode a wiry gray

arguments there were a thousand stories
about the masked rider few of them true
most of them false and distorted but all
told of this fighting fury on horseback who
battled to help the oppressed and the down-
trodden though he himself was counted
as an outlaw

  henry recalled that though young the
masked riders past was a sealed book
rumor had it that those firm ups never spoke
of it even to the yaqui blue hawk who
was his constant companion and friend even
his real name was unknown to any man
but himself

  despite the thousands of stories no one
knew what had caused the masked rider
to become a robin hood outlaw but what-
	masked rider western

ever his past there were hundreds who
would give their lives for him because he
had ridden to their aid when their need was

greatest

  for all buck henry had heard though
there were many things he did not know
about the masked rider he could not know
that this supple tall masked man was also
the wandering cowboy whom he himself had
challenged back in the winchester there
was no way he could guess that the masked
rider often assumed the role of wayne
morgan a puncher with a characteristic
slow drawl and easy manners and he was
convincing in the role since he was a good
cowhand and time and again he had proved
that he could be tophand on any spread

  they are gone senor the indian said
in a quiet voice he had been educated in
a mission school and spoke english well but
he clipped his words short so that at times
they sounded harsh indianlike

 good blue hawk the masked rider
smiled keep a watch on the road while
mr henry and i talk things over

 yuh know my name buck henry ex-
claimed in amazement

  among other things the masked rider
answered gravely as he cut the ropes that
bound bucks hands but theres much more
about this valley that id like to know yore
recent companions seemed right determined
to stretch yore neck

  m bar c rannies i reckon henry an-
swered slowly he shook his head prob-
ably hotheads i dont reckon zack or rita
would allow a trick like that

  the masked rider swung easily out of
saddle and buck henry followed him they
sat down under the thick limbs of the cot-
tonwood as the evening shadows deepened
blue hawk disappeared as silently as he had
come

  despite his knowledge that this man be-
side him was a hunted outlaw the rancher
felt a deep sense of security

  this has all the earmarks of a range
war the masked rider said quietly id
like to know more about it

  shucks its no different from a hundred
other range wars henry answered soberly
he waved his arm back toward rifle rock
and then in a wide arc that included the
pecos range to the north this whole of
rifl valley is divided between two spreads
my diamond h is up this way and zack
mcclouds m bar c is south of rifle rock
he only town in these parts zack and me
rode in here together forty years ago and
f tablished our spreads there aint been a
r-m of trouble between us until lately
vtiats happened the masked rider
r-vd

  trouble just reared up all of a sudden
iid slapped her brand on the valley henry
answered sadly first jed-hes my son-

and me began to miss some diamond h
cows jed trailed em and each time they led
south onto m bar c range i couldnt
imagine zack doin any rustlin him and me
had been friends for years his daughter
and jed was some sweet on each other still
are if this blamed trouble would clear up
how many head did yuh miss

  just a few at a time but its kept up
then some jasper put a couple of slugs
through the ranchhouse winders we never
had no trace of him but it could have been
an m bar c warnin yuh see about that
time zack started rampagin about losin
cow-critters he claimed the diamond h
had gone plumb loco

  looks as if theres a third party in this
deal somewheres the masked rider said
playin both sides against the middle

  i thought of that henry agreed ive
seen it done before but there aint another
cattleman in these parts exceptin me and
zack aint nobody can gain a thing stirrin
up trouble so far as i can figger theres
only one answer

  id like to hear it the masked rider
nodded

 mcclouds gone land greedy i know
the diamond h has lost cows its been a
steady drain and every time they head into
m bar c range mccloud claims weve stole
some of his it aint so it sounds to me like
somebody over there is tryin to raise a
rumpus to cover their own stealin

the masked rider was silent for a while
buck henry stole several glances at him
eyes full of questioning he looked back to-
ward rifle rock and sighed

  zack got shot today in town he said
mournfully and the diamond h is bein
blamed for it they claim we drygulcfied
him from the gunsight saloon but not ne
of the boys in the gunsight was away from
the bar its goin to bring trouble though
plenty of it limp denton aint goin to let
it ride no matter how much rita and zack
might try to hold a check-rein on him
whos limp denton

  segundo for the m bar c zack ramrods
the m bar c hisself limps a youngn just
come in to the valley mebbe two years ago
he picked up a rustler bullet down in texas
and his hip never did heal right

  from texas eh the masked rider said
musingly is that all yuh know about him
just about all buck henry nodded
seems to be a hard-workin and ambitious
gent got a temper like a prairie fire
though he sort of figgered one time he
could hitch up with rita but she made it
mighty clear jed was the one she wanted i
expected him to go on a rampage but he
never did

  the masked rider straightened up and
looked about over the range when he spoke
raiders of

  slowly his deep voice showed he was
  thoughtful

   only two spreads here and no other
  cattleman yet things still look like a third
  party in the deal somewheres on sudden
  inspiration he asked how about minerals

     aint none to amount to much theres
  big copper mines beyond the pecos ridge
  and experts looked over the valley several
  years ago they didnt find enough to start
  any new mines here

    yuhre makin it harder by the minute
  the masked rider chuckled ruefully

    amigo it is hard buck henry answered
  swiftly ive done thought her over till im
  tired of thinkin any more

    but still there is trouble the masked
  rider snapped grimly it might be caused
  by the m bar c or by somebody yet un-
  known yuhre facin a range war and
  theres been blood spilled already that has
  to be stopped and whoever is behind the
  trouble brought out in the open

    sounds hard to do henry stated dryly
  it will be how about somebody in rifle
  rock

    what would they gain there aint no
  cattlemen there thatd know how to handle
  range like this some mighty tough gents
  in rifle rock might rustle a few cows but
  they couldnt figger up the trouble thats hit
  us

   how about king gardner the masked
  man asked

    not king least of all the rancher said
  positively hes a smooth gent and i dont
  like him much but hes a saloonkeeper and
  wouldnt know the front end of a cow from
  the back a brandin iron from a remuda i
  cant point nothin at gardner

   the masked rider turned to the black
  stallion waiting patiently near-by

    looks as if rifle valley needs some in-
  vestigatin he said grimly mr henry
  can yuh keep yore diamond h boys in line
  not start any trouble or do any flghtin no
  matter what comes along

    i reckon i could the rancher nodded
  slowly he looked up yuh plannin to take
  chips in this

    might the masked rider answered at
  least im goin to look around a bit if i
  find out anything ill let yuh know at the
  diamond h

    glory be buck henry breathed

    the masked rider smiled slightly

    oh another thing theres a wanderin
  waddy came in to the valley today ive
  been keepin close watch on him and hes
  all right if he happens to ride up some
  day he might have a message from me keep
  yore boys at home and keep their sixes hol-
  stered ill see yuh later

    he swung lithely into saddle neck-reined
  the stallion the magnificent beast plunged
  off into the night in the direction of rifle



rifle rock	

rock soon buck henry could no longer
hear the pound of the horses hoofs slowly
he started for the diamond h

  the masked rider done took chips he
breathed i reckon well get somewheres
now waitll i tell jed

  he pulled up sharply from out of the
night came the distant cry of a mountain
lion he listened but it was not repeated
at last he rode on down the trail to the
diamond h

chapter iv

gun trap

lue hawk came out of the
night answering the masked
riders call he swung in be-
side his companion and the two
cut off the road heading across
the range to a hide-out in the
canyons along the west moun-
tain wall of the valley they
rode silently and at a good
speed but always two pairs of
keen eyes searched the dark range ahead and
to either side at last the canyon closed
about them

  they came out on a small hole com-
plete with grass and a little spring the
roan and the pinto they always carried with
them for any needed extra mounts and the
camp gear had already been put in order
by blue hawk the two men dismounted
and the yaqui took the masked riders
stallion and his own gray to pasture them
with the others by the time he returned
the masked rider had a small fire going

  the masked rider opened his bed-roll
the black stetson and cloak disappeared and
the domino mask with it when he returned
to the fire he was again wayne morgan
and even his voice seemed to have changed
to a softer drawl as he said something to
himself aloud he busied himself with bacon
and rolls of dough on a stick soon the sim-
ple meal was ready and when it had been
eaten wayne morgan nursed his coffee as
he looked across the flames at blue hawk

 what yuh think of rifle valley he
asked

  trouble is here senor blue hawk an-
swered quietly

  yuhre right morgan nodded he told
blue hawk what had happened in rifle rock
and the story buck henry had told seems
like there plumb has to be somethin beside
grass and cows behind this minerals mebbe
or somethin like that

  blue hawk will ride the valley the
yaqui said quietly to watch the rocks
and see

  you do that me im ridin back to rifle
rock seems like somebody ought to know
	masked rider western

who shot mccloud i might take a pasear
out to the m bar c too

  i will meet you when blue hawk
asked

  here tomorrer night if i aint around
check rifle rock before yuh ride out to
the m bar c i might try to get on the pay-
roll at that spread

  you think this ranch is at the bottom
of the trouble the yaqui asked

  i doubt it wayne morgan answered
thoughtfully but yuh never can tell in a
deal like this theres some tricky polecat
somewheres im certain of it

  blue hawk nodded and stared into the
fire finally morgan arose and stretched

  wed better hit our soogans amigo to-
morrer might be right tirin

  the fire died down to low embers as the
two companions of the trails rolled up in
their blankets peaceful night settled over
rifle valley but somewhere hate and greed
plotted to rip the range apart in clouds of
gunsmoke

  early the next morning the two men rode
out of the canyon hide-out with only a
brief word they parted blue hawk heading
toward the distant pecos ridge and wayne
morgan on the roan going at an easy can-
ter toward rifle rock

  the town looked peaceful and drowsy in
the morning sunshine and it was hard to
believe that the single quiet street had
only yesterday been a battlefield morgan
slowed the roan and ambled lazily into town
looking like a waddy who had few cares in
the world

  he pulled up to the winchester hitch-rack 
and dismounted a swamper who was
sweeping the porch gave him only a sleepy
glance as morgan pushed through the bat-
wings

  the saloon was empty except for a mourn-
ful-faced bartender the cowboy had not seen
before the man looked at morgan sol-
emnly sighed and reached for a shot glass
he had it filled and ready by the time
morgan reached the bar

  the first drink of the mornin is on king
gardner pilgrim he said

  you got it this time

  thanks morgan drawled he downed
the drink and half turned watching the
street been any more trouble since yes-
terday

  none whatever the bartender replied
sadly and if there is i aint goin to know
nothin about it that way i aint headin for
trouble

  well-trained huh morgan grinned

  the bartender shrugged his beefy shoul-
ders and gave morgan a more careful in-
spection

  you one of snakes boys he hires new

ones all the time and i aint always shore
whos who

  not yet morgan shook his head what
kind of gents does snake hire

  gunslammers mostly them cutters of
yores look well-used and i figgered yuhd
be lookin for snake

  how come a town like rifle rock needs
gunhawks morgan asked casually

  the bartenders lips twisted in a wry grin
and he pointed a thick stubby finger at the
cowboy

  now thats one of them things i dont
know nothin about yuhll have to ask
snake or king

  might do it morgan shrugged ill take
a little pasear around town first

  keep yore eyes open and yore mouth
shut the bartender warned its a plumb
healthy rule

     organ grinned and left the winches-
ter he stood on the porch for a mo-
ment looking up and down the street the
shops were open and a blacksmiths anvil
clanged cheerily two women turned in at
the general store

  wayne morgan left the porch and saun-
tered easily down the planked sidewalk he
took his time but even so he soon came to
the end of the street

  though he looked lazy and half asleep
the mild blue eyes had missed nothing he
had photographed the entire stretch of build-
ings in his mind to morgans idea the town
was the focal point of the valley and any
trouble would be bound to center here he
wanted to know the town like a book before
that happened

  he reached the white church and stopped
looking thoughtfully at the spot where the
cowboy and girl had been talking	

  jed henry and rita mccloud they were
he muttered softly still in love and meet-
in when they can in spite of the trouble
between the spreads i wonder what the
girlll be thinkin about jed now that she
believes the diamond h salivated her
father

  he shook his head and had turned around
to head back when he stopped short eyes
narrowing down the road he saw king
gardner and snake bannon cross the street
to the winchester coming from the small
frame hotel at the same moment a rider
came in and raised his arm in a brief signal
morgan recognized the man as limp den-
ton segundo of the m bar c the man
rode to the hitch-rack and dismounted and
king and snake joined him for a moment
they stood close together talking

  morgan watched them unable at the dis-
tance to catch a word that was said but
he noticed dentons deep frown and saw
raiders of

 snakes lips form what he was sure was a
 curse gardner smiled said something and
 jerked his thumb toward the winchester
 all three men disappeared inside

   the wandering cowboy remained leaning
 against the wall of the saddle shop he
 thoughtfully rolled a cigarette his narrowed
 eyes watching the winchester now blank
 and silent

  they was mighty thick down there
 he told himself now what would the se-
 gundo of a big spread be planning with a
 saloonkeeper and his gunslammer ramrod

   he lit his cigarette and continued his walk
 with no sign of hesitation he mounted the
 steps of the winchester and pushed through
 the batwings the mournful barkeep was at
 his station snake king and limp denton
 were seated at a table in the rear the three
 men watched morgan silently as he walked
 to the bar and ordered

   in the mirror he could see limp denton
 plainly and he studied the man more close-
 ly denton might have been handsome had
 it not been for the deep frown that gave
 his tanned face a lowering look his brown
 eyes were morose and brooding those of a
 man who has been sorry for himself too
 often

   his stetson was on the table before him
 and morgan noted the thick shock of coal
 black hair limps mouth was well-formed
 the nose straight and long the chin at first
 glance looked firm but a slight cleft some-
 how weakened it denton appeared to be of
 about the same height and weight as mor-
 gan and the cartridge belt he wore was
 pulled down at one hip from the weight
 of the heavy colt and holster

   upstairs to the office morgan heard
 king gardner say in a low voice hes just
 a wanderin waddy but yuh cant take
 chances

   their chairs scraped back and the three
 men left by a door at the back that opened
 on to a steep stairs morgan could hear the
 booted feet ascend thump along overhead
 and then stop he finished his drink and
 asked where he could find the sheriff

   morts at his office this time of morn-
f in the barkeep answered fact is he
t seldom stirs his stumps out of there across
 the street and down a bit the barkeep
 swished his cloth across the mahogany

l aint needin a lawman are yuh

l no morgan answered cryptically hes
 needin me though but he dont know it
i yet

 he pushed his hat forward over his eyes
 i and left the saloon again that conference
  going on upstairs interested him but there
  was no chance of overhearing it hanging
 i around the winchester would only arouse
 i deeper suspicion and right now morgan
 didnt want trouble but he did know where
 gardners office was

rifle rock	

as the sheriff rolled morgan over the waddy raised his gun
barrel toward the lawmans head chapter viii
masked rider western



  just before he reached the sheriffs office
he turned and looked back toward the win-
chester he saw the top of a tall tree tower-
ing above the building to the rear recall-
ing the direction of the footsteps of the three
men morgan was certain the tree was close
to gardners room

  he turned and opened the sheriffs door
mort hatcher had been leaning back in his
chair against the wall whittling on a long
stick he looked up pushed forward and
the chair legs thumped to the floor

  whats in yore craw stranger he asked
harshly

wtt-ayne morgan looked around the
cubby-hole the dirty floor and dusty
windows scarred desk and yellowing neg-
lected reward dodgers told him the caliber
of lawman he faced he had an impulse to
turn around and walk out but controlled it
mort hatcher was the only law in the valley
and morgans information should go to him

  yesterdays shootin morgan answered
the question

  hatcher looked only mildly interested
what about it

  i saw the man who shot zack mccloud
morgan said quietly

  hatcher didnt look up but morgan no-
ticed that his knife twisted on the stick of
wood nicking his finger hatcher swore
snapped the blade shut only then did he
look up and his muddy eyes were nar-
rowed

  yuh shore of that

  certain i was lookin down toward the
gunsight and saw the jasper fire a few
minutes later i almost caught him in back of
the buildin but somebody slung lead at me
and he got away

  hatcher finally looked excited his eyes
narrowed further and he came out of his
chair and leaned forward his knuckles on
the desk

  yuh got a good straight look at the jas-
per he demanded yuhd know him when
yuh saw him again

  thats right morgan said firmly

 he described the man in detail while
hatcher listened it seemed to morgan that
the lawmans eyes mirrored a shadow of un-
certainty and fear

 do yuh know the man morgan asked
as he finished

  not me hatcher replied swiftly almost
too swiftly sounds like a drifter will yuh
be around town for a while id like to talk
with yuh later its important

  mebbe a couple of hours morgan an-
rvered

  ill look for yuh hatcher said eagerly
theres a gent should know about this kill-
in jasper yuh described

  lie practically shoved morgan out the door

 as the cowboy turned away from the

office he had a glimpse of limp denton rid-
ing out of town hatcher came out of the
door clamping his hat on his head he
shoved by morgan and walked directly to
the winchester and disappeared inside

  morgan was thoughtful as he moved away
king gardner he was thinking must be the
man whom hatcher had been so anxious to
see everything kept coming around to
gardner morgan decided but where did
limp denton fit in all this-or did he

  for half an hour morgan loafed along the
street he dropped in at the gunsight and
discovered the saloon to be almost a duplicate
of the winchester but now its windows
were broken and the bar had been scarred
by flying slugs the owner a bald little
wren of a man whom morgan heard called
gus stood looking at the damage with a
woebegone expression on his pinched face

  shore be glad when the troubles over
he told morgan shaking his head a mans
property aint safe no more

  say do yuh know a gent who looks like
this morgan asked and he described the
unknown rifleman

  the little saloon owner listened and slowly
shook his head

  nope he said he aint anybody in these
parts lessn he come plumb recent

  the batwings shoved open and three men
who wore their guns low on each hip came
in their hard faces were stubbled and their
cold eyes stabbed at morgan he felt him-
self tense as without signal they started fan-
ning out the old gunman trick of catching
a man in a deadly cross-fire there would
be more gunsmoke in rifle rock in a mere
matter of minutes

       chapter v	

                                                              

colt conjerence

us behind the bar stared hard
at the three men who had come
into the gunsight and were
converging on morgan and
found it hard to swallow he
finally found his voice but it
came out in a frightened
squeak

 no guns no shootin
theres enough damage al-
ready for petes sake dont

  no one paid any attention to him as the
three gunhawks spread out and faced his
customer at the bar gus gulped hard again
and disappeared below the bar as if some-
one had jerked his feet out from under him
morgan who had swung around easily and
clear of the bar waited his hands hanging
loose at his sides

  before yuh start smokin he suggested
quietly mebbe yuh could tell me why
yuh want to
raiders of rifle rock

  we dont like yore clothes the biggest
of the gun slammers answered and smiled
coldly reckon thats answer enough

  its my eyes that bother yuh i reckon
morgan said coolly they see too much
thats good too the man said surlily
mebbe that suits us

  his hand slapped down to his holster the
other two crouched and faded to either side
taloned fingers diving for their guns mor-
gans hands blurred down and up the heavy
sixes gleaming he had sunk into a steady
crouch eyes cold and hard lips a thin
straight gash above a granite chin

  he slammed a hasty shot to the left caus-
ing the gunman there to duck instinctively
and slow his draw morgans right hand
squeezed tight around the colt and the weap-
on bucked and flamed in his fist a slug
pulled at his shirt sleeve and gunsmoke bil-
lowed high but in the same instant a big
gunman slammed backward colt still un-
fired a hole in his forehead

  morgan whirled guns lining down on the
man to his right the gunman over to the
left threw a hasty shot that plowed the
length of the scarred bar and finally buried
itself deep in the wood morgan and the
other gunman matched sixes both guns roar-
ing as one the gunhawk doubled over
hinging at the waist a look of stunned sur-
prise in his staring eyes

  morgan shifted fast and a slug cut the air
where he had stood a breath of time before
his colt blasted again the last of the gun-
men left alive whirled half around spun by
the slap of the heavy slug in his shoulder
his colt clattered to the floor he seemed to
do a jig step then lost his balance and fell
heavily

 morgan jumped forward kicked the
dropped colt under a far table his face was
bleak and hard as he holstered his sixes and
jerked the wounded man to his feet the
killer whimpered with pain and blood started
staining his shoulder morgan whirled him
half around and pointed to the two silent
forms on the floor

  you could be with them jaspers right
now he snapped yuh might still be if
yuh dont talk who sent yuh to gun me
i dont know the man gasped

  yuh lie morgan gritted

  fear mingled with the pain in the mans
beady eyes and his loose lips trembled

thats straight he declared stammering
in his haste to convince joe over there said
we had a job men bates came with him
all right morgan snapped who gave
joe his orders

  the wounded man hesitated licked his
lips he clutched at his injured shoulder and
looked wildly around as though seeking a
means of escape he found none but wayne
morgan waited there grim and merciless
the man shrugged



 i reckon yuhll know anyhow he
growled joe took orders from-

 the batwings banged back and mort
hatcher came storming in gus ducked back
under his barricade with a despairing howl
hatcher pulled up short muddy eyes drop-
ping to the two silent figures on the floor
he whirled around glaring at morgan his
hands slapped down but his fingers only
touched the gun butt morgan apparently
had not moved yet hatcher found himself
looking into the black muzzles of twin colts
he froze hand still outspread over his gun
his eyes lifted and his thick lips were slight-
ly parted

leave yore iron alone wayne morgan
snapped at him i didnt start this ruckus
the gent behind the bar will tell yuh that
hatcher didnt move a muscle his voice
sounded thick and choked

  yuh got just fifteen minutes to get out
of town morgan and two hours to get out of
the valley yuh cant hold them cutters on
me all day and theres too many hombres
for yuh to buck in rifle rock

  like these gunslammers morgan asked
in clipped tones

  ive kept rifle rock peaceful so far
hatcher went on as though he hadnt heard
except for the fracas yesterday-and this i
dont aim to let any gunhawk run loose get
out of rifle valley before i come for yuh
morgan

  how about that talk we was to have
morgan demanded

  its a pack of lies yuh told me hatcher
said heatedly though he was staring in fas-
cination as morgans hands whitened around
his guns there aint no such man

 shuck yore gun hatcher morgan
snapped im leaving rifle rock for the
time being but ill be back

  yuhll be dead if yuh do the lawman
challenged angrily

  mebbe but i dont aim to be dead right
away unbuckle that belt

 watcher slowly moved carefully loos-
ening the buckle and letting the belt fall
to his feet the wounded gunhawk leaned
against the bar eyes glazed with pain still
clutching his shoulder morgan shot him a
swift harsh glance

  now he announced get on with what
it was yuh was goin to tell me yuh lobo
who was it sent you and these other two
after me

 the gunhawk stumbled as he moved he
opened his mouth to speak shooting a fright-
ened glance at the sheriff but if he had in-
tended to say anything it never was said
for even with his single movement he
reeled then tumbled to the bar-room floor
like a sack of potatoes completely out
wayne morgan swore but there was noth-
	masked rider western

ing he could do about it-right then he
glowered at the sheriff

  you heard me he snapped and im not
through with this business im cornin back
some time like i said and then i aim to find
out who sent these three skunks after my
hide no time now get over against that
far wall hatcher

  hatcher cursed but lumbered over to the
wall with one glance at the wounded man
and the two dead men on the floor morgan
kicked the lawmans gun-belt to the far end
of the bar he edged to the batwings paused
there cold blue eyes blazing at the lawman

  yore kind of law dont last long he flung
at hatcher ill see yuh again

  he turned and disappeared through the
batwings he hit the porch cut sharply away
from the steps his boots thudded along the
planks and he jumped off the high end to
the ground to run swiftly the length of the
building to the rear and then along the line
of stores back to where his horse was
hitched

  he came out on the street just a few feet
from the roan he rode when in his role of
wayne morgan as he ran to his mount he
heard hatchers hoarse shout but paid no
attention a gun blasted but the slug whined
high and wide morgan hit leather and neck-
reined the roan around another shot came
closer curious heads popped out of win-
dows and doors but morgan touched with
spurs and rode out of rifle rock in a cloud
of dust

 there were no more shots but wayne
morgan rode hard he expected more trou-
ble and time and again he looked back but
when he left the road there was as yet no
pursuit he headed the horse toward the
canyon hide-out working toward it in a huge
circle that would confuse any who tried to
follow him

  late in the afternoon he reached the
hideout blue hawk was not there and the
pinto was gone morgan dismounted and
turned the tired roan loose he sank down
on the ground and rolled a cigarette the
stallion whinnied greetings and morgan
smiled slightly midnight would have a
chance to show his speed again tonight for
this night the masked rider would make a
sortie into rifle rock he wanted a good
look at king gardners office the man need-
ed explaining-a lot of it

  morgan realized now that his having seen
the man who shot mccloud was a direct and
positive threat to somebodys plans so much
so that the three gunhawks had been sent to
shut him up hatcher had been conveniently
busy elsewhere when the killers had struck
but he had been fast enough after the gun
fight was over morgan stretched out on the
thick grass lazily wondering how long he
would have remained alive in hatchers jail
if he had allowed himself to be taken there

  hatcher was in on the deal whatever it
was-no doubt of that morgan shook his
head he was getting too many suspects and
none of them fitted anywhere if buck hen-
ry was right the man behind the trouble
should be a rancher which would eliminate
gardner hatcher and the gunhawk snake
bannon it might eliminate limp denton
but morgan was not ready as yet to take the
segundo from his list of suspects denton
knew cows and ranching but it was hard to
explain how he could profit from the trouble

  wayne morgan sighed and closed his eyes
he wanted rest before night had fallen

  just at dusk blue hawk came in to the
hide-out morgan had started a small fire
and had nearly finished preparing the meal
for the two of them blue hawk unsaddled
the pinto and came silently to the fire mor-
gan looked up a lazy smile on his bps
see anything he asked

  nothing senor but i have not covered
all the valley there is rich graze but no
minerals

  well that leaves us with a land grab to
think of as bein behind this trouble but the
jasper who is responsible for it is keepin
hisself well hid all right

  you go to m bar c blue hawk asked
after i take a look in rifle rock to-
night amigo that king gardner the saloon
man i told yuh about is in this deal some-
where if graze and cattle are the reason
for it it looks like limp denton would take
some trailin hes close to gardner too
morgan told blue hawk of the events of
the day as the two men ate blue hawk lis-
tened his dark face impassive

  sheriff is crooked the yaqui grunted
when morgan finished he tell someone
what you know and that person send giin-
men to kill you

  shore said morgan but who yuh fig-
ger hatcber talked to

  king gardner blue hawk said coolly
i wound up with that brand too mor-
gan admitted mebbe gardners helpin
denton but limp is only a segundo why
should he stir up trouble and have his boss
drygulched it just aint addin up blue
hawk

  it will senor the indian assured if
we keep at it

  thats what i intend to do and thats why
i want a look at gardners office he got up
and stretched well i reckon its about
time for the masked rider to appear get-
tin late

lue hawk also arose and went for
the stallion midnight wayne morgan
busied himself at a bed-roll when finally he
straightened up and turned the wandering
waddy had disappeared in his place stood
the masked rider his black cloak falling
raiders of rifle rock



around his shoulders he seemed taller
straighter than the cowboy

 blue hawk came in riding the gray and
leading the stallion without a word the
masked rider vaulted to midnights saddle
and the two friends rode out of the canyon

 rifle rock was again sheltered by dark-
ness when the masked rider drew rein at
one end of the town his blue eyes chill
now gazed steadily through the domino
mask at the few lights along the street
there was little doing in rifle rock since
both the m bar c and the diamond h were
staying close to their own spreads

 the masked rider spoke a word and the
two men skirted the town like part of the
night itself they drifted up the back of the
winchester the saloon was quiet almost
too quiet blue hawk slid out of the saddle
and disappeared in the darkness his com-
panion waited silent and alert

  in a few moments the indian drifted back
out of the darkness

 back door senor he whispered gun-
hawks in the saloon upstairs dark

 the masked rider swung out of leather
and passed the reins to blue hawk the
yaqui watched the dark figure disappear in
the night he waited black eyes fixed in a
glittering stare on the shadowy bulk of the
saloon

 when the masked rider reached the rear
door the same one he had used when he had
tried to capture mcclouds ambusher he
carefully turned the knob and slowly let the
door swing inward down the short hall
through the crack of the other door he could
see the light from the bar-room even as he
looked the knob was rattled

  instantly the masked rider stepped back
pulled the door closed but kent his hand on
the knob he crouched outside ear pressed
to the panel he heard heavy boots and talk-
ing

  hatcher a coarse voice was saying yuh
shouldnt have let that waddy get away how
yuh know he wont go to henry

  shut up snake until we get to the of-

fice gardners voice snapped yuh want
the whole town to listen in

  bannon growled something unintelligible
then boots ascended the stairs

  just above the masked rider a lamp
glowed he raised his eyes and his lips tight-
ened with decision again he eased open the
door and this time stepped inside the dark
hall carefully he pushed the door shut be-
hind him making sure the catch did not
click he did not want to lose a precious in-
stant turning the knob in case he had to
leave in a hurry

  he edged forward muscles tense keen
ears alert for any sound from above or be-
low the bar-room door was closed again
and there was only faint murmurs from be-
yond it

  the masked rider found the dark stairs
leading upward pressing against one wall
he climbed slowly when he reached the top
he stood in a long hall that ran the length of
the building and he saw a faint line of light
under a far door to the rear

  he lifted his colts from their holsters and
cat-footed toward the light as he edged
closer he could hear the murmur of voices
inside the room grow in volume finally he
stood at the door crouched and tensed now
he could distinctly hear each word spoken
and recognized hatchers growling voice

  dont blame me snake them gunhawks
of yores had already upset the coffee pot i
only tried to finish what theyd started
there aint no need to argue about mor-
gan gardners voice cut in smooth and
pacifying hes done left town and has
probably rode plumb out of the valley
thats what we want anyhow and it saves us
salivatin him

  i aint so shore hes gone snake grum-
bled id feel safer with him in boothill
he raw too much

shore he did gardner agreed but so
long as hes not here to talk were safe ban-

hnre yuh can swing this deal

  why not the stuff is here right in these
hills i know the road has to come right
ihrough rifle valley we got a jealous hom-
bre workin with us and we got him plumb
ioosed what yuh think the diamond h and
m bar c will be worth once theyve done
chewed one another to pieces

  ill probably knock em down to the high-
est bidder hatcher said with a laugh

  thatll be me gardner assured of
course i figger on gettin the m bar c just as
cheap if limp-

  a door suddenly opened below and the
masked rider jerked back he half turned
looking toward the stairs at least two men
ere below the masked riders eyes cut
-c length of the hall if the men came up
hs was trapped at that moment he heard
the thud of boots on the stairs

          chapter vi
gunhand

masked rider moved with
speed of a mountain cat
h three long strides he
shed the head of the stairs
flattened himself against
wall just around the corner
the men he had heard in
e ascended the twin colts
the masked riders hands
settled more firmly

  abruptly the door down the hall opened
and light fanned out into the hall snake
bannon stood framed his uncombed hair
looking even redder in the glow of the lamp
behind him the masked rider had a brief
glimpse of gardner seated at a desk of
hatcher standing glumly beside it then
bannon saw the dark figure in the hallway
his jaw dropped in sheer surprise the men
on the stairway were almost at the top when
snakes constricted throat regained its power

  the masked rider he yelled his hand
dropped down to his gun

  instantly the masked rider exploded into
action he threw a slug at bannon that
smacked into the door casing beside the
mans red head bannon jumped back tug-
ging desperately at his colt the men on the
stairway halted confused

  the masked rider swung around the cor-
ner and jumped down the gunhawks had
only a glimpse of a hurtling black-cloaked
figure they had no time to move before the
masked rider was upon them his gun-
barrel rapped smartly against one mans
head and his shoulder hit the second hard
in the chest

  both men fell backward down the stairs
a spinning confusion of arms and legs the
masked rider leaped after them had reached

the bottom of the stairs as bannon and
hatcher appeared at the top he crouched
whirled and sent two shots blasting upward
bannon faded again but hatcher sent one
wild slug singing downward before he
jumped for cover

  as the masked rider hurtled the two gun-
hawks and sped for the rear door he heard
gardners alarmed shout and hatchers wild
cursing from the bar-room came the crash
of chairs as bannons gunslammers jumped
to their feet they were hurling themselves
at the door when the masked rider sent lead
smashing through the thin panel a man
howled in agony

  the masked rider sped to the rear door
jerked it open he could hear the pound of
heavy boots on the stairs as snake hatcher
and gardner rushed down but the masked
rider had disappeared into the night run-
ning swiftly

  blue hawk loomed out of the darkness
leading midnight the masked rider vault-
ed to saddle instantly the powerful stallion
plunged away into the night

 the saloon erupted men gunslammers
with heavy colts in their fists they heard
only the fading pound of hoofs and then the
night was silent they milled uncertainly
until king gardner came out with hatcher
and snake pressing close behind him the
saloonkeeper realized the quarry had fled
and he gave flat orders for the men to return
to the saloon he turned and looked hard
at snake bannon

  now weve got some real trouble on our
hands he said tightly that masked rider 
is a gent wholl take some killin

  i dont like it king hatcher said slowly j

  king whirled on him face working an-
grily gettin yeller he demanded well
yuhre in this deal and yuhll stay theres
too much dinero in this for any of us to
give up

  mebbe i dont want the money as bad as
i figgered hatcher said hesitantly and
gardner smiled slowly

  mebbe yuhll like boothill instead huh
he queried well i reckon that could be
done too think it over

 as the masked rider and blue hawk
streaked away from rifle rock at first they
had been expecting pursuit but it soon be-
came evident that the men on whom they
had been spying had been caught too much
by surprise to follow the fleeing men final-
ly the masked rider pulled up midnight
blue hawk also reined in and waited im-
passive and silent for the man in black to
speak

  gardners back of this puzzle the
masked rider said after a moment and hes
interested in gettin both the ranches hes
usin limp denton in some way blue hawk
there has to be a mineral deposit of some
kind around here gardner spoke of what

masked rider western

   king yuh
raiders of

hes after as bein in these hills keep look-
in for sign

  i will senor

 somethin else-i think theres to be a
road built through here

 road senor blue hawk said in quick
surprise but there is already one

 shore but gardner mentioned another
one to come this trouble in rifle valley is
beginnin to make a little sense but i still
want to know what part dentons playin

i think ill be at the m bar c at dawn

  ill look for you there senor if i have
need of it

 right blue hawk yuh might watch
rifle rock for a while in the mornin to see
if them renegades try to pick up our cold
trail if they dont then head for the hills

blue hawk dismounted with the
masked rider from the bed-roll behind
the cantle of the stallion the masked rider
pulled a battered stetson the mask cloak
and black hat disappeared and wayne mor-
gan took the gray mount blue hawk had
been riding he swung into saddle waved
his hand in brief goodby and rode away in
the darkness

  circling rifle rock he struck the road be-
yond the town and settled to the long ride
to the m bar c far after midnight he came
to the trail that branched off to the ranch
morgan rode along it for a while then pulled
off after a glance at the stars he rolled up
in a blanket and took a few hours sleep and
rest

 the first rays of the sun awakened him
he stretched the cramps out of his muscles
rolled his blanket and again swung into sad-
dle before long he topped a small hummock
and saw the sprawling buildings of the m
bar c just ahead

 morgan deliberately gambled when he
rode into the yard he gambled that limp
denton as yet did not know about him and
that none of the men he had tangled with in
rifle rock would visit the ranch during the
short time he planned to stay give him a
day and a night here and morgan was con-
fident that he would be able to know at least
a little more about limp denton

  the ranchhouse was silent and no one was
in the yard when wayne morgan rode up
he heard sounds of life in the bunkhouse
and the cooks cheery whistle from the cook-
shack there was a small two-room building
to one side of the ranchhouse that obviously
was the quarters of the segundo

 wayne morgan dismounted turned and
hitched up his gun-belt he started toward
the small shack but a sudden challenge from
the bunkhouse swung him around a young
cowboy stood in the doorway a colt in his
fist

 where yuh aimin to ramble stranger
he demanded

rifle rock	

  morgans lazy smile softened his lips he
jerked a thumb toward the cottage

  i figgered to talk to the boss yuh can
put that six up amigo im peaceful

  you might be but we aint the cowboy
snapped we got a bad wounded man here
now just elevate yore hands and ill call
limp out

 the cowboy came forward as morgan
raised his arms the fellow vas about twen-
ty-five with a lean tanned clean look to his
angular face and jaw his eyes were a clear
brown open and direct though now his lips
were set and he obviously regarded morgan
with suspicion he kept his colt steady cir-
cled morgan and knocked on the door of the
shack

  limp he called hey limp theres
a strange rider out here wants to see yuh
in a moment the door was jerked open and
limp denton stepped out his dark morose
eyes cut to wayne morgan and glittered in
instant suspicion his hand dropped to the
gun he wore and he advanced his left shoul-
der dropping as he limped his weighing
glance dropped to the crossed gun-belts
then lifted again

 whats in yore craw he demanded
we dont take kindly to strangers

 now whats wrong with this valley
morgan drawled in an aggrieved tone i
aint aimin to harm anybody me im just
tryin to find a job and drifted down this
way

  pilgrim huh limp spoke sharply his
eyes narrowed where from

  i started in montana but ive covered a
heap of miles since then say could i drop
these arms theyre gettin plumb heavy
stickin up there in the sky

  limp hesitated a moment then briefly
nodded he spoke to the young cowboy

  yuh can put up that cutter bart i reck-
on i can handle the jasper if he gets proddy
morgan lowered his arms rubbed them
bart hefted his six in his hand a moment as
if undecided whether to follow orders or not
then he gave a slight shrug and dropped the
colt in leather slowly he returned to the
bunkhouse door said something to the men
inside and then leaned against the frame a
silent warning to the stranger

  this is a bad country for work pilgrim
limp said

  im shore findin that out morgan said
wryly i make a good cowhand mister and
i hope yuh could use one

  limp scratched his jaw and his glance
dropped again to the crossed gun-belts

  we aint exactly looking for cowhands
he said carefully but yuh look like yuh
could do somethin else

  huh oh these guns ive handled em
in my time morgan grinned

  good with em
masked rider western



  fair to middlin aint been plugged yet
and ive been places where no man could
hardly say that

  come on back of the barn limp ordered
with sudden decision

  he turned on his heel and morgan fol-
lowed him morgan noted that despite
limps bad hip he could move fast they
circled the barn and came out in a narrow
pasture for stock to be held close to the
ranch limp pointed to a row of glass jars
stuck over a line of pickets some distance
away

  let me see what yuh can do

     organ looked puzzled at the jars and
     turned to limp

 yuh mean yuh want me to bust them
good jars

  rita can replace em limp snapped
start smokin

  like this morgan asked

  his hands blurred down and he whirled
almost like a rolling thunder his guns
roared and chattered along the fence posts
jars crashed in a swift line ten of them
wayne morgan blue eyes sparkling ejected
the empties from one gun and looked up at
limp

  that what yuh mean

  limps jaw was hanging open he swal-
lowed deeply and chuckled ruefully

  and i told bart malone i could handle
yuh if yuh got proddy yuhve got yoreself
a job pilgrim and i pay fightin wages lets
get to the house and ill tell miss rita

  yuh got a woman boss morgan asked
abruptly he frowned as though he didnt
like the idea

  our regular boss is down with lead poi-
sonin denton explained watching morgan
reload his daughters in charge till hes
back on his feet but to be honest i give
the orders

  oh i see morgan looked wise you
and the lady sort of-understand one an-
other

  thats it though we dont say nothing
about it lets get to the house

  they rounded the barn and morgan saw a
girl at the door of the ranchhouse she was
tall well-formed graceful as they came
closer morgan saw that her dark eyes were
clouded with fear one hand was at the
white column of her throat the other
clenched at her side her face was a tanned
oval framed by dark waving hair the ging-
ham dress she wore accented simply the
lovely lines of her figure red lips were
slightly parted revealing white even teeth
what was the shooting limp she asked
the gent here was showin what he could
do im hirin him rita

  the names morgan the blue-eyed wad-
dy put in and swept off his battered hat
wayne morgan

  the girl paid no attention to him her bps
snapped shut and her jaw formed a hard
angle her eyes sparkled angrily and she
took a half step forward

 gun hawk she exclaimed i wont
have it limp we have never hired fighting
men killers and we wont now

  limp scowled yuh never will learn will
yuh rita what about yore pa in there
now

  the law will take care of whoever shot
father she snapped in reply we will not
be a gunhawk ranch

  yuhd let the henrys just ride in and
do what they please limp sneered his
features twisted in rage we can be robbed
blind rustled white shot down whenever we
go to town its all right with you because of
that jed henry

  limp rita exclaimed and her face be-
came pale

  limp didnt seem to hear her or remember
that morgan stood close by

  yuhre plumb loco over that jasper well
he shot yore pa or ordered his shootin-yuh
can depend on that he aint no different
than any other killer and if i get him in my
gunsights-

  the girls hand cracked against his cheek
limp flinched and stepped back his face
was pale showing the red marks of the girls
hand ritas shoulders slumped and she
turned running back to the house she
stopped at the door and morgan could see
her square her shoulders she turned face
drawn

  im sorry for that limp she made a
slight gesture of defeat with her arms do
what you please im tired of fighting

  she disappeared within the house limp
stood stock-still his face a study in fury and
jealousy morgan shuffled his feet and
cleared his throat limp came to with a
start flushing slightly

  yuhll find a place in the bunkhouse he
growled to morgan see bart malone
cooky has breakfast about ready yuhre on
-at gun wages

  he walked rapidly toward his little house
and disappeared the door slammed behind
him

          chapter vii
               spy

ayne morgan looked back
toward the ranchhouse and his
brows arched questioningly
from what rita mccloud had
said about gunslammers mor-
gan was ready to cross the m
bar c off his lists of suspects
buck henry had been entirely
wrong when a ranch started
rustling it started hiring gun-
raiders of

hawks one was absolutely essential to the
other

  but limp denton was another question
morgan thought as he moved slowly toward
the corral with his horse that flare-up be-
tween limp and rita mccloud had been en-
lightening limp denton was jealous of and
hated young jed henry so greatly that he
was determined to line the man in his gun-
sights morgan scratched his head and
sighed

  reason enough there he mused if i
could see how it fits in with the rest but
what has jealousy got to do with minerals
and a road and what minerals and what
road and where

  he chuckled derisively at himself and
turned the horse into the corral

  bart malone was waiting for him at the
bunkhouse door and the young cowboy was
smiling he flushed a little as morgan looked
at him

  plumb sorry i threw down on yuh he
blurted but weve had trouble

 i reckoned as much morgan smiled
back no hard feelins how about a place
to bunk and im plumb famished

  malone eagerly showed him a bunk then
led him to the cookshack where he intro-
duced morgan to the crew not a one of
them was a professional gunslinger morgan
noted all of them cowboys friendly enough
but intensely loyal to the mcclouds and the
m bar c

  after the meal they went out in the yard
and started rolling quirlics none of them
went to the corrals to got their horses and
start the work on the range

  dont nobody earn his pay here mor-
gan asked bart malone

   were stickin close to home right now
malone answeied a shadow coming over his
face tthere was trouble a few days ago
and our boss was bad shot limp sort of
figgered mebbe them back-shootin snakes
would raid the ranch so were waitin to see
what happens

  morgan seemed to be thinking the news
over and his face showed surprise

  who yuh figger on fight in he finally
asked

  diamond h looks like malone replied
he shook his head i cant figger it myself
buck henry and his son jed shore looked
like fine people to me but theyve done
started rustlin and shootin at us it dont
add up

  limp denton came out of his quarters and
hurried to the corral he roped and saddled
a horse then came riding up to the bunk-
house bart malone steored out to meet him

  im ridin to rifle rock lamp snapped
might be there all day see the boys stay
close malone and keep an eve on miss rita
and zack ill be back tonight

  he rode oil at a fast canter and morgan

rifle rock	

made himself a promise to be gone by night
gardner or someone in rifle rock would be
sure to mention wayne morgan to limp
the segundo would come riding back look-
ing for trouble and for the moment morgan
didnt want to clash with him

  i been lookin for an hombre down this
way morgan said as malone again sank
down beside him he most usually has a
red stubble on his face and the face would
shore scare little kids on a dark night got
himself a scar that pulls his lips down on one
side the scar runs clean on down under
the jaw ever see or hear tell of him

 he shore dont sound like anyone i
know malone shook his head i dont re-
member even seein a gent like that of
course im pretty close to the ranch all the
time though and dont see everybody that
comes to the valley

  morgan had to be content with that

  the time passed slowly and the new hand
used it to good advantage he learned that
zack mccloud was seriously wounded but
the doctor gave him a fair chance of pulling
through the m bar c hands as a whole
were certain that buck henry and the dia-
mond h were behind their trouble it would
only take a word to send them against the
henrys with gunsmoke limp denton was
more than ready to say the word only rita
mccloud held them back

  later in the afternoon morgan decided it
was time he left the m bar c denton would
be back from rifle rock and trouble for
wayne morgan would be riding with him
for over an hour morgan had not been able
to leave the group without arousing suspi-
cion he hid his growing tension however
and at last started edging toward the door
he wanted to slip outside saddle and be off
before any of the men realized his intention

 he had nearly reached the bunkhouse
door the men were grouped around malone
their interest centered on the young cowboy
morgan had touched the knob when he heard
men ride into the yard but so had the rest
malone looked out the window

  its limp he announced and hes got
the sheriff and gardner with him i wonder
whats happened now

organ knew what had happened he
was trapped between the men in the
yard and the m bar c hands inside he
thought for a moment of blasting his way to
freedom but pushed the thought aside it
might mean the death for some of these men
here and morgan didnt want that to his
credit

  bart molone and the men crowded to the
door and outside wayne morgan went with
them keeping to the back of the group and
edging his way along the bunkhouse wall

  denton hatcher and king gardner swung
out of saddles and came toward the bunk-
	masked rider western

house hatcher lifted his colt from leather
and limps face was dark with suppressed
fury

  wheres that hombre i hired this morn-
in he barked

  malone turned around morgan stopped in
his tracks hatcher saw him then and the
bloodless lips curled in triumph as he lifted
his colt lining it down on morgans chest

  just stand hitched sidewinder yuh aint
goin nowheres but to jail

  what for morgan demanded quietly
yuhre a blasted diamond h spy limp
denton broke in fairly spitting his words
the henrys sent yuh here

  hatchers gesture stopped limp the law-
man spoke slowly and distinctly

  yuhre under arrest for the attempted
murder of zack mccloud yuh hired on here
to get a chance to finish the job if zack dies
yuhll stretch rope killer

  morgan slowly raised his hands above his
head his mild blue eyes had become as cold
and hard as steel the m bar c men stared
at him then the red flush of anger slowly
worked up into their faces bart malones
hand dropped to his holster

  yuh sneaking killer he rasped i ought
to blast yuh down where yuh stand

  i didnt shoot zack and hatcher knows
it morgan protested he has another rea-
son for arrestin me

  shut up hatcher gritted he came close
and pulled the sixes from morgans holster
bart dont start no trouble this man is
my prisoner

  rita mccloud came out of the house and
up to the group limp walked to meet her
and in a few words explained the arrest
rita listened her face becoming pale and set
she looked at morgan and her glance held
a world of loathing and contempt she looked
away and at limp

  the law did find fathers drygulcher
limp she said just as i said it would
you were terribly wrong in blaming the
henrys

  hes a diamond h spy limp rapped out
jerking a thumb at morgan

  is that true rita asked turning to the
accused waddy

  no it aint morgan said firmly and
i never shot yore father

  lying in his teeth hatcher growled
malone rope and saddle his hoss were
wastin time

  in a short while morgan rode out of the
m bar c yard holsters empty to either
side rode mort hatcher and king gardner
two m bar c hands that limp had loaned in
case of trouble came just behind the three
they headed for rifle rock and the jail

  hatcher could not keep the pleased smirk
from his face king gardner showed no
emotion but now and then his green eyes
cut toward morgan and there was a deep

 sparkle of triumph in them morgan said
nothing

  he held an ace up his sleeve unknown to
these two plotters blue hawk would come
to the m bar c to report when he found
morgan gone he would instantly know that
something was wrong the silent yaqui
coud be depended upon

  when they reached rifle rock the small
party headed immediately for the jail mor-
gan was shoved into a small cell and the
barred door locked he watched the party
disappear up the corridor toward hatchers
office heard the boom of voices then all but
the sheriff left in a few moments hatcher
came back into the corridor he grinned at
morgan

  how yuh like our jail

  ive seen better morgan answered dry-
ly he sank down on the hard bunk mind
tellin me why im arrested

  not at all amigo hatcher boomed and
chuckled yuh tried to salivate zack mc-
cloud

  you know that aint so morgan said
without emotion ive been arrested because
i saw too much for somebodys comfort i
described the jasper who shot mccloud
now thats true aint it hatcher
grinned but do yuh know that a good citi-
zen of rifle rock saw the shootin his tally
of the gents looks size and weight just fits
you right down to the ground i reckon we
believe the citizen

  sheriff-morgan leaned easily back
against the wall-i got an idea i wont nev-
er come to trial i dont think yore boss can
let that happen

  now what gave yuh that idea hatcher
chuckled make yoreself right comfortable
yuh aint goin to see anybody and well
keep yuh right here till zack mccloud dies
after that well see what happens

  so mccloud is to die morgan said and
smiled bleakly

bfl atcher frowned then the frown dis-
appeared as his leering grin returned
he chuckled deeply again waved his hand
and clumped down the corridor his office
door slammed with dread finality and wayne
morgan was left alone

   he settled himself for patient waiting he
was certain now from what hatcher had
said that there would be little danger from
the outside for once of course morgan knew
that the hulking lawman took orders from
someone else still blue hawk would be ap-
proaching the m bar c even now

  morgan lay full length on the bunk hands
under his head looking up at the dirty ceil-
ing he hoped that blue hawks wanderings
would confirm his suspicion that metallic
wealth of some kind was involved mor-
gans own short visit to the m bar c had
thrown considerable light on the problem
baiders of rifle rock



limp denton was eaten up with jealousy of
rita mccloud he had evidently come to
some agreement with king gardner to strike
back at the henrys but so far the m bar c
seemed the hardest hit

  morgan felt certain that gardner was
playing for big stakes of some kind he had
gathered a band of gunhawks around him
and their services cost money and plenty of
it as yet though they seemed to have done
little to earn their pay gardner must be
holding them for some future need and that
worried morgan

  on the whole the general line of the trou-
ble in rifle valley was fairly clear the two
ranches had been skillfully played against
one another creating gunsmoke trouble the
third party either limp or gardner or both
planned to step in when m bar c and dia-
mond h were too weak from fighting to pro-
tect themselves

  as yet the motive was not clear and it
looked as if limp and gardner were work-
ing toward different aims proof against
either right now though was impossible and
morgan realized that he must have definite
proof to expose the two plotters to mccloud
and buck henry

  at dusk hatcher lit a weak lamp in the
corridor he grinned in at morgan through
the bars and disappeared again in about
half an hour he returned with a tray of food
he unlocked the door and held his colt
hammer dogged back in one hand while he
gingerly placed the tray inside the door he
turned the key in the lock again with obvi-
ous relief

  yuh couldnt have better service was yuh
in a hotel he jeered

  ill take the hotel morgan grinned back
at him

  yuhll take the jail hombre hatcher
promised coldly yuh aint goin nowhere
else for a long time

  once more he clumoed off down the hall
morgan ate then stretched out on the bunk
again he could hear the sounds of rifle
rock through the open barred window it
was muted almost furtive as if the town
feared to live its natural fife morgan sensed
it and wondered how powerful a hold gard-
ner had on the town

  time passed slowly morgan drifted off in
a light sleep awakened he arose from the
bunk and stepped to the window peering
out between the bars he saw the dark bulk
of a low building across the yard in which
the jail sat there was no light back here
from street or window he heard boots
thump along the planked sidewalk out in
front then fade away

  senor a low voice whispered close at
hand

  blue hawk morgan called softly in re-
ply im at the window

  a shadow stirred moved then blue

hawks ghostly form appeared out of the
darkness he came up to the window and
thrust something through the bars mor-
gans eager hand touched the cold metal of a
colt his fingers closed tightly around it

  midnight is here senor blue hawk
whispered at the end of the yard i will
wait

  good amigo i dont reckon it will take
long to get out of here

  the yaqui drifted off into the darkness
again and morgan turned from the window
he stood a moment thinking gun hanging
loose in his hand he caught a gleam of light
from the food tray hatcher had left the
lamp in the corridor gave a feeble yellow
light uncertain and tricky through the bars
morgan grinned

  he picked up the tray dishes and all and
lifted it high above his head he yelled with
all the force of his lungs and crashed the
tray to the floor it made a terrific racket
immediately he threw himself to the ground
face down gun hand hidden under his body

  the office door burst open and hatcher
thundered down the corridor through slit-
ted eyes morgan saw the lawman hold his
sixgun ready in his hand morgan let every
muscle go limp hatcher came to the door
and peered through the bars

  morgan held his breath suddenly the law-
man cursed the light grew stronger as
hatcher picked up the lamp from its bracket
and held it high morgan heard the mans
keys rattle and then the barred door swung
open hatcher stepped cautiously inside gun
held tightly in his fist lined on the sprawled
figure on the floor

chapter viii

jail break

ior a moment hatcher stood
still suspicious eyes boring
into the flaccid body on the cell
floor then his eyes cut around
to the wreckage of the tray
the broken china and finally
lifted to the barred window he
set the lamp down and careful-
ly approached the prisoner he
touched morgans back with
his fingertips and still morgan didnt move
hatcher swore

snake aint done it already he breathed

  in sudden decision he holstered his gun
he grasped morgans slack shoulders and
rolled him over and in that instant like a
striking snake morgans hand came up his
gun barrel rapped heavily down on hatch-
ers head and the lawman collapsed without
a sound morgan hnd to work himself out
from under the heavy body

  he worked fast pulling hatcher over to
the bunk he tugged the lawman onto it then
	masked rider western

picked up the mans gun and stuck it in his
waistband then he hurried out of the cell
and into the office

  a quick search of the big drawer of the
battered desk revealed the handcuffs with
them morgan returned to the cell he
snapped one of the links around hatchers
thick limp wrist the other he fastened se-
curely to the steel post that supported one
corner of the bunk then he systematically
searched the mans pockets making sure the
lawman did not carry the keys to the hand-
cuffs

  satisfied morgan picked up the lamp and
backed out of the cell he closed the door
and turned the key in the lock placing the
lamp back up on its bracket carrying the
ring of keys he returned to the office

  he worked faster there not knowing what
second someone might come in and discover
him he found his own matched sixes in an-
other desk drawer and snuggled them into
his empty holsters with satisfaction then
he went to the door

  he stepped out on the street glancing has-
tily up and down no one was near him
over at the winchester light streamed from
the windows and around the batwings and
he saw the dim shapes of horses at the hitch-
rack

  hatcher would be out for some time and
it would take an even longer period for his
yells to attract attention morgan had little
to worry about there and he grinned when
he pictured hatchers face after the man had
regained consciousness

  morgan slipped around the corner of the
jail and between the buildings to the dark
yard in the rear blue hawk came out of the
darkness

  this way senor the yaqui said hastily
we ride fast

  not yet i still havent had a chance to
look over gardners office

  it will be a risk senor blue hawk said
he made no further objections led the way
into the shadows and soon morgan saw mid-
nights dark form

  he spoke an affectionate word to the horse
and then unstraoped the bed-roll from the
cantle he worked swiftly adjusting cloak
and mask and black stetson in a short time
the masked rider tall and mysterious stood
there

  theres a tree by the winchester blue
hawk he said im usin it to get into
gardners office

  yes senor we will circle wide and come
up behind the saloon

  the two riders took a wide loop around
the town working their way silently to the
rear of the winchester the masked rider
saw that the upper story was completely dark
and a brief smile of satisfaction touched his
lips

  he swung out of saddle tossed the reins to

blue hawk then ghosted up to the dark sha-
dow of the tree he looked upward placed
gardners office window and saw that a thick
limb swayed just beneath it like a moun-
tain cat he sprang upward grasped the first
of the low limbs and pulled himself into the
leaves he worked on higher moving with
swiftness and sureness

  finally he crouched on the limb beside
gardners window the lower sash was
raised to admit the cool night breezes the
masked rider listened every sense keened
satisfied he edged forward reached out and
grasped the sill it took only a moment to
pull himself inside

 he stood silent another moment hall
crouched there was no sound no move-
ment at last the masked rider moved deep-
er into the room and his outstretched hands
touched the desk he pulled open the top
drawer and heard papers rustling

  taking a chance he struck a match swift-
ly he passed over invoices for liquor and all
the stock that gardner used in the saloon
below that exhausted the top drawer
striking another match the masked rider
pulled open the second drawer

  he saw some rocks and held them to the
light a moment puzzled certain veinings in
the rock held his attention then realizing
the need for haste he replaced the rocks and
searched further suddenly he straightened
with a soft exclamation

the letter he held in his hand was from
the continental mine development cor-
poration and dated not long before the
cold eyes behind the domino mask quickly
scanned the copper-plate handwriting that
informed

  we must be sure you have full title before we
can go further your samples and report are in-
teresting and we are anxious to investigate rifle
valley further when we are satisfied with your
clear title we will extend an option to cover the
period of our further surveys if those surveys
live up to expectations there is no reason why
we should not come to a mutually profitable un-
derstanding

  the masked rider replaced the letter lips
grim he struck another match and raised a
second sheet to its light this was from a
railroad company he had only time to read
the first word or two when a door slammed
below

  instantly he replaced the letter and snuffed
out the match lithe steps took him to the
window and he swung outside he caught
onto the limb and pulled himself into the
protection of the leaves at that instant a
light shown through the window behind him

  king gardner came in holding a lamp
snake bannon followed close behind him
gardner placed the lamp on the desk and sat
down frowning bannon waited impatiently
raiders of rifle rock	

tapping his fingers in a nervous rhythm on
the desk

  nothin can go wrong snake gardner
said finally  figgered to hold him till some-
thin happened to zack peopled think less
about it if they thought he was a killer
yuh cant run the chance king snake
growled shore mebbe mort wont let him
see anybody but id feel better if he was in
boothill dont forget he saw scar use his
rifle on old mccloud

  im not forgettin gardner sighed his
fist struck the desk we had everything all
planned out and lined up it couldnt go
wrong then this wayne morgan has to
wander in to see scar salivate zack then
the masked rider shows up we got to work
fast snake with that masked gent around-
and make no mistakes

  thats why i say kill morgan then we
can take care of the masked rider

  all right snake gardner agreed you
can take care of him tonight i reckon mort
hatcher can be away from the jail when yuh
pay yore visit

  as the masked rider realized he was lis-
tening to these two plan his own death al-
ready snake bannon had turned and walked
out the door

  the masked rider moved slowly back on
the limb toward the trunk of the tree keep-
ing his eyes on king gardner the man did
not move did not hear the slight noise the
masked rider made at last the cloaked fig-
ure reached the trunk and started to de-
scend he dropped from the last limb cat-
like to the ground

  he waited a moment glancing up the
yellow light still streamed out the upper
window and gardner had not been alarmed
the masked rider ran silently into the shad-
ows nd reached blue hawk he took the
reins and vaulted into the stallions saddle

  were teachin a killer a lesson blue
hawk and givin him a warnin he plans to
kill wayne morgan in his jail cell

  that would be hard to do blue hawk
replied gravely and the darkness hid the
slight twinkle in his normally impassive eyes

  once again the two men circled the town
and drifted down on the jail the masked
riders eyes searched every shadow and his
ears were keened for any sound he did not
know if he had beaten snake bannon here
or not finally he dismounted and with a
short word of caution to blue hawk drifted
up to the jail building

  he edged along the wall until he was be-
side the window of the cell where he had
been a prisoner he heard no sound except
that of deep breathing cautiously he peered
inside the lamp still glowed in the corri-
dor throwing enough light into the cell so
that the bunk could be dimly seen hatcher
still lay there apparently in the same posi-
tion in which the masked rider had left him

  just then he heard the corridor door open
snakes call echoed in the cells

  mort where in blazes are yuh

  he came down the corridor the masked
rider peered around the comer of the win-
dow snake came in then stopped and turned
as though to go back to the office just then
hatcher moved and groaned snake swung
around as though hed been shot

  mort he called again

  hatcher stirred and snake came to the cell
door he peered inside then cursed he took
the lamp from the bracket and returned to
the door holding it high he recognized the
handcuffed man on the bunk for just then
hatcher opened his eyes and tried to move
his arm the handcuffs clinked

cnake broke into a series of blistering
 oaths he placed the lamp on the floor
and grabbed the bars trying to open the
door then rushed back to the office

  hatcher regained full consciousness and
realized what had happened he tugged
against the handcuffs but only succeeded in
hurting his wrist he swung carefully around
so that he could sit up in the bunk he
yelled

  all right snake roared im huntin
for the keys now

  ill kill that morgan hatcher threatened

  snakes mocking laugh made hatcher
curse more bitterly at last snake came with
another ring of keys he fitted two to the
lock and the third one finally opened the
door

  when he stepped inside the masked rider
left the window and edged to the front of the
building a quick glance showed that no
one was near the jail he slipped to the door
gently eased it open with a single quick
flowing motion he was inside and just as
gently had closed the door behind him he
lifted the colts from the holsters and cat-
footed to the jail corridor

  snake had the lamp inside the cell now
his scorching tongue raked hatcher like a
spur and the sheriff fairly sizzled with anger
the masked rider heard the clink of the
links and snake spoke up disgustedly

  locked in yore own nippers even had
the key taken what a tophand lawman you
make was yuh plumb asleep

  he tricked me i tell yuh hatcher
blazed yuhd be fooled just as i was quit
yore arguin and get a file there was only
one key to these cuffs and i lost it waitll i
get my gunsights on that morgan

  yuhll never see him again snake
jeered

  he stamped out of the cell and started up
the corridor he sensed rather than felt the
presence of the man in the doorway and
jerked up his head then he saw the masked
figure his hand slapped downward to his
holster but the masked riders colts levelpd
masked rider western



down beating snakes draw by seconds

  yuhre careless snake the deep voice
derided now raise yore hands high sos i
can see em

 slowly snakes hands edged upward
hatcher was quiet listening to the new voice
in the corridor the masked rider came for-
ward holstering one six he lifted snakes
colt from the holster and threw it in hatch-
ers cell but beyond the manacled sheriffs
reach the masked rider stepped back

  the jail has a new prisoner he said and
smiled grimly wayne morgan aint here to
be killed

 snake bannon said nothing he stood
quietly eyeing the steady gun the masked
rider held on him hatchers links clinked
against the steel and the sheriff chuckled
deeply

  now whos the gent that gets caught flat-
footed hatcher derided snake you aint
got no room to talk

  shut up snake growled without turning
his head

  yuh came here to kill wayne morgan
the masked rider said he was arrested on
a trumped-up charge and yuh had to shut
him up i think yuhll do as messenger boy
from me to yore boss

  snake flushed angrily and his lips curled
whos my boss he demanded trucu-
lently

 king gardner the masked man an-
swered levelly tell king that im taking
a hand in this game tell him that the dia-
mond h and m bar c will soon be told who
is behind all the trouble theyve been havin
king and the rest of you renegades have a
little time to pull out of rifle valley with a
whole skin yuhd best take the warnin and
leave that goes for you hatcher

 why yuh blamed outlaw hatcher
snarled impotently ill run yuh down and
have yore hide when im out of this
others have thought the same thing
hatcher none of em ever succeeded
others are in boothill think it over snake
you can pass the word to limp denton too
snake gasped in surprise his eyes nar-
rowed and he licked his lips nervously sud-
denly his head cocked a little to one side as
though he listened for a sound the masked
rider heard it an instant later-boot heels
rapping along the planked sidewalk ap-
proaching the jail bannons lips broke in a
grin

  talk fast owlhooter he jeered yuh
aint got long thems friends of mine
into the cell the masked rider snapped
he took a quick step forward and jabbed
the barrel of his gun in bannons stomach
the red-headed renegade backed into the
cell eyes sparking the steps outside sound-
ed louder

rthe masked rider slammed the cell door
--shut bannon had left the new ring of
keys in the lock and a twist of the wrist
turned the key the masked rider withdrew
it bannon cast a quick look into the far
corner where his six lay

 remember my warnin the masked
rider snapped i dont give a second one

  first get out of this trap yuhre in ban-
non jeered

 the masked rider moved fast he was
down the corridor before snake bannon
could scoop up the six in the far corner of
the cell the big renegade let out a yell and
flung himself against the cell door he thrust
his gun through the bars and fired blindly
at an angle up the corridor

 the masked rider threw the keys into an
empty cell he had reached the door when
bannons slug whined wildly off a steel bar
and splattered against the ceiling the
masked rider pulled the corridor door shut
and jumped for the lamp on the sheriffs
desk snuffed it out

 he heard bannons call for help and a
muffled shout of alarm outside on the street
the masked rider jumped to the door and
flattened himself against the wall beside it
boots pounded loudly and the door was
burst open half a dozen men stumbled into
the darkness

 as the last one cleared the door the
cloaked figure swept noiselessly through it
to the street a dark figure jerked from a
leaning position against the wall and called
a surprised challenge the masked rider
didnt answer but met and beat the look-
outs swift draw both guns blasted almost
together the man yelled and grabbed his
shoulder

 the masked rider swept around him and
plunged to the corner of the jail he heard
bannons blasphemous shouts and the sudden
confusion inside as all the gunhawks tried
to push through the door at once

chapter ix

diamond h

ke a black ghost the masked
rider sped along the side of the
jail then cut diagonally across
the dark yard blue hawk
came up with the horses and
the masked rider threw him-
self into saddle someout shout-
ed behind them and the flame
from a six-gun licked like an
evil orange tongue

 the bullets were wild however in the
darkness midnights mighty muscles hurled
horse and rider forward and blue hawk
raced close behind the two riders cut di-
rectly away from the town there were
some more shots but none came near them
raiders of

for gunhawks were only shooting at the
night

 for a while the two friends rode hard
then the masked rider drew rein he twist-
ed around looking back in the darkness
toward rifle rock at last he straightened
and chuckled

 theyll be havin a hard time gettin
hatcher loose he observed and i gave
bannon a warnin that hell pass on to king
and limp i want to get em worried rush
em sos theyll show their hand through
some mistake

 now wayne morgan is wanted and so is
the masked rider blue hawk said they
will make our work hard senor

 thats happened before the masked
rider answered but i think im due at the
diamond h itll be a fair enough hidin place
for wayne morgan what have you learned
blue hawk

  there may be copper senor in the north
end of the valley i found traces in several
small pockets up in there hard to get to of
course senor it would take a mining man to
know i am not too well-trained in these
things

 i know that the masked rider frowned
thoughtfully into the darkness and it puz-
zles me about gardner what would a sa-
loonkeeper know about mineral deposits and
values

  maybe he has not always been the saloon-
keeper senor

  that might be ill do some questionin
the masked rider dismounted and re-
moved cloak mask and hat he rolled them
up and soon they were tied behind mid-
nights cantle wayne morgan grinned up at
the indian 

  i reckon ill have to borrow yore hoss
  lue hawk like i said ill be ridin to the
  iamond h tonight

 blue hawk dismounted i have seen cat-
tle moving north senor he remarked the
men who drove them looked like gunslam-
mers

 north morgan queried now i wonder
if bannon has hit the diamond h herd again
it would be the thing to do to stir up more
trouble yuhre close to the hide-out now
blue hawk so yuh can walk it and get some
rest you lead midnight since he wont let
nobody but me ride him then watch rifle
rock and if yuh see anything suspicious
meet me at the diamond h

 yes senor good luck

 morgan swung onto blue hawks mount
and rode easily away heading toward the
diamond h now and then he thought of
mort hatcher a prisoner in his own cell and
he chuckled it would take a file before the
worthy sheriff would be rid of the steel
bands on his wrists

  morgan rode steadily and at a fairly fast
clip the night was dark but by now mor-

rifle rock	

gan was familiar with the valley before
long he saw a glitter of light ahead and knew
it to be the diamond h he came closer and
suddenly pulled up frowning

  there were too many lights every win-
dow of ranchhouse and bunkhouse glowed
lanterns bobbed across the yard and mor-
gan heard the impatient whinny of a horse
he recalled blue hawks report of cattle be-
ing driven across the valley morgans wide
lips pressed in a straight angry line

  buck henry was ready to ride on a war
trail morgan knew it as well as if he had
been told the diamond h was on the verge
of falling into gardners trap and continuing
the useless war against the m bar c

  morgan loosened the colts in his holster
and spoke a word to the horse that sent it
streaking ahead toward the lights and the
arming ranch

  as he came closer morgan saw that the
ranchyard was filled with mounted men who
waited close to the ranchhouse the dia-
mond h looked armed to the teeth and
waiting only a word to start the rifle valley
war in earnest morgan urged the horse to
greater speed

  the men in the yard heard the heavy drum
of morgans horse some of them swung
around and guns flashed up they waited
tense morgan rode into the yard and the
heavy suspicion on the mens faces did not
lessen at least a dozen guns covered this
stranger who had ridden out of the darkness

  morgan apparently did not see the colts
that threatened him as he rode up to the
steps and dismounted at that moment the
door opened and buck henry stepped out
the peppery little man carried a rifle in his
hand and a gun-belt circled his waist mor-
gan saw young jed henry just inside the
door the young mans face was drawn and
troubled

wbuck henry did not at first recognize
 the new arrival then his eyes narrowed
in recognition

  yore names morgan aint it he asked

  thats right a friend of yores sent me
morgans glance circled the waiting armed
men i reckon i came just in time too
could we have a pow-wow inside

  buck henry hesitated then stepped aside
and opened the door

  step in but make it fast hombre we
got work to do

  morgan stepped into the kitchen with
buck henry close behind him jed henrys
hand dropped to his gun and he flashed a
questioning glance at his father who shook
his head

  i heard yuh might be along any time
morgan buck henry was short and sharp
what yuh got to tell me

 the masked rider watched some cows
rustled today morgan drawled from yore
	masked rider western

boys bein all set for a scalpin party id say
they was yores

  they was snapped the rancher and
ive stood enough from the m bar c the
trail led right to their range

  disappeared didnt it morgan asked
quietly

  shore-like all the rest mccloud-or
that limp denton-is mighty smart in hidin
trail i reckon we aint takin any more
were ridin over there and callin a show-
down

  the masked rider saw them cows mor-
gan repeated in a slow drawl and the m
bar c wasnt chousin em along

  yuh mean that jed henry asked
eagerly

  his fathers wrinkled face screwed up

  when did yuh see this masked gent he
demanded

  not moren ten minutes ago morgans
keen eyes weighed the two men his quick
brain deciding what course to take the
same gent that directed the shootin of mc-
cloud planned the rustlin of these cows
that gent wants yuh to fight henry and
when yuh burn powder yuhre doin it for
him

  who is he buck henry was quivering
with eagerness

  the masked rider knows that morgan
said coolly and ive got some ideas myself
but i cant prove em yet send yore men to
the bunkhouse mr henry and forget yore
loco ideas

  old henry bristled i do as i please

  morgan spoke quietly almost in a whisper
yet his words had the impact of battering
fists

  i had orders from the masked rider to
keep yuh peaceful mr henry ill do it if i
have to use colts yuh aint makin this mis-
take

  bucks face turned a deep angry red his
hand dropped and he took a half-step for-
ward jed swiftly intervened he stepped
close and grabbed his fathers gun wrist

  hold yore temper dad i figger this hom-
bres right seems like yuh gave a promise
once to the masked rider that yuhd stay
right here on the spread no matter what hap-
pened

  buck henrys anger slowly receded and
his eyes wavered

  its hard just settin he complained not
knowin whats goin to happen to yuh next
ive held things in until im plumb ready to
explode

  yuhll get yore chance to explode mor-
gan promised but itll be at the right time
and place

  the diamond h owner made a gesture of
surrender he stepped to the door and
barked orders that dismissed the men mor-
gan heard angry mutterings but the men
slowly broke up leading their horses back

to the corrals buck henry went out into the
yard leaving morgan and jed alone

  yuhre glad yuh dont have to ride against
the m bar c morgan said quietly yore
dad had yuh in a bad spot

  how do you know jed asked quickly

  i saw you and miss rita the mornin be-
fore mccloud was shot and i can kind of
put two and two together keep as close a
check on the m bar c as yuh can jed miss
rita might be needin yuh mighty fast

  jed straightened alax-m in his eyes shes
in trouble

  not bad yet morgan said but just be
ready

  buck henry came back in the room and
morgan turned away from jed his move
clearly showed that he would not again men-
tion rita to the young rancher old henry
threw his hat on the table and sank wearily
into a chair he glanced up at morgan

  how come yuhre here he wanted tq
know

  i have to lay low for a while mort
hatcher arrested me-for shootin zack mc-
cloud

  the silence was thunderous buck henry
jerked as though he had been hit jed froze
his face stunned and questioning morgan
sank down in a chair and calmly rolled a
cigarette

  i didnt shoot zack he said coolly but
i saw the hombre that did thats plumb
bad medicine for a couple of gents i aint
mentionin yet they had to get me where
i couldnt talk to no one

  the rancher caught a sharp breath then
who shot zack

     opr an described the man in great de-
t  s ing that the unknown rifleman
was called  ocar though he made no men-
tion of how he had come to know this buck
henry and his son hung on every word
then the older man shook his head with a
resigned sigh

  ive seen the hombre hung around the
winchester for a spell and then plumb dis-
appeared suddenly his eyes widened and
he looked up at morgan hung around the
winchester then king gardner is some-
wheres in this mess-and that red-headed
gunhawk bannon

  yuhd be surprised who is in it morgan
answered steadily theres a heap of things
to be proved yet and the renegades have
got to be smoked out into the open i do
know this though-that if id stayed in
hatchers jail id have been in boothill by
mornin

  how did yuh get out buck henry
asked and morgan told him

  by the time he had finished the rancher
and his son were grinning widely the father
raiders of rifle rock



slapped his knee and broke into a loud
laugh

  id shore like to have seen hatcher that
worthless skunk has had it cornin to him
for a long time

 then i can hole up here morgan
asked

  shore but wed best not say nothin to the
boys yuhre just a new hand buck henry
pinched his lips together with his fingers
and looked shrewdly at morgan im takin
a long gamble on yuh pilgrim and the word

of his coming the conference with the dia-
mond h owner and morgan did nothing to
explain

  the next morning he rolled out with the
rest after breakfast he roped and saddled
his horse and waited orders for the days
work the rancher and his son divided the
men one group riding north toward the
m bar c line morgan rode with them just
behind young jed

  when they reached the line fence jed
detailed the men to check it for breaks

im telliri yuh boss-yuh
cant bring a bunch of gun-
slicks and rustlers to this
ranch

toreman hoodoo turner of
the rocking m spoke sharply-but ranch
owner dan mallory merely shrugged

  slade corrigan and his crew are here
to stay he announced i cant rightly ex-
plain it now but thats how things are
the new regime at the rocking m leads
to plenty of gun trouble-and the mystery
keeps right on deepening until wayne mor-
gan the masked rider and his faithful
yaqui pard blue hawk take a hand in the
game then a sinister plot explodes wide open

  its more than thrilling-its a rip-snorting humdinger from the word go-
ghost guns by donald bayne hobart a masked rider novel packed with
excitement and action in every paragraph

coming in the next issue

of an outlaw about yuh thats a mighty
shaky loop dont do nothin thatd make
me plumb suspicious and change my mind

 ill just ride yore range and do yore
work until i hear from the masked rider
said morgan but dont be surprised none
if i aint around some mornin reckon id
best get out to the bunkhouse now

 he arose and old henry walked with him
out into the yard and to the bunkhouse
there he was introduced as a new hand and
given an empty bunk in which he dumped
his bed-roll no explanation was given to
the men and they eyed morgan with curi-
osity

  after the boss had left the men started
that slow guarded speech by which they
greeted a stranger morgan was friendly
enough and gradually the men thawed but
they were still puzzled by the circumstance

others spread out to tally on diamond h
cows that were in the vicinity

  morgan realized that they must be close
to where the cattle had been stolen the day
before he and a stubby bow-legged cow-
boy named top turned eastward along
the fence

  there was no sign of break in the fence
top told of the rustling of the day before
and the way it had been discovered speak-
ing in the long drawling accents of the
typical texan morgan only half listened
for the method was an old story to him

  the two of them crested a small rise and
morgan saw a row of trees along a narrow
stream he also saw a break in the fence
and called tops attention to it they spurred
forward

  morgan drew rein close to the fence and
looked down at the ground there were


masked rider western

traces of the stolen cattle and in two places
morgan saw the clear track of a horse
he straightened following the trail with
his eyes into m bar c range

  even as he was studying the trail with
startling suddenness three men rode out of
the cottonwoods beyond the line fence they
were close before morgan knew of their
presence top grunted a soft warning

 m bar c rannies and their segundo
keep your colt loose

 morgan had seen limp denton for an
instant he had thought to rein around and
ride off but knew it was useless for al-
ready the segundo had spotted him wayne
morgan slouched a little in his saddle and
his hands carelessly dropped close to the
colts snuggled to his thighs his mild blue
eyes chilled a bit but there was nothing
else to show his tension

  denton and his men came riding closer
they slowed their horses and edged up to
the line limps dark eyes filled with anger
as he stared at morgan his hand trembled
a little on the saddle-horn

 so yuh were a diamond h rider he
snapped how did yuh get out of jail
walked out morgan answered placidly
and limps anger boiled over

  yuh killin snake he said through set
teeth and his hand flashed down to his
holster

  morgans hands blurred and the heavy
colts jumped up to cover the three m bar
c riders they froze fingers still taloned
over their gun butts top gasped in amaze-
ment at morgans speed the wandering
cowboy sat bleak-faced guns steady

  yuh come close to killin yoreself den-
ton he drawled dont try that again did
yuh come over this way to rustle some
more diamond h critters

  look whos talking limp flared  try-
in to cover yore own tracks by raising dust
top this hombre yuh ride with shot zack
mccloud he was arrested for it and i dont
know how he got out of jail hes wanted
and wanted bad tell henry he shore
brought trouble to his spread

  turn around denton morgan said qui-
etly and keep ridin back home itll be
a heap healthier all around

  lenton sneered at him openly and there
was a light of suppressed triumph in his
eyes without a word he turned his horse
and spoke a brief order to his men they
gave morgan a long hard look then rode
after their boss not once did they look
back and morgan remained still and motion-
less

  at last he holstered his guns he caught
tops sliding glance and knew the puncher
had been studying him morgan said noth-
ing but he sensed a coldness in tops atti-
tude the texas cowboy became as silent

as he had been talkative before the en-
counter with limp morgan still said noth-
ing and soon top spoke curtly

  i reckon wed better be gettin back to
jed hell want to know about this fence
they rode back along the fence both
men silent now and then top glanced at
morgan from the corner of his eyes his
expression slowly changed from one of sus-
picion to deep dislike he edged his horse
a little further from morgan at last they
came up to jed henry

 met denton and some m bar c boys
top said coldly found the break in the
fence denton made some claims about mor-
gan here but i reckon he can tell yuh what
about

jed looked up alarmed any trouble
none morgan said quietly denton had
some ideas about makin a ruckus but he
changed his mind id like to talk to yuh
jed

  he rode off a distance with jed henry
the young mans face was puzzled and
twisted with worry morgan finally drew
rein out of earshot of the rest of the men

  denton accused me of shootin zack and
top heard him he said i reckon the rest
of the boys will know about it soon im
pullin stakes jed denton is shore to send
hatcher out here and yuh wont have no
trouble if i aint around tell hatcher yuh
found out about me and let me go

  what will yuh do jed asked

  im ridin back to the ranch now may
hang around until tonight dont worry
about me jed thats gardners job say
was gardner always a saloonkeeper

  i dont rightly know jed answered
surprised ive heard he used to manage
or own a mine somewheres but lost it gam-
blin ive heard its all just talk

  thanks that clears up a point mor-
gan smiled tightly tell yore boys to keep
their dander down   well ill be ridin
back to the home ranch

  he wheeled his horse around and started
away across the range toward the distant
diamond h jed watched him a while then
slowly turned back to his men

chapter x

open warfare

little after noon morgan
reached the diamond h build-
ings limp denton he knew
would not as yet have had
time to reach rifle rock and
report morgan to hatcher but
sooner or later the sheriff
would be on his way smarting
under the trick that had been
played on him

  buck henry was not around the spread
raiders of rifle rock	

and the cook fixed a meal for morgan when
the waddy had finished eating he came out
of the cookshack door leaned against the
building and looked toward the barn he
caught a slight flicker of movement at one
corner and blue hawk gave him a quick
signal morgan casually straightened and
strolled toward the bam blue hawk waited
behind it

  two strangers have come to rifle rock
the yaqui reported and king gardner is
much excited

  do yuh know who they were

 yes senor blue hawk nodded one
is a mining man the other is from a rail-
road and he argues with senor hatcher the
sheriff will not let him leave town

  minin and railroad morgan exclaimed
blue hawk gardners bein pushed faster
than he planned to go theyre callin his
hand on the sale of rifle valley and gard-
ner has to produce thingsll break wide
open blue hawk

  it is time senor

  yes its time morgan answered gravely
he touched his holstered colts time for
gunsmoke and a heap of killin

  morgan told blue hawk to meet him out
on the range then he returned to the bunk-
house gathered up his bed-roll and then
went to the corral in a short time he had
his horse roped and saddled the cook
watched him mount

  yuh shore didnt work here long he
exclaimed

 yuhd be surprised how long i been
workin for buck henry morgan said and
grinned he waved his hand adios ami-
go ill be ridin this way again

  he rode out of the yard cut a little to the
right and headed for a distant grove of trees
blue hawk met him there and the yaqui
fell in beside him morgan set off in a direct
line for the hide-out which they reached
with all speed

  in the canyon pocket he dismounted and
changed his saddle to midnight the stallion
was all eagerness to be racing down the
dangerous trails the masked rider always
took morgan grinned at the horse and
glanced up at the western sky there was
still plenty of daylight but the sun had dis-
appeared behind the peaks

  just keep yore patience midnight he
muttered yuhll have plenty of runnin to
do before this rifle valley trouble is over
blue hawk had the coffee on when morgan
returned to the fire the yaqui silently
prepared the meal and morgan sat down
beside the glowing embers he stared into
the fire his quick brain trying to foresee
the moves gardner would make he would
work fast now to gain control of the valley
driving out the henrys and the mcclouds
those gunslammers who worked under
snake bannon would earn their pay from

now on morgans face became grim and
hard

  after the meal he returned to midnight
and opened the saddle roll shortly it was
the masked rider who mounted midnight
and headed for the mouth of the canyon
blue hawk followed on the pinto checking
the rifle and shoving it back in the boot
under his right leg

  free of the canyon they turned toward
rifle rock before they had ridden many
miles night settled on the range and the
masked rider increased his speed at the
edge of the town he drew rein and blue
hawk rode up close beside him

  where are these strangers yuh told me
about stayin the man in black asked

  both in the hotel said the indian but
the railroad man spends most of his time
arguing at the sheriffs office

  im taking a look at both these gents
the masked rider said softly youll have
to act as look-out blue hawk

  you can depend on it senor the indian
said simply

  the masked rider worked in a wide loop
around the town drifting up into the dark
back yard of the jail he dismounted and
silent as a shadow moved along the side of
the building the cells were empty but a
light glowed from the office the masked
rider eased forward close to the window
and peered in

  a young man was pacing back and forth
before the battered desk he was tall and
tanned and obviously angry hatcher was
leaning back in his chair whittling his face
set in stubborn lines

he steady thump of heels came clearly
 to the masked rider then the young
man stopped beside the desk and leaned over
it

  but hatcher the masked man outside
heard him say this survey was scheduled
long ago my company has been corre-
sponding with gardner about it

  cant help that hatcher grunted seems
like yuhd be glad of a chance to loaf around
the hotel a few days

  my jobs surveying railroads the young
man snapped not loafing this spur line
to the pecos mines is needed itll cut wagon
hauling completely out and save a hundred
miles if trains can go down through rifle
valley and over the pecos ridge

  thats the mines trouble not mine
hatcher growled he looked up muddy eyes
glinting with anger now you listen here
im doin this to protect yuh theres a
wanted killer loose in the valley i cant let
yore surveyin crew out of my sight the
lobo might kill all of yuh

hatcher the young man snapped ive
told you we can take care of ourselves
listen edwards hatcher barked his
	masked rider western

patience gone yuh got my orders you
stay in rifle rock till i tell yuh to leave
if yuh aint got sense enough to stay in a
safe place on yore own then ill make yuh
stay

  listen you stubborn- edwards began
but hatchers angry roar broke in the
sheriffs chair thumped down hard on the
floor as he pushed away from the wall

  get out of here or ill lock yuh up
and yore whole blamed crew im tired argu-
in you stay in rifle rock

  the young man called edwards remained
leaning over the desk his face became
pinched and his nostrils flared then slowly
he straightened and pulled down the sleeves
of his coat he started to say something
but changed his mind turned and stalked
out the door the masked rider heard his
steps echoing and fading along the planked
sidewalk in the direction of the hotel

  hatcher sank back in his chair and picked
up his stick and knife again the anger left
his face to be replaced by a thoughtful
worried look he stared for a long time
at the opposite wall then shook his head
and started whittling

  the masked rider slipped away from the
window and cat-footed back to blue hawk
he swung into saddle checking midnights
eagerness to be off

  hatcher is holdin up a railroad survey
through the valley the man in black told
blue hawk hes stallin and the surveyor
aint goin to take much more of it

  this must have been the new road that
gardner spoke about senor blue hawk
said quietly

  it is the railroad will buy right-of-
way through the m bar c and diamond h
gardner wants that dinero and the only way
he can get it is to own the ranches blue
hawk that smilin renegade saloon man
has a big killin planned railroad money
and hes also found a copper deposit some-
wheres in the valley its a big deal and
gardners doin everything he can to swing
it his way i can see limps place in gard-
ners plans right now

  how about the other stranger senor
blue hawk suggested his room is at the
hotel

  yuh know which one

  yes its on the second floor front there
is a long hall senor and a lean-to in back
that is just below an upper window

  made for our purpose the masked rider
chuckled lets make a call at the hotel
the hotel was up the street and on the
same side as the jail it was a two-story
frame building not large the masked rider
saw that entry by an upper window would
be easy he dismounted again loosened the
colts in his holster and slipped to the lean-
to his powerful muscles pulled him up on-
to the shaky roof

  he remained there a moment listening
then noiselessly went up the pitch of the roof
and crouched just below a dimly lit window
he carefully raised his head and peered in-
side he looked down the upper hallway

  the mining mans room was at the far
end and the masked rider could see the
closed door the other doors also were shut
and the hallway deserted the robin hood
outlaw tested the window and discovered
that it was unlocked slowly he raised the
sash a delicate job if he was to prevent
noise

  at last he stood erect on the roof and
raised the sash higher one booted foot
swung inside to the floor and then the black-
cloaked figure stood erect in the hall there
was no sound from the near-by rooms but
a muffled laugh sounded from behind the
door at the end of the hall

  the masked rider cat-footed down the
corridor the voices became clearer aiyl
he recognized gardners laugh a deeper
voice spoke with sudden seriousness

  these samples are interesting gard-
ner

  theres plenty more powell that was
the saloon man answering ive done some
minin in the past and i know a rich de-
posit when i see one yore mines are al-
ready just over the ridge at the pecos and
theres a railroad cornin through here what
more could yuh want

  frankly nothing more answered the
man who had first spoken our geologists
and surveyors will give us the full value of
the deposit you have clear title to this land
of course

ardner hesitated just a moment

  to most of it powell he said then
id shore like a little time to complete a
dicker though-a matter of a few days then
there wont be any worry about titles

  i guess you can have that short a time
gardner but id like to complete these
options while im here say three days for
you in swinging your deal at the end of
that time well sign contracts with the land
owners whether you or someone else

  three days is mighty short gardner
objected

  but my times valuable gardner i have
other things to do and i cant stay in rifle
valley indefinitely no three days should
be sufficient if your negotiations are as far
along as you say they are

  all right-three days gardner accept-
ed and then a note of caution came into his
voice powell could yuh keep quiet about
why yuhre here

so you can buy cheap powell laughed
well so long as everythings legal why
not we pay the same rate to you as to
someone else so we cant gain or lose ill
keep quiet and now how about a drink to
raiders of rifle rock

seal our bargain three days and my si-
lence

  the masked rider slipped away from the
door and back to the window in another
moment he was outside and slipping down
the roof of the lean-to he jumped lightly
to the ground there he rejoined blue
hawk and the two rode slowly back to the
jail keeping in the deep shadows behind
the buildings

  so gardner had just three days in which
to complete his land grab the masked rider
was thinking and the copper was up at
the head of pecos ridge previous surveys
of the mining company men must have
missed it gardner riding over the valley
since the time he had started his saloon had
stumbled onto it

  his trained eye had instantly judged its
worth and he had started scheming to get
the lode for himself

wust as they neared the jail blue hawk
   interrupted his thoughts

 listen senor a man comes riding-
fast

  the masked rider hoard the steady rapid
beat of hoofs a ridet was coming into
town and coming in a hurry the man in
black spoke a word to blue hawk and
swung out of leather he wanted a look at
the man he was slipping along the jail
toward the street when he froze

  the hoofbeats grew louder and then the
masked rider glimpsed the horseman who
pulled his mount to a sliding halt in front of
the jail and burst inside the office the
masked rider heard hatchers chair thump
down

 bart malones excited voice sounded
through the window

  wheres limp

  i dunno hatcher answered he was
here awhile back reckon hes at the win-
chester has somethin happened

  they finally got zack bart gritted
somebody slipped into his room and knifed
him hes dead

  the masked rider stiffened in the dark-
ness and his fist clenched grim-faced he
listened to hatchers grunt of surprise and
the man outside in the darkness heard the
false note in it that malone completely
missed

  hatcher swore luridly

 its that wayne morgan jasper he
barked i know where we can get him
too yuh go to the winchester and get
limp bart have him get the m bar c
crew together ill get a posse here

 wheres morgan hidin malone de-
manded

  at the diamond h hatcher said grimly
limp and a couple of yore boys rode in to
report it this afternoon you get limp
im goin to be busy



chapter xi

gunsmoke

alone hurried out of the sher-
iffs office and soon hatcher
followed him the masked
rider hurried back to blue
hawk and the two rode quickly
out of the town in the dark-
ness the masked mans face
was hard and grim
he set a fast pace so that
blue hawks pinto was hard
pressed to keep up with him but the
masked rider hurried on gardner had at
last eliminated one of the key men between
himself and wealth zack mccloud was
gone now only the girl rita stood between
the saloon man and the m bar c

  hatcher of course would gather all of
bannons gunhawks into his posse and with
the m bar c outfit with him to a man
certain as they would be that morgan and
the henrys were behind the murder of mc-
cloud the posse would be a formidable
fighting force with the sheriff at their head
their actions would take on the cloak of
legality they would wipe out the diamond
h and the henrys leaving gardner with a
clear field to sweep up the land and close
the deal with the mining and railroad com-
panies mcclouds death had been per-
fectly timed

  moreover if the henrys were wiped out
resisting an illegal arrest by an illegal posse
there would be no heirs to the diamond h
the ranch and all the henry holdings would
revert to the territory and be disposed of
by order of the court at sheriffs sale the
masked rider felt certain that king gardner
had enough control of the situation to make
sure that he himself would be able to bid
in the property then the only other per-
son then standing in his way for a clean-up
would be rita mccloud

  king gardner hiding behind hatchers
lawless posse had at last brought open war
to rifle valley the first thing that would
happen would be that the diamond h would
have no owner by dawn unless-

 the masked rider urged midnight to
greater speed he pushed the stallion hard
flinging over his shoulder to blue hawk
how he figured out the new developments

  the pinto dropped further and further
behind and at last blue hawk swung his
mount toward the hide-out as the masked
rider pressed on blue hawk would change
mounts then follow on to the diamond h
it would probably mean that the yaqui
would be to the rear of the renegade posse
and in position to use his deadly rifleto
good effect if it was needed

  on through the night the masked rider
rode he knew that by now hatchers posse
	masked rider western

of gunhawks would be gathered limp den-
ton would be riding to the m bar c to
gather that crew for the diamond h kill
hatchers men would strike first though
before the m bar c outfit could arrive and
the masked rider began to see a way to
beat the combination that was shaping up
against buck henry and his son jed

  he swept down on the diamond h and
into the deserted yard he was out of the
saddle and plunging up the steps to the
ranchhouse door almost before midnight had
halted alarmed shouts came from the bunk-
house but he paid no attention to them his
fists beat an imperative summons on the
door and buck henry jerked it open

  instantly the masked rider stepped in-
side

  tell yore boys its all right mr henry
he said hastily but tell em to get ready
for war

  war henry repeated dazedly

  plenty of it the masked rider snapped
get out there or yore crew will be gun-
nin for me and well lose a lot of time
its runnin short

  buck henry shook his head and stepped
out the door he stopped the rush of cow-
boys to the house coming to the defense
of their boss he told them to get saddled
and check their guns and ammunition he
came back in just as jed stepped into the
kitchen from the front of the house he
stopped short watching the masked rider
he showed no fear

  ive heard a heap about yuh hombre
he said quietly all of it good i dont savvy
why they call yuh an outlaw

  thanks jed the masked rider smiled
he whirled to face jeds father mr henry
-hatcher bannon and all his gunhawks are
ridin here as a posse limp denton is rid-
in to get his m bar c boys and hit yuh
from another direction rifle valley is ready
to blow up

  why buck henry asked

  zack mccloud was knifed to death and
wayne morgan is accused of the job hatcher
knows he was here limp denton told him
zack killed henry exclaimed

  poor rita jed said quietly

  thats just the excuse the masked man
said i think i know who killed mccloud
and it wasnt wayne morgan it was one of
gardners men or one who worked with
him

  that saloonkeeper buck henry snorted
yes yuh underrated gardner all along
mr henry hes behind the whole deal did
yuh know that theres a big copper deposit
up in the pecos ridge that a minin com-
pany wants to corral did yuh know the
railroad plans to run a spur to the mines
beyond the pecos right through this valley
jumping catamounts old henry sank
down in a chair staring

the masked rider went on speaking rap-
idly

 gardner knew these things gardner
spotted the copper and gardner knows the
railroad will have to build across m bar c
and diamond h land gardner couldnt see
any reason why you and mccloud should
profit by what he knew with the help of his
renegade gunslammers he rustled both of
yuh hes tried to get you two fightin
either wiped out or ruined then at a pub-
lic sheriffs sale hatcher would see that the
range was knocked down to him he could
then sell land to the railroad and mineral
rights and options to the minin companies

  that saloonkeeper buck henry half-
whispered

  he was a minin man in the past hes
shrewd and cold and determined to carry
this crooked deal through no matter how
many men are killed his own gain is all
that counts with him bannon is his right- 
hand man and hatchers law is gardners
law

  then whynt we just throw a loop around
the gent and turn him over to a u s mar-
shal if hatcher wont do nothin jed
asked

 proof the masked rider snapped
where is it i know what gardner plans
and ive convinced you but could yuh go
into a court and make anybody believe it

  how about this raid thats cornin buck
henry bristled

  hatcher is in charge of that the masked
robin hood outlaw told him and hes corn-
in to arrest a man whos wanted by the
law what could be more legal but weve
talked enough and hatcher will be here
mighty soon mr henry yuh tell yore men
to follow my orders

  old henry lifted his head and stared hard
into the steady cold blue eyes behind the
domino mask he glanced at jed who nod-
ded slightly the rancher pulled himself out
of the chair

  yuhre in charge i reckon he said
simply ill tell the boys

  the masked rider stepped to the table
and blew out the lamp

  no lights anywhere he ordered

  he stepped outside with buck henry and
his son the cowboys stared in amazement
at the masked cloaked figure their boss
raised his hand for silence

  this heres the masked rider henry
told them i reckon yuhve heard of him
and the things hes done for folks in trouble
well the diamond h is in a bad pinch and
well burn powder before long you take
orders from the masked rider what he
says goes and im backin him to the limit

  one of you men blow out the lamps in
the bunkhouse and cook-shack the masked
rider ordered saddle hosses for mr
henry and jed
raiders of

 aint we makin a stand here jed
asked

  thats what hatcher and gardner will
expect well do a little surprisin the
masked rider smiled coldly

  soon there was not a glimmer of light in
any of the buildings jed and his father
mounted their horses and the masked rider
looked over the band of men carefully and
deliberately

  one mistake he warned and the dia-
mond h can be wiped out i want every
man to do exactly as hes told lets ride

 he jumped down the steps and swung
into leather wheeling midnight around he
led the way out of the yard at a fast pace
the diamond h hands strung out behind
him

  as the masked rider rode he tried to
judge about where hatchers posse would
be by now he had a fair idea figuring by the
time elapsed since he had left rifle rock
and recalled a small grove of trees about
two miles further along would be sufficient
cover for the diamond h that would be
as good a place as any to spring his sur-
prise

  that posse of killers masking their evil
intent behind a law badge would destroy
the diamond h if they reached it the
masked rider was grimly determined that
they should not

  when he caught sight of the grove of trees
ahead he knew he had arrived well ahead
of the posse he ordered the men into hid-
ing warning them to keep the horses from
making any sound buck henry and jed
drew in close to him

  well stop hatcher right here the
masked rider told them there wont be
much of a parley them renegades will
tart shootin pronto

  how yuh goin to challenge em the
rancher asked

  ill take that risk their attentionll be
on me at the first sign of trouble hit em
and hit em hard i figger surprise will do
the rest

  he said a few more words then sent the
two henrys to join their men he rode out
a little distance pulled up midnight and
waited

  it was not a long wait he heard the low
rumble of horses hoofs before the posse
came in sight he lifted his colts a frac-
tion from the holsters then dropped them
back

  soon he saw the dark mass of the posse
they rode compactly for the diamond h
and would pass the cottonwoods several
yards to the left a touch of the reins and
midnight moved to intercept them the
posse had come abreast of the trees when
the masked rider challenged them

 pull up hatcher yuhre goin no
further

rifle rock	

wnstantly the gunhawks pulled up

  three horsemen detached themselves from
the mass and rode forward as they came
closer the masked rider recognized hatcher
snake bannon and gardner at the same
instant hatcher let out an amazed oath

  the masked rider yuh got plenty of
nerve hombre yuhre under arrest

  his hand dropped down to his gun at
the same moment bannon and gardner
made their play midnight jumped forward
and the move completely surprised the three
the fighting black stallion was on them be-
fore their guns could clear leather hatch-
ers mount went down with a squeal of fear
bannons gun cleared and he fired wildly

  the masked rider had not as yet touched
his colts midnight scattered the three and
streaked for the trees bannons single wild
shot was the signal for the diamond h the
men swept out of the cottonwoods and struck
the renegades

  instantly guns blasted the posse milled
in wild uncertainty the masked rider
circled back guns drawn now bannon and
gardner had exploded into action trying
to join the posse and direct the fight hatcher
came to his feet cursing trying to find his
gun that had been knocked from his hand
in the dark of the night the swift movement
of horsemen the lancing dart of gun flame
and the steady roar of colts made everything
confusion

  the masked riders guns came in to the
battle a renegade charged at him out of
the milling shadows gun winking evilly as
lead sang around the masked riders head
midnight swerved slightly and the twin
colts bucked back in the masked riders
hand the renegade tumbled out of the
saddle hit the ground and lay sprawling

  action was fast and furious diamond h
had caught the renegades completely by sur-
prise bunched directed by the owner of
the spread and his son the diamond h
crew had split the posse wide open it was
no longer a unit but little knots of sur-
prised bewildered gunhawks who had no
stomach for the killing lead coming their
way the attempt they made to stand was
only half-hearted

  the long suppressed anger of the diamond
h waddies found release in this attack
they had quietly stood by too long while
their cattle was stolen and their ranch
smirched with charges of rustling the rene-
gade posse was something tangible to fight
at last with wild exultant yells diamond
h rode down the killers saddles emptied
cowboys seemed everywhere at once

  almost as if a signal had been given
the renegades broke and ran in every direc-
tion vainly the masked rider tried to find
king gardner or snake bannon but in
the dust and darkness it was impossible to
distinguish any particular man
masked rider western



  his shouted command brought the dia-
mond h hands up short in their pursuit of
the fleeing posse the masked rider did
not want the cowboys themselves split up
easy prey for limp denton and his m bar c
should the segundo be near enough by now
to strike

  the cowboys reluctantly returned

  heres our sheriff lookin for his six
buck henry suddenly yelled in triumph

  the masked rider swung in the direction
of henrys voice he found the tubby
rancher grinning down over a leveled six
at hatchers twisted face the diamond h
silently ringed the lawman who kept glar-
ing from one to the other

  yuh fired on a legal posse hatcher
exploded yuh sheltered two men wanted
by the law-wayne morgan and the masked
rider now yuh all wear the owlhoot
brand

  yuhre bluffin nobody hatcher the
masked rider said quietly yuhre finished
in rifle rock and so is gardner mr
henry take him to the ranch hell have
till mornin to talk if he hasnt told what
he knows by the time we ride to get gard-
ner then hell go to jail with the rest of
em

  hatcher sobered buck henry gave curt
orders for him to mount one of the rider-
less horses that stood near-by without a
word of protest the hulking sheriff obeyed
the cowboys circled him and headed for
the diamond h the masked rider called
old henry over

  im ridin to the m bar c he informed
if some of these gunhawks run into limp
hes liable to turn back i dont think hell
want to run into the trap that gardner did

  what can yuh do at the m bar c the
rancher asked

  tell rita mccloud to have her boys in
rifle rock tomorrow for the show-down i
want the diamond h there too mr henry
but hold yore boys in there might be
trouble but keep yore sixes in leather till
yuh get the word from me ill be there

chester and take yore boys inside dont

thing thats important be there just be-
fore noon

  ill be there buck henry replied firmly
and i hope yuh aint makin any mistake

  i hope so too mr henry but im cer-
tain im right see yuh in rifle rock tomor-
row at noon-at the winchester and peace-
ful

  the masked rider rode off into the dark-
ness soon he gave the call of the mountain
lion and it was answered immediately blue
hawk came out of the darkness riding the
roan his stern face broke in a brief smile

  diamond h fights well senor he said

the gunhawks are all scattered

  seen the m bar c the masked rider
asked

  no senor

  the masked rider urged midnight to a
fast pace cutting across the range toward
the m bar c he half expected to meet the
cowboys riding to attack the diamond h
but there was no sign of them the masked
rider sighed with relief

  some of the gunhawks must have met
limp and told their story the segundo of
the m bar c was not willing to attack a
spread that would be ready and waiting for
him

chapter xii

the man with a scar

astening steadily onward
the two companions of the trgil
were silent now intent on
reaching the distant ranch at
last when they saw the lights
of the spread the masked
rider pulled up

  well scout the place blue
hawk mebbe gardner or ban-
non is there i want to know
before i try to reach miss mccloud

  blue hawk nodded and the two men drift-
ed slowly up to the shadow of the big barn
they dismounted neither midnight nor the
roan would make any attempt to whinny

  the yaqui and the man in black edged
around the corner of the barn and slipped
across the darkened yard they crouched
below the window of the bunkhouse and
slowly raised their heads looking within

  the m bar c hands were clustered around
two men who had ridden with hatcher and
had fled from the fight at the cottonwoods
the masked riders eyes widened when he
had a clear glimpse of one of the gunhawks
he had a stabbled red beard a scar pulled
down his heavy loose lips and disappeared
under the jaw-bone blue hawk dropped
instantly below the window when the masked
rider touched him

  i want the hombre with the scarred face
blue hawk can yuh get him alive without
alarmin the rest

  he must come out sometime senor
blue hawk whispered i will have him
good hold him at the hide-out ill join
yuh there

  yes senor blue hawk whispered again
the masked rider faded away from the
bunkhouse carefully circling it he worked
his way cat-footed to the ranchhouse a
light burned in a room to the front but the
rear was dark the masked man carefully
tested the back door and it swung silently
open he slipped inside and closed it from
raiders of rifle rock	

some room in the front ritas voice sounded
clearly

  limp you should have ridden on to help
the sheriff

  yuhve changed yore mind aint yuh
rita came limps swift answer too bad
it took yore fathers life to wake yuh up to
the sidewindin henrys

  dont limp the girls voice was agon-
ized i was wrong youve proved it

  the masked rider slipped down the dark-
ened hall pressed against the wall limp
spoke again this time his voice soft and
vibrant

  rita with yore father dead the henrys
are going to strike hard again and mighty
soon yuh need a man to protect yuh rita
and see that yuh aint harmed ive loved
yuh all along even when yuh wouldnt so
much as look at me

  not now limp the girl begged chok-
ingly

  but nows the time the renegade per-
sisted the parson could marry us right
here secret we could tell folks whenever
yuh think it the right time to but yuhre in
trouble and yuh need my help

  there was a deep silence the masked
rider took a single long stride and noise-
lessly entered the room rita sat by the
window head bowed limp stood beside
her his back to the masked rider he leaned
over the girl

  say yes rita he pleaded

  wait until tomorrow the masked rider
said quietly

  limp whirled as though he had heard a
rattler rita gasped and her fine eyes grew
wide when she saw the masked figure stand-
ing in the door her face showed the ravages
of grief and tears limps hand dropped to
his gun but the masked riders colt covered
him with the speed of light

  limp denton is lyin to yuh miss rita
the masked rider said gravely i can prove
it can yore boys be at the winchester
tomorrow at noon yuhll find out then
whos behind the whole trouble in rifle
valley who shot yore father and who the
man is who finally killed him

  yuh lie limp blazed

  the masked riders cold eyes bored into
his

  the henrys are innocent he continued
calmly and yuhll see its true miss rita
if yuh ride to rifle rock i wonder if den-
ton here dares be at the meetin

  limps face contorted in an angry snarl
despite the steady gun leveled at him he
made a suicidal play for his own six the
masked rider fired as limps six cleared
leather the gun smashed out of his fin-
gers and limp grabbed his hand

  make limp come the masked rider
said with swift intentness to rita

  he moved around limp and opened the

front door he stepped outside leaving the
girl stunned her eyes large and round in
her drawn face the masked rider cut
away from the house gun still ready in his
fist he heard men out in the yard and
someone pounded on the back door the
masked rider vaulted the yard fence then
cut along it toward the bam

rthe house door flew open and limps
-angry voice yelled orders

  hes out front here somewheres get
the masked son shoot him down

  the masked rider reached the barn and
midnight he could hear m bar c men
call to one another as they scattered through
the yard their search would soon turn in
his direction the robin hood outlaw spoke
a quiet word to midnight black horse and
rider drifted silently off into the night

  when he reached the hide-out the masked
rider discovered that blue hawk had al-
ready arrived there with the man with the
scarred face the indian had taken prisoner
at the m bar c

 the red-bearded man whom the masked
rider had heard spoken of as scar cow-
ered before the fire and the flames lighted
the livid scar that pulled down his lips and
disappeared under his jaw he glanced fear-
fully at the silent yaqui who stood beside
him and then to the masked and cloaked
figure that strode over and stood before
him in neither pair of stem eyes did he
see any mercy

  i know you shot zack mccloud in rifle
rock the masked rider said with grim
finality yuhre bannons tool and he took
orders from king gardner that right
the man licked his loose ups his hands
were tightly tied behind his back there
would be no escape from this little pocket
in the canyon his hard eyes wavered and
dropped

  why should i tell yuh he asked in a
whining voice

  if yuh dont yuh wont live long-i can
promise yuh that if yuh do i might see
that yuh get a chance to get off easier
were after the leader in this deal not the
small fry like you

  thats a promise scar asked quickly
a promise tell yore story in rifle rock
tomorrow before witnesses and ill see that
yuhre not harmed by anybody after yuhve
told yore story and its straight itll be the
old story of yore turnin states evidence
and ill personally see to it that it sticks
it means a prison sentence shore though
it can be shown yuh was roped in as a tool
for somebody else the pens a heap better
than a rope at that

  scar considered the proposition there
wasnt much choice that he could see one
way this grim indian would probably knife
him if he didnt talk the other way he had
is	masked rider western

at least a chance for life and maybe this
masked man could get him a fairly light
sentence or maybe sometime he could es-
cape

  ill tell what i know he agreed itll
be the truth king gardner hisself gave
me orders to shoot mccloud i bungled the
job mccloud was to be killed

  then yuh knifed him this time-to make
it good the masked rider accused grimly

  n-no i didnt scar stammered swiftly
i wasnt near the m bar c when denton-
he shut up suddenly

  the masked rider laughed and arose

  thats what i wanted to know bring
him to rifle rock tomorrow blue hawk
ive got some more witnesses to corral be-
fore momin

  he left the fire and soon scar and the
yaqui heard the fading pound of midnights
hoofs down the canyon

  the masked rider rode straight for rifle
rock he was tired but he had to keep
going just one or two more pieces to fit into
the picture and the puzzle would be com-
pleted it had to be done by the time dia-
mond h and m bar c gathered in the win-
chester a few hours from now he urged
midnight to greater speed

  the masked rider knew that rita mc-
cloud would be present a clever bait had
been placed before the girl-the identity
of her fathers killer-and rita would come
to rifle rock to find that man he felt cer-
tain that limp denton also would be there
the man dared not draw suspicion on him-
self no matter how much he feared what
the meeting might bring

  when at last the masked rider reached
the outskirts of the town everything was
dark it lacked less than two hours until
dawn moving like a ghost the masked
rider rode to the rear of the hotel by
means of the lean-to he again climbed to
the second story and through the window
to the hallway

  he cat-footed along the hall to the front
and knocked lightly on the door panel he
knocked again he heard bed springs squeal
and a sleepy voice called out in protest

  what do you want

  yuhre mixed up in plenty of trouble
powell better talk to me now than talk
in jail	

  there was strained silence then the
masked rider heard bare feet slap across
the floor light suddenly glowed under the
crack of the door it was flung open and
the masked rider quickly stepped inside
his six-gun covered the nightshirted figure
powells mustache bristled in his square face

  is this a hold-up he demanded

  it is not the man with the guns said
grimly yore company has offered an op-
tion or is about to to king gardner for
mineral riahts in rifle valiev that offer has

caused a range war several deaths and a
murder do yuh want to clear yore company
of complicity in those charges

jwowell ran his hand through his shock
of black hair streaked here and there
with gray he abruptly turned and waved
to a chair

  sit down wed better get to the bottom
of things put that colt away youve got
my attention completely without the hard-
ware

 an hour later powell went down the
hall and knocked at another door its occu-
pant answered almost immediately powell
stepped inside and a moment later both
men returned swiftly and silently to pow-
ells room

  this is the masked rider powell said
to edwards the young surveyor who was
with him he wants to talk to you about
king gardner and your company i think
youll be amazed at the things he has to 
say

  the surveyor sat down gingerly eyeing
the black mask and the glittering crossed
gun-belts but the blue eyes behind the
mask were friendly and the lips beneath
the mask smiled edwards found himself
losing his uncertainty and fear talking free-
ly under the quick questioning of the
masked man

  the first false dawn was in the sky when
a cloaked and masked figure dropped lithely
off the roof of the lean-to and ran to a
black stallion he swung into saddle neck-
reined the horse and soon disappeared be-
yond the town rifle rock slept peacefully
on   

 king gardner came to the winchester
late that morning his face looked tired
and drawn and the green eyes were clouded
with worry his smile was completely miss-
ing and he only growled when snake ban-
non came in the big gunhawk stepped
behind the bar and poured himself a shot
of liquor

  seen hatcher he asked

  that cowardly coyote vanished with the
first shot gardner snarled hell show
up in a day or two when he thinks its
safe snake we muffed things pretty bad
last night weve got just one day left to
take care of the henrys

  how about m bar c snake asked

  limp will have rita mccloud married
to him by noon gardner chuckled with
zack dead we shouldnt have any trouble
with the girl limp workin for us its the
diamond h that worries me i shore wish
hatcher would show up

 speakin of diamond h bannon
drawled take a look out the winder

  gardner turned saw buck henry and his
son jed leading the diamond h crew into
town he watched them ereen eves soark-
raiders of rifle rock

ing with anger and then turned to bannon
his fist pounding on the bar

  we could make the arrest now if hatcher
was here everythings gone wrong whats
more edwards and his surveyin crew could
slip out easy and tell everybody the whole
story about the road if they were a-mind to
powell gave me some weak excuse this
mornin for not talkin about what hes
doin

  say bannon exclaimed whats henry
stoppin here for

  gardner jerked around to the window
again the diamond h had pulled in to the
winchester hitch-rack and the men had
dismounted gardner realized suddenly that
not a man of them wore a gun he looked at
bannon puzzled

  get out the back way he snapped ab-
ruptly round up the boys and bring em
here i dont like this

  bannon nodded and ran toward the back
he disappeared just before buck henry
pushed open the batwings and his crew
streamed in behind him gardner managed
a welcoming smile

  im surprised to see you gents in here
yuh generally go to the gunsight

  we got plumb curious about the win-
chester king buck henry replied affably
set the boys up to a drink

  gardner busied himself pouring drinks
but worry rode him with spurs something
was in the wind something threatening his
plans diamond h had come to the win-
chester for a definite purpose and he could
sense a hidden tension in these men who
leaned against his bar the two henrys
showed nothing by word or look what was
in their mind

  he began to feel a little better when the
first of his gunhawks drifted in the door
now he could have more control of the
situation

  buck henry noticed the gunslammers
trickle in and take seats here and there
about the room at the tables he smiled
slightly but paid them no more attention
snake came drifting in looked surprised to
see the diamond h

  lookin for trouble he demanded di-
rectly of old henry who chuckled

  not a bit yuh notice not a one of us
has a gun plumb peaceful and a proddy
gent would get hauled up for murder was
one of my boys salivated

  snake sent a quick look at king gardner
who bit his lip buck henry was right
despite all his gunhawks gardner couldnt
start any trouble even if hatcher was here
there would be no resistance to arrest and
that was what gardner wanted-a chance
to kill the rancher and his son legally this
whole thing was getting more puzzling and
more alarming

  a quarter of an hour passed the silence



became deeper more tense snake stood at
one end of the bar and betrayed his nerv-
ousness by the quick tattoo of his fingers on
the wood king gardner slopped whisky
over a glass when he poured for buck
henry the gunhawks stirred restlessly at
their tables puzzled and uneasy

  here comes m bar c old henry said
quietly i see miss rita is with em

  gardner looked out the window again
snake swore softly under his breath

 the m bar c pulled up to the hitch-
rack limp denton was with them but
there was something drawn and haggard in
his face his eyes shifted from rita mccloud
to the men all of them dismounted and
snakes surprised exclamation sounded loud
in the room

  the girls cornin in too is this whole
valley gone loco

chapter xiii

roundup in rifle rock

ita mccloud calmly mounted
the steps of the saloon with
her men and followed them in-
side limp denton avoided
gardners stare and the sa-
loonkeeper saw the hard-
checked panic in the segundos
eyes snake had swung around
staring rita flashed a look at
jed henry long and searching

  the young man took an impulsive step
toward her but the girl turned away gard-
ner caught himself firmly pushed down the
terrifying thoughts in his mind and hurried
around the bar he pulled out a chair from
one of the tables and rita coldly thanked
him as she sat down m bar c hands nar-
rowly watching the diamond h bunched
close around the girl

  gardner realized that limp was trying
to send some desperate signal to him but
gardner couldnt understand what it was
he choked down the tightness in his throat
something was definitely up and it had to
do with the rifle valley troubles he as-
sured himself that he was in the clear
completely unless limp lost his nerve

  it was almost noon when the back door
was quietly opened gardner swung around
at the gasp of surprise that echoed around
the room his eyes widened when he saw
the tall cloaked masked figure the eyes
behind the domino were cold and glittering
but the wide lips smiled

  well a deep voice said this is a regu-
lar roundup everyones on time

  snake bannon made a strangling noise
he pushed away from the bar and made
a fast play for his gun the heavy colt
had cleared leather before the masked rider
seemed to move then his hands dropped
	masked rider western

down and up with the speed of light ban-
nons shot and the roar of the masked
riders colt blended as one

  the door casing by the masked riders
head splintered as bannons slug smashed
into it snake himself stood stock-still his
face slack with stunned surprise his eyes
widened and his mouth opened as though
he wanted to speak then his short front
stained red his gun hand slowly lowered
and almost in slow motion his fingers
opened and the colt spun around and clat-
tered to the floor bannon swayed slightly
life left him with a rush and he collapsed
to the floor

  the masked rider looked over the room
both colts covering the gunhawks limp
denton and gardner remained frozen star-
ing down at snake bannons slack form
they looked up at the stern dark figure in
the doorway

  bannon at least was a fighter the cold
deep voice of the masked man said thats
more than can be said for the rest of the
sneakin snakes in this rifle valley trouble
gardner id welcome gunplay from you or
limp both of yuh deserve killin and im
goin to tell buck henry and rita mccloud
why

  gardner licked his lips nervously and kept
his hands in clear sight on the bar dentons
dark face grew a little pale and cold sweat
stood out on his forehead he looked trapped
ready to break but he made no move for his
guns the masked rider waited a brief mo-
ment then continued talking

  rifle valley has been on the edge of a
range war diamond h and m bar c have
come to hate and distrust one another there
have been cows stolen from both spreads
zack mccloud was shot then knifed the
blame was to be placed in the diamond h
but a wanderin waddy named wayne mor-
gan had seen the man yho shot mccloud
and he had to be shut up he was accused of
the shootin hisself and arrested but it
wasnt meant for him to be brought to trial
or leave the jail alive

  who shot my father rita asked and
she could not control the tremble in her
voice

  ill come to that the masked rider told
her gently first i want to make clear
whos been behind this whole deal hes
a man who at one time was a mining man
he found a heavy copper deposit that prob-
ably extends over most of the valley the
few outcroppins and indications of it was
missed years ago when men from the mines
beyond the pecos prospected rifle valley
this man im talkin about made inquiries
of a minin company who told him right
away that theyd be interested henry and
mccloud had the right to these minerals
and their sale or development the plotter
wanted this for hisself

  then he heard rumors that the old
freightin road from the pecos mines wasnt
satisfactory a railroad planned to send a
spur to them mines and the best route was
through rifle valley across land owned by
diamond h and m bar c the man who
owned them lands could get a good price
from the railroad company for right-of-way
so our plotter had to get rid of henry and
mccloud sos he could profit hisself

  he found a mein who was close to zack
mccloud a man whose warped brain would
stop at nothin to gain his own ends this
man was used by our plotter

  but who was the plotter rita asked
tensely

  yore genial barkeep king gardner the
masked rider answered 

zjardners face became paper-white he
looked around at the grim cowboys who
faced him	t

  thats a lie he said in a quavering
voice he cant prove nothing

  but i can the masked rider interrupt-
ed he didnt turn his head but spoke more
loudly mr graydon powell representative
of the continental mine development cor-
poration

  powell appeared behind him he was a
large powerful man who seemed to fill the
door he stepped around the masked rider
taking care not to come between gardner
and the colts that held the room

  did you get an inquiry from gardner
here the masked rider asked did he
lead yuh to believe he owned the land where
the copper could be found

  he did powell spoke clearly he
claimed he controlled most of the valley
and said he was in process of getting clear
title to the rest we assumed his statement
to be true and agreed to hold off until he
could acquire full title-from a purchase
we believed time passed and we were eager
to chart this deposit and come to some
arrangement about its development i came
here to wind things up and gardner was
much upset he asked for a few more days
in which to finish his deal

  did yuh believe this -deal to be illegal
the masked rider demanded sharply

  not at all i felt that gardner might
not be telling all he knew about the copper
lode but that was between him and the
man from whom i assumed he was buying
the land i had no idea he was resorting to
murder and range war

  thanks mr powell the masked rider
said quietly he raised his voice again
curt edwards surveyor for the pecos ridge
and apache railroad

  the young surveyor appeared and gard-
ners hands gripped the edge of the bar
until the knuckles showed white limp den-
ton edged carefully away from the bar eyes
raiders of

held in an almost hypnotic gaze on the
masked rider the cloaked figure spoke
briefly to edwards

  has the sheriff of rifle rock kept you
and yore crew from leavin town

  he has edwards answered firmly he
said there was trouble in the valley he
didnt want my men or myself involved i
tried to argue him out of it but hatcher
was stubborn then i suggested that i con-
tact diamond h and m bar c separately
hatcher then threatened to jail me and all
my crew unless we stayed quietly in rifle
rock until he gave permission for us to
leave

  hatcher is now bein held by the diamond
h the masked rider said buck henry
has his signed statement hatcher named
the man he took orders from and told why
powell and edwards were kept from seein
the ranchers now we come to the shootin
and later murder of zack mccloud

  limp denton had come close to the door
the masked riders gun swung slightly
and lined on his chest

  dont go denton this concerns you
denton halted looking trapped and dan-
gerous at that moment the red-haired rene-
gade with the scar came in blue hawk
was just behind him the masked riders
voice sounded stem and hard as he spoke
to scar

  you shot zack mccloud from the roof
of the buildin next to the gunsight didnt
yuh

  the man gulped looked frightened then
found his voice

  yes gardner give me orders to an-
other gent was to start a fight between the
spreads at that time

  he did start the fight the masked rider
said softly it was through this gent that
gardner was to gain control of the m bar c
i dont believe gardner meant to let the
man live long after the job was done he
knew too much about the plot but zack
mccloud had to be got rid of first sos the
ranch would pass to his daughter scar here
missed and the job was finished silently with
a knife by a man nobody around the m bar
c would suspect limp denton you stabbed
zack mccloud to death

  rita gasped in horror jed henry swore
under his breath limp denton jerked as
though the masked riders fist had smashed
into his face only his eyes seemed alive
and they had the look of a trapped animal
darting from man to man the masked
rider inexorably pressed his point

  yuhre in love with rita mccloud and
have been since yuh first came to the m
bar c yuhre insanely jealous of jed henry
and wouldnt hesitate to kill if it would get
him out of yore way yuh was a tool ready-
made for king gardner he promised to
rid yuh of the henrys father and son all

rifle rock	

you had to do was kill zack secretly marry
rita and have her sell out at a sacrifice
to gardner

  by that time if things had gone as
planned diamond h and m bar c would
have been at one anothers throats each
ranch ruined by the range war gardner was
encouragin but things went wrong the
minin and railroad companies called gard-
ners hand he had to act fast and you
limp had to run the risk of murderin mc-
cloud yoreself well it caught up with you

w ed henry saw ritas crushed andagon-
ized look killing anger surged up in
him and he jumped toward limp denton
for a moment he stood between the masked
rider and the renegade segundo limp acted
instantly his hand slashed down to his gun
it blurred up and flamed

  he whirled and ran for the batwings
even as jed fell back grabbing his shoul-
der gardner had dropped beneath the bar
and buck henry rushed around one end to
block the mans escape the saloonmans
gunhawks clutched at their holsters but the
m bar c hands were instantly ready for
trouble

  limp reached the batwings and for an
instant was clear of the milling crowd then
the masked riders gun spoke like thunder
in the narrow confines of the room limp
came up on his toes he grabbed at the
batwings but they gave way he fell through
them onto the porch outside

  rita ran to jed who leaned against the
bar neither of them saw buck henry as
the rancher stopped gardner with a blow
that cracked off the mans jaw the plotter
against rifle valley dropped in his tracks
as though he had been pole-axed

  old henry swung around and joined the
masked rider as he strode to the batwings
they knelt over limp denton the rene-
gades eyes fluttered open and he glared up
into the masked face

  if it wasnt for you he gritted and a
spasm of pain crossed his face i could
have had- his voice failed and his head
lolled to one side he was dead

  the masked rider straightened and buck
henry shrugged eloquently

  i reckon that winds everything up the
old man said

  everything the masked rider replied
you and rita mccloud are free to deal with
the minin company and the railroad will
give yuh a fair price for right-of-way rifle
valley will be a busy and peaceful place
thats what it should have been all along
but greedy and twisted men sometimes try
to change things

  i reckon jed and rita will be gettin
married soon buck henry said turning to
face the batwings we shore owe a heap
of thanks to you for the new wealth thats


masked rider western

coinin the two spreads here joined and no
trouble ever no more

  he turned back and his eyes rounded with
surprise he was alone with limp dentons
sprawled body the masked rider had
vanished

 man-hunting mustang

by jack sterrett

half of jay hickens troubles on the trail of a sheriffs killer are
over when he selects a pard with good hoss sense

it was almost dark when long-legged
indian-faced jay hicken rode into cay-
use the main street of the cowtown was
quiet

  there was a smile of anticipation on jays
dark and bony face long time since he
had been to town he would call on sheriff
dad ringle and say howdy to his old
friend

  he halted in front of the stone jail noted
that there were two horses already hitched
to the rack one a wall-eyed dun a wild
horse that one and not local stock-plenty
of mustang in that black-legged buckskin

color but a smart horse too you could see
that even though he rolled his eyes and blew
like a half-broke bronc

  jays booted feet were practically sound-
less on the bricks as his long legs carried him
to the office he wanted to surprise the
sheriff so didnt knock on the door but just
turned the knob and flipped the panel open
the scene he revealed stunned him with a
moments paralysis

 silver-mustached sheriff ringle was
backed against a wall hands high in front
of him stood a beefy masked bandit with
doised six-gun to one side mouth oden in
	masked rider western

a yell of warning was a third man a stranger
to jay handcuffs dangled from this mans
wrists

  just for the instant jay stood rooted then
whipped his right hand toward his gun the
masked bandit however was already whirl-
ing whipping his gun around as he fought
to clear his own  jay stared into eyes
that above the masked nose and mouth
bore the glare of a lion-wild and yellow
eyes

  everything happened then the bandits
gun roared first jay felt the sickening sag
of his knees and fought it then his own gun
was blasting but entirely without aim
somehow he couldnt line up soft darkness
swooped through its haze he saw the
sheriffs desperate leap saw the manacled
man trip him saw the yellow-eyed killer
sweep his gun back and heard its deep-
throated roar and then-he saw no more 

jay hicken lost enough blood to keep
him in bed for a week but the wound
was a clean round hole under the right
shoulder and healed rapidly he made time
and was soon in the saddle again-ready and
burning with a hate that would not be tamed
until dad ringles murderer was caught
jay had not smiled since learning of his old
friends death his indianlike features were
a grim still mask

  standing by the fence at the feed corral
in cayuse jay scowlingly watched the wall-
eyed dun that was kicking his heels and
rearing around inside he questioned pert
wilton the stableman

  slow morose pert shook his head too
much mustang in that dun reckon thats
why the bandit shucked him in favor of yore
big bay both hosses was tied to the rail in
front of the jail the killer and the hombre
he freed from jail just plain had to make
tracks to get out of here whole dont blame
him for takin yore bay instead of toppin
that bucker

  jays black stare followed the careening
dun there was no mark nor brand on the
animals hide to point to an owner

  did anybody ever guess as to who them
killers were jay asked

  nope sheriff died fore he could speak
the masked man shot the handcuffed gent
liisself and dumped the body beside the
trail didnt leave a thing in the hombres
pockets though and nobody knew that
corpse nobody doubts it was a plain case
of the killer needed to free that hombre be-
fore the sheriff could get him to tell about
somethin they got to quarrelin as they ran
looks like looks like the killer decided his
pard had already told and plain needed to
be dead

  pert shrugged as though it was all none
of his business nor worry

 jay swore softly well he growled

dab a noose on that hoss and drag him over
here will yuh pert im goin to top him
off

  hes a devil pert warned

  som i

  two days later jay rode grimly out of
cayuse on the wall-eyed dun he was work-
ing on a theory and took his going quietly
telling nobody of his purpose and he went
with another gun in a saddle-pouch as well
as his hip-gun-and there was jerky sow-
belly flour and salt and coffee rolled up in
his blanket behind the saddle he was pre-
pared to stay away for a while and it was no
part of his purpose to return to his horse-
breaking for the wagon wheel immediately

  perhaps jay knew more about horses both
tame and wild than anybody else in that
whole section he had been tophand at that
trade for a long time and now he meant to
put his knowledge to a new test and use

 he rode out from cayuse a half-days
distance then just began to drift in that
drifting he cut a wide slow circle around
the town jay was working on the theory
that the dun if just circled easily around
and closely watched would sooner or later
betray a desire to head out along some cer-
tain trail the homing instinct

  jay knew that his own big bay stolen by
the killer would have returned to the wag-
onwheel by now if he had been given the
chance and a raw bronc like the dun just
off the range would surely line for familiar
pasture if so encouraged

  circling slowly around distant cayuse jay
was not giving the bronc his head right away
the horse was too wild a man could never
know just when he would decide to explode
also jay just wanted to keep the horse
circling until he had forgotten pert wiltons
feed corral

  the first time the dun showed a desire to
head in any one direction except toward
town jay made the most of that it was the
middle of the third day of circling and hot
blood suddenly sang in jay as the mustang
suddenly lifted his head pricked his ears
and started eagerly away to the north

  jay pulled the dun back but there was a
grin on his dark face a half-dozen times
just to make sure jay circled closer to town
or farther away but every time he brought
the dun around that mustang tried to line
north jays big fists knotted his jaw muscles
jumped and his dark eyes slitted as the yel-
low-eyed glare of the masked bandit leaped
up in his memory

 now he gave the bronc his head

  they bee-lined north as the days slipped
by and the dun showed no desire to travel
in any but that one direction the rider and
the horse became acquainted it came to be
as it will between a man and a horse that
they could almost speak to each other i

  a score of times jay fanned and scratched
man-hunting mustang	

that horse and ran him into the ground when
he showed fight and now he was a pretty
good horse he was smart and gave in to the
man and was then treated kindly and maybe
grew to like the tall dark rider

  grass was plentiful and game came easy
to jays six-gun so they traveled fat then
at last the dun showed a tendency to wan-
der they were six days to the north of
cayuse and it was now finally as though the
mustang had reached his home range and
was just scouting around for the wild horse
band with which he once had roamed

 icken scowled and cursed softly as
he studied the duns actions through-
out all of that day he tested the horse in a
number of ways and the answer came out
always the same this was that broncs home

  by his lonely camp-fire on the plains that
night jay hicken studied his problem here
or near here was where the dun had first
been caught no question of that to the
west of here was one of the big cattle king-
doms of the region cow country that be-
longed to hank boyer boyers line b was
famous and boyer had a rep for fairness
and honesty

  figuring it all out jay decided that if
the outlaw who had killed sheriff ringle
had come from this section he was head of
some rustler band which had been fattening
on the cattle kings herds perhaps dad
ringle had caught one of that crowd and it
had become important for the rustler boss to
silence the prisoner before he slept jay
had decided to head for boyers line b and
see what he could leam

  by daylight jay lined cross-country aftei
working out the dun in a wild spree of crow-
hopping buck-jumping and straight head-
long running the mustang was winded
enough to be peaceful now and cantered
across the flat country that was knee-high
with buffalo grass cut through with sudden
hidden gullies and clay and sand cutbanks

  far in the direction toward which he head-
ed jay saw thin smoke and figured it came
from a branding fire before long he would
be joining with some of boyers crew he
saw plenty of grazing cows

  every now and then jay hicken had to
head-fight the running dun into jumping a
cutbank or gully some of these were pretty
deep with sheer side walls that dropped
down six feet and the dun disliked the look
of them but they were nothing that a good
cowpony would not take in his stride

  nevertheless there came one where the
mustang threw his head aside and slid on
his haunches to the very edge of the cut
then reared in fright at the depth of the
knifelike gulch good-naturedly jay tried
to show him that it was only four feet across
just an easy frog-jump but the dun bogged
his head and beean to buck

  it was no place to buck the rim trembled
and as the horse came down hard from a
sunfishing turn the ground split and fell
in a big crumbling chunk jay felt the horse
collapse beneath him yelled and threw his
weight where it would help for an instant
they clawed on the collapsing rim then
scrambled free

  it had been a near thing a rider could
spill into one of those with his horse over-
turned and wedged on top of him and they
would stay there until the buzzards or coy-
otes had cleaned them these places were a
little more dangerous than jay had fully
realized the rims poised and on the verge
of falling in many places because of recent
heavy rains

  from then on jay jumped only the places
that were narrow and not deep and rode
around the others a time or two he saw
cow skeletons in the gullies which showed
that the beef critters had fallen in and
wedged feet up just as perhaps he had come
close to doing

  he lined his sights on the smoke ahead and
rode for it it was now thin and practically
gone but he could still see it and believed
he was now close to it and something puz-
zled him because except for these rain-cuts
the land was flat and yet he could see nothing
where that smoke was no men nor horses
there was just the faint haze of the dying
smoke and it seemed to come from out of the
ground

  had the fire been built in a gully if so
why was that

  as he drew near jay hicken saw that in
fact the smoke came from one of those slitted
gullies now he remembered that he was on
a man-hunt and decided he didnt care to
ride right up to that gulch without knowing
more about what he poked his nose over so
he angled upgulch a ways pulled his  and
fired a warning shot plenty of men were
touchy about being surprised too sudden

  in a few seconds there came an answering
shot then a faint cry and jay was not sur-
prised at all as he rode over and peered
down to find a man pinned under his up-
turned horse in there just as had almost hap-
pened to himself from the looks of it the
fellow had been down there for several hours
and he was lucky that the weight of his
helpless horse had not crushed him to death

  jay could see how the man had scratched
and clawed frantically to free himself with-
out other result than to pull crumbling clods
down into his face and he saw how he had
managed to reach a clump of dried mesquite
with a match and had set fire to that the
only way in which he could send out a signal
for help

  all this jay hicken took in at a glance
and was figuring without haste and yet
without delay on how to get the man out of
there as quickly as possible without hurting
	masked rider western

  him the best thing it looked like would
  be to dig the earth out from beneath the man
  with strict care and ease him out from be-
  neath the horse should he simply rope the
  horse and try to drag him off there was the
  possibility the animals body might turn and
  the iron-shod hoofs churn the man to death

 tphe prisoned man was groaning and
 beginning to curse jay for not hurrying
 but jay just grinned good-naturedly tied
 the dun to a bush and scouted around for a
 good sharp piece of dried mesquite root to
 use for a digging tool he couldnt blame
 that poor devil for wanting to get out of
 there immediately

    using care not to dislodge more crumbling
  earth jay slid down beside the man he
  put his bandanna to use in cleaning the dirt
  away from the mans face and out of his eyes
  and mouth then hunkered back on his heels
  in sudden rigid surprise at what he had un-
  covered twisting his face around the man
  was glaring at him wildly from yellow and
  flaming eyes-the same eyes that jay had
  seen over the mask of the bandit who had
  killed dad ringle

    jay saw that the outlaw had recognized
  him and was gripped by terror in the belief
  that if somehow jay knew him he would
  be left to die in slow agony there beneath
  his horse hot fury in his blood jay was on
  the point of accusing the killer but checked
  the angry words on his lips

    hicken had never been a man to show his
  feelings on his face and now his dark fea-
  tures were more than ever a mask his black
  eyes told the man nothing and the fellow
  plainly snatched at the belief that jay did
  not know him he began to curse and whine
  get me out of here im sufferin a heap
   hombre what yuh waitin for

    jay turned his face away busied himself
  at sizing up the situation and how best he
  might release the man

    just take it easy he advised and his
  voice told the man nothing of the wild riot
  of his thoughts yore hips are trapped un-
   der the saddle looks like ill have to figger
  to ease em out of there without lettin the
  weight of the hoss down more

    he studied the horse which was wedged
  down in the earth-crack with its four feet
  in the air his heart leaped it was an un-
  natural and queer way for a horse to appear
  but he saw familiar things at once that told
  him that this was his own big bay gelding
  the horse moved his legs helplessly when
  jay spoke and lifted his head weakly he
  had recognized jays voice

    jay picked up the outlaws gun which
  the man had somehow managed to reach and
  fire in response to jays warning shot and
  tossed it out of the hole then went to work
  in earnest and with a sort of cold and pas-
  sionless furv

  all he wanted now was to get this mean
killer out as quickly as possible then let him
know his fate he would give him a fighting
chance let him reach his gun because no
matter how he hated the man he couldnt
just put a bullet between his eyes while he
lay helpless

  with the greatest of care he loosened the
earth beneath the mans shoulders and hips
and removed it a handful at a time now
and then he spoke to the bay and quieted
his dangerous struggling and little by lit-
tle no more than an inch at a time he
worked the groaning and sweating outlaw
out of his trap

  then he seized him by the shoulders and
suddenly yanked him all the way free just
as all of his careful work showed signs of
collapse the horse kicked and settled more
deeply in the hole but now it didnt matter

  the outlaw lay panting and resting for a
while testing his legs and his back and find-
ing them whole and at last he sat up weak-
ly and reached for his dirt-covered smokes
he rolled a cigarette and jay could see him
pull in his strength with each drag the
mans yellow eyes were now hooded and
blank as he grunted his surly thanks and
studied jay without staring

  jay could read his thoughts who the
man asked himself is this rider that looks
injun and has rescued me hes the hombre
i shot in the jail in cayuse he dont know
me-anyway his face dont show a thing-
but how far can i trust that and whats he
doin here whats my move now those
thoughts were so plain you could hear them
jay thought

  jay hickens eyes told the man nothing
of his own thoughts nor of the hate in his
heart

  well he grunted seems like yuhre all
in a piece and sound well crawl out of
here get a rope on that hoss and drag him to
his feet well-

  a shadow moved across them and a mans
rough voice warned them to sit without mov-
ing

  yuhll do nothin at all this voice grat-
ed till yuhve unbuckled yore gun-belts
and crawled up out of there

  struck rigid jay stared up into the beard-
ed face and cutting gray eyes of a big man
who peered down at them over the sights of
a carbine and beside the big man was a
leather-featured cowboy who looked equally
grim and ready behind a big 

 jay and the outlaw alike were pulled
automatically to their feet by the deadly
threat of those leveled gun-barrels and in-
voluntarily their hands fumbled to unbuckle
and drop their gun-belts this though the
outlaws was already empty of its weapoa

  come out the big man ordered sharply
no tricks

  look jay began protestingly and had
man-hunting mustang	

his words choked off by the sudden savagery
with which the bearded man glared at him
and twitched his rifle muzzle toward his
chest

  i aint got a mite of patience left the big
man growled been huntin you rustlin
coyotes the best part of several months and
now i got yuh irs plumb itchy with the
trigger aim to string yuh up or shoot yuh
anyhow and id just as soon do it right now

 ay hicken bit his lip and kept silence
for the moment crawling out of the hole
behind the outlaw this big man he figured
would be hank boyer and not only fairness
and honesty had made him the big cattleman
he was he had never been fearful of back-
ing his rights with hot lead suddenly and in
plentiful amount it was said

  boyer surveyed them with contempt when
they had crawled out

  it wasnt yore lucky day when yore
smoke led me and johnny here he in-
formed them you-he pointed his beard-
ed chin at the yellow-eyed outlaw-are a
man ive sworn to kill on sight every man
knows what cat-eye munro has done to me
the cows hes rustled and the lonely punchers
hes murdered all the range countryll
hooraw when it hears of yore death cat-
eye he switched his angry gray stare to
jay i dont know you but yuhve signed
your own death warrant by runnin with
cat-eye

  im from cayuse jay hicken said swift-
ly though i never knew his name i come
this way to kill cat-eye myself i aint of
his crowd and ive never run with him
he-

  yuh bawl like a yellow calf the outlaw
broke him off with a snarl i always knew
lje told boyer that hed turn on me and try
and talk his way out of trouble when it
came

  for an instant fury that was almost un-
controllable held jay hicken in its grip it
made him speechless the vicious malice in
the killers yellow eyes tied his tongue and
turned him rigid and boyer plainly took
his momentary helplessness as proof of cat-
eyes evil accusation

  all right the big man ordered curtly
yuhve both said as much as ill allow
another peep or an effort to escape-yuhll
just simply trip my trigger he jerked his
head at his cowboy hit yore saddle john-
ny you too his eyes stabbed jay climb
that dun tied over there the two of yuh can
daub ropes on that hoss in the gully and
snake him out

  he moved back a few steps taking cat-
eye munro with him and with hawklike in-
tentness watched every move that jay made

  jay remembered the gun he had tossed
out on the ground cat-eyes weapon he
saw from the corner of his eye that it had

passed unnoticed by the cowboy johnny
and boyer but he saw too that it lay too
far to one side for him to reach it if he
should turn toward it boyer would instantly
discover it and shoot him without hesitation
the only chance he had was to walk steadily
and without foolishness straight to his mus-
tang

  but even so wild hope hammered in his
brain if these two men had not taken the
time to examine the dun and his equipment
if they had come straight over to peer down
into the gully then there was his spare gun
in the saddle-pocket

  his heart hammered wildly but his face
was as still and expressionless as a mask he
could feel the dun trembling as he untied him
and gingerly mounted hoping he wouldnt
buck just now the merest flicker of his eyes
showed him the bulge that told that his spare
gun was there in its leather pocket his thigh
concealed it as he turned the nervous bronc
and rode back to the lip of the gully with a
solemn face while unlooping his hemp catch-
rope

  johnny had holstered his  and had al-
ready tossed down his loop to draw a firm
noose around the trapped geldings hind legs

  get another holt on him in the same way
he told jay we can drag him on his back
to where its wider and he can turn

  this was jays chance and he knew it it
might not come again just like this he
eased his dun over close to johnnys horse
and gathered his loop the chill of nervous
tension rolling all over his hide like buck-
shot he twirled that loop once around his
head then spun it again preparatory to
dropping its circle over his target but in
doing so and apparently only in clumsiness
he flicked the dun harshly across the face

  the spooky little horse keyed-up and
aware of an overcharge of tension in the air
exploded like a shot he blew up and leaped
madly in the direction jays hard hand forced
him to he piled into the johnnys horse and
with a startled yell that cowboy and his
mount were knocked into the arroyo in a
churning heap

  hank boyer cursed and yelled but jay
and his bronc were unable to heed him for
the next few seconds the black-legged mus-
tang put on such an exhibition of plain and
fancy bucking as to outdo all previous efforts
he had made it looked as though jay only
tried desperately to stay in the leather and
keep from being hurled to the ground but
he had come to know almost every habit and
favorite trick of that sunfishing little devil
and he managed while hiding the gesture
from the cursing and hesitating boyer to
reach his hidden gun and fish it from the
leather

  when the bearded cattleman saw that
weapon it was already too late jays gun
bellowed smoke and flame and its lead rump-


masked rider western

burned boyers horse even while boyer tried
frantically to aim and trigger his own weap-
on the big man was hurled from the saddle
by his mounts frantic leap

  he struck the ground with such stunning
force that he did not move immediately
thereafter

ib ut all this was also such a chance as
cat-eye munro had never dreamed he
would get as quick as a flash he was talk-
ing advantage of it streaking for his own
gun on the ground that his eyes had con-
stantly and longingly watched he was al-
ready snatching the weapon from the earth
when jay saw him and with a final grim
effort controlled the bucking pony and halt-
ed him

  he gave no shout of warning did not try
to halt the outlaws frenzied and vicious
effort he merely smiled coldly and with
final calm and grim satisfaction sent a bullet
crashing through the outlaws head even as
munros mad shot split the breeze not far
from his own ear the outlaw gasped once
and fell and did not move again-ever

  jay hicken disarmed the nearly uncon-
scious boyer and the cowboy struggling in
the ditch he fished johnny out and when
the two were calm and forced to listen told
them his story as simply and honestly as
plain words could relate it

  when he had finished and had voluntarily
returned their weapons to them they had no
choice but to believe him it was a fact that
if he had been outlaw he could have killed
them easily and mercilessly instead he was
offering to surrender his own gun

  yuh can hold me if yuh like yuh can
easy check on every word of my story if
yuhll ride to cayuse jay stared for a mo-
ment at munros dead form it just had to
be him or me-no matter who else homed
in

  boyer refused to take jays gun from him

  theres times when a man just knows the
truth he grunted and smiled i was old
dad ringles friend too and i plumb sabe
how yuhve felt he was still smiling sober-
ly as he examined jays little dun-colored
friend that hoss has been a friend to yuh
hes smart and hell never betray yuh like
a man would

  and now at last the mask over jays dark
features was broken and his teeth were a
white flash as he grinned and stroked the
little broncs neck

  hes shore a man-huntin little mustang
it aint as if when he bucks that hes really
tryin to be mean hes just bound he wont
let yuh forget hes an equal if he wants he
can go free right here hes earned it but
if he chooses to stay with me hell always be
my pard

 old doc holly stepped out of the bank	had elected him though there had been a

 counting money and walked into a	good deal of spirited opposition he felt

 mexican who stood gawping toward	now that he was in a tough spot and he

 the top of the line of bluffs red now in the	was with the catclaw girtman gang of

 morning sunlight that reared high close back	holdups back in its old home county once

 of town holly jerked his gaze upward he	more

 swore then ran to the sheriffs office	hes got a white cloth tied to the muzzle

 kirk he said breathlessly to the man at	of his rifle kirk doc holly added

 the desk youd never guess whos sittin his	catclaw used to brag that anything was

 horse in plain sight up there on the rock	fair if only yuh got by with it and always

 so ill tell you its catclaw girtman	was plumb full of tricks the tall and wolf-

 he was young that sheriff under twenty-	lean kirk brennan said

 three his father and his grandfather had	he loosened his six-shooter in its holster

 held the job before him and their records	as he hurried out to the street
	masked rider western

  the man on the bluffs was a big man
full-bearded with a hawks eye and a hooked
nose at sight of the young officer he waved
his white rag and called down

  like to hit off a short truce with yuh
kirk my poor daddy has cashed over in
bledsoe county and theyre shippin him
here to be buried alongside my ma him to
be on the train which gets to town at two
this afternoon we want yuh to let us meet
the train and take the coffin away thats all
if yuh will well swear to leave this county
for good tomorrer anyhow weve never
bothered here much how about it kirk
yuhve never bothered here much be-
cause yuh figger yuh wanted to use this coun-
ty as a sort of refuge when yuh was pushed
hard in other places brennan threw back
but yuh wasnt safe here none catclaw it
was just hard to get a line on yuh with no
fresh trail to foller here in a county as big
as some of the eastern states

  yeah reckon so girtman said and
shrugged well how about us cornin in to
get the corpse kirk you shorely got that
much heart in yuh

  all right the young sheriff answered
but dont wear any guns come straight to
the railroad station and go straight back
bueno the outlaw leader said and took
off his hat we shore thank yuh kirk and
mebbe well be able to do somethin for yuh
some day never can tell adios

ue waved his hat pulled his horse around
     and vanished

  you couldnt refuse him that kirk the
old doctor said youll be on hand at the
station of course when the two-oclock
comes in

  shore kirk replied and added musing-
ly probably i could take a posse and foller
em to their hang-out doc if i wanted to
trouble there is i mebbe wouldnt be quite
respectin the truce

  doc holly laughed just like your sheriff
daddy and granddaddy they leaned over
backwards too trying to be plumb straight
sometimes ive wondered if it paid

  yuh ought to know it does the younger
man said

  at noon sheriff brennan walked down to
the railroad station and had the agent tele-
graph the two railroad towns in bledsoe
county to find out whether the body of
which catclaw girtman had spoken was
aboard the train the answer came ticking
back in the affirmative

  at ten minutes of two that afternoon
kirk and his three deputies-one of them
a wizened little old man named idaho
snow who had served under the other
sheriffs named brennan-went to the sta-
tion since the brief talk between kirk and
catclaw girtman was public property curi-
ous townsfolk were there to see the notorious

gang when it rode in

  the train rolled up with the combination
express-and-baggage car door wide open the
big box in plain sight and still no girtman
gang

  brennan ran to the car door barking at
the man inside

  yuh shore about whats in that box
there

  i am now but a few minutes ago i
wasnt was the nervous answer i had
to end it around to get it where it is and i
could feel rocks rolling inside looks like
somebodys been fooled

  which same is me kirk brennan
thought hotly he called to his deputies and
with them ran up the street

  if id had any brains a-tall he thought
grimly id have seen through this and set
a trap i

  they went tearing into the bank and there
found about what kirk expected to find
teller and bookkeeper lay insensible from
gun-barrel wallops the vault door swung
open and some twenty thousand dollars was
gone it had been as easy as it was simple
with main street practically deserted lobo
trick but it had worked

  doc holly came on the run and got busy
reviving the bookkeeper and the teller bren-
nan and his deputies picked up a trail of
hoof prints in the alley behind the bank
building got their horses and followed it
the trail led into a trail at the outskirts of
town and was lost in a maze of other hoof
prints

  eastward lay grazing land the holdup
gang must have ridden for the much bigger
and much wilder western reaches of the
county theyd had to head for one of two
passes through the high bluffs line

  north pass is the highest creaked little
old deputy idaho snow come on kirk 

  outfoxed again rapped kirk when they
reached the entrance to the north pass my
dad used to say it was the simplest things
that fooled a man the quickest and looks
like he was right by the time wed get to
the south pass that outfit would have an
hours start on us and in that time theyd be
in rock country where hoof marks would
show only to a good tracker pokin along on
foot

  im a good tracker kirk idaho snow
wheezed

  that was idahos chief value as a deputy
brennan frowned down at his badge a bat-
tered old silver star that had been his fathers
then said

  yuh can see where i stand now ide as
a sheriff im only a poor joke knew cat-
claw girtman had always bragged about any-
thing bein fair if yuh could get by with it
yet i did-what i did i can think of just
one way of cornin back ide

  oughtnt to take it so misable kirk
star on ffls desk



 old snow said yore dad was the best
 sheriff i ever knowed and he never could
 catch the girtman outfit nobody blamed
 him nuther

   hed already established hisself a good
 lawman kirk replied and didnt have no
 such opposition as ive got and he didnt
 have the chance i just let slip through my
 fingers either nope the only way i can
 prove ive got a right to wear his badge is
 to nail the whole outlaw gang all by myself
 passin the joke on the girtman outfit and
 my enemies

   a plumb big job commented idaho
 snow if yuhll excuse me kirk only a
 young buck and him not any too wise would
 have thought of that 

    i want you to help me a little at the start
  brennan said evenly i want yuh to light
  out right now and track the gang across the
  rock country and get the direction of their
  hole-up spot then come in and report to me
  be careful they dont see yuh adios ide

 hdaho rode off on his mission kirk
 b brennan and the other deputies returned
 to town

    kirk didnt have to leave his office in order
  to hear the oppositions verbal flaying this
  was exactly what they had expected of him
  his enemies said more than once he throt-
  tled a youthful impulse which had to do with
  his going out to the street and knocking a
  few men down

   old doc holly came in looking blue
 kirk he said hesitantly theyre think-
 ing of sending a petition to the governor
 asking him to appoint somebody in youi
 place lots of your former friends would
 sign it on account of having lost money in
 the bank busted now of course the bank
  is means that youll lose the sheriff job
 thought you ought to know

   thanks doc brennan said losin the
 job aint all of it old-timer i wear the
 name of brennan my dad and my grand-
 dad wouldnt rest any more where they lie-
 shore you get it doc well yuh can tell
 the wasps out there on the street that they
 can pull their stingers in because i aim to
 surprise em half out of their hides and aim
 to do it right soon sounds braggin i know
 but go ahead and tell em that

   holly shrugged and went out to tell the
 wasps   

   wizened little deputy idaho snow
 showed up in town at noon the next day
 he found brennan in his office and started
 talking

   i got their hang-out lined up for yuh
 kirk all right but yuh shore are locoed
 if yuh tackle em all by yore lonesome this
 cat girtman and his cousin nep and the
 other three of em wouldnt be ridin free to-
 day if they wasnt the plumb worst hombres
 in the entire southwest 

  about where is their hole-up spot ide

  idaho blinked know them big hills other
side of the rollin rock country with three
little creeks runnin out of em a few miles
apart well the gang has follered the mid-
dle creek yuh got any trick up yore sleeve
kirk

  no but i aim to watch for my chance
and grab one brennan got briskly to his
feet then stopped short this badge idar
ho--my dads-its the heaviest load i ever
carried ill not wear it any more till ive
earned the right

  he put the battered old silver star on his
desk and hurried toward the liverymans for
his horse

  ten minutes later he rode up the main
street with many eyes upon him one bank
depositor just reeling out of the saloon
yelled for all to hear

 will yuh look at that our younker
sheriffs goin after the girtman bunch all
by hisself bet he aims to try and catch
em in mousetraps hey kirk why dont
yuh go the whole hog and go without a
gun

  had brennan not been so mad he would
not have done what he did then

  i was about to forget he said voice
tight

  he unbuckled his gun-belt rode past his
office and tossed the heavy belt to old snow
in the doorway

  dont yuh follow me ide he ordered the
little deputy and see that nobody else
does

 its on yore own head idaho said
gloomily

  kirk brennan rode fast and in two hours
by the sun was entering the hills canyon
that served the middle cieek the average
lawman would have hidden his horse and
proceeded on foot doing away with the tell-
tale sounds of iron-shod hoofs on rock but
kirk brennan had something in the nature
of a plan now and he figured that boldness
would be in his favor so he kept riding

  nep girtman like his cousin catclaw was
a big man also like catclaw nep wore a
full beard their companions were younger
lean and wiry men with slits for mouths and
the same for eyes the sun had gone down
and the five bandits stood at a supper fire
that burned not far from a prospectors di-
lapidated old cabin this cabin marked the
center of a wild boulder-dotted basin

  kirk brennan rode around a boulder the
size of a barn saw them and jerked up his
empty right hand the outlaws made no
move their sentinel had hurried in shordy
before to report one man coming and they
feared no one man on earth

  with his left hand kirk reined in before
them

  anybody follerin yuh kirk catclaw
girtman asked
	masked rider western

  nobody yuh can take my word for that
brennan eased his right hand down to his
saddle-front

  the girtman leader considered himself
smart and was smart in point of cold fact
he was too smart

  no gun and no badge he commented
them two cards reads me the rest of the
deck young sheriff elected on his pas rec-
ord kicked out because he let a gang make
a plumb monkey out of him made him so
cussed mad he wants to flop over and be a
owlhoot hisself im right kirk aint i 

mrennan grinned narrowly catclaw
was playing squarely into his hand his
best chance of rounding up the gang lay in
joining in or pretending to do so and cat-
claw had made this easy he was not going
to lie outright so he merely kept grinning
the cocksure girtman went on airing his
smartness

  if the authorities didnt take yore gun
from yuh when they kicked yuh out yuh just
didnt wear none on account yuh was afraid
of bein drilled on sight have much trouble
locatin us

  it shore was slow work kirk answered
if anybody does foller yuh girtman said
yuhll be the one to shoot him buck agin
that and well shoot you savvy

  brennan savvied-with a jolt idaho
snow might disobey orders and come sneak-
ing out here

  put yore hoss into the rope corral behind
the cabin kirk catclaw went on then
come back and show us how good yuh can
cook hustle

  and tomorrer kirk nep girtman said
fingering his beard and winking at his cousin
yuh can wash up all our clothes

  this was the payoff the young sheriff
was being permitted to join the band-as a
slavey but it didnt rankle much the big
thing was that they were not suspicious
which meant that he could grab the first
chance he saw theyd been nowhere to
spend the money they had stolen from the
bank and brennan wanted to nail them
while the money was intact in their posses-
sion

  each of the five had a heavy six-shooter
that was never out of his reach their one
additional weapon was the  winchester
that catclaw had been carrying when he had
shown up on the bluffs back of town the
rifle now stood against the outside cabin
wall near the door with a belt of cartridges
hanging on its muzzle

  night caught them finishing supper night
that would be quite dark until moonrise
brennan followed nep girtman and a wiry
man in the cabin girtman lighted a match
which showed kirk a pair of built-in bunks
and into one of these crawled nep kirk
picked his way between saddles and blankets

and piled down on the floor in the blackness
the wiry man did likewise soon catclaw
girtman and another wiry man came in

  aw nep nothin to do but sleep cat-
claw growled as he found his bunk to-
morrer we ride

  to san carlos and throw us a main ben-
der said nep

  right said catclaw

  brennan stiffened san carlos was not
only out of his county but was across the
border in mexico 

  so whatever i do he told himself ill
have to do before another sun comes up

  if he could lay hands on that  winches-
ter and get the drop on them at daybreak
when they were woozy with sleep at least
he would have a fighting chance his sheriff
father he remembered had never asked for
more than that

  four men had come into the cabin the
fifth would be off somewhere doing sentry
duty one by one the four began snoring
the sounds seemed genuine but kirk bren-
nan lay there staring into the dark for two
hours before he dared lift a finger then he
crept outside moving an inch or so at a time
making no sound

  the rifle was gone

  of course the sentinel had taken the long-
reacher this told kirk that the sentinel
occupied some high point that would give
his eyes far coverage after the moon rose

  kirk waited for moonlight then found his
man on a rock pinnacle except that he
nodded a little now and then the bandit sat
as motionless as the stone beneath him
brennan sprang upon him from behind
snatched the mans six-shooter from its scab-
bard and with the barrel of the outlaws own
weapon knocked him senseless using his
own and the bandits neckerchiefs tightly
twisted he tied the fellows wrists behind
him and tied his ankles to his wrists

  it was the work of only another minute
to tear a sleeve from the outlaws shirt and
gag the unconscious sentinel kirk then
put on both cartridge-belts holstered the six-
shooter caught up the rifle and made his way
cautiously toward the cabin

  half the night was past the wait for day-
break would be long the moon had grown
bright every boulder and clump of scrub
stood out almost sharply enough to be pho-
tographed brennan wondered whether he
hadnt as well tackle it now

  the matter was decided for him on the
pinnacle the sentinel came to slipped his
shirtsleeve gag and started yelling

  cat hey cat cat

  inside the cabin a sleepy voice mumbled a
guttural oath instantly brennan tossed to
the still glowing embers of the supper fire a
small handful of cartridges that he had
snatched from the six-shooter belt they
began exploding in a fine imitation of a
star on his desk



close-up pitched gun battle

  outlaws came piling through the narrow
doorway and into the smoky moonlight kirk
in the cabin shadow beside the door swung
the barrel of the winchester as a steel club-
and three of the outlaws dropped like dead
men

  but the fourth ducked the rifle-barrel

  what the tarnation he barked

wt was catclaw girtman and instantly his
six-shooter blasted kirk brennan felt
bullet-wind in his hair he had dropped al-
most too late he threw himself quickly side-
ward and out of the acrid powdersmoke
jerked the winchester up and fired

  silence closed down kirk brennan had
had his fighting chance

  

  a shout from old doc holly woke the busi-
ness section of the town that lazy afternoon
men hurried from saloons and stores to wit-
ness the spectacle that had brought the
shout the young sheriff was riding in
herding the girtman five tied on their horses
with the ropes that had made the little corral
at outlaw headquarters a winchester rifle
lay across five six-shooters in front of bren-
nan bellows of mixed amazement and ad-
miration greeted him

  howd yuh ever do it kirk demanded
the man who had made sport of brennan
the day before

  caught em in mouse-traps of course like
you said brennan answered with a twinkle
in his eye

  he halted the cavalcade at the squat jail
building called to wizened little deputy ida-
ho snow

  take this twenty thousand dollars to the
bank for me ide and hurry back

  doc holly came running up

 heres some damaged heads for yuh to
look after doc kirk told him when weve
got em safe behind bars catclaw girtman
there-i had to shoot him to save myself
might be hell have use for the box he had
shipped here with rocks in it

  yuh call that fair nep girtman blatted
joinin up with us just to catch us

  i shore do because i didnt lie to yuh
promptly answered brennan anyhow who
was it always claimed anything was fair if
only yuh got by with it

  the gang was locked up soon doc holly
went looking for kirk brennan to tell him
that the bandit leader had passed kirk sat
down at his desk and pinned like a target
and a dare over his heart was a battered
old silver star

nesters are poison

 by mel pitzer

          dave lester risks his bankroll to catch a poker
          cheat and then backs up his play with gunsmoke

the small cabin had four rooms
-two bedrooms a kitchen and a
plainly furnished living room
in the living room a home-made rock-
ing chair was occupied by a woman who
had once been beautiful but now she
was thirty and her face was lined and
haggard her eyes once agleam with
vivacity and life had grown dull with
unremitting toil she was clad in a faded
calico dress

  suddenly she stopped mending the
socks in her lap and lifted her head to
listen

  john is back dave she called out i
just heard his horse come into the yard

  out in the kitchen an oil lamp was
casting a bright glow over the worried
features of dave lester her husband as
he sat dealing cards at a small table in
the center of the room lester was big-
framed and firm-jawed but care also had
marked his once-handsome features
now he turned his eyes to the door



  it was flung open and a willowy youth
in his twenties with a flaring breadth of
shoulder entered johnny stevens was
daves brother-in-law stevens closed
the door to shut out the wind and rain
and laid a hand on lesters sleeve there
was trouble in stevens eyes

  lester leaned back and stared up at
him

  what kept yuh so late johnny he
asked its nearly midnight did yuh
sell those steers of mine for five hun-
dred dollars

  johnny stevens put a finger to his lips
and nodded toward the living room

  i suspect sis is up yet he muttered
softly i dont want her to hear what
im goin to tell you his voice dropped
lower i got the five hundred dave
but thinkin of how bad things are for
us i stopped in at the lucky nugget
and tried to double it in a poker game i
lost the whole thing

 dave lester had been playing soli-
nesters are poison



taire now he flung down the cards and
stood up towering to his six-foot-three
with grim face he shrugged off young
stevens hand

  yuh tried to double it he bellowed
savagely yuh took my money and lost
it at cards why yuh fool all you
know about the game you learned from
me you ruined us is what yuh did i
ought to smash yore face in

he half-raised a big fist johnny
stevens had backed away from
him he knew he was wrong and took
the tongue-lashing silently then sud-
denly mary lester was standing be-
tween them

  stop stop it dave she cried i-i
heard everything but acting this way
wont help matters

  dave lester had slumped down before
the table once more and listlessly began
riffling the pastboards his hands were
shaking as he tried to control the anger
seething within him in spite of every-
thing he knew that the only thing that
johnny had on his mind while he was
sitting in that poker game was the
thought that he could win more and
proudly hand it over to his brother-in-
law

  the rain outside had changed from a
soft patter to a strong downpour from
the roof above lesters head water began
to drop onto the table and gradually
form a growing pool before him notic-
ing the pool lester turned his head and
again fixed his eyes on young johnny
stevens

  i told yuh to get some tar to fix that
roof leak why didnt yuh do that

  i forgot it answered the youth
huskily i was only thinkin of this
here poverty were in dave stevens
voice grew stronger as the flame of this
new thought took possession of him
ever since we came here dave weve
been looked down to by the rest of the
folks were nesters and they dont like
nesters yuh asked walt dolf the
banker for a loan and he refused it
boyden the eastern syndicate buyer
gives us three dollars a head less for our
cattle and only takes em because he
needs all he can get tom jackson who
owns the big bar b outfit has turned the
other ranchers against us they wont
let us throw in with them at roundup
and brand all our cattle together he

wont let us use his water-hole in the
hot weather or his sheltered pastures in
the winter like he does the others im
sick of it dave do you hear me im
sick of us tryin to make ends meet

  lester said nothing but he knew that
every word johnny stevens spoke was
true many a time in an agony of inde-
cision he had wondered whether he
should give up

 now mary lester came over and
stood by her husband

  john is right dave she said tone-
lessly cant you see were fighting
against things we cant beat were not
wanted around here theyre too power-
ful

  im sorry about losin that money
dave went on young stevens i
learned a lot about poker from you and
i figgered i might win at first i started
to dolf was in the game and boyden
and jackson anse jollay the nugget
owner himself was sittin in he was
doin most of the losin and i was get-
tin ahead then like he always does
jollay started drinkin heavy so heavy
he spilled his liquor a couple of times
but the liquor didnt affect the way he
has of winnin jollay claims he has bet-
ter luck when hes drinkin and it shore
seems true because he cleaned us out

  that hasnt got anythin to do with
it johnny said lester jollay being
in it should have warned yuh he built
the nugget on what he made in playin
cards hes as crooked as a dogs hind
leg and has plenty of card tricks up
his sleeve

  dave lester went on with his game of
solitaire then he tensed and a queer
look suddenly twisted his face he bent
lower over the table with a grim half-
smile on his face he slowly laid aside
the cards

  mary lester went to the sink taking
a rag she went over and began to mop
up the water on the table which had
started to drip to the floor

 get a pan johnny she ordered
and put it on the table to catch the
watfr dave can repair the leak tomor-
row

  at her words dave lester stood up i
got to think things over mary what
johnny and you said is true us nesters
aint liked anyway im goin to try
and hang on a bit longer lets all turn
in


masked rider western

lester went into the bedroom with
a slight smile of hope on his face

  the next day in the afternoon mary
lester went to mind the two children of
a neighbor who planned to take his wife
on a visit she intended to stay there
overnight which suited dave lesters
plans fine young johnny stevens had a
lot of plowing to do this would keep
him busy until dark

  after his wife had left lester told
young johnny that he was going into
town and not to worry if he didnt arrive
home until late without saying any
more lester harnessed his team to the
light buckboard and headed for town a
little later he stepped into the stock-
mens bank and was finally ushered into
the presence of the president walt
dolf the banker was a tall florid-faced
man who had been a cattleman before he
went into the banking business a frown
drew down his bushy brows as lester
entered

  dont look so gloomy walt said
the nester i didnt come here to ask
yuh for a loan again i came to find out
if yuhd like to get some money back
yuh lost 

  walt motioned to a chair sit down
now that youre here he said whats
this about me losing some money

  lester took the proffered seat and
leaned forward

  look here walt i know that yuh
dont like nesters but aside from that i
know that you are a fair and square man
last night yuh sat in a poker game with
my brother-in-law johnny stevens
jackson the rancher also was playin
and the cattle-buyer jack boyden
anson jollay was in it too he sort of
emptied the pocketbooks of you boys so
i heard

  walt dolf nodded you heard right
he said-

  well walt that money that johnny
lost was mine i cant afford to lose it
and i got an idea jollay won it by play-
in crooked i could stick a gun in his
ribs and get it back again if i wanted to
or i could go to the sheriff but the way
i figger i think i can jf-rove that jollay
plays crooked cards also if i can get
in the game with you gents playin
youll be the same as witnesses for me
when i get the goods on the nugget
owner

  you and jackson are members of the

citizens committee and thats all thats
needed to put jollay out of business
yuh know as well as i do hes been a
reef that a lot of young fellers around
here have smashed themselves on
theyve lost their hard-earned cash gam-
blin in his place now what do you
think about what i said

  walt dolf head of the citizens com-
mittee slammed his fist on his desk

  lester he answered i agree with
every word you said it may be all right
for the older set to get some amusement
in the nugget but the young uns cant
buck games like that when the skys the
limit you hit me in a spot where im
soft dave and ill tell you something
the only reason that jackson boyden
and i have been playin poker with jol-
lay is to try and get somethin on him 
weve been hoping to prove that hes
dishonest the mayor and the sheriff are
waiting to hear from us and theyll do
the rest

  walt dolf leaned back in his swivel
chair and lifting a finger stabbed it at
lester

  dave he went on you prove that
jollay is running a crooked poker game
and youll be doin this community a
great service

  i wont say i can do it broke in the
nester but i got a hunch how jollay
works i know its never been found he
uses marked cards mebbe its somethin
else suppose we get in a little poker
game tonight do you think yuh can
arrange it walt

  whenever my friends and i want to
play jollay is willing to relieve us of
our money grinned the banker

  all right then walt how about me
meetin you boys there about nine
oclock tonight then yuh can work it
sos i can get irt on the game i dont
want to tell yuh how i might be able to
get the proof on jollay up until it works
out if it dont work out itll be my own
money i lose

  they talked a bit longer and lester
left he ate at the small restaurant and
the rest of the time he hung around the
town making some purchases for the
ranch he had taken a couple of hun-
dred dollars along with him practically
all the money he had so that he could
enter the game

  at nine oclock he strode into the
lucky nugget it was still quite early
nesters are poison



only a couple of men stood at the bar
but at the lower end loafed a tall
gaunt-faced beak-nosed man his black
restless eyes were in startlingly con-
trast to the pallor of his face he had
just taken a new deck of cards from
a box this fellow was anson jollay
now his eyes flickered to lester and he
gave a slight nod through the door of
a back room stepped walt dolf a cigar
fuming in his mouth

  hello there lester he called loud-
ly want to lose some of your cash
were just starting a little game of
poker

  shore ill take a hand answered
the nester

  there were four big round tables in
this room their tops gleaming darkly
with polish at one of them sat two
other men one of them was joe jack-
son white-haired and heavy-jowled
with work-rounded shoulders the other
was jack boyden slight thin-faced and
partly bald he was the syndicate
buyer they greeted lester then dolf
and jollay came over and sat down

  over this table was a glaring light
its rays directed downward from above
by a shade jollay lowered the lamp un-
til it put the faces of the men in dark-
ness and left only the players hands
in view

  cant read a mans expression this
way lester chuckled jollay and
everyonell have a fair chance you can
read a lot by a mans face you know

  the game started and as usual the
sky was the limit at intervals someone
raked in a pot after a while jollay
started to boost the betting an hour
passed the stakes had become higher
but each of the players had taken in a
pot now and then then came the time
when the pot held seven hundred dol-
lars and dave lester found himself with
four sevens the others had thrown in
their cards

  anse jollay saw himself looking down
at an ace full on a pair of queens to
him this was a beautiful sight-in fact
they practically whispered in his ear
that he was seven hundred dollars richer
than before so he raised his bets lav
ishly because anson jollay was honest
up to a certain point but if he fell
down on a hand like the one staring up
at him it was a time to use othr ways
and means at labt he saw lester and

the sevens which the other spread out
lester raked in the pot and anse jol-
lay called for a quart of whisky

  he began to fill the little ounce and
a quarter glass from the big bottle and
downed his drinks often as the game
proceeded twice he spilled liquor and
began to talk in a mumbling tone but
his luck began to change he started
winning steadily at last he won a par-
ticularly big pot

  funny thing with me he said the
more i drink the better my luck gets
when im sober i have no luck at all
its been that way all my life

  he kept winning and then when he
was about to deal for cards called in
his usual slow fumbling way dave
lester pushed back his chair his voice
was cold and brittle when he spoke

  jollay im playin a new kind of
hand in this game and here it is
lesters right fist flashed up over the
table and in it was a long-barreled forty-
five pointing straight across at the sa-
loon owner magically six-guns came
into the hands of jackson dolf and
boyden all were trained on jollay

  whats the idea lester snapped
jollay and you other gents what
are yuh tryin to do

  im sayin that yuhre playin a
crooked game of cards jollay and i
aim to prove it watch him boys
lester leaped up and swiftly went
around to jollays chair all right
anse he went on ive got my gun
right in your back one bad move and
ill pull the trigger now get up dolf
you change chairs with jollay here i
want to show yuh somethin

  the banker did as he was told now
dolf continued the nester take a
couple of cards and deal em to jackson
like as if he was callin for em theyre
upside down in yore hand dolf yuh
cant see what they are but look into
that little pool of spilled liquor as
yuhre dealin and tell me what yuh see

alt dolf uttered an oath
why lester he explained in
this liquor that jollay spilled with the
light shining the way it does i can see
every card im dealing out its a reg-
ular mirror

  all right went on lester now let
jackson and boyden try it and keep
yore gun on jollay

                                                i


masked rider western

  the others followed lesters instruc-
tions

  shore thing growled the rancher
i can see every card im dealin
thats why he wanted the light low
gents so yuh couldnt see him lookin
down into that liquid mirror he could
watch the cards and knew when to bet
and when to stay out he just faked
being drunk

  now lester pulled up the light on its
pulley and then they could all see the
fearful look of guilt on anson jollays
face and it was as the glaring light
struck their faces that he made his play

  leaping backward he drew a gun and
darted toward an open window the
gun in his hand flamed lester felt a
pain burn across his ribs jollays gun
roared again and jackson letting out a
cry grabbed at his shoulder walt dolf
returned the fire but missed then les-
ter took careful aim and thumbed
the hammer of his colt

 jollay with his right leg over the
window-sill fell backward and crashed
to the floor lester dived forward and
kicked the gun from his loosened fin-
gers the gambler was cursing and hold-
ing his right hip with both his hands
after a few moments of confusion it
was found that jackson had a clean hole
in his shoulder and wasnt badly hurt

jollay mumbled something about
cutting them in on the profits of
his gambling

  walking over lester reached inside
the gamblers coat and brought out a
well-filled wallet from which he ex-
tracted five hundred dollars then les-
ter flung the wallet down

  this is my money johnny stevens
lost it last night you other gents can
have jollay

  well notify the sheriff and the
mayor said dolf im in favor of pre-
ferring charges against him and putting
him in prison for a long term how
about it boys one charge will be
shooting with intent to kill

  jackson and boyden agreed that this
should be done and when he comes

out said the rancher if he ever shows
up in this town well give him a coat
of tar and feathers

  heads had begun poking in through
the doorway walt dolf ordered one of
the watchers to get the sheriff and a
doctor

  well let the doctor work on you
first jackson said the banker then
he can patch up jollay

  he turned now to dave lester and
held out his hand dave said the
banker i thank you for showing up
this crook it was clever of you think-
ing he might be using a trick like that
but how did you get onto it

  that rain we had last night
chuckled the nester i was sittin at a
table in my cabin with nothin to do buj
play solitaire my roof leaked an the
rain cornin through made a pool of
water in front of me on the table with
the bright light of the lamp i was usin
shinin on it i could see the fronts of
the cards reflected when i was handlin
them at the same time young johnny
was tellin me as how jollay started
spillin his liquor an winnin i figgered
that with a brighter light an everythin
the thing might work and it did well
gents i guess ill be leavin you all
now

  walt dolf coughed say lester-er
-come into town tomorrow will you
stop off at the bank i believe i can
arrange that thousand dollar loan you
wanted and give it to you right away
fine blurted jackson and listen
here dave come round-up you and
yore outfit throw in with the rest of the
boys and well brand and ship together
guess i can let yuh have some sheltered
pasture in the winter and anything else
yuh want

  top prices on all yore stock from
now on davy drawled the buyer

  dave lester opened his mouth to blurt
forth his thanks but a mist jumped
into his eyes and instead he left the
lucky nugget with his shoulders a bit
more squared and his head a trifle
higher life he felt sure from now on
held a bright future

electricity

 perhaps im one war
 older than you are

  believe me after the last
  tear i saw what happened
  will you let me give you
  some advice

 if youve got a job today-for your
 own sake fellow be smart think
 twice before you fight for a wage in-
 crease that might force prices up and
 land you behind the eight-ball in the
 end

   salt away as much as you can out
 of your present wages put money in
 the bank pay up your debts buy more
 life insurance above all put every
 extra penny you can lay your hands on
 into uncle sams war bonds

   nobody knows whats coming when
the germans and the japs are licked
perhaps well have good times okay
youll be sitting pretty perhaps well
have bad times then theyre sure to
hit hardest on the guy with nothing
saved

   the best thing you can do for your
 country right now is not to buy a thing
 you can get along without that helps
 keep prices down heads off inflation
 helps to insure good times after the
 war

   and the best thing you can do for
 your own sake brother if there should
 be a depression ahead is to get your
 finances organized on a sound basis of
 paid-up debts-and have a little money
 laid by to see you through

claws of perdition

            by gunnison steele

  seeking hidden gold sonora drake held adam boone helpless

sonora drake crossed the red des-
ert at night escaping into the lofty
tamarack hills here in the high
country where the wind blew cool and
clean in a world of perpetual twilight where
mighty firs fashioned a roof high above he
felt that he would be safe from the law

  for sonora drake was a killer a human
wolf down in the lowlands town of sentinel
he had robbed a bank and killed a man and
now he was running for four days he rode

sonora drake

the uplands awed by their vastness and aloof-
ness then when his grub was gone and he
was feeling the pangs of hunger-he came
unexpectedly upon adam boones cabin

  adam boone was a runty gray-bearded
little gent oddly dwarfed by the towering
forests that hemmed in his cabin he wel-
comed sonora drake eagerly

  six months since ive seen a human he
chuckled a feller gets lonesome

  so yuh live here all alone sonora asked
  just me and my friends

  friends sonora said sharply

  the runty oldster chuckled again gesturing
at the shadowy forests that hemmed the clear-
ing in which the cabin huddled old nero

there and the deer and muskrats theyre all
my friends

  sonora grunted and dismounted looking
carefully about suddenly aware of the deep
silence that had gripped the vicinity as he ap-
proached a deer had crashed away through
the underbrush a squirrel that had been
chattering in a nearby tree had quieted a
huge black bear stood at the edge of the clear-
ing the bear had been nosing among some
leaves but now it stood motionless watching
the big killer with suspicious unblinking eyes
friends huh sonora growled

  nero wont hurt you unless you bother
him he just dont know you you timber
cruisin up here

  thats right sonora lied and im hun-
gry you got anything to eat old man
plenty come on inside

tjonora drake tied his horse and fol-
lowed adam boone into the cabin he
hadnt decided what course to pursue the
oldster had shown no sign of suspecting who
or what he was maybe he could hole up here
until it was safe to return to the lowlands

  the one room was rudely furnished but
clean besides the stove it contained a table
a couple of chairs and a bureau all home-
made a bunk with the blankets that covered
it trailing to the floor was in a corner of the
room adam boone indicated a chair against
the wall across the room from the bunk

  set down over there mister whatd you
say your name was

  lake-john lake the killer said

  the oldster started perceptibly he looked
closely at sonora drake his eyes narrowing
down-and in that instant sonora drake knew
that further lying would be useless he jerked
out his gun lining it on the oldster and his
black eyes held a cold feral light

  he sneered so thats it you know me
dont you

  adam boone didnt seem scared

   shore i know you he said quietly youre
sonora drake and youve killed half a dozen
men ive got an old reward flyer over there
in the bureau drawer with your name and
picture on it which i picked up last time i
was in sentinel you runnin from the law
i was but i give that posse the slip when
i quit the desert and come off up here if you
know me old man yuh know i wont stand
ror any foolishness you try any tricks and
yuhll get the same medicine i gave that old
goat down there in the sentinel bank he
reached into a drawer like mebbe he had a
gun there and i let him have it it was kind
of funny the way his toes curled up

   adam grew very still

   not a fat bald little gent with longhorn
 mustaches he whispered

   thats right you know him

   old sam giles adam said a dazed look
 in his pale eyes me and sam used to be
 pardners for thirty years we roamed the des-
 erts and mountains lookin for gold sam was
 the best pard any man ever had but finally
 sam met a girl and married and he took to
 bankin i been alone since then but i alius
 visited sam once a year and wed talk over
 old times i-you shore sams dead

   yep im shore sonora said callously
 he ought to have had better sense than to
 reach into that drawer he just made me
 shoot him and that stirred up a wasp nest and
 i had to run without a dollar of the banks
 taoney i was lucky to get away alive

   it aint right adam muttered sam
 wouldnt harm a fly somethin ought to hap-
 pen to anyone thatd kill him like that

   yuh better get such ideas out of yore
 head you got a gun old man

   the oldster nodded toward a long-barreled
 old rifle on the wall only that hardly ever
 need a gun everything around here is my
 friend

   sonora drake got up and took the rifle
 then he closed and latched the door just
 in case that blasted bear takes a notion to
 come in here and jump me he grinned

 you aim to do me like you did pore sam
 ill be decidin about that while yuh cook
 up some grub get busy now and remember
 ill be settin right here in this chair with a
 gun in my hand

  adam boone offered no further protest he
 went silently about kindling a fire in the
 stove he seemed stunned and bewildered
 by the news that his old pard sam giles was
 dead he must have known sonora drake
 meant to kill him but he still showed no fear

 from a window sonora could see the
 huge bear as it overturned a log and
 pawed under it for grubs he noticed the
 red deer had returned to the clearing edge and
 stood there motionless eyeing the cabin a
 couple of squirrels capered across the clear-
 ing friends bosh he sneered what good
 will they do you now old man

   adams manner was dejected theyre all
 ill have now that sam is gone i guess i
 wont even need that little gold i-

   he stopped talking abruptly sonora drakes
 eyes had narrow gold you pannin gold
 in that creek out yonder

   never heard of any gold bein found up
 here did you adam muttered

  yes i did by gosh thats itl  been
wonderin why yuh was stuck off in a place
like this that means yuhve got a nugget
cache where is it

  look drake i havent found much gold
dont lie to me yuh old buzzard where
is the gold

  aint you done enough what with murder-
in old sam the oldster said miserably im
gettin old and i need something to keep me
stop blubberin sonora drake got to his
feet his black eyes shone with a greedy
wicked light he jabbed the gun at adam
speak quick old man or ill kill yuh and
find the cache myself where is it

  adams thin shoulders slumped with defeat
over there under the bunk he said
sonora drake strode quickly across to the
bunk he stooped lifted the trailing blankets

  there was a hissing snarling spitting
sound and a tawny thunderbolt streaked from
under the bunk sonora lunged backward with
a startled yell but the thunderbolt had
fastened itself on sonoras leg-and then with
incredible speed still snarling and spitting it
scaled upward and perched between sonoras
shoulder blades there with fang and claw
it went to work furiously on the killers neck
and face

  sonora had dropped his gun and he was
screaming with pain and surprise frantically
he grabbed at the tawny creature that was
ripping and mauling at him with such cyclonic
savagery but the thunderbolt clung slash-
ing at sonoras hands and arms panic seized
the big outlaw he lunged wildly at the spot
where he thought the door was he smashed
into the wall and it flung him back then
he stumbled over a chair and fell to the floor
where he rolled over and over screaming

  adam had the gun and now he leaped to
the door and flung it open abruptly the thun-
derbolt left sonora and still yowling angrily
streaked out the door and across the clearing

  all right killer-you can get up now
adam said calmly youre just clawed up
some which aint as bad as youll get when i
take you down to sentinel

  sonora drake sat up whimpering his shirt
almost torn from his body his face and neck
bloodv and ripped

  what was that cussed thing he moaned
just a she-bobcat which sneaked in here
one day when i went off and left the door
open got under the bunk and started her a
family i let her stay mainly because aint
nothin on earth tougher or worse-humored
than a bobcat with young kittens thats why
i been sleepin out in the tool-shed for the last
week afraid to get close to the bunk

  what about yore gold cache sonora
drake whined

  old adam chuckled

  that was just a trick i figured out to get
you over to the bunk only thing i got up
here worth money is my friends


trail talk

continued from page s

no chance of winning he simply mysteriously
withdrew from the battle and the smoothest
indians could not follow him but soon he
would just bob up again ready for another
battle

the chisholm trail

  when we started this trail jaunt however
we intended to start meandering southward
from dodge city kansas that rough tough
famous first western cattle market the
town that figured greatly in the early days
of the cattle industry and to which ran the
famous old chisholm trail

  the chisholm trail was the trail over
which thousands and thousands of long-
horn cattle were driven from texas and the
southwest to market at the then western
terminus of the railroad it came out of
texas then a wild and sparsely settled state
through the indian territory which was if
anything still wilder

  hundreds of stories of tragedy of adven-
ture of courage and of romance have been
told about this trail and while the old trail
has given way to paved highways the trail
itself having passed out of existence the
stories will live on and on

  sometimes corning north along the chis-
holm trail the trail drivers would meet
men who lived not by earning but by
taking from those who were weaker or not
so well armed

loyal cowboys

  no greater loyalty has ever been shown
for the boss or the firm than that shown
by the cowboy trail drivers who worked for
a much smaller salary per month than is
now usually paid per week and yet with
that small salary never shirked when riding
into the face of danger they risked their
lives almost every day and would stand pat
in the face of odds and fight to the death if
necessary to protect the cattle of the man
from whom they drew their wages

  it is natural then that those men along
the trail with cattle while they were always
glad to meet other human beings were cau-
tious whenever strangers came around and
looked upon each stranger with suspicion
until they had measured him by their own
scale

  the majority of those old trail drivers
were great character readers they had to
be for their own safety

  were we following the old chisholm trail
south from dodge city we would pass a
little east of coffeyville kansas where the
dalton gang of outlaws made things lively
for quite a while they added many pages
to oklahomas outlaw history the prin-
cipals of the gang were grat and bob dal-

ton emmett the younger brother did not
count as a principal of the outlaw gang
he was too young and simply went along and
helped but took no part in the planning
other prominent members of the gang were
bill doolin dick broadwell bill powers
and black-faced charlie bryant

 the mother of the dalton boys was a
younger a relative of the younger side
of the famous missouri outlaw band the
james-younger gang and although it has
been three quarters of a century the names
of the youngers and jesse and frank james
still live and are mentioned whenever old-
times or early outlaws are talkedabout

  the dalton gang committed many depre-
dations along and on both sides of the chis-
holm trail that we are now riding they
robbed banks trains stores murdered who-
ever got in their way when they were in
the act of robbery or escaping from the law

 this went on until bob dalton who
planned most of the robberies seemed to
get over-ambitious and wanted to stage a
bank holdup that would eclipse anything
ever perpetrated by the famous younger-
james clan

a double holdup

 bob dalton thought that robbing one
bank in a town was just ordinary but to
rob two banks in the same town at the
same time would be an outstanding achieve-
ment one that would make his name live on
and on it did and while he lost his life in
the attempt to rob two banks at one time
he achieved the purpose of making his name
live on and on through the pages of out-
lawry

  the banks selected for the double holdup
were banks of their own hometown coffey-
ville the robbery was unsuccessful and the
dalton gang was practically wiped out but
no braver deed was ever attempted by out-
law or lawman than that of emmett dalton
the kid of the gang who turned back in the
face of deadly gunfire in an attempt to drag
his mortally wounded older brother bob
up and onto his own horse after bob had
fallen before the furious gunfire of the citi-
zens who seemed to have been tipped off
in advance and who were shooting at the
outlaws from every direction

  it is similar to the story of the end of many
other men who lived by force of the six-
gun one mistake-it may be the first and
it is apt to be the last

pawnee bills adventure

  as we ride on down the once famous trail
into oklahoma just a little to the west of
our trail is the section where the bert casey
gang of outlaws operated and where later
another noted oklahoma outlaw operated
and caused many a widespread manhunt

  it was also into this same section that the
late major gordon w lillie pawnee bill
rode when little more than a boy with a
string of pack mules loaded with hides for
trading at an indian post there were few
white men in that section at the time ex-
cept the indian agents and outlaws

  what an adventure it must have been for
young pawnee bill in a storm he lost
his way darkness was coming on and he a
young fellow was alone in a wild and rough
country a stranger appeared on the scene
found that the youngster was lost led the
way to a camp and invited the young man
to stay for the night here again the charac-
ter reading of the pioneer came into play

tough hombres

 pawnee bill knew that the men at the
camp were no ordinary cattlemen or men
of any ordinary business there were quite
a number of rough-looking men in the camp
and while they were civil enough to their
overnight guest they engaged in conversa-
tion with him very little but gathered in
groups to themselves where they carried on
their conversation in low tones this be-
spoke that their talk was not for his ears

  pawnee bill was given directions for find-
ing the indian post the next morning and
was well on his way when he learned that
he had spent the night in the camp of the
famous outlaw james gang and although
he had been well treated he never forgot the
experience

  to go up the chisholm trail with a trail
herd was a great adventure to the average

largest rare coin establishment in d 

cowpuncher but they knew that it was no
picnic it meant long and hard riding long
weary hours in the saddle and plenty of
danger there are some men who are never
satisfied unless they are courting a new
adventure they seem not to worry about
the danger of any occupation or calling
and the trail drivers were of this class

  usually the trail drivers were recruited
at whatever point or section the herd origi-
nated their salary was anywhere from
forty dollars to sixty dollars per month
according to their ability and experience
and the amount of equipment they furnished

  if they furnished their own horses they
usually drew a little higher salary than if
they did not furnish their own mounts yet
many owners of cattle herds did not like
to have the trail drivers furnish their own
mounts because in such cases a rider might
spare his horse and partially neglect the
cattle

                                                              

rounding up the herd

  the trail drivers usually helped round up
the herd of cattle and get them ready for the
trail it did not take long when once out
upon the trail to accustom men and cattle
alike to the routine

  by daylight every morning the cattle
would be up and grazing away from their
bed grounds and all hands except the last
guard those who went on the last shift
guard and who would start the cattle graz-
ing toward the north end of the trail
would have eaten breakfast

  then while the last guard ate the rest of
the crew would be stringing the cattle out
by the time these men had the herd strung
out in good traveling formation the men left
behind would be up in their places with the
herd

  all day long the men rode slowly along
riding hard only when it was necessary
to head off an animal that had a desire to
leave the herd at night the outfit was
usually divided into three guards

  normally this arrangement left several
hours for sleep but if the weather was bad
or threatened to be bad all hands were put
on guard and there was no sleep and usually
the trail boss or owner would sometimes
laughingly point out to the men that they
could sleep all the next winter

horse thieves

  different outfits had different methods of
handling the saddle horses at night with
some outfits a remudero or wrangler-
night-hawk he was often called-herded
the horses other outfits had no night-
herder for the horses but simply hobbled
them but no matter how the horses were
handled horse thieves were likely to make
away with some of them on a dark night
  if they were herded a thief could slip
 in among them and drift a few out if they
 were hobbled a thief could catch what he
 wanted cut the hobbles and drive or lead
 them away a night wrangler meant an ex-
 tra man on the payroll and a lot of the out-
 fits that went up the trail were short on
 cash and used as few hands as possible

   uncle dan stewart who went up the trail
 several times told me of a time when two
 young men rode into his camp just as the
 men were hobbling their horses before eat-
 ing supper they were invited to light un-
 saddle and eat

  they were very accommodating and
helped the men hobble the horses but they
did not unsaddle stating that they had a
long way to go and would have to be making
tracks as soon as they had a bite to eat
a little after dark they pulled out and uncle
dan said that they were nice looking young
fellows and so never aroused any suspicion
during their short stay in the camp

  when the remuda was rounded up the
 next morning six horses were missing and
 by a strange coincidence all the horses miss-
 ing belonged to the boss or owner of the
 herd the two thieves having helped with
 the hobbling of the horses had spotted those
 that belonged to individual trail drivers and
 perhaps had just a little fraternal feeling
 toward the men who drove cattle on their
 own horses

almost invariably ran into indians who
either demanded or begged for beef and to
turn down their request could easily lead
to trouble

  on one trip up the trail a cattleman by the
name of bill jackman picked up a big steer
that by the brand he knew belonged to col
ike pryor who had gone up the trail with
a herd sometime before jackmans inten-
tions were good and honest and he intended
to take the steer along with his herd and
return it to pryor at dodge city but while
passing through the indian territory a fat
osage indian with a gang of warriors rode
up to the herd and asked for the chief
jackman was pointed out then the indian
gravely handed him a slip of paper

  unfolding the paper which the indian had
handed to him jackman read as follows

  to the trail bosses this is a good in-
dian i know him personally give him beef
and you will have no trouble getting through
his country ike pryor

  the indian got beef but it was pryors
steer that was given him and all the crew
of trail drivers considered it a great joke
and each in turn when they met pryor
kidded him about the note

  it was a great trail that chisholm trail
and those men who drove the trail herds of
longhorns were real he-men thats one of
the reasons we have such a great west to-
day adios

here was trouble on the rocking m
ranch for eight days and nights dan
mallory was missing he started out for
town one morning and then completely dis-
appeared his dead horse was found but
there was no trace of the ranch owner

  at the ranch his motherless daughter wait-
ed as did old hoodoo turner foreman of
the outfit for the past fourteen years they
were still hoping that dan mallory would
return-and that night their hopes were
realized the owner of the rocking m came
back

  but he was a changed man there was a
bunch of hard-eyed gunslicks with him and
dan mallory announced that slade corrigan
the leader of the new arrivals was the new
half-owner of the ranch and he and his men
were all joining the outfit ray abbott the
tough little killer who was corrigans right
hand man listened silently as mallory made
the announcement

  from outside there came the sudden roar-
ing of guns ray abbott stepped to the lamp
on the table and blew it out plunging the
room into darkness he then hurried out
into the hall and blew out the lamp there
in the darkness the front door closed and
abbott bolted it from the inside
 the box h outfit must have trailed us
here corrigans deep voice sounded iron-
ical in the blackness too bad-reckon they
didnt like us stealin that herd and drivin
it back into the mountains

 gunslicks-rustlers exclaimed hoodoo
turner all i got to say is yuh shore picked
yoreself some fine partners boss

 the guns outside were louder from a
window in another room came the roar of
abbotts guns as he fired at the men of jerry
holcombs box h outfit corrigan was dimly
outlined against the night light as he moved
to an open window

 hoodoo turner drew his gun and aimed
at the back of the man at the window dan
mallory seemed to sense what the foreman
intended to do for the ranch owner moved
close to turner and caught his gun arm

 dont hoodoo mallory whispered
that wont do any good this is too big
for us to handle yuhve got to get away-
try and find the one man who can help us

i	know hes in the valley for i seen him
just before sunset tonight

  who is that boss turner asked softly
as mallory released his arm what man
the masked rider whispered mallory
as corrigan fired from the window find
him this is just the start of whats gonna
happen here and i can do nothin to stop it
nothin i tell yuh

  dad wailed sally out of the darkness
make these men stop fighting the box h
jerry holcomb is out there-hell be killed
and i-i love him

  get rifles mallory commanded corri-
gan without turning from the window this
is yore fight as well as mine partner

 that is the dramatic start of ghost
guns the complete book-length wayne
morgan novel by donald bayne hobart in
the next issue of masked rider west-
ern

  it was easier for hoodoo turner to find the
masked rider than the old foreman had even
dared to hope for the black-clad wanderer
heard the sound of shooting coming from
the rocking m and galloped to the ranch to
investigate

 the masked rider found a chance to talk
to turner after jerry holcombs outfit had
ceased their attack on the spread and gone
away the masked rider learned that a pass
through the mountains which was part of
rocking m property was the only way the
ranchers in the valley could get their herds
to the railroad town miles to the north if
mallorys new outfit refused to let the herds
through the pass there would be plenty of
trouble

 swiftly the masker rider and his yaqui
companion blue hawk go into action with
brains and courage wayne morgan goes
after his foes who are also the enemies of

 ern for about  years i like it better than any other
 magazine i like the novels very much i liked
 gunpowder strip lost valley devils
 range dead mans ranch and guns of
 the malpais keep up the good work

-tommy bell el dorado ark

  i have been reading masked rider western
 for some time and if there is any better magazine
 i have not yet seen it i especially like larry a
 harris novels give us some more like lost val-
 ley and dead mams ranch

-herman king wolf creek w va

  i have been a reader of masked rider west-
 ern for sometime and i think it really is an inter-
 esting magazine naturally there are some stories i
 like better than others but i like most of them

              -jewell robison crab orchard tenn

   maybe it is because i like short stories better than
 long novels-but there are times when the masked
 rider just doesnt appeal to me it seems like he is
 able to do too much for just one man maybe im
 wrong-but you wanted my opinion-so here it is

-david blake philadelphia pa

   i enjoy your magazine very much the stories
 certainly are action packed i like wayne morgan
 best of all he certainly is a real hero but like most
 heroes i would like to see him have a litue romance
 along with all his exciting adventures i find that i
 like masked rider western better than most
 any western magazine i have read

-mary l elmore hope michigan
