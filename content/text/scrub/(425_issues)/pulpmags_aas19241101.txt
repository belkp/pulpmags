chapter i

 the big day

when you have an office boy like
jimmy around even for the two
weeks he lasted you get into the
habit of watching him out of one corner of
your eye i saw him duck back from the
window suddenly and then stretch out his
neck and stare down again at the street
one floor below then he croaked

    mr morse hey morse come look
 this over 

   well i had been tiring myself all out for
       a	

 ten minutes ignoring him but i had a
 little strength left and i kept on ignoring
 him it didnt work so well the kid just
 flapped an arm up and down beckoning
 and he all but yelled

    no come this is on the level you
 dont want to miss this

   then i looked at him without excep-
 tion he was the worst thing in the way of
 a boy that ever got on the pay roll most of
 them spend a lot of lime near the windows
 because the b berford corporation takes
 up the whole second floor and theres a
 good deal to be seen but jimmy might


argosy-allstory weekly

shave been glued to the glass eight hours
a day just then he ought to have been
taking out the private office mail and stick-
ing on the stamps

   kid i said sternly  if i tell you
again to take out that mail im going
to speak to the boss and have you canned
to-night

   thatll be all right chief said the
accursed brat  but before you do the dirty
work come quick and get an eyeful of this
while it lasts

  and im hanged if there wasnt something
so odd about him that i got out of my chair
and walked over to his side-and the funny
thing is he was dead right there was
certainly at least one eyeful down there
and so far as im concerned there were
about two dozen

  the boss-my personal boss you know
thomas f berford president of the com-
pany son of the founder the case-hardened
bachelor that everyone said didnt know
whether the prettiest girl in the office was
twenty years old or seventy and didnt give
a hoot in any case-the boss was standing
down there on the curb beside nine thou-
sand dollars worth of pale blue automobile
and behind the wheel all in one chunk sat
about ninety million dollars worth of girl
more he was holding her hand and he
looked as if hed been holding it for some
time and she was gazing up at him as if-
oh theres no use trying to describe the
way she was looking at him if some little
flapper away back in the ancient times
ever summoned up the nerve to look a
real god in the eye and let him hold her
hand she must have looked at him just
like that

  and that wasnt all by any means the
boss himself raised his head and sort of sur-
veyed the neighborhood as if hed never
really seen it before he was smiling he
doesnt do that so often there was a
kind of pinkish flush on his face too and
as a rule hes pale then the wonderful
girl in the car said something to him and he
burst out laughing just like a boy and he
took her hand in both of his and squeezed
and she put out her other hand and there
they were for about a minute just looking
at one another

  and then something woke them up and
they were all flustered for ten seconds or
so and after that she started the engine
and drove off and mr berford stood on the
curb waving his hand after her

  queer it was a lot more than queer
youd have had to know mr berford as
well as i did to realize how queer it all was
i just kept on staring even after the boss
had walked into the building jimmy poked
my ribs

   not so worse chief-huh he said
 not so worse for a guy like him they
got some slick ones up to the follies-
huh

   mail those letters i said

  there was no follies about that girl
though she was just plain millionaire class
and she was so infernally pretty that one
felt sort of dazed even after looking at her
from a distance and--well mr berford
came into his office just then

  he was whistling a jazzy little tune to
himself id never heard him do that be-
fore and as a matter of fact i havent
heard him do it many times since-but he
was whistling then fast enough also hed
brought the smile all the way upstairs with
him

   good morning henry he said

   good morning sir i said

   wonderful day he went on

   yes sir

   wonderful day said the boss and ac-
tually grinned at me and then instead of
handing me his hat to hang up on the
clothes tree in the corner he sent it spinning
through the air-and im blest if it didnt
land squarely on the peg at that

   mail all ready for me henry he said
as he sat down behind his desk

   right there sir 

  he picked up the first letter of the pile
id sorted out for his personal attention
and put in about two minutes staring at it
holding it upside down then he dropped
it and looked at me

  henry he said  youre pretty ef-
ficient arent you

   i hope so i answered

   how long have you been my secre-
tary

   a little over three years now
where was i 



   how old are you said the boss

   twenty-five i said and began to won-
der what it was about

  mr berford just shook his head thought-
fully

   um-m he muttered  doesnt seem
any nine years since i was twenty-five my-
self-er henry

   yes sir

   how many times have i raised your
salary

   well just once two years ago i said

   really said mr berford and he
looked almost shocked  well im going
to raise it again ten per henry beginning
immediately you do not find yourself
heartbroken over this

   suppose i grinned if i did most of it
was astonishment the president of our cor-
poration doesnt put that easy intimate ef-
fect into his conversation as a rule

   sir i can stand a shock like that four
times a week if necessary i answered
-and it struck me all of a sudden that that
wasnt just the way id been in the habit of
talking to mr berford either

  he only leaned back and laughed though
-yes laughed right out loud like an or-
dinary human being-and when he had
finished laughing his face smoothed out into
the funniest most glorified smile and he
clasped his hands on top of his desk and
looked straight at me

   henry he burst out  did you-er-
ever-er-

  and that was all there was of that the
boss straightened up in his chair with quite
a jerk and coughed the glorified smile dis-
appeared and he frowned over his mail just
as he always does and coughed again quite
violently

   er-what was i going to say-well
its immaterial in any case he murmured
and kept his eye on the mail  ill-er-
ring for you when ive been through this
stuff henry well go light on the mail
to-day i want to finish up that report for
the annual meeting of the directors this aft-
ernoon

  then he glanced at me again in the dear
old familiar way which means  get out of
here i trotted into my own little two-
by-four office and i cant say that all alone

there i broke down and wept i have no
responsibilities of course but an extra ten-
spot every saturday looks just as pretty and
enticing to me as it does to the next man
thinking it all over i certainly did warm
through to that girl in the big blue roadster

  well admit that im not particularly
bright still there are some things that can
be grasped without entirely wrecking the
brain and this was one of them at last mr
thomas f berford was in love

  this happens so i understand to a num-
ber of people in the course of a year but
there was something mighty near incredible
about mr berford getting into that condi-
tion maybe it was because he had always
seemed so hard and arrogant without a
grain of sentiment in him maybe it was
because in my own mind id never asso-
ciated him with one thing in the wide world
but work with a capital w

  and he was a glutton for work normal-
ly hed arrive in the morning with that
rushing effect that always suggested a kan-
sas cyclone slap down the black brief case
he always carries ring for me if i hadnt
already appeared dump the brief case on
his desk and begin dictating even before
getting at the mail after that hed play
a symphony on his little bank of electric
buttons and department heads would come
a-running and then stand and listen all
screwed up to concert pitch while mr ber-
ford shot orders at them with the general
effect of a machine-gun

  next wed do the early mail marathon
and when that was over i had ruined anoth-
er notebook and had six more pencils ready
for the sharpener after that came the visit-
ors all by appointment and it was a mighty
important one who talked more than five
minutes in the presidents office-and so on
through the day at just the same speed un-
til some time after five mr berford would
pack up his black brief case again until it
bulged and then steer for the old home up-
town they said he worked all night every
night and ive been inclined more than
once to believe it

  oh he was a hustler fast enough and
there seemed to be no end to his energy
ive seen young mallison the boob junior
partner-the firm used to be berford 


argosy-allstory weekly

mallison you know before we incorpor-
ated-ive seen mallison come in with his
golf sticks and pat mr berford on the
back and beg him to come take just one
week off why mallison used to do every-
thing but cry over him when mr ber-
ford would shake his head and tell him to
get out as he always did mallison used
to look like a mother worried to death over
her sick only child and ive seen other
friends come in and implore him to go with
them for trips and cruises and so on he
never went when mr berford left new
york it was on business and once i re-
member somebody had his old family doc-
tor call at the office and do his darnedest to
make mr berford promise to quit an hour
earlier and come uptown and have himself
thumped and sounded all over to see what
part of him was getting ready to smash
first under the strain he never went there
either its just possible that mr berford
himself knew best how he felt but even so
it did seem queer how he kept it up

  he rang for me about half past ten and
we finished up the annual report and it
was certainly some report i knew we
had been doing a mighty fine business
through the year but i hadnt suspected
that we were turning into a monoply four
minor competitors had just been sponged
out of the picture completely three more
bigger ones we had absorbed gently and
painlessly and they were now part of the
berford corporation that of course left
a single big firm for us to buck the storm
manufacturing company-otherwise george
r storm the champion hard-boiled iron-
fisted relentless business man of all time
wed been bucking them and they inci-
dentally had been bucking us for several
years and i suppose it is no breach of con-
fidence to say that theyd put at least as
many dents into us as ever wed put into
them off and on there had been a lot of
talk among our big people about coming
to some amicable agreement with the storm
folks but it never seemed to get anywhere

  well thats the sort of report it was and
i really enjoyed writing it and i was glad
too that id be sitting beside mr berford
when he read it so that i could watch the
directors faces

  theyre a lot of funny old birds our di-
rectors were a very staid old concern
you know and this crowd was all asso-
ciated with the original berford thomas
fs father jones and moreland are just
ordinary old-timers macpherson is about
what his name indicates bennetts the best
old soul that ever lived all kindness and
sympathy but isaac craven is the great-
est card of the whole collection somebody
must have done something pretty mean to
craven when he was an impressionable lit-
tle child and the memory has stuck fast ever
since when craven puts down his head
and looks at you through his thick eye-
brows you know perfectly well that he sus-
pects you of looting the safe after thirty
seconds of it you begin to wonder yourself
if you havent been doing something like
that i think craven must have trusted his
own father and mother implicitly-if they
were covered by a thoroughly responsible
bonding company

  all five of them gathered at four oclock

  they puffed into the directors room and
shed their coats and got out their expensive
cigars they swapped a few anecdotes about
the civil war and jim fiske and black
friday and other things you read about in
histories and then mr berford and i came
in and the session began

  i wasnt disappointed in that matter of
watching their faces while the president
read his notes they looked like a lot of
nice elderly children hearing the news that
all candy is to be distributed free hence-
forth and that therell be an extra santa
claus working next christmas four of
them sat and gurgled craven just nodded
and nodded and rubbed his hands together
until one would have thought the skin must
have peeled and the boss finished his dec-
lamation and they clapped their hands and
rose and patted him on the shoulders they
did everything but cheer

  bennett was the most enthusiastic of
them all

  they calmed after a while and sat down
again all but bennett he remained stand-
ing by his chair and his smile seemed to
light up the whole place

   ah-gentlemen-you tom-all hands
this is-ah-splendid he said
where was i



   splendids not the word for it-not the
word for it jones said

   well magnificent might be a little bet-
ter joe mr bennett beamed  however
we wont waste time hunting adjectives i
think we all feel more adjectives just now
than can be expressed but it seems to me
a fitting moment to express our apprecia-
tion of thomas berford just once more
and just a little more strongly than usual
and with your permission gentlemen i shall
try to do that

  they applauded mr bennett bowed and
cleared his throat

   thomas he went on solemly to mr
berford  we knew you most of us as a
boy-the worthy son of your incomparable
father we felt all of us no slightest trace
of hesitation in asking you five years ago
and young as you were to take the place
he once occupied in our company yet not
one of us i am very certain felt that an-
other man quite like your father could exist
-and there is not one of us to-day
thomas unconscious of some slight amaze-
ment that another such man not only can
and does exist but that we have the rare
good fortune to own him as our chief ex-
ecutive

  they applauded some more and this time
mr berford bowed and smiled

   i am a man of few words thomas
the speaker continued  and to those few
i cannot give sufficient strength we have
known you for many years as a man whose
spotless private life was far far beyond
the faintest breath of criticism-whose en-
ergy in our service has been so tireless
whose executive capacity has been so broad
as to be almost astounding no no my
dear boy dont protest this is not
flattery but simple happy truth and to-
day after hearing your report and realizing
all that lies behind it i want to go just a
little bit farther i want to tell you
thomas that it is my firm conviction as it
is the sense of all this gathering that in you
we possess the perfect man the perfect
president 

  and again they clapped their hands even
to craven who actually smiled as he did
it mr berford shrugged his shoulders and
looked a little bored and foolish

   thanks but it isnt necessary to lay it
on as thick as all that he said

   i think it is tom macpherson said
unexpectedly  theres none other just
like you in the whole world theres never
been but one-your father

   and when he names you  perfect
tom he says no more than we all feel
mr moreland contributed very earnestly

   and now having said very badly what
i wished to say so emphatically mr ben-
nett concluded with the same beaming
smile  may i make a single prophecy
within one year gentlemen within one year
i venture to predict thomas berford will
have the storm manufacturing company it-
self eating out of his capable hand

  he sat down and they stared hard at him
because that surely was putting things
pretty strongly jones gave one or two du-
bious nods as if hed have liked to be op-
timistic about it but found that impossible
macpherson just sighed craven pulled
down one corner of his mouth with the fam-
iliar sneering effect that passed for a smile
but mr bennett leaned forward pounding
the table with his clenched fist and glared
at them

   why dammit hes capable of it
hell do it sooner or later ill bet any
man present a thousand dollars that tom
has from one to a dozen tentative schemes
in his head at this minute for bringing
storm into camp well

  they didnt take the bet-and just then
i happened to look at mr berford and i
kept on looking harder and harder for that
smile of his was distinctly peculiar it be-
gan as the faintest little flush it grew
broader and broader then it seemed to sink
into him again and he chuckled for a sec-
ond or two

  he looked around the table and rubbed
his chin meditatively as he does when his
mind isnt quite made up after that he
gave a small grunt and rose to his feet and
standing there and looking at them he
made quite a picture more than anything
else it seemed as if mr berford was hyp-
notizing them he was just oozing domin-
ation over those five old gentlemen as he
did about every so often when sonething
important was afoot and they were looking


argosy-allstory weekly

up at him in the same inquiring expectant
way i had come to recognize

   well gentlemen mr berford said in
that crisp voice of his  now that youve
said all these nice things about me may i
be permitted to thank you

   its not necessary tom bennett said
 and having thanked you to make a
little speech of my own the president
smiled  what i have to say is of a dis-
tinctly personal nature and perhaps this is
not quite the place to say it but on the
other hand he went on soberly  perhaps
it is a confidence which is due you gentle-
men i recognize to the full the close rela-
tion between a mans personal life and his
business life to you gentlemen the direc-
tors of our company i have always tried to
make my life an open book-and hence
perhaps more than you quite understand
i appreciate very deeply the trust in me
that you have been so kind as to express
he drew a long breath and looked rather
uncomfortable and sheepish they stared
at him with growing curiosity

   all of this gentlemen is leading up to
the announcement that your bachelor presi-
dent shortly will no longer be a bachelor
president

   huh said craven

   i expect to be married in june
  married gasped mr bennett

   married smiled the president

   well-by cracky   the old boy yelled
joyfully  going to turn human like the
rest of us are you going to get out of
the hermit state and join the jolly old race
eh well thats fine tom that-that-
that-by gad thats tremendous

  now all of them were gabbling about it
too they popped out of their chairs and
swarmed around the president shaking his
hand and congratulating him even craven
joined in this although without much en-
thusiasm mr berford waited patiently
until they had quieted down then more-
land asked

   whos the fortunate lady tom

   well thats the second part of my an-
nouncement the president said with a
broad smile  the lady who has done me
the very great honor of consenting to be
my wife is-ah-miss alicia storm

  just exactly as if five strings had pulled
them all five sat bolt upright and gaped
at him

   not-not george storms daughter
jones cried

   his only daughter mr berford said
quietly

  moreland got up to the surface about
that time with a new gasp

   youre going to-to marry the storm
manufacturing company

   i am going to marry mr storms
daughter the boss repeated rather frostily

  well-well-well-here here god
bless my soul what did i tell you what
did i say not five minutes ago mr ben-
nett sputtered quite crazily  didnt i
predict that-um-that- and just there
he caught mr berfords eye which was
quite cold and steely and he subsided sud-
denly with a mumbled not-not to im-
ply tom that-ah-not to imply of
course that-er-well you know what i
mean my dear boy

  there was a heavy hush second after
second as they assimilated the news mr
jones broke it in a queer awed little voice
 we called him-called him perfect
and he looked around dizzily  isnt there
any stronger word than that isnt there
any stronger word than just perfect

chapter ii

regarding luck

 dont know the longer you live in
this world the more of a shame it seems
that nothing under the sun can ever be
quite one hundred per cent perfect what
i mean is that if you ever did happen to
stumble on a mine with a billion dollars
worth of pure gold in the middle of a desert
some infernal crape-hanger would be sure to
pop up from nowhere at all and tell you
that probably it wasnt pure gold-and if it
was gold was going down so fast that it
wasnt worth anything like a billion dollars
-and even if it stopped going down it
would probably cost more to mine it in this
particular location than the gold was worth

  it was just like that in this matter of
mr berfords announcing his engagement
where

was i



  four of the five directors broke loose
after a minute or so and raised shouts of
rejoicing and mr berford grew paler and
paler and i knew if nobody else did that
he was getting madder than sixty his an-
nouncement not having been taken in quite
the way he had intended-or rather per-
haps having been taken in such a purely
selfish way by the directorate that the pres-
ident wasnt feeling flattered

  the director who did not lift up his voice
in jubilation was mr isaac craven

  he had started at the very first mention
of the storm name his mean eyes had tak-
en on a meaner little squint and fastened
hard on mr berford and they had been
there ever since now as a sort of happy
giggle died down cravens lips opened
slowly

   that-hey he said

   what mr berford asked

  craven nodded just once as if he under-
stood a great deal

   it seems possible that your life may not
have been quite the open book you have
led us to believe he said very distinctly
while the rest of them sat rather stunned

   what the devil do you mean by that
sir mr berford asked and banged his
fist down on the table

   i mean that youve been secretly con-
sorting with the family of george storm
sir craven cried and banged down his
own fist  i mean sir that in actual fact
you are upon the friendliest terms with a-
an individual fondly supposed by us to be
your-as he is our-deadliest enemy per-
sonal and business i mean to say sir that
this smells amazingly strong of treason to
our company and-

  why you confounded old fool mr
bennett shouted and he has a big voice
when he wants to use it  you soured
doddering old-old idiot you-pay no
attention to him thomas pay no atten-
tion and-

  he said more but it was drowned out by
the uproar that was coming from jones and
moreland and macpherson about that time
they too were addressing craven-and
after about thirty seconds of the din they
seemed to be making an impression old
isaac looked downright scared

  both mr berfords fists were clenched
and he was snow-white and his jaw stuck
out as he waited it was quite interesting
he waited until things were quiet and
craven had shut his old teeth tight to-
gether and pulled down the corners of his
mouth

   may i say the president began so
steadily that i knew he was having a
dickens of a time to control himself that
of all things in the world the possibility of
having such construction placed upon my
engagement to miss storm never occurred
to me

  of course it never occurred to you
mr bennett thundered at craven  why
the sam hill should it occur to you
why-

   just a minute please but since it has
occurred to mr craven and since he has
voiced it with such charming candor at
whatever personal humiliation i insist upon
explaining the matter as well as may be
i-

   no explanation is necessary  more-
land cried

   yes it is-and cravens going to get
it said the boss and his voice shook i
met miss storm for the first time just five
months ago i have talked with her father
in his home just four times he is at least
as frank as-and rather more happily
poised than-mr craven in the plainest
english at the first interview he laid down
the proposition-and i accepted it-that
out of business hours our personal relation
had best be something like that which ob-
tains between lawyers who fight tooth and
nail on opposite sides of a case and after-
ward go to dinner together

  naturally naturally mr bennett
puffed  storms a devil incarnate but
hes not an ass

  hes not even a devil when you get ac-
quainted with him sir said the president
with a faint little smile  last night-
specifically at half-past nine in her own
home he spat at craven  i became en-
gaged to miss storm about one hour later
i talked for a considerable time with her
father he is as are we tired of fighting
he is not only open to-say ill be damned
if ill go any farther with this explanation


argosy-allstory weekly

shouted mr berford as he lost himself for
a second or two

  well by the mighty i guess you
neednt go any farther moreland cried
and his voice cracked with the pure joy of
the thing  youve said enough you-
youre a wonder youre-

  they were at it again all of them chat-
tering at once like so many monkeys first
at one another and then all of them at
mr craven and im bound to say that
craven was funny to watch he seemed
to be shrinking down his eyes were wide
open again and he was waving his hands
palms upward and saying something or
other that nobody bothered to hear mr
berford held up one hand and they grew
sflent suddenly

   does that explanation suffice he de-
manded

   you bet it suffices  mr jones cackled
and the rest nodded energetically

   and has the book of my life been
opened to your satisfaction mr craven
four old gentlemen leaned toward cra-
ven at once for a moment i thought there
was going to be a sort of elderly battle royal
to get at him but old isaac pulled himself
out of his chair and came toward berford

   i ask your pardon thomas he said
nicely enough  i spoke hastily and with-
out due thought i offer you my most hum-
ble apology

  he held out his hand and of course mr
berford shook it although i didnt notice
that craven had to wince any at the grip
he got as he turned around and went back
to his chair i caught his expression and it
struck me harder than ever how much more
like a catty old lady he is than like a man
woman convinced against her will you
know-all that sort of thing

  anyhow peace was restored and every-
thing was lovely and nothing short of a
national calamity could have taken the
smiles off the faces of those old gentlemen
for a while they talked and they guarded
their words so as not to offend mr ber-
ford  but a blind and deaf man in that room
could have sensed that nobody contem-
plated suicide because the president was
going to marry the storm manufacturing
company

  so far as that goes it did mean a lot to
all present it meant getting decent prices
henceforth and less worry and hundreds
on hundreds of thousands of dollars saved
on advertising campaigns by the time the
consolidation really had been effected it
would mean running two huge firms for
about the price of one with the profits
nearly doubled for everybody these old
codgers owned about all the berford stock
that had ever been sold no wonder they
were pleased

  but the presidents ruffled fur wasnt
smoothing down so easily mr berford is
an extrerhely proud person and it had hurt
him like sixty to stand up there and explain
his private affairs to old craven he fussed
for a minute or two glaring at them then
he turned and glared at me as if he were
going to knock me senseless just to relieve
his feelings then he got up with a savage
little jerk and they all stopped talking and
stared at him

   i am merely going over there for a
drink of water he explained tartly

  and he marched away from the table and
his heels must have ground straight through
the four thousand dollars worth of lovely
oriental rug we have in that directors
room

  they put up our building in the funny
old era when no office was properly fur-
nished unless it had a marble basin stuck
in the corner the marble basin was in
here with a mirror hung up above it and
an ancient screen in front of it and they
had put the showy white water-cooler be-
hind the screen too in the interest of ar-
tistic harmony i suppose the rest of the
place being rather chastely elaborate

  that was where mr berford headed and
once behind the screen he took his own
time about reappearing i dont know just
what was going on back there but i can
imagine most of it and very likely if the
directorate could have heard exactly what
their president was muttering theyd have
made a break for the door he drank one
glass of water and then another glass i
heard the tumbler clink back into its place
on the stand and there was a little wait
another thirty seconds and mr berford
probably felt that he could face them again
where

was i



without committing mayhem for he started
back toward his place at the table

   the screens in our offices are so arranged
 that it is practically impossible to get out
 from behind one of them without knocking
 it flat to the floor this one was set at
 just the regulation angle and the presi-
 dent hit it with his shoulder and it began
 to tilt and he snarled quite viciously at
 the screen and yanked it back with a good
 deal more force than seemed necessary he
 gave it such a violent yank in fact that
 he himself bumped squarely into the wall
 close by

   he snarled again as his other shoulder
hit something two or three seconds i
watched him pawing at the mirror which
 had been dislodged and trying to catch it
and then the thing escaped his fingers al-
together and went down on the floor with a
crash that sounded as if half the plate glass
in the building had caved ini down at
mr berfords feet there were at a rough
guess about five hundred little pieces of
broken mirror

   some of my ancestors must have been ig-
norant and superstitious people its all
nonsense of course but to save my soul i
cant see a thing like that happen without
having a little cold chill even if it is only
for an instant mr berford had some other
kind of ancestors i imagine he just looked
at the wreckage and growled and kicked
most of it back behind the screen there-
after resuming his trip toward the table
within a yard of it he stopped short and
stared blank astonishment

   upon my word of honor to the very last
one of them those five old gentlemen all
nearing seventy all substantial hard-head-
ed business men were sitting there with
their mouths open and their eyes fairly
popping

    thats-unfortunate thats very un-
fortunate macpherson breathed

   jones tittered more than anything else
like a scared little boy

    seven years bad luck he said

    seven what mr berford rasped

    thats what they say thomas

   absurd-yes mr moreland put in
 but my younger brother many years ago
broke his mirror and-

   and had seven years bad luck ber-
ford laughed

   he wasnt spared to suffer them tom
he met a woman that very night who drove
him to drink within the year and to the
grave within another moreland said and
shook his head

  something about this and the sigh that
went with it helped restore cravens bal-
ance at least he pulled down the corner of
his mouth sneered undisguisedly at mr
moreland and seemed to feel better mr
berfords teeth came together with an angry
click and he was about to speak when ben-
nett interrupted with

   ridiculous of course yes yes were
bound to admit its ridiculous but i do call
to mind one little incident in this connec-
tion which made a lasting impression on me
it must have been about -yes it was
in the early spring of  just after the
big blizzard that a cousin of mine-a young
chap you understand without a grain of
superstition in his whole makeup chanced
to-er-were you waiting to say something
thomas

   if you dont object

   not a particle go on

   then may i ask of you gentlemen in so
many words the president rapped out  if
there is really one among you who seriously
believes that bad luck follows the breaking
of a mirror

  they stirred uneasily but nobody spoke
until

   well theres a lot of things in this life
thomas that we may not believe in the
ordinary sense of the word macpherson
began heavily and unsmilingly  and at
the same time the evidence may be so over-
whelming that there is something that--
that-well perhaps theres not after all
perhaps theres not

   most emphatically there is not mr
berford snapped contemptuously  and
there is no such thing as  bad luck  or
 good luck  or any other kind of  luck 
what comes to a man in the way of  bad
luck  he brings upon himself absolutely
without any exception whatsoever

   always tom macpherson sighed
dubiously

   invariably barked the president and


argosy-allstory weekly

he made a pretty convincing figure as he
stood there too and it was funny to watch
the sheepish grin that went around that
table and the way they avoided looking
directly at him he had shamed them
hed done just that

  mr bennett coughed

   toms right of course hes always
right said he  good lucks what a man
works like the devil to get and finally does
get-and bad lucks the fitting reward for
the scamp quite right-quite right

   and even so bennett macpherson in-
sisted  it does happen-

   no it doesnt mr macpherson the
president laughed as he sat down  a
mans bad luck is the punishment hes
earned for bad acts a man whos right-
clean right all the way through-doesnt
have any bad luck now is there any fur-
ther business to be looked after before we
adjourn

  craven cackled out a sour little laugh

   only to pass a resolution of thanks to
you for being the sanest man present i
guess thomas he said

  and it was just exactly at that moment
that it began to happen

  i always sat beside mr berford at meet-
ings taking down whatever had to be taken
down trotting out now and then for docu-
ments and all that sort of thing and my
chair faced the door of the directors room
well the excitement having all subsided
and there being nothing of a stenographic
nature to record i was just sitting and look-
ing at the door-when it opened about four
inches and jimmys face appeared

  that kid never had any idea of the sol-
emnity or importance of any occasion he
would have walked straight in if i hadnt
caught his eye at just the right second as
it was he stopped and beckoned to me
and i shook my head  no  and jimmy
shook his head  yes  and beckoned again
i waved a hand trying to tell him to close
the door he merely stood there and went
on beckoning so that finally i laid my book
and pencil on the table and went over on
tiptoe-and pushed him out and followed
him and closed the door behind me

   well whats the matter with you i
asked

  the blamed little clown put the tip of
his forefinger under his chin and curtsied

  oh morsey i hate t tell ya he
said

   what

   say lissen  said the boy  as a rule
this place aint what you could call inter-
esting but to-day things is different this
is our day for cuties morse first the
chicken in the gas-wagon-and now this
bimbo

   what bimbo

   oh morsey-wonderful shall i tell
you about her or would you like to give her
the up-and-down first and hear about her
afterward shes right out there in the hall
by your office door

   a woman

  a dream said james she wants
to see the main squeeze and she says her
business is personal what it must be to
be rich like berford morsey and have em
buzz you like this-huh what it must
be-

  well i left him just then and made for
the corridor-and she was there all right
enough

  she couldnt have been much over twenty
and she was pretty phew but she was
pretty too not like the storm girl you
understand that girl was just pure class
but she was a mighty attractive young per-
son all the same she had huge blue eyes
rather darker than they are usually she
had a funny straight little nose that looked
as if shed be likely to finish anything she
started and she had a chin with a big dim-
ple in the middle when it came to clothes
she was not so striking that is she was
very nicely dressed but-oh sort of plain
and severe i suppose youd call it there
was a fur thing around her neck and there
were little shiny buckles on her pumps the
whole effect of her at first was quiet respect-
ability but when you looked hard at her
-and it was part of my job to look hard at
people and save time by guessing what they
wanted before they explained there was
something about this girl not quite as soft
and refined as it might have been i dont
know what it was maybe it wasnt there at
all

  meanwhile she was looking me over just
where was i



about as carefully and she smiled suddenly
and showed some magnificent teeth as she
said

   is mr berford coming

   well no im afraid hes not i said
 mr berford is in conference and cant
be disturbed have you an appointment
with him

   an appointment the girl repeated
and opened those magnificent eyes  why
no of course not

   then if youll give me your name and
address and the nature of your business
miss ill take it up with mr berford and
let you know when-and if-he can see
you

  and i pulled out the pencil and the lit-
tle notebook with the regular flourish and
prepared to write-and all the girl did was
to stare at me as if she didnt understand
at all

   i wish to see mr berford now she
explained

   but as i said hes in conference
and-

   well that doesnt make a bit of differ-
ence she informed me  i wish to see
him now

  her nice little nose dilated she seemed
to be growing quite fretful i produced the
reliable old smile which usually eases them
out of the office like so much grease it
didnt work with her she stamped her
foot

   in fact i insistupon seeing him now
she added  go at once and say that i
insist 

  once in a while you know they stick
like that or they stick until mr berford
comes out with fire in his eye and they
dont stick very long afterward it dawned
on me suddenly that this girl was a grade a
sticker and that i might talk myself hoarse
without budging her

   if youll give me your name and your
business- i began

   i shall not give you my name 

   but-

   and i shall most certainly not tell you
the nature of my business now tell mr
berford that i wish to see him

  i left her there i found the president
with the directors all back in the state of

pure admiration telling him that not one
of them believed broken mirrors had any
real consequences and sort of thanking him
for dispelling any little shakiness they may
have had on the subject for a minute or
two he glanced up at me with a dry smile
and i told him about the girl

   name he said

   she wouldnt give it

   what does she want

   she wouldnt tell me that either

   cant see her said the president and
turned back to the table

   well excuse me mr berford i said
 but this young lady looks determined and
i dont think shes selling anything i
think she has some personal matter that she
wants to talk about and she-er-she in-
sists on seeing you

   youre a pretty good judge of people
henry smiled mr berford  find out
what shes after if you can if it seems
necessary make an appointment for three
oclock to-morrow that hours open

   you see the railroad people at three
fifteen i reminded him

  the boss grinned the overwhelming
good humor was back upon him

   i can get rid of any woman in the world
in five minutes henry he said  make
it for three

  so i went back to the girl and she
glanced behind me to see if the president
was following and when he wasnt her nos-
trils dilated again

 where will he see me she demanded
 in his office i said just as smoothly
as possible  tomorrow afternoon at three
oclock and please be on time because at
three fifteen-

   to-morrow she echoed very sharply
 but i dont want to see him to-morrow

i want to see him to-day-

   but if you will call to-morrow-
she drew back her pretty head and
looked me in the eye

   i am calling now she said  go
back to mr berford and tell him that
 but-

  that is as far as i was permitted to go
her blue eyes were snapping now and if a
girl as pretty as all that can look danger-
ous that is what she was doing


argosy-allstory weekly

   and it might be just as well for you
to add she broke in  that unless he finds
it convenient to grant me an interview i
shall make a scene here

chapter iii

out of the past

 couldnt believe my ears

 a what i said

 a scene 

   what sort of a scene

  there was an awful sweetness in the
smile she gave me then

   if you will just bring back another re-
fusal from mr berford she said  you
will know now go 

  so i went it may seem queer that i
didnt stay there and argue the matter out
with her-smooth her down diplomatically
of course as ive done first and last with at
least a dozen cranks and maniacs of differ-
ent kinds but there was something about
the assured air of that girl she looked as
if she had authority to talk and act like
that

  mr berford glanced up casually when i
reached his side

   you look quite flustered henry he
observed  did you have to arrange the
appointment

   i did not sir i said  you see
this young woman--

  thats all i ever had to explain about
that young woman the rest she explained
herself in a word even then she was
with us

  i dont know how she got there it is
quite a puzzle for strangers to find the
directors room alone because one has to
go up and down several corridors perhaps
she had been quietly tagging along behind
me at all events she had pushed open the
door and was two yards inside it before any
of us noticed her

  mr bennett looked startled and began to
puff his way out of his chair--and ob-
served that none of the rest of them were
doing it and sank back again the presi-
dent shot one annoyed uninterested glance
toward her and spoke very softly to me

   this the young lady henry

  yes sir

   charity worker after a subscription i
can tell em a mile away said mr berford
 get her out of here

  i never moved somehow i couldnt
move for watching that curious approach
of hers and i doubt very much if mr ber-
ford ever noted the disobedience just
then you see his interest in the girl was
beginning to quicken because she was
heading straight for him and she was wink-
ing quite rapidly almost as if she meant to
cry and more than this her lips were
quivering so pathetically that i started and
stared a little harder at her-and now im
blest if she didnt stretch out her hands ap-
pealingly toward the boss and cry softly

   tom

   huh said the president

   oh tom the girl breathed

  for fifteen seconds at least nobody
moved a muscle-except the muscles that
control the eyes as one man the directors
looked at the girl and then looked at mr
berford and mr berford frowned won-
deringly and with the saddest little
gesture just as if her heart had broken
the girl dropped her hands

   arent you even going to-to say
 hello  to me tom she asked so faintly
that we could no more than catch the
words

  i	dont quite know what would have hap-
pened to an ordinary man if i had been
in his shoes i know id have felt guilty and
panic-stricken and all that sort of thing
but thomas berford is a hard man to jar
so the first shock having passed almost
immediately he merely rose and smiled pa-
tiently

   i should be most pleased to say  hello
if i happened to know you miss he said
quietly  but that pleasure is not mine
and-

   tom the girl cried

  hah said isaac craven

   and the pleasure having been denied
me the president went on more sharply
 may i point out that this is a directors
meeting young woman and-

  but-but youre tom berford the
visitor gasped blankly

   that is my name the boss said and
where

was i 



his voice rose  but i assure you you
have confused me with some other ber-
ford

   but i-i havent the girl stam-
mered  there isnt any other-i mean
you are tom berford and-and who should
know you know better than  know you
and having fired this one she turned and
gazed at the five old gentlemen and hon-
estly it was astounding that expression of
hers she looked utterly dazed and strick-
en and alone like somebody who has just
landed in a strange country and found that
the friends she expected to meet her are
all dead if you get what i mean she
looked so forsaken so pretty that before
her eyes had rested on mr bennett for two
seconds he was muttering

   well-well upon my word why my
poor child i-that is to say-

   please dont say anything mr ben-
nett the president said very crisply  the
young lady has made an astonishing mis-
take of course i was unaware that i
owned a double either in name or appear-
ance but such is apparently the case its
most unusual of course but-

  everybody in our little berford corpora-
tion world had a habit of hanging on mr
berfords words and listening most atten-
tively to all he had to say this girl did not
belong to our world it seemed to be against
her principles to let mr berford finish even
one sentence as in this case abruptly
she switched her attention from the direc-
torate and turned it upon the president
her big eyes opened in astonishment she
took a step nearer mr berford and searched
his face-which by the way was getting a
little redder

   tom youre not telling them that you
-you dont even know me she choked
 you-oh you couldnt do that

   i am telling not only them i am telling
you that-as you yourself know perfectly
well-i never laid eyes upon you before
madam the president cried

   but-but-

   and whatever all this may be whether
it is an astounding error on your part or-
or whatever else we have had more than
enough of it mr berford concluded  i
ask you to retire

  did she retire from the scene yes she
retired just about as much as the directors
table or the west wall of the room retired
she stood absolutely motionless for a little
space looking and looking at mr berford
whose temper was decidedly up-just look-
ing and not giving one small hang for his
temper what that little things eyes were
saying i actually hated to think but they
were saying it and the directorate not to
mention mr berford himself were lis-
tening

   tom she whispered  you-youre
not ashamed of me are you

  and then she wept aye she began to
sniff and her pretty lips began to tremble
and she pulled out a little joke of a hand-
kerchief and tried to hide behind it her
shoulders shaking and to say the least
the response was prompt mr berford
stood like a statue staring at her incredu-
lously and quite pale now but the old gen-
tlemen all left their chairs at once isaac
craven jammed his hands down in his
trousers pockets and looked steadily at our
president the other four hurried to the
girl

  mr bennett dragged a chair from the
table jones and moreland helped in forc-
ing her into it gently macpherson patted
her shoulder and sighed heavily

   well well lass dont you cry now
these things happen and-

   what things happen mr berford
roared savagely  i assure you mr mac-
pherson that nothing of any description
whatever has happened to warrant-

  	maybe not tom macpherson said
quietly  but this is no time to let your
anger run away with you youre distress-
ing her 

  he went on patting her shoulder mr
bennett patted her other shoulder jones
started off to get her a glass of water mr
moreland picked up a newspaper and
fanned her-i dont know why and im sure
he didnt know either they were all talk-
ing at once too and crooning over her as
they might have crooned over a child
queer how much attention a pretty girl can
get with a few tears isnt it

  now my dear my dear mr ben-
nett was saying  the mistake is yours


argosy-allstory weekly

i assure you-a most remarkable mistake
-but dont cry about it child

  most-remarkable craven said dis-
tinctly

   what snapped the president

   it might be well to open that book of
your life again thomas and let us read
another page or two eh

  mr berford walked straight to him

   you are implying that i seek to hide
something of a disgraceful nature in con-
nection with this girl

   i am implying nothing at all thomas
craven said just as steadily and im bound
to say just as dangerously  we have all
heard what the girl said she knows you
and-

   she does not

   berford dont be ridiculous were not
fools

  the president threw out his hands sud-
denly

   gentlemen he cried passionately  i
ask your attention for just one minute i
want to assure you upon my solemn word
of honor that i never saw this young
woman before she entered this room

   well we know that tom bennett
said soothingly  you neednt protest like
that the young lady has made a very odd
blunder of course and thats all and-now
now my child aha wes not going to
cry any more eh thats better yes
indeed thats better

  she looked up at him trustfully and the
good old soul beamed down at her

   you-believe in justice dont you
she whispered

   i should say so

   even for a girl who is all alone and
friendless

  mr bennett blinked at her

 ah-certainly for everyone lie
said

  and the girl kept on looking at him and
her little hand fluttered into his

   i can trust you she said

  most decidedly you can said mr
bennett and pulled up another chair to her
side and sat down with considerable de-
termination  now my dear lets get
right down to the bottom of this affair and
clear it up

  theres a good idea craven rasped

   i think so said mr bennett and
 glared at him  my child well begin at
 the very beginning what is your name

  the girl looked at him and turned and
 shot the strangest glance at our president
 and then dropped her eyes

   ask tom she said

   eh well-well-all right then
tom-er-do you happen to know her
name

   how in-ah-how should i know it
 mr berford said fiercely

  thats no answer craven submitted

   isnt it heres an answer then no
 i do not know her name

  tom cried the girl

  mr craven gave an evil little smile and
 shook his head

   she knows yours pretty well though
 doesnt she

   so do ten thousand other people mr
 craven

   true berford but none of the other
 nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-
 nine are here inquiring whether youre
 ashamed of them get on with the ex-
 amination bennett

   im trying to do that well-ah-let
 me see youre-ah-quite sure that this
 mr berford is the mr berford you have in
 mind

  the girl fairly whirled on him

  her eyes were big and round and out-
 raged her bosom heaved taken all in all
 she was so startling at that moment that
 mr bennett sat up and puffed

   sure she cried  sure do you
 suppose that any normal woman ever for-
 gets-

  she stopped there you could have
heard the smallest pin in the world drop just
then the first sound was her little gulp
as she covered her eyes again

  craven was leaning right across the table

   yes he said  yes forgets
what

  the girl only sobbed

   yes my dear mr bennett said en-
 couragingly  what is it that-er-a nor-
 mal woman never forgets

   you-ask tom said the girl

   well-ah-
where was i



   dont ask me the president snapped
 im not a woman normal or otherwise
i have no idea what they never forget and
i dont give a-er-hang

  mr bennett frowned in some distress
he is all just simple conventional goodness
the sort that does the same thing at the
same time every day for a hundred years
if it happens to live as long as that and this
matter was getting beyond him probably
in all his life he had never encountered
anything quite so odd

   this is-is very confusing all of it he
muttered  wont you please speak up
young woman i mean to say wont you
be quite frank

   what am i concealing the girl de-
manded indignantly

   thats just what were trying to find
out and-no no not concealing my child
bennett said hastily  but there is-er-
something here of which you seem reluctant
to speak and-

   why shouldnt i be reluctant when
tom denies even knowing me

   er-just so of course lets put it in
another way do we understand that you
are making-making certain definite
charges against mr berford

  the girl seemed puzzled and shook her
head sadly

   charges no-not charges  she mur-
mured

  but youre accusing him of some-
thing

   i-yes

  well all right then mr bennett
said desperately  what is it

  a long shuddering sigh came from the
girl her eyes flashed at mr berford for
an instant and then dropped again

   ask tom she whispered

  mr bennett got out his handkerchief and
dabbed his forehead although it was not
particularly warm in there craven
snorted and stepped around to their side

   youre not moving very far or very
fast bennett he said sharply  let me
take charge of this please

   well but-

  the vinegar member of our board waved
him aside and transfixed the girl with his
hard old eye

   my dear lady he began  the display
of a little candor on your part will be to
your interest pray be so good as to answer
me directly and fully you know mr ber-
ford

  know him the girl echoed bitterly
 where and when did you first meet
him

   the girl glanced up

    ask tom  she said

   im asking you will you tell me

   let tom tell you

  moreland snickered mr cravens eyes
grew a little harder

   in one way i understand i think he
said  young woman i tender you the
sacred pledge of every member of this board
that whatever you may feel justified in tell-
ing us will never be repeated also i beg
to point out that you have involved the
president of this company in a mysterious
way which needs explanation not for your
sake alone or for his but for the sake of a
large corporation which has ever prided
itself upon the spotless integrity of its of-
ficers in common fairness to all con-
cerned we must have the truth-and the
whole truth down to the very last detail
he waited a moment for this to sink in
now he said just what relation
existed-still exists perhaps-between you
and mr berford

   the girl only gave another of these shud-
dering sighs and failed to face him

   ask tom  she murmured

  isaac craven gritted his teeth and then
bared them threateningly

  you are serving yourself very poorly
by taking this attitude he said  it seems
clear that mr berford is bent upon pro-
fessing ignorance of your-er-very charm-
ing self that being so if you wish justice
-which in fact i promise you to the very
fullest degree-

  i	have said that mr berford was a hard
man to jar for any length of time this
little affair had shaken him more than any-
thing i had ever seen happen to him be-
fore and very likely the reason for that was
that it had come at a time when he was

                                                             

utterly happy and contented with things in
general but he was himself again now
he looked as calm and strong as ever and


argosy-allstory weekly

there was contempt on his lips as he stepped
to isaac craven and tapped his arm

   pardon me mr craven he said
sharply  but im not on trial here and you
are not the prosecutor whatever all this
poppycock may be it concerns me and
since this girl is to be examined ill examine
her

  he could be convincing when he wanted
to be mr craven stared an instant and
pulled down the corners of his mouth and
then backed away a pace or two and the
president looked down at the girl and
grinned

  come he said briskly theres
something behind it whats the answer
young woman

  and the girl looked up at him and said
not one solitary word with her lips and yet
as she had done before she said so much
with her eyes that even mr bennett began
to fuss and frown uneasily

  talk please mr berford barked
 theres a limit to patience you know

   yes i-know there is tom the girl
said with some difficulty  there was a
lim-limit to mine thats why i-came
here

   well what dye mean by that
roared the president id never seen him
lose his poise so easily as he did that after-
noon

   stop bullyragging her craven shout-
ed stop that

  im not bullyragging her what do
you mean speak quite frankly please
i have nothing to conceal well

  the girl twisted her handkerchief it
seemed that she was getting ready to cry
again

   well i mean that-that if you dont
want to tell them-i mean that-that i
dont want to it-isnt my place tom
you should tell them

   umum umum said mr craven

   i havent the most remote idea of what
youre talking about the president
snapped  i have nothing to tell them
about you or about anything else if you
have by all means tell them

  and the bosom began to heave again

   you-said youd never even seen me
before the girl cried

   its the plain truth i never did 

  then she looked up suddenly she
looked squarely at him-and thundera-
tion how pretty she was she looked at
him through him into him her lips
parted her eyes grew bigger and somehow
terrified

   tom she breathed and they all bent
forward to catch her words  tom you
havent actually forgotten the ninth of
january in nineteen twenty

chapter iv

january  io

of course i know him so well and that
may have had something to do with
it but even if i hadnt known him
i think that blank perplexed expression of
mr berfords would have been nearly all
the proof  needed of his innocence it
wasnt for craven though that old fiends
eyes lit up quite delightedly and he nodded
quickly

  hah he said heres something
concrete at last what happened on janu-
ary ninth nineteen-twenty my dear

  the eyes turned on him sorrowfully

   ask tom said the girl

   i venture to say well do just that-
and insist on an answer mr craven said
heartily berford

   what

   what happened

  the boss was breathing hard as he faced
craven

   what dye mean he demanded

   where were you-and this girl-on
that date

   i was nowhere at all with this girl be-
 cause i never saw her before to-day as
 to where i may have been myself i cant
 say

   thats odd

 is it what were you doing on janu-
ary ninth four years ago mr craven

  craven held up one of his lean claws and
smiled

   dont dodge the issue like that ber-
ford 

   im dodging nothing i dont know
where i was on any given date four years

                         	a
where was i 



ago you dont-mr bennett doesnt-
mr moreland doesnt

   that isnt just the point berford a
man might well enough have to think for a
minute or two before he could give an ac-
count of himself on any particular date
years gone true we concede that
but shouted mr craven and leaned so
far across the table that i thought he was
going to bite the president  certain dates
in ones life are graven deep into ones
mind never to be erased it is my im-
pression that your january ninth is such
a date    well

   bosh yelled mr berford

  mu craven smiled wickedly and wagged
his head

   so we are to look solely to the young
woman for information eh

   pray do so

   i shall smiled isaac craven and ap-
proached her again u my dear be so good
as to give us the whole story of that day
and here was a new one because as she
looked up at him this time im blest if it
didnt seem that she was turning sulky and
stubborn at all events she tightened her
lips and shook her head

   let tom tell you

   there seems to be some slight re-
luctance on his part so you will tell us
please come just what did happen on
that date

  the mystery merely shook her pretty
head

   no  she said

   but we insist upon knowing

   no said the girl  ask tom and
she seemed really pettish about it too
 he is the one to tell you not i

  isaac craven folded his arms and looked
the president up and down

   well berford

   oh rot snapped the president and
banged down into his chair again  some-
bodys crazy here-more than one person
perhaps but im not among the number
settle this idiocy in whatever way best
pleases yourself mr craven

  this was plain speech and i suppose it
was just the way the boss felt anyhow he
shrugged his shoulders and began packing
things back into the black brief case and

   	a

offhand one would have said that so far as
he was concerned the matter had been
closed forever

  the rest of them did not feel quite that
way about it though craven of course
is a freak of nature who would hang his
own twin on circumstantial evidence but
by this time macpherson and jones and
moreland were beginning to look a trifle
dubious and even mr bennett seemed
rather bewildered

  he spoke just as craven was picking
words for a new assault

   well a-a very extraordinary situation
seems to have arisen here gentlemen said
mr bennett  while i know-while we
all know tom-that you are incapable of
anything of-er-a discreditable nature
still at the same time-

   exactly said isaac craven-

  --there does seem to be something that
needs clearing up and well have to clear
it up of course his eyes were genuinely
troubled as they studied the president  it
might be just as well to tell us what you
were doing on that day tom

  berford laughed outright although not
merrily by any means

   it might indeed sir he agreed  ex-
cept that as i pointed out a moment ago
it happens to be impossible my memory
is fairly good but its not good enough to
go back and collect the minor happenings
of any one day years ago or-

   the minor happenings gasped the
girl

   pardon me snarled the president

   oh-tom she breathed and seemed
about to die on the spot

  she had very little effect on our presi-
dent however he shrugged and turned
back to mr bennett

   you at least are reasonable he smiled
 try the thing yourself what were you
doing on january ninth nineteen twenty
 well-to save my soul from perdition
i couldnt tell you that my boy said mr
bennett

   you mr jones

  	huh me jones stared and shook
his head  i was doing something or other
around towti here or somewhere else do-
ing something else


argosy-allstory weekly

   precisely so was i the president
said with a dry smile  how about you
mr craven what were you doing on that
day

   berford it isnt my january ninth
thats under consideration just now  its
yours

   quite so well then the very best
and the very last word i can give you on
the subject said the boss-and oh lord
how wrong he was about that  is that in
all probability i put in between eight and
ten hours in this office going at top speed
and that thereafter i took home a load of
work and sat over it in my library until
about two the next morning ive been do-
ing that four days out of six for some time
is that satisfactory or is it not

  nobody said a word for a little the
girl was gazing straight at him

   tell them where you were tom she
said unexpectedly

   aha said mr craven and bright-
ened instantly  were getting at it
slowly but were getting at it

  mr berford didnt brighten though
he turned suddenly on the young woman

   i have told them and i now tell you-
although heaven alone knows why i should
be compelled to do that-that i dont
know where i was that is to say i as-
sume that i went through my regular daily
routine but i couldnt go into court and
swear that i was here or there or at any
given place without checking up in what-
ever way if you happen to know tell
these gentlemen

  he waited they all waited the pretty
girl only closed her lips again and shook
her head looking straight at mr berford

   no tom she said quietly  thats
something you should do 

   well by the- the president began in
a sort of maddened roar and then he
caught himself and threw up his hands and
turned back to the table  i give it
up gentlemen he snapped  i think the
young woman is demented if you like
try to find who who she is and where she
comes from and ill cheerfully bet an even
thousand dollars to any mans ten that
nurses or distracted relatives are hunting
for her at this minute

  and he went on with his packing and all
five old gentlemen stared at the girl and
the girl herself after a horrified little cry
pressed her handkerchief to her lips and
rose

   i-i didnt come here to be told that i
was crazy tom she said shakily i
-thought that you were-were at least
man enough to--to-im going she con-
cluded and covered her lovely eyes

   well not just yet  isaac craven cried
hurriedly  here wait a minute young
woman

  no i didnt come here to be insulted
and shouted at

   well my dear young lady for what-
ever reason you may have come you did
come mr craven persisted and by this
time he was at her side  and you have
made charges against our highest official
which however vague they may be at
present i have no doubt are-that is to
say you have made vague charges you
cant run away from them

   i havent the slightest intention of run-
ning from them im not the one to do the
running the girl flashed at him

   and berford is eh you have the
most remarkable way of implying things
without saying them mr craven mut-
tered almost admiringly  well be that
as it may miss-er-what was the name
 ask tom

   be that as it may then pursued
isaac  you have created a situation which
must be probed to the last detail and he
turned and considered mr berford who
was humming to himself as he locked the
brief case  berford for the last time
will you explain

   mr craven the president said uncon-
cernedly and his grin was whimsical  for
the last time i cannot explain

craven nodded complete understanding
 would you perhaps after twenty-four
hours of ostensibly pious meditation find
yourself able to explain berford he
asked

   my dear sir said the president  if
you refer to the young woman herself i
might meditate from now until the week
after judgment day without being able to
offer one solitary item of information-be-
where was i 



cause for the hundredth time i never saw
her before to-day if you refer to my per-
sonal acts on that day-yes i will look up
the matter overnight and tell you precisely
where i was and what i did on january
ninth nineteen twenty satisfactory

   in a qualified way berford sighed
mr craven since the rest of them were
nodding quick assent to this  shall we
meet at four oclock to-morrow in this
room

  they agreed to that too mr craven
laid one of his claws on the young womans
arm

 and you will be here too he stated
 have no fear of that i shall be here
the girl said with another angry flash at
our president  may i go now i-i
cant stand any more of this

  craven stepped aside with a bow mr
berford bounced out of his chair

   wait a minute he cried energetically
 youre not going to pop in here and start
a riot whatever your reasons may have
been-and then escape i wish to see you
in my office miss

   oh no you dont no you dont
craven cried almost wildly and simply
ihrew himself on mr berford  if-if--
if youre to be exonerated it shall not be
because of private threats and coercion of
this girl and-stand still sir

  frankly if i had been the boss i think
i should have taken that old vulture by the
neck and sent him spinning into the corner
but mr berford isnt like that hes as
gentle and decent as they come and a child
or a woman or an old man can take any
sort of liberties without fear of a thrashing
so instead of giving craven what he de-
served he stood there with his teeth grit-
ting and watched the girl walk out as
swiftly and gracefully as you please and
disappear

  for a minute or so there was a funny lit-
tle lull while mr bennett got up and hur-
ried to the president

   now my dear boy dont look so con-
cerned he cried  dont take the thing
so-er-seriously 

   because macpherson sighed  to
give the devil his due you know we were
all of us young at some time or other and

-and shes a very very attractive lass
thomas i will say that

  i dont find her so mr berford
laughed bitterly and rather dazedly

   there evidently was a time when you
did mr craven submitted

   there- the boss began and then
shrugged his shoulders  oh whats the
use of letting you stir me up gentlemen
ive been accused of something or other i
take it just what it may be ive no idea
have any of you

  there was a silence so dead and heavy
that it startled mr berford i think jones
sighed and pursed his lips

   most likely not tom but its not im-
possible to do a bit of guessing

  the boss controlled himself

   thanks for the vote of confidence he
said tartly  shall we consider this meet-
ing adjourned until four oclock to-morrow
afternoon and may i say good afternoon
to you all come henry

  he started for the door and i started
after him and mr moreland who had
been drumming with his fingers this last
minute and looking as if his last stick of
candy had dropped down the well spoke up
suddenly

   hold on there a minute tom theres
one phase of this we havent taken into
account

   is that possible muttered the presi-
dent

   when this little-well whatever it may
prove to be-when this leaks out tom
hells going to begin popping for this com-
pany

   piffle said the president contemptu-
ously

   its nothing of the kind moreland
shouted savagely  youre blind of
course any man in love is blind likely
enough you have the delusion that old
george storms a maligned angel tom be-
cause hes his daughters father but we
knew him before you were born and once
one word of this mess gets to his ears hell
move heaven and earth to smash this firm
just out of pure vindictiveness

  several cheeks paled a little even mr
berford went somewhat whiter although
possibly not for quite the same reason


argosy-allstory weekly

moreland surely enough had offered a
pretty little thought for consideration
jones helped with some trimmings

  and he could do it he said do
you all realize that he could do it storm
must be worth seven or eight million dol-
lars outside the business and that kid of
his has always been more than the apple
of his eye ill venture to say that he
would throw every last penny of his pri-
vate fortune into paying off a grudge
against ony one he fancied had injured
her

  craven looked like a perfect demon

   see here he gasped  will that girl
go to him if-if she doesnt get whatever
satisfaction it is she requires from ber-
ford

  is she bright enough for that mac-
pherson breathed

  she is submitted mr bennett and
it was plain that for the moment the ex-
citement had conquered even his kindly
brain  she-shes a mighty bright young
woman she was bright enough to walk in
here and turn all hands upside down at
the most satisfactory moment in the history
of the concern

  true said macpherson true-
every word of that and whats more-

  mr berford is courteous always even if
it is in his own hard short way i couldnt
have imagined him interrupting a director
in that particular fashion yet it is the fact
that just then he brought his fist down on
the table with such an unearthly crash that
the whole quintet jumped

   gentlemen he shouted  im through
for the day i wish to say for the very
last time that i am innocent of any knowl-
edge of or crime against the young woman
who was here that is my complete and
final statement of my side of the case and
ends my connection with this-this damned
tommyrot until four oclock tomorrow
afternoon when i shall give a full account
of my doings on january th  and
then leave the rest of it in your hands
good afternoon come henry

  henry i am free to say would have
been just tickled to death to hang around
that room and hear some more of the cheery
thoughts the old gentlemen were going to

conjure up but he didnt no henry
trotted dutifully after his employer and
once we were in the presidents office he
slammed the brief case down on the desk
and glared at me

  im no mind reader of course but i
think he was inclined just then toward his
perfectly regular and usual trick of ignoring
the possibility that i might be a human
being and understand a thing or two beside
stenography would that he had done just
that then and later but the emotional
side of mr berford was in too hectic a
state for dignified silence

   henry youre only a-a kid but ill
have to talk to some one he said sud-
denly

  i bowed politely

   say did you ever hear of anything like
that in all your days mr berford roared
 i never did sir i said

   out of a clear sky-a perfectly clear
sky-and at just this time a woman ill
swear i never passed in the street or sat
opposite in the subway and-hell

  he sat down hard and bit his lips and
stared at the desk for a minute while i re-
mained in the background he glanced at
his watch and snorted and got up again

   well if it wasnt for the rotten side of
it the thing would be funny he observed
 however well make mighty short work
of it to-morrow henry-and after that
perhaps well see what the law can do to
that little devil you were not working for
me at that time henry

   i came about a year later

   true enough murfon had your job
and hes somewhere in south america now
i believe all right im going home now
henry

   yes sir i said

   and you go to work immediately-im
sorry to ask you to stay but its unavoid-
able this time-and run through the early
 correspondence of this office before
you leave find out just what i was doing
about the th of january and ill piece out
the details of course jot it all down and
come up to my house at quarter of eight
sharp henry and whatever letters you
find that have a particular bearing on that
date bring along with you and a note-
where was i



book henry i want to prepare a little
statement for those-er-for the directors
to-morrow

  he tucked the eternal brief case under
his arm although the effect was a trifle
forced he did look much like himself again

  quarter of eight-sharp be con-
cluded

  and he departed and as many years as
he had been in the firm i will venture to
say that he never departed in just that
frame of mind before

chapter v

the saner view

that thing of running through the
early  correspondence sounded
simple of course

  maybe it would have been simple if the
president wrote more letters and said more
in those he did write but he hates corre-
spondence and anything along that line
that can be done by a department head is
done by a department head another
thing mr berford is probably the most
cautious man in the world when it comes
to wording his letters i hammer them out
on the machine but while the fellows who
read them probably know what theyre
about four times out of every five i havent
much more than a strong suspicion

   and in spite of all that getting a line on
the presidents activities on january 
 didnt seem much of a job-until i
had been at it for half an hour so far as
i could judge mr berford had been more
than ordinarily uncommunicative during
the early part of that january that or he
had been away somewhere on a trip since
i have been with him he has had a very
nice system for keeping me busy during his
absences the afternoon before his de-
parture he has always spent dictating like
a streak of greased lightning arid by the
time he has returned i have cleaned up
everything in the way of postponed unim-
portant letters signed them with his auto-
graph rubber stamp and filed awray the
carbons

  but back here there were gaps and gaps
the one that interested me most began on

the th of january and im hanged if i
could find trace of any letter having been
written in the presidents office from that
date until the eleventh the worst feature
of this gap was that nothing seemed to have
gone before it and nothing followed it that
would give a clew now in the previous
november just before one of the empty
spots there was a letter in which he said
 i expect to be in chicago thursday and
friday of this week and in december of
the same year after five days of nothing at
all in the way of filed carbon copies there
was one that began since talking with
you in cleveland day before yesterday
and so on

  but if this particular gap indicated a
trip it had been a different kind of trip
because there was not a solitary word in
any letter of the fourth as to where he was
going and there wasnt a word in any letter
after the eleventh as to where he had been
and-oh well im human of course ill
admit that i put in a minute or two won-
dering whether this queer reticence did
mean anything but it was only a minute
 two i know mr berford and on some
counts im proud to work for him because
a citizen who speaks the unqualified truth
just one hundred times out of a possible
hundred is quite a man

  however wondering wasnt getting me
very far and id been staring into those
files for an hour or more and the clock had
worked beyond half past six i hated not
to make a job of it but there was no help
for that i went off to find some dinner
and then get uptown to mr berfords home
and tell him the worst

  he lives in a dandy old mansion a couple
of dozen steps from central park-one of
those wide white affairs they used to con-
struct when land was a little cheaper and
building mechanics didnt have to support
servants and automobiles themselves it
seems like a lot of house for one man to
occupy but the president is fond of it his
father built it and his parents both died
there and the place has a certain aristo-
cratic dignity that fits the boss very nicely

  i expected to find him considerably fret-
ted about what had happened that after-
noon he wasnt the old butler who must


argosy-allstory weekly

be nearly one hundred and has been with
the family since his boyhood showed me
into the library and pretty soon mr ber-
ford himself appeared looking like at least
one million dollars in his evening togs- and
so far from seeming worried he grinned in
the friendliest way and said

   well henry where was i

   i dont know sir

   didnt you stay and look the presi-
dent asked and stopped grinning

   i did and there wasnt a thing to be
found i said  there wasnt a letter
written in your office between the fourth
and eleventh of that january and-

   but of course there was he snapped
 i was in the city then i-er-that is i
cant recall being anywhere else about that
time although its a long while ago
youve overlooked something henry
thats possible sir i said but if i
did it wasnt in your private file i emptied
the whole of that january and part of the
december before on your desk before i
gave it up and then went over every let-
ter

  after which of course one of those
nasty curt chilly rebukes was due-and it
didnt come at all the president stared
good and hard at me for a moment and
then he grinned again and shrugged his
shoulders

   well if there was nothing there there
was nothing there henry-thats all cu-
rious of course but its not important
sooner or later ill remember or discover
just what i was doing on that day and
when i do ill call the directorate together
and break the news meanwhile theres
nothing to worry about

  well-to-morrow sir- i began

  the president unbent still further he
settled down on the arm of a big chair and
removed his cigar looking whimsically at
me

   drat to-morrow  he said cheerfully
 ive recovered from the shock of finding
my impeccable character assailed for the
first time henry and taken to thinking
almost beyond question that woman was
somebodys asinine idea of a joke

   id thought of that

   had you really henry the president

said with a dry smile  well the next
time inspiration of that character comes to
you in a similar crisis dont hesitate to
mention it-because i was so utterly thun-
derstruck that for a little while i wasnt
able to think of much of anything but
thats what it was and weve seen the end
of it

   the end

   of course that pleasing young wom-
an will never return

    why not sir

   well as nearly as i can follow the
probable working of the sort of brain that
must have been behind that performance
its chief virtue lay in its surprise quality
you cant very well repeat the same sur-
prise also should she turn up again shed
be virtually certain to run into a real third
degree and possibly enough some un-
pleasant consequences she wont turn up
 i hope not sir i said

  oh she wont henry snapped the
president and it was plain that he was grow-
ing a trifle impatient with me for not agree-
ing instantly in the optimistic view  shell
never- yes evans

   its mrs storm and miss alicia mr
tom said the butler and showed all three
of his teeth in a smile  come to take you
to the theater sir i believe and sending
word in from the car that-

  the president left that chair like a ten-
year-old kid he was out of the room be-
fore the butler had finished

   right evans good night henry-
and thanks he called

  there was an end of him for that night
the butler came back with my hat and
coat in about five minutes and i went home
feeling almost foolish-i dont know why
maybe it was because id been worrying
like sin about not having been able to get
the boss all vindicated with carbon copies
whereas in point of fact the whole affair
seemed to have slipped from his own shoul-
ders like a drop of water from a ducks
back however if he wasnt concerning
himself about the strange lady there was
no reason why i should i had all but for-
gotten her myself by bedtime

  and he was quite as cheerful when he
appeared at the office next morning he
where

was i



wore the same rapt expression that had
come over his face when the butler an-
nounced that miss alicia was waiting for
him he hummed little tunes he was just
floating around on a pretty pink cloud

  icoh-id nearly forgotten he said
when he had been down for half an hour
or more  no word from the lady of yes-
terday i take it

   no sir

   wont be grunted the president and
reached over for the three letters at his left
 letter to james r gribton henry
ready

  there is something very convincing about
mr berford in whatever he says or does
by two oclock for no particular reason ex-
cept that she hadnt telephoned or material-
ized i began to feel quite sure myself that
the fool girl would never show her face
again up to that time i had been more
than dubious about it but those little
hummed tunes and that new grin of his
did their work on me too when four
oclock came and the directors sent in word
that they were assembled and ready to
pass sentence i marched in with mr ber-
ford with much the same jaunty step

  there was nothing jaunty about the di-
rectorate no sign of a smile appeared on
one of those five faces although mr ben-
nett did make a sickly effort at one they
just nodded and grunted their several greet-
ings as the president took his place and
then all hands sighed to have made the
picture perfect there should have been a
body on the table

   shall we-er-open the meeting for-
mally mr berford said with a smile

  craven looked at his watch

   hey no berford not necessary yet
its only eight minutes past four girls
late women always are of course no
well do nothing until she gets here

  the president shrugged and grinned

   im afraid that were destined to do
very little at this meeting then

   what does that mean

  mr berford looked at him tolerantly

   well mr craven ill confess that as
yet i havent guessed the complete answer
to yesterdays nonsense eventually you
may be sure that i mean to find it and to

take proper action but i am convinced
that somewhere among my friends or ac-
quaintances there is one congenital idiot who
sent that girl here as a joke she will not
be with us again to-day

  craven sat up and stared

   oho she wont hey

  she will not said the boss so con-
vincingly that mr bennett relaxed
craven smiled wickedly

   so after all you managed to find her
and to fix her he exclaimed

   i did what thundered the president
and glared at him so suddenly so terribly
that craven pushed back his chair and laid
his hands on the arms all ready for flight
 no sir i did not and by the al-
mighty-

  there tom there mr bennett put
in hurriedly  we-the rest of us-know
perfectly well that you did nothing of the
sort and as for you craven be suspi-
cious if you must you cant help it i
suppose but for heavens sake dont make
yourself ridiculous

  the soured director nodded rather dizzily
 you-i fear that you misconstrued the
thought behind the question he said  it
impressed me that after all this had been
the wisest thing to do in the circumstances
that is to say if the girl had been-or has
been-satisfactorily silenced berford you
need have no slightest hesitation so far as
i am concerned in speaking frankly of the
matter yesterday i was inclined to see
the affair straight through on its-all-de-
merits to-day i should be vastly pleased
berford at any positive assurance you may
be able to give that the woman is per-
manently out of the way 

  once more the president was calm
enough to grin as he lit his cigar

   i would go far to please you mr
craven he said  but as it happens the
idea of squaring her for something id never
done did not occur to me and hadit i
should have found myself without a sus-
picion of where the lady was to be located
his tone grew more brisk as he turned to
the others  how long are we to wrait

   oh until quarter past jones said  if
shes not here by that time shes not
coming


argosy-allstory weekly

   no make it half past four craven
suggested quickly  any woman might
easily be delayed fifteen minutes

   and if she has not appeared by that
time we are to assume that the pleasure
of her presence is to be denied us

   huh i presume so craven grunted
 im quite as willing to make it five
oclock or half past five the president
said

   four thirtyll do said craven

  he sat back with his watch in his hand
perhaps the rest of them would have liked
to do the same thing but with craven
the horrible example of a director keeping
tabs on the time they refrained instead
bennett started a nice little conversation
about some of the finer points of mr ber-
fords annual report to the directors and the
others joined in readily the boss himself
smoked and grinned contentedly

  and the minutes jogged along and there
was nothing to be seen by the eye i kept on
the door after what seemed a long long
while moreland yawned and said

   must be more than half past now isnt
it craven

   it is twenty-eight minutes after

   two more eh what were you saying
mac

  macpherson went on with what he had
been saying and it took time mr craven
presently clicked together the case of his
old-fashioned watch and with a sigh
dropped it into his pocket and mr ben-
nett cried

   half past

   it is twenty-five minutes to five

 hey five minutes past the limit is
it said the genial director and treated
us to that big laugh of his  well by
george i think youre vindicated tom
 thanks the president said briefly

   in all our minds

  yes said four old gentlemen to-
gether

   in your mind craven hey speak
up snapped bennett

  eh hum-i suppose so

  farther than that apparently he did not
care to go mr bennett turned away quite
disgustedly and looked fondly at our presi-
dent

   now thomas i think this absufd mat-
ter is closed

   and the meeting adjourned

   yes 

  the president leaned forward unsmil-
ingly

   well before this gathering breaks up
may i be permitted a word or two of a
purely personal nature

   a thousand of them 

  all right gentlemen the boss said
slowly  i have been with this firm al-
most since boyhood it pleased you some
years back to make me its president in
all the time that i have been connected
with the company you have had every
ounce of everything that was in me i
have had hardly another thought hardly
another reason for existence than service
to this company im not trying to pose
as the perfect man-far from that but
i do feel compelled to say that never in all
my life in this office or out of it have i
consciously lied or consciously done a wrong
thing or-

  why we know that well enough
macpherson cried

   yes but you didnt know l yesterday
and you didnt know it until half past four
to-day said mr berford and quiet as
he was trying to be his words dripped bit-
terness  yesterday through the agency
of some fool a woman came in here and ac-
cused me of-i dont know what and you
dont know what and within five minutes
of that time suspicion of myself was ex-
tremely evident

   well you see tom mr jones began
 human natures what it is and not what it
ought to be and when that girl popped in
so unexpectedly-

   you immediately concluded that i was
the man who had ruined her life or some-
thing of the kind thats just what im
talking about gentlemen if suspicion of
my personal or my business character is
really so near the surface as appears it
seems to me that the time has come to
tender my resignation

  three seconds they stared at him then
they began to boil they surged out of
their chairs even to craven and came
around to mr berford all talking and pro-
where was i



testing at once all trying to pat him or
wave their hands before him they babbled
for one full noisy minute before bennetts
big voice rose above the tumult

   oh my dear boy my dear boy thats
preposterous natural-dont blame you a
bit-but preposterous cant be contem-
plated for an instant the firm couldnt
run without you shows what a lot of old
imbeciles can do to a wonderful man and-
see here gentlemen

  they subsided and looked at him

   we owe tom about as abject an apo-
logy as it is possible to make thats my
sense of the matter is it yours

  it seemed to be

   and it shall be made it is made right
here and now tom in the name of this
board i beg your pardon

   well perhaps its not necessary to-
the president began with a faint smile

   yes it is yes it is and well put
the thing into lasting form tom well
put it into such shape that youll be able
to poke it under our noses if ever we try
the same trick on you again well adopt
a set of resolutions and have them properly
engrossed and presented to you tom
upon my word thats precisely what well
do said the repentant director and the
others nodded  well put them in shape
at once henry

   yes sir i said

   i wish to dictate them to you take them
down very carefully and give me a type-
written copy just as soon as possible now
let me see now-let me think a moment 
he scowled heavily and thought and i
sat there and waited and also did some
thinking

  because really it was a queer thing to
watch the way a man not thirty-five could
dominate those old gentlemen he always

seemed to do it when he wanted to he was
doing it now and he had them licked even
craven had given up glancing at the door
and seemed about as conscience-stricken as
the rest of them maybe it was the mem-
ory of our presidents father who must have
been an even more wonderful man what-
ever it was that threat of resigning on the
spot had given them all a shock

  here i have it i think mr ben-
nett said suddenly  if any of you have
any suggestions to make hold me up and
make them ready henry well say
something like this whereas by reason of
a most unfortunate and baseless charge
made by an unknown woman against-

   make that  person  instead of c wom-
an  macpherson suggested cautiously
 that might be found lying around fifty
years after tom was dead and start any
sort of scandal in his family

   eh yes thats true i suppose thats
a good idea where was i oh yes-
made by an unknown person henry make
that person unknown person this board
has seemed to censure its beloved-

  the reason he stopped there i presume
was that he saw that i was no longer listen-
ing it was the truth-i wasnt beautiful
as those resolutions promised to be they
just drifted away before what was happen-
ing over by the door

  the knob had turned with an abrupt
jerk and the confounded door was opening
and it stopped and for two or three sec-
onds i sighted what looked like jimmy the
office boy having a wrestling match with
somebody then suddenly jimmy got the
worst of it and disappeared and the portal
swung wide open and in she came the same
pretty girl in the same quiet clothes

  she was nearly an hour late of course
-but she was there

chapter i

treasure trove

eight thirty oclock of a winter
morning is disagreeable anywhere
but it was particularly unpleasant on
the front end of a jersey city ferryboat
jammed with shivering jerseyites bound for
work in the skyscrapers of lower manhat-
tan

  harry hilwin stood next to the rail his
collar turned up and his hands thrust deep
in his pockets when the man beside him
jostled him slightly he did not look pleased
but the offender apologized and hilwin a
good natured young man grinned cheer-
fully back

   water looks cold doesnt it remarked
the stranger a lean angular man of about
sixty who tossed a cigarette into the hud-
son as he spoke

the river was filled with floating ice

it was gray and white in the dull morning
light

   not a good day for a swim replied
hilwin perfunctorily

   there is no accounting for taste an-
swered the other with a queer smile  you
look like a good sort i make you a present
of my bag

  as he spoke he swung one leg over the
railing followed it with the other and be-
fore the astonished hilwin could reach him
he dived into the river

  almost petrified with horror hilwin
shrieked  man overboard

  a dozen others repeated the cry there
was a clanging of bells blowing of whistles
somebody tossed a lifebuoy over deck
hands rushed to lower a boat the paddle
wheels stopped women screamed

  hilwin had followed the flight of the
body with his eye he had seen it hit a
cake of ice and slide off into the gray


nothing but money



water it did not reappear the boat
when lowered found no trace of the suicide

  the passengers talked excitedly it was
quite a thrill for the ordinary suburbanite
on his way to work the captain of the
ferryboat accompanied by a policeman who
happened to be crossing approached hil-
win

   the man who jumped over was talking
to you wasnt he

   yes

   did you know him

   no just happened to be standing
alongside of me

    did he say anything about what he was
going to do

  no i said the water was pretty cold
for a swim and he laughed and said there
was no accounting for tastes then he
jumped he did it so quickly i didnt have
a chance to stop him

   thats that said the policeman shut-
ting his notebook  takes all kinds of
people to make a world

  after they had gone hilwin remembered
the suicide had presented him with his bag
he looked around for it and saw an ordi-
nary black traveling satchel at his feet

   i suppose i ought to turn it over to the
police he reflected  guess ill have
a look first after all he gave it to me and
its a good bag dont suppose there is
anything valuable in it or he wouldnt have
committed suicide

  so when the ferryboat tied up at her slip
hilwin picked up the black bag and walked
ashore with it

   no use of dragging the thing all the
way to the office might as well check it
somewhere

  accordingly he left it at a fruit store
which picked up small change by checking
parcels for folks coming off the ferries

  hilwin was an assistant auditor in a cot-
ton brokerage house in the woolworth
building he was twenty-four years old
unmarried and earned twenty-five dollars
per week a graduate of princeton three
years out of college he had found the busi-
ness of living rather difficult many college
men acquire influential friends own wealthy
relatives and make valuable acquaintances
but hilwin despite his success as a football

player had been forced to rely strictly upon
his own

  like many youngsters he felt that he
was not doing well that he was underpaid
and unappreciated and such an attitude on
his part made him a bit careless regarding
his work he was twenty minutes late at
the office this morning

  braden his deckmate grinned at him dis-
agreeably  this time you are going to get
it old man simpson was looking for you
and it sounds like the dead march

  rather nervously harry entered the inner
office where j e simpson head of the
firm lurked in his lair

   good afternoon mr hilwin this
makes the fourth time you have been late
in three weeks

  ive worked overtime ten nights in a
month without complaining to do the work
piled up as a result of insufficient help in
the outer office replied harry with spirit

   well well said the cotton magnate
 is that a fact i dont like overtime i
dont ask it i think a first class accountant
would not have to putter over his books
ten nights in three weeks i am afraid you
will break down from overwork mr hil-
win i wouldnt have it on my conscience
get your time mr hilwin get your
time

  he busied himself with the papers on his
desk and harry slid out of the office quietly
and considerably crestfallen

   so thats how it feels to be fired he
mused as he sauntered in an ostentatiously
careless fashion to his desk ignoring the in-
quiring glances of braden however his
packing preparations were unmistakable

   gee old man i didnt think he would
really can you said braden contritely
 im sorry i laughed at you i thought it
was just a tongue lashing

   i wasnt canned i resigned i told
him that i had worked ten nights in the
last three weeks without complaining and
i didnt see why he should kick if i were
a few minutes late in the morning

   you talked to him like that its a
wonder he didnt bite you

    id like to see him try it snorted hil-
win  im sick of this place anyway the
next time you see me ill have a real job


argosy-allstory weekly

   get one for me while you are about
it meanwhile if a couple of dollars will
help you-

   thanks old man thats decent of
you but i am getting my salary two days
ahead of time so im flush

  in a few minutes harry had shaken
hands all around visited the cashier and
left the office at nine forty-five in the
morning he found himself unemployed it
didnt feel so good he lived with cousins
in jersey city and while they wouldnt
press him for his room rent he knew they
needed it a new job was an immediate
necessity

   think ill go back and have a look at
that poor fellows bag he told himself as
he reached the broadway pavements
 then ill go through the want ads though
its too late to have much luck with them
to-day

  in a few minutes he had repossessed him-
self of the satchel and was looking around
for a quiet spot where he might explore
its contents one of the ferry waiting
rooms suggested itself to him as a place
where a man might fumble with a grip not
his own without attracting attention at
that hour the outgoing boats were empty
once seated in an unoccupied section he
attempted to satisfy his curiosity but none
of his keys would fit he was unable to
slip the lock by jerking at it and at the
end of five minutes the thing was still un-
opened it was not an expensive bag and
he could always cut the leather or rather
the imitation leather of which it was made
but that was a thiefs trick and any police-
man seeing him carrying a bag with a cut
in the side would promptly investigate

   well thought harry  i didnt go
to bed until two this morning and i
have no work to do i could use a
few hours sleep and i have money
in my pocket the thing to do is hire
a room in some cheap hotel cut the bag
and see whats in it even if there are
only a few clean shirts they will be worth
the price of the room besides there may
be some papers that would tell about the
suicide then i might sell the story to a
newspaper

  these arguments decided him he left

the ferry picked out a small fairly clean
hotel where they still rented rooms at a
dollar and found himself in a dingy cell
with a sad looking mattress on the single
bed

  as soon as he had locked the door and
taken off his coat and vest he drew his
penknife and ripped a long slit in the side
of the bag

  it was full of money

  unable to believe his eyes he began pull-
ing the green contents out and throwing
them on the bed there were neat packages
of treasury notes mostly in denominations
of twenty and they were packed so tightly
in the bag they did not come out easily
his knife had ripped one package nearly in
two

  remember that harry was a low salaried
clerk he had never owned more than
two or three hundred dollars at one time
in his life the sight of a pile of green-
backs a foot high lying on the bed almost
unhinged his mind

   they must be counterfeit he thought
and he examined the packages more closely
but if they were spurious they were done
so cleverly that none but an expert could
detect them

  if not counterfeit then they must have
been stolen the suicide had been a bank
cashier robbed his bank and started for
new york perhaps his crime had preyed
on his mind and the idea of prison so
overpowered him that he preferred to die
in the river

  in that case what bank did he rob
where was he from there was nothing in
the bag to tell not a scrap of paper no
change of underwear nothing but money

  undoubtedly the bank would pay a big
reward for the return of the stolen cash
on the other hand wasnt there danger in
approaching a bank and suggesting that its
money was in his possession

  all sorts of strange thoughts crowded into
hilwins head he imagined that covetous
eyes were gazing at him and he hastened
to pull down the window shade and cover
the keyhole with his hat

   what am i going to do wthat can
i do supposing oh supposing i could
keep this money myself he gave it to me
nothing but money



it was a bequest perhaps he wasnt a
thief only crazy if the money was right-
fully his then it is rightfully mine but
if he were crazy his heirs could get it away
from me

  first it had better be counted and then
hidden being an accountant by trade he
went about the tabulation in a businesslike
manner with a pencil and a sheet of paper
there were one hundred and fifty packages
of notes there were fifty twenty dollar
bills in each package except ten packages
which held fifty hundred dollar bills the
total contents of the bag was one hundred
and ninety thousand dollars

  convinced of this harry feverishly stuffed
the bills back into the bag regretting now
that he had cut it so carelessly he re-
gretted also that he had picked his hotel
so casually in one of these water front
hostelries they would murder a man for a
tenth of two hundred thousand dollars

  his head was aching with excitement
utterly inexperienced he was completely at
a loss what to do where can a man hide
two hundred thousand dollars a rich man
like old simpson could walk into his bank
and deposit it to his account without creat-
ing a ripple of interest or suspicion hil-
win realized that a penniless clerk who tried
to open an account with a handbag full of
greenbacks would probably arrive at police
headquarters to keep the money about
his person was impossible-too bulky as
to leaving the bag in a hotel room that
would be utter madness

  by this time hilwin had decided to keep
the money if he could not having any
other information he felt he had a right to
believe that it had belonged to the man who
bequeathed it to him if it developed that
the fellow was a thief and the persons who
had been robbed proved their claim then
perhaps he would give it up but he was
human enough to feel that they would have
to find him first before they had a chance
to prove ownership  findings keepings 
and  possession is nine-tenths of the law
were the adages he adopted for his consola-
tion

  he was not unaware that the strictly
ethical thing to do was to take the bag to
police headquarters and report all the cir-

cumstances connected with finding it but
he felt that the authorities would hold the
treasure and if there did happen to be a
reward offered for it would probably pre-
vent him from getting much of it at least
that was his opinion of the police

  nevertheless he was in a perplexing situ-
ation he wished to attract no attention to
himself whatever and every expedient
which occurred to him seemed sure to draw
curious eyes

  renting a safety deposit box suggested
itself to him but even that meant giving
references and perhaps an explanation of
why a young man in his simple circum-
stances should need a very large box

  the first thing to do was to get rid of
the damaged satchel and he decided to let
future operations wait on that common
sense told him his bag would be safe for a
few minutes in the room he had just rented
and when he saw a key in a closet door
he determined to take that chance how-
ever in case the bag might vanish during
his absence he filled his overcoat pockets
with several packages of greenbacks

  he found a leather shop near by and pur-
chased another bag in very short order he
almost ran back and his heart sank sicken-
ingly when he reached his room for the
door stood open and a maid was bustling
around

   oh i thought youd left sir she
grimaced and went out he tried the closet
door still locked his hand trembled as
he opened it glory be the treasure was
still his

  during the walk to the store he had de-
cided that his next move must be to a first
class hotel where a man laden down with
money wouldnt attract so much attention
carrying both bags but with the money
transferred to the good one he left the
water front tavern and hailed a taxi on
the way uptown he decided to leave the torn
bag inside the taxi rather a stupid thing
but hilwin was young in crime

  he left the taxi at the door of the hotel
pendorf and saw it drive swiftly away car-
rying the suicides bag then it struck
him that the next passenger would discover
it and seeing the slit in its side suspect a
robbery investigation would lead back to


argosy-allstory weekly

the pendorf which meant that he would
better place a good part of the city between
him and that pretentious caravansary hil-
wins wealth was causing him more worry
already than the last six months labor in
simpsons cotton office

  at the mastodon where he arrived in
another taxi he registered under his own
name before he thought that it might not
be the best thing to do docilely he fol-
lowed the bellhop to the elevator a deep
furrow in his boyish brow

  once in his room he stretched out on the
bed and tried to remember all the detective
stories he had ever read

  he didnt recall any of the heroes of light
fiction who were in his peculiar predica-
ment there were plenty of persons who
eloped with bags of money or securities
but they never seemed worried about ways
and means here he was with a fortune
come by honestly so far as he knew and
he was completely embarrassed he im-
agined he had aged years since morning

  one idea came to him as he lay flat on
his back he would put the packages of
hundred dollars bills in a neat bundle and
have them locked in the office safe he
would also carry as much as he dared in
the pockets of his clothes

  he felt and rightly that he was in a
different world at the mastodon from the
business section down town and the jersey
suburbs those hundreds of thousands of
underpaid clerks who inhabit the tall office
buildings of lower broadway during the
day and live in the backwoods of jersey
or brooklyn in small flats or installment
cottages were as remote from the mastodon
and park avenue as if they were living in a
different planet occasionally a naughty
stenographer might invade these precincts
financed by her employer but the clerks
never

  and even the theater district of times
square would be completely blighted if its
patronage depended upon the work bees of
the lower broadway hives

  no hilwin felt he could stop at the mas-
todon spend money freely and get his treas-
ure safely deposited somewhere without
danger of recognition from his former as-
sociates a telegram to his relatives in jer-

sey that he was spending a few days with
friends in new york would allay that
anxiety

  and for the first time he began to con-
sider the delights of money remember
that harry was a college man in his salad
days he had enjoyed glimpses into the
sunny places of life to live luxuriously
at a first class hotel to purchase tickets
for the front rows of the musical comedies
from the speculators to dine in the ex-
pensive restaurants and look at ihe beauti-
ful women in their jewels and furs to
become acquainted with such beauties and
entertain them himself to travel in a deep
cushioned and glittering automobile to
golf and ride horseback to attend bo-
hemian parties where wine was drunk from
satin slippers to exchange persiflage per-
haps even to make love to actresses whose
photographs he had admired in the maga-
zines money could secure all this for him
and being young fairly good looking and
unmarried these things seemed worth while
to hilwin

  he shivered with delight just thinking
about them and he was inclined to be-
lieve that a year or two of such delights
would be worth any penalty

   supposing i could live like a million-
aire for a couple of years and supposing
then they found out that i had no right
to the money they couldnt take away
the fun id had and jail wouldnt be much
worse than going back to the grimy grind
ive just escaped from

  there was no key for the closet in this
hotel room but hilwin locked the bag after
abstracting his packages of hundred dollar
notes and carefully wrapping them up in
hotel stationery then he sauntered care-
lessly to the office and shoving them
through the cashiers grill said  kindly
put these packages in the safe

chapter ii

a close shave

let us pass over the next couple of days
u hilwin summoned courage to open ac-
counts in two neighboring banks for
five thousand dollars each offering cash
nothing but money



which was accepted without comment and
securing a waiver of references on the
ground that he was stopping at the masto-
don and had no friends in the city he
also laid in a supply of clothing suitable
to a wealthy young man living at an ex-
pensive hostelry

  harry always had had ideas regarding
clothing ideas which he had hitherto been
unable to gratify three or four hundred
dollars were well spent in this direction
despite all his efforts however the money
bag remained two-thirds full it now re-
posed in a very good trunk with a special
lock and it didnt worry him so much

  he had read all the papers with minute
care the suicide was dismissed with a
few lines and no bank robbery loomed por-
tentously in the headlines

  it was about seven in the evening harry
in a well-fitting dinner suit was lolling in a
big chair in the lobby looking rather wist-
fully at the throng of pretty women who
walked about or parked themselves on the
hotel couches and easy chairs awaiting their
men a few of them cast glances at hilwin
which would have meant something to a
more experienced lounge lizard it never
occurred to him that any of them could
be casually encountered

  a youth about his own age with sharp
features and the rather shifty glance of a
certain type of new yorker dropped into
the next chair

   great place to see life he observed
drawing a gold cigarette case from his
pocket lighting a cigarette and offering the
case to hilwin

   it sure is replied harry whose soli-
tary grandeur was getting on his nerves

   some of these wrens aint so magnifi-
cent as they look added the stranger
c sure thing some of them are on the pick-
up bet we could grab off a couple if we
started to work

   dont try it i live here

   you live here how long

   oh three or four days

   pretty steep isnt it

   i wouldnt want to stand it indefi-
nitely

   guess not say what was in that
bag

  the bottom fell out of the world for hil-
win he had played poker enough to keep
a fairly wooden face but inside he simply
curled up

   wha-what bag he stammered

   dont pull that stuff i was standing
right near you on the ferryboat i saw you
walk off with the bag of the guy who
jumped overboard

   oh  said harry  that bag

   yeh thought youd remember it

   and you think i stole it

   saw you grab it kid

   if you were standing alongside of me
you must have heard him make me a pres-
ent of it

   cant say i did but im not blaming
you for walking off with the bag would
have done it myself if id thought of it
what was in it

   nothing but some soiled linen i threw
it away

   didnt even keep the bag

   no why should i i have plenty
of bags and it wasnt a good one

   funny thing for a guy who lives at the
mastodon to do walk off with that bag
remarked the inquisitor  you didnt look
as though you belonged up here that morn-
ing on the ferryboat

   i dont see why i should answer these
questions complained hilwin with what
indignation he could muster  you dont
suppose a man with anything valuable in
his possession would have committed sui-
cide

   not likely how about pawn tickets
were there any

   there were not retorted hilwin em-
phatically  now lets drop the subject
c you looked to me like one of those
twenty-dollar-a-week clerks continued the
unwelcome acquaintance  kind of a
quick change for you

  a laughing group stopped in front of the
two men at this instant there were four
girls and three men one of the latter
glanced casually at the pair and recognition
dawned in his eyes

   if it isnt harry hilwin he exclaimed
 harry i havent seen you since twenty-
one look bill its old hilwin princeton
twenty-one 


argosy-allstory weekly

  bill gave a whoop of joy and both
pounced upon harry a college reunion
followed exclamations reminiscences do-
you-recalls ad nauseum-at least to the
simple stranger who had been interrogating
harry

   what youre doing to-night doesnt
matter youre with us cried the chap
who had seen him first  meet the girls
girls this is harry hilwin princeton
twenty-one played on the varsity pitched
for the baseball team regular guy hes
coming with us miss mabel boardman
miss helen swan and miss ruth simpson

  hilwin acknowledged the introductions
with a little embarrassment he was shak-
en by his interview with the fellow ferry-
boat voyager and he felt that the interrup-
tion was very opportune surely the recog-
nition by a wealthy party of this sort must
convince the sharp-visaged man that he
didnt owe his apparent prosperity to the
suicides bag

   who are we going he demanded

   dinner here then theater afterward
were bound for a russian joint ruth
knows it whats the name of that place
ruthie

   club petroushka

   thats it tough on false teeth
chattering noisily they entered the din-
ing room leaving a much puzzled young
man sitting alone

   names harry hilwin seems to be-
long all right however wont do anyjiarm
to investigate these were his musings
he rose and strolled carelessly toward the
phone booths from one of these he called
the hotel desk

   i want to talk to harry hilwin whats
his room number please

   hilwin just a minute room 
the unknown hung up and jotted down
the number in a little memo book

   well harry old socks he said under
his breath ill just take a look through
your bridal suite while youre whispering
sweet nothings into the shell-like ear of
one of those wrens

  then he chuckled silently

  in the dining room meanwhile harry was
sitting between two distractingly pretty girls
who kept asking embarrassing questions

   where have you been keeping yourself
mr hilwin dancing men are scarce and
you have been very mean not to let your
college chums know how to find you
hilwin smiled a little bitterly these
men were classmates but hardly chums
they had parted after commencement with-
out regret for they had never traveled
the same paths in college even there
men with money and those with none found
little in common he knew that in his ca-
pacity as a clerk in lower broadway he
would be lucky if he got a cool nod of recog-
nition from these fellows to-night at the
mastodon after a couple of cocktails in a
party where one man had failed to show up
they had fallen on his neck because he was
presentable and apparently prosperous

   i hope youll let me make up for lost
time he parried  i am going to be in
new york right along and im unmarried
and undoubtedly a great catch for any girl
this sally was greeted with peals of
laughter and all four girls proposed to him
at once after the brazen manner of the girl
of 

  ill watch you all work this evening and
reserve my decision he informed them

  bill cromwell nodded approvingly and
whispered to jimmie slaven  hilwin
was on the teams but not in the societies
dont remember seeing much of him

   always a good sort indorsed slaven
with the pride of a discoverer  knew he
would fit in all right thats why i an-
nexed him

  the dinner was a very elaborate affair
hilwin quivered with fright at the prices on
the menu and could not prevent himself
from doing problems in mental arithmetic
to estimate the total amount of the orders
and then he recalled that his pockets were
bulging with money and he could afford to
pay for many such dinners

   did you ever meet my father down
town demanded ruth simpson having
extracted from hilwin that he had been in
business in lower manhattan  hes a cot-
ton broker they say hes a hard man to
beat in a deal

  old simpsons daughter that was a
coincidence hilwin could imagine the old
mans face if he thought his daughter was

                         	a
nothing but money



cooing pleasantly into the ear of the clerk
he had fired a few days before and cau-
tion told him that he must not become
friendly with miss simpson because her
father was one person who knew him for
what he was

  it was going to be hard snubbing miss
simpson however she was one of those
girls whose eyes made you think of limpid
pools and whose smile seemed to bathe you
in radiance and she was apparently in-
terested in harry her own crowd de-
clared she was making a dead set at him

  harrys acquaintance with girls since he
left college had been limited by his pocket-
book girls mean expense in new york
theaters motion pictures dinners dances
are required of every young man who wishes
to make good he knew a number of girls
in jersey who would consent to let him
park in their parlors but even these re-
quired escort to a dance or a theater occa-
sionally and what these little attentions
had been wont to do to his twenty-five
dollars per

  a girl of miss simpsons type was a new
experience for him not much prettier per-
haps than the stenographers and bookkeep-
ers of his acquaintance she had the aid of
hairdresser modistes jewelers furriers and
beauty shops to accentuate her natural ad-
vantages and she had the confidence of a
society girl the experience of a hundred
flirtations and the amazingly frank almost
masculine way of talking which modem
new york girls have adopted

  when a beautiful little thing you have
just met on whom you hope you might
make an impression suddenly looks at you
pleadingly and says  i love you will you
marry me it sort of takes your breath
away its unfair embarrassing and it
knocks a man who isnt used to such treat-
ment off his pins and if such an unpro-
voked assault causes the victim to blush
hesitate and possibly accept the offer it fills
the little hussy with unholy glee

  pocket flasks circulated freely and it was
nearly nine oclock when the crowd decided
to move on to the theater in two taxis
they set out for broadway in some man-
ner ruth simpson fell to harry and she
snuggled against him in the cab in a most

   	a

inviting manner when he was slow in
putting his arm around her she grabbed
it and personally placed it in proper position
herself asking almost petulantly

   where were you brought up

  the play was a musical comedy full of
pretty girls and poor comedians musically
it was like all the rest harry thought it
marvelous however because of the com-
pany he was in the drinks he had enjoyed
and the general hilarity suddenly to-
ward the end of the second act a sharp
shiver ran through him he remembered
the inquisitive stranger in the lobby and the
bag of money unguarded in his room after
his peek into paradise to-night it would be
too cruel if anything happened to his
treasury he must get away for a little
while

  almost rudely he excused himself to ruth
simpson and the rest saying he would join
them later at the club petroushka and tore
up the aisle to jump into a taxi and reach
the mastodon was the matter of a few
minutes

   my key he demanded of the clerk at
the desk

  the clerk looked in the rack  not here
mr hilwin isnt it in your pocket

   no indeed replied harry after a
rapid search

  a second clerk looked around  why
i sent up your key a few minutes ago mr
hilwin you phoned downstairs that you
had gone up without it and i sent it up by a
bellboy

   i must have missed him muttered
harry making for the elevator his mind
in a whirl

  evidently that crook in the lobby had
got into his room by this time the bag
might be gone the elevator stopped at
the tenth floor and he darted toward his
room the key was in the lock outside
he threw open the door and beheld an
alarming spectacle the trunk was open
seated on his bed was the rat-faced youth
from the lobby blandly counting the con-
tents of the bag

  this person looked up recognized the in-
vader and remarked with a sigh of relief

   oh its you i didnt expect you back
for hours


argosy-allstory weekly

   how dare you break into my room
put that money back ill turn you over to
the police exclaimed hilwin in righteous
indignation

  the burglar put his hand in his pocket
and drew out an ugly looking little auto-
matic

   ever see one of these things if you
had any sense youd have bought a couple
yourself with all this jack to guard sit
down kid and make yourself at home
sit down i said

   you wouldnt dare shoot

   wouldnt i say for a quarter of
whats here id riddle you so full of holes
youd look like a sieve dont kid yourself
youre up against anything soft how
much money was there in this bag

   what you see

   you must have spent some of it those
glad rags all the clothes in that closet
ill bet youre carrying a wad right now
however theres nothing small about me
i aint going to ask you to make good what
youve spent

   thank you

   dont mention it with a graceful wave
of the hand carrying the automatic  why
do you suppose a guy with all this jack
wanted to jump off the ferry it beats me
you know i almost fell for your story
about a couple of dirty shirts being all you
found but im one of those careful ginks
that likes to check things up efficiency
thats my middle name so i waited till i saw
you folks start for the theater and then i
allowed you an hour to get interested in the
play and then i started to work i came up
here and phoned down to the clerk to send a
bellboy up with your key figured they
might know you at the desk but that a
bellboy wouldnt worked like a charm
its a wonder more hotel rooms aint robbed
its so easy to get into them

   im not interested in your methods
said hilwin bitterly

   aw be sociable just to show what
a good guy i am i aint going to bother to
count this i aint going to ask how much
you got away with

   thanks

   but theres the matter of making my
getaway thats bothering me all i need

to do is to get out of the hotel without at-
tracting any attention because im not wor-
rying about you getting the police on my
trail not you youre too scared theyll
ask you where you got the money so all
i have to do is to fix you so you wont
make any fuss as i exit of course i didnt
expect you back but i always carry a little
bottle of chloroform ill just give you
enough to put you to sleep for a half an
hour or so and then everything will be
o k

  the chatty robber was sitting on the bed
during this conversation hilwin had
dropped into a chair about three feet away
the crook was covering him with the auto-
matic held in his right hand and he now
began to fumble in his vest pocket for the
phial of chloroform

  when hilwin went to princeton he had
played football for four years and one of
the best things he did was to punt so
confident was the crook that he was deal-
ing with a frightened amateur in violence
that he dropped his eyes toward the hand
which was feeling in his vest pocket as
he did so harrys right foot shot out and
his patent leathered toe struck the hand
holding the revolver with all the power be-
hind it of a leg which used to send the pig-
skin fifty yards

  the automatic flew up and struck the
ceiling there was a shriek of pain from
the crook for the kick had broken some
bones in the hand and then hilwin fell
upon him with the sure grip of a football
player

   ouch ouch let me up youve
broken my hand oh my god the
pain

  hilwin rose from his victim and picked
up the pistol which fortunately had not
discharged

   put that money back in the bag he
commanded

  sniveling with pain the crook tried to
obey orders without any compunction
hilwin let him finish the job he was
breathing heavily more from triumph than
from his exertions and he was wondering
what wfas the next move

   now you listen to me he declared to
the crook  that money belongs to me
nothing but money



i intend to put over a big deal to-morrow
which explains why all this cash is in my
room there was nothing in the bag given
me by the suicide except a few dirty shirts
which i threw away i am not afraid of
the police nor you nor anybody else i
am going to keep your automatic because
people who dont know how to handle such
things shouldnt have them and i am not
turning you over to the police because i
want to rejoin my friends and havent time
to be bothered with you i dont care
whether you believe what i tell you or not
if you ever cross my path again i
wont break your hand ill break your
neck

   i was a fool not to shoot you on sight
grumbled the crook as he nursed his hand
 hey not that you said you wouldnt
for hilwin had taken the telephone and
spoke into it  send up the house de-
tective

   i want to make sure you get out of
the hotel and im going to ask him to
escort you out explained hilwin

   look here declared the unsuccessful
robber  nobody knows but me how you
got this money give me half of it and ill
keep quiet otherwise ill get it all be-
cause im not through with you by any
means

  hilwin laughed with a merriment he
didnt feel  nobody knows but you he
exclaimed  you havent much sense
why if i had stolen this money and you
were the only witness it would be the best
thing in the world for me to empty this
gun into you youre a thief i find you
in my room i struggle with you take your
gun away from you and to protect myself
i have to kill you id get a vote of thanks
from the police

   yes but you wont do it you aint
got the guts

   ive guts enough but i have nothing
to fear from you so why should i com-
mit murder

   dont do it on my account said the
crook with a sour grin

  at tliis moment the house detective
bustled in

   this gentleman refuses to leave my
room though i dont want to see him any

more will you escort him out of the hotel
and make sure he doesnt hang around
outside

   come on kid said the detective
 want me to make a pinch

   no just throw him out

   this aint no way to treat a friend
protested the crook moving toward the door
with the detective  ill see you again
when youll be sorry you didnt do busi-
ness with me

   good night

  as soon as he was alone harry lost his
air of confidence he was actually very
much frightened it was bad enough to be
holding on to a fortune that he wasnt
really certain he owned when he thought
that nobody knew he had it now he hacl
active enemies for the crook would prob-
ably call in assistance and he would have
to look out for trouble and the worst of
it was that he couldnt ask the authorities
to protect him

  he remembered that he had to rejoin
the theater party at the russian restaurant
because if he didnt show up it might start
them talking about him besides that
daughter of simpsons was a mighty fas-
cinating girl

  and the bag must not remain in the bed-
room a minute longer

  whether the hotel safe would accommo-
date anything as large as the bag he did not
know and he was afraid to ask but he
thought of a simple hiding place examin-
ing the grip and discovering that the crook
had not damaged the lock but opened it
with a key of some sort he locked it again
and started downstairs

  when he reached the ground floor he did
not pass into the street for he figured the
robber might be lurking around instead
he went to the basement and out through
a passage leading directly into the grand
central station making sure he wasnt
followed he stepped up to the package-
room window and checked the bag in a
place where so much baggage was being
handled he felt sure the clerks were too
busy and probably too honest to go through
anything so ordinary looking as his hand
bag and he felt it would be the last place
in the world a crook would think of looking

  after which he jumped into a taxicab and
sought the restaurant where he expected to
meet his new friends

chapter iii

two kinds of girls

this restaurant was one of the new in-
timate clubs which happen to have
caught the fancy of new york so-
ciety with only twenty-five or thirty
tables the effect was something like a big
private party very high prices kept the
clientele fairly select and the guests felt at
liberty to let themselves go rather more
than they would do in a large hotel cafe

  harry caught his friends as they were
checking their garments and concealing
their drinkables in side and hip pockets
a general shout went up at his appearance
one might think he had been a member of
the crowd for years ruth simpson seized
his right arm and another girl his left and
both scolded him tenderly for daring to ab-
sent himself  even for a few minutes
hilwin smiled rather grimly when he
thought of all that had happened in those
few minutes but he had sense enough to
keep the cause of his mirth to himself
shortly he was whirling about in a dance
with the simpson girl rather bothered by
the abandon with which the society girls
gave themselves up to the raptures of jazz
miss simpson impressed herself upon him
in a manner which would have caused in-
terference by the floor director at one of
the dancing parties in jersey city and
yet he knew perfectly well that if he took
the slightest liberty he would suffer a com-
plete social eclipse

  back at the table he found a new couple
miss mildred duroy the well known mus-
ical comedy singer had been plucked at
the stage door and brought to the party
miss duroy sat next to hilwin and was
soon confidential with him her partner
busied himself with ruth simpson

   yes its a rotten show said miss
duroy  i dont think it will last another
couple of weeks its the most curious thing
that pieces like this get a chance wrhile
really good shows cant find a producer

   how do you know they are good shows
if they are not produced demanded bill
cromwell listening in for a second or two

  any simp can tell a real score and a
good book replied miss duroy  now
i know a piece which was really written
for me it has a musical score which would
knock broadway cold and one of the clever-
est librettos ever turned out the piece
is fairly inexpensive too forty thousand
dollars would put it on and twenty has
already been raised the other twenty
cant be found so there goes that

   is there much money in a successful
musical comedy asked hilwin innocently

   is there money shrilled miss duroy
 where were you raised why a success-
ful musical show can make five thousand
dollars a week jim montgomery made a
million out of  irene  and look at what
george m cohan cleaned up in  little
nellie kelly 

   you mean to say there is a chance of
making a few hundred thousand for an
investment of twenty thousand or so

   sure declared cromwell and you can
win thirty-six thousand to one in roulette
if you pick the lucky number

   be still interposed miss duroy sharp-
ly  its not the same at all if you have
a good show you cant lose and this is a
good show can i interest you in it mr
hilwin

   i am interested he declared seriously
at this a hoot went up around the table
the men looked at hilwin with mingled
respect and pity respect that he might
have twenty thousand dollars and pity that
he might be induced to risk it on a musical
show the girls gazed at him with the in-
terest that any woman exhibits when a man
who is young and good looking is suddenly
discovered to have money to throw away

   miss duroy has monopolized you long
enough declared ruth turning her back
on the man to whom she had been talking
 come and dance

  my angel you wouldnt take away
my angel  exclaimed the actress throwing
her arms around hilwins neck

   ill say she wont announced the man
miss simpson had deserted  she promised
this dance to me
nothing but money



  he promptly dragged ruth to her feet
and the others also scrambled out upon the
floor miss duroy turned her big black
orbs full upon hilwin and let loose her most
fascinating smile

   wouldnt it be wonderful if you were
to make it possible for my show to be pro-
duced financiers of plays are usually the
most impossible people but you would be
different

   what fine times we could have to-
gether what a success we would have
how much money we would make because
i dont mind telling you i am to have a
percentage in the piece

  hilwin was a simple youngster though
not so simple as he had been a few days
before he sensed the insincerity and the
artifice of the beautiful woman who was
attempting to beguile him he realized
fully he was being vamped he much pre-
ferred ruth simpson boisterous flapper as
she was to this sleek and perfumed
creature

  but he was a person with a bagful of
money and that money was at present draw-
ing no interest and running frightful risks
in the checkroom of the grand central
station

  and he had been struck by an idea if
he were able to put some of that money
mto an enterprise which would return him
huge sums on the investment in a short
period of time he could turn the original
amount intact over to the rightful owner
if that individual ever showed up

   let me hear the music and read the
book he informed miss duroy  and if
i like it ill make an investment

  oh you adorable person she ex-
claimed and she kissed him full on the
mouth the people at the next table
grinned and clapped their hands but
ruth simpson dancing by with her partner
gave miss duroy a furious glance

   thats enough she declared  ive
got to save harry hilwin from that nasty
vamp

   cut out the spooning harry and
dance with me she demanded and harry
had nothing to do but obey the vamp
lady grinned maliciously at ruth she had
finished her business deal

   youre not going to be idiot enough to
put money into a musical comedy for that
woman asked miss simpson with more
indignation than she was justified in ex-
pressing to a man she had met for the first
time only a few hours before

   not for that woman i dont care an
awful lot for her said harry  but i
have some loose change and a flyer in a
musical comedy sounds interesting especial-
ly if the financial returns are as big as they
say

   i know a man who lost all his money
backing a musical comedy and i dont
want you to have the same experience if
you have money to put to work my father
could invest it for you in the cotton busi-
ness which is a lot safer

   yes but it takes a long time to get a
return in that business im looking for
a quick turnover

   i believe youre completely fascinated
by the woman she isnt any good she
cant sing and she cant dance all she
does is vamp men into putting money into
productions for her im disappointed in
you and if you could see where her lip-
stick came off on your cheek she laughed
meanly as he tried to wipe it off with the
back of his hand

  harry didnt get another chance with
ruth during the remainder of the dancing
other men claimed her and he danced with
other girls particularly with miss duroy
who had evidently informed her escort that
there were business reasons why he must
permit her to devote herself to hilwin the
men attempted to chaff harry on the
 angel  business but miss duroy was so
much in earnest that they realized they had
better not interfere

   when shall i see you-to-morrow
she asked hilwin

   whenever you say

   come to my apartment at the giltmore
at two oclock wrell have a little time
alone and then ill have you meet the author
and the composer and the man who in-
tends to produce the show

   its a date

  as the party went into the street ruth
simpson got a chance to say to harry
 come and see me any time better phone


argosy-allstory weekly

madison  youll remember the
number

   if i forget everything else ill re-
member

   better forget that vamps musical
comedy

  hilwin laughed and waved his hand as
the taxis drove away

  at two the next afternoon he inquired
for miss duroy at the giltmore that lady
who was still in bed gave a gurgle of ex-
citement when he was announced she had
experience with angels many a man who
was willing to sprout theatrical wings at
one a m changed his mind and decided
to stay on earth in the cold gray morning

   dont let him get away she said to
the clerk  send him right up i need
him in my business

   quit your kidding miss duroy
laughed the clerk as he hung up  the
lady is expecting you he explained to
hilwin  you are to go up to her suite



  miss duroy was jiggling her telephone
receiver excitedly

   give me bryant  quick hello
mr rubenstein please is that you
jake all right this is millie hop
into a taxi right away put the script of
 sweetheart annie  in your pocket and
try to get bill delaney with his music ive
hooked a live one honest this time
theres something doing i wont let him
get away if i have to dance the  hooch a
ma cooch  for him

  after this she passed into her bathroom
and made a swift but efficient toilet then
wrapping around her a negligee so beauti-
ful and expensive that it would have fed
a family of children for five years and
slipping her bare feet into golden mules
she emerged into her sitting room where
harry had just been ushered by her maid

  seen in the daylight mildred duroy
wasnt quite so exquisite as she appeared
in the candle lights of the petroushka but
she was still under thirty years old her eyes
and teeth were excellent her hair was her
own and voluminous and she boasted one
of the most perfect figures in the show
business a figure which the negligee did
not entirely conceal

   oh you dear man she greeted him
crossing the room in a few jumps she
treated him to a warm embrace

  he did not exactly suffer under this treat-
ment but it made him a little uncom-
fortable

   now look here miss duroy he be-
gan when she had released him and he had
collapsed into a big armchair a few feet
away  i like you and all that but im
not here to talk business because ive fallen
in love with you if this is a good show
and the prospects are good im interested
if not im not and while i wouldnt
want a better vamp than you if i wanted
to be vamped im only interested in the
business side of the affair you dont have
to be nice to me to make me buy into a
really good show

   oh but harry she exclaimed with a
pout  it isnt that at all long before
we talked about the show last night i was
interested in you i thought you were the
best looking fellow there and i gave the
chap who brought me the shake

   well i like you too but this is busi-
ness

   and dont you love me a teeny weeny
bit she asked drawing her chair toward
him

   i guess i love you about as much as
you love me and i wish youd get dressed
suppose somebody came in and caught
us

   youre an idiot snapped miss duroy
expressing her true opinion for once  the
people coming are friends of mine how-
ever if it will make you feel better ill
finish my toilet youll find a copy of
 our dumb animals  to read

   where asked hilwin innocently

   ye gods remarked miss duroy and
vanished into her bedroom

   guess im being kidded grinned hil-
win  i hope the manager and the author
wont kiss me when they come in

  five minutes after she had entered her
bedroom her phone tinkled again it was
mr rubenstein

   come to my bedroom door jake i
want to see you before i introduce you to
the angel she said in a low voice

  when jake arrived accompanied by mr
nothing but money



 delaney they were welcomed in her sanc-
 tuary jake was a short stout bald-headed
 and very greasy looking person delaney
 the pianist was tall red-headed and had
 protruding teeth

 rubenstein indignantly  if hes got twen-
 ty thousand weve got a show

  meanwhile harry hilwin had been idly
looking out of the window that morning
he had redeemed his bag of money from
the railroad package room boldly rented a
good-sized safety deposit box at one of the
banks where he had opened an account
and placed his greenbacks at last in a place
of absolute security he had withheld
enough to double his balance in the two
banks and he still carried in his clothes an
amount which would justify any yegg in
murdering him

  when jake and bill had been introduced
to him by millie he dispensed with their
program in a manner which flabbergasted
them

   i understand you gentlemen own a mu-
sical comedy and will sell me a half inter-
est for twenty thousand dollars

  you bet declared jake and after
you have heard it youre going to say its
the best show of its kind you ever listened
to

   you are a producer mr rubenstein
 yep ive produced some of the great-
est things broadway ever saw remember
 the lady in velvet 

   no

   well that one didnt run very long
but it was a great show  remember  the
merry widow 

   did you produce that

   surest thing you know of course sav-
age got the credit but i did the work

   and this gentleman is the composer
 well no this gentleman is the mu-
sical director of all my enterprises millie
almost strangled trying to keep from laugh-
ing while bill himself accepted his hon-
ors with an air of mild surprise

   bill tickle the piano and let the gent
hear some of the tunes


argosy-allstory weekly

  hilwin held up his hand  it wont be
necessary i am sure you would not have
picked out a bad show and i know so little
about music that i wouldnt appreciate a
lot of tunes i never heard before now

interest in this show you put it on pick
the best cast you can get i havent any-
body in mind

   oh harry-- exclaimed millie  you
know that i am to have the leading
role -

   miss duroy of course youll find
something for her

   the leading role harry

   if mr rubenstein considers you suited
to it the only condition i make is that
my name shall not be associated with it in
any way im not looking for publicity
and if i get any ill cancel all arrange-
ments i dont want to be known as in-
terested i have good reasons is that
clear mr rubenstein

  well sure just as you say only
money talks you know

  hilwin took out his fat wallet and drew
two five hundred dollar bills from it
 heres a deposit to show my good faith
he said

  rubensteins eyes sparkled as he picked
up the notes

   say mr hilwin youre the kind of man
i like to do business with ill keep your
connection as quiet as the grave but
dont you want to be in on picking the
chorus and the principals

   i may attend the rehearsals as a friend
of miss duroys but i dont want anything
to do with the cast i wouldnt know a good
chorus girl from a bad one

   cinch grinned bill  there aint
no good ones

   can that stuff exclaimed millie  i
was once a chorus girl myself

  bill laughed out loud but checked the
mirth at a baleful glare from rubenstein

  you have the proper legal papers ready
to-morrow and ill meet you at your office
with a lawyer said hilwin  ill pay the
balance in cash then now miss duroy
please excuse me and accept my thanks
for bringing me in touch with these gen-
tlemen

  hilwin shook hands all around and de-
parted leaving three vastly puzzled thea-
trical people

chapter iv

a musical investment

 whats the matter with that
bird demanded bill  he buys
half a show he hasnt heard from
a guy who dont own it for a dame he aint
stuck on and he doesnt want to lamp the
candidates for the chorus hes a nut

   this is good money replied ruben-
stein fondling the notes

   if the rest is good i should worry what
his game is find out where the author and
composer of this show hang out and sign
them up right away then get a lawyer
and form a corporation so hell have pre-
liminary papers ready to-morrow

   can you produce the show on -
 asked millie

   with  cash i can easily dig up
 more money draws money an
eight girl chorus and two sets i know
where there are a lot of good costumes just
in from a show that blew up on its road try-
out sure wte can produce it

   you aint actually going to put the
show on bill was incredulous

   whats your idea graft the dough
and give him nothing im afraid of that
guy theres something behind him he
aint such a fool as a matter fact thats
the way to buy a musical show the ones
you think are good fliv the lemons turn
out to be pippins supposing we succeeded
in cheating him out of half his 
wed have  wouldnt we on the
other hand supposing we put on a show
and its a hit we have a third interest
anyway after weve dug up a little more
dough well weve got a chance to make
a hundred thousand you bet youre life
im going to produce this show and its go-
ing to be the best thing i ever did

   aint sayin much from bill

   shut up now millie i dont know
about you for the lead he looked at her
searchingly  you aint as young as you
was and your pipes are losing their steam
nothing but money



   is that so millies eyes narrowed dan-
gerously  well my pipes are strong
enough to bust this deal wide open unless
you sit right down here and sign an agree-
ment that i play the lead and have my
name in the electric lights

   this guy aint crazy about you at all
 i led him in and i can lead him out
hes a bit shy and didnt want you to think
it was because of me he was putting up the
jack and anyway i can give him such an
earful about you and your career that hell
back away so fast you cant see him with
a spyglass you put on the  merry
widow but savage got the credit all you
had to do with the  merry widow  was
selling tickets on the sidewalk

   i didnt say you couldnt have the
lead retorted jake hastily  i suppose
hed insist on it though he didnt say so
and after all you tipped us to this

   for which i get one of those 
bills

   ah no millie this is on the level
all the jack has to go into the show no
commissions this fellows lawyer will sew
us up tight

   all right but you sign the agreement
about me playing the lead seizing a pen
she wrote rapidly and jake signed

  quite unaware that his absurd business
methods had caused a crooked manager to
decide that honesty was the best policy hil-
win arrived at the mastodon in a taxi his
hasty departure from the giltmore had been
due to a quickening desire to call up ruth
simpson

  he was human enough to feel a thrill
of excitement at the idea of calling upon
a well-known actress at her apartment but
he was still conventional enough in his point
of view to be a bit shocked at millies ob-
vious willingness to go to great lengths with
a man who would finance her show and
there was a wholesomeness about ruth de-
spite her flapperish pertness which con-
trasted most favorably with the sleek and
rather snaky prima donna

  then why did he agree to buy in on the
show you might ask because he was just
a gambler making a blind wager he real-
ized that even after he had heard the script
and listened to the score he would be ut-

terly unable to tell whether the piece were
good bad or indifferent so he just pur-
chased a pig in a bag and incidentally
saved a couple of hours time which could
be profitably used trying to get in touch
with ruth

miss simpson was at home and easily in-
duced to go to the telephone talking over
the phone was one of her chief diversions
the conversation went something like this
 miss simpson this is mr hilwin

   c mr hilwin with a rising inflection

   why-er-yes i met you last night
 the party was quite large last night
which were you mr hilwin

   why-er-i was the chap joining you
at the mastodon who went to princeton
with bill cromwell surely you remember
me now

 oh yes i wasnt sure your name was
mr hilwin you were short and dark
 no im tall and fair harry by this
time was overcome with confusion and hu-
miliation

   oh yes i think i danced with you
once didnt i

   if i made such a slight impression on
you that you dont remember how i looked
i must apologize for presuming to call you
to the phone good-by miss simpson

   harry

   yes its impossible to describe the
change in his tone at hearing her use his
first name

   dont be an idiot of course i remem-
ber you but i owed you something for fall-
ing for that nasty actress woman

   gee miss simpson you certainly made
me feel small i thought youd forgotten
me completely

  you deserve it but i didnt exactly
you are too nice a boy to be lured into
backing a show for a person like that what
are you doing this afternoon

  calling you up

   well im not very busy myself and i
might be induced to come to have tea with
you if you urged very hard

  when can you come

   soon as i can get my hat on masto-
don

   ill be waiting

harry radiant stepped out of the phone


argosy-allstory weekly

booth a thin dark foreign-looking man
scrutinized him carefully but he did not
notice him

  the dark man stepped to the telephone
operator as harry hastened away

   was that mr hilwin he asked

   yes sir

   thank you

  now to go back a little we left the rat-
faced young man being escorted out of the
hotel by the house detectives the night be-
fore that individual hastened to a doctor
of his acquaintance and discovered that a
small bone was broken in his hand it was
neatly bandaged by the physician and he
went on his way

   how did you get the busted wing
moriaty the doctor had demanded

   kicked by a mule he had replied and
mumbled to himself  and thats no lie
mr moriaty did a little thinking during
the remainder of the night and decided that
the prize was worth calling in more com-
petent workers than he had proved to be
himself so next morning he rang the bell
in a certain house in the fifties and was
admitted to the presence of a heavy set man
who looked like a former saloon proprietor
which is exactly what he was-among other
things

   hello moriaty the big man greeted
him  whats on your mind this fine
day

 if i put you next to something worth
 in cash what will my share be
 depends on who has to do the work
if its easy you get a third if its very
hard you dont get so much

   well i cant swing it alone so ill have
to take what you give me

   thats a wise kid now spring your
story

   in the first place have you heard of
any big haul being made lately of between
 and  worth of nice new
greenbacks

   not around here wait till i call head-
quarters and find out what they know down
there hand me that phone will ye

   hello police headquarters give me
detective sergeant leatrice a moments
pause  that you phil bull hansen
talking private and confidential i want

to know whos got away from anywhere
with anything up to a quarter of a million
never mind the small stuff what do i
want to know for you get me the dope
im looking for and there may be something
doing for you call me back

  he hung up and folded his big flabby
white hands across his stomach regarding
moriaty keenly out of red-rimmed eyes

   bout a week ago i was on a north
river ferry early in the morning when a
feller jumped overboard

   heard about that body not recovered
nothing known about him

   just before he went over the rail he said
something to a man named hilwin who
was standing alongside of him i heard
them talking but didnt pay any attention
when the crowd rushed to the rail to watch
the search for the body i got busy and
landed a few wallets and a watch nothing
much in them as i was slipping off the
ferryboat on the new york side this fel-
low hilwin passed me carrying a bag now
it happened i had noticed him getting on
the boat because he is one of that kind of
guys you pay attention to somehow and
he didnt have a bag i didnt think any-
thing about it because i saw a bull eying
me pretty hard and with the stuff in my
clothes i had to make a quick getaway

   this fellow hilwin looked to me like
a regular jersey commuter probably haul-
ing down twenty or thirty a week in one
of the big buildings i didnt think any
more about him till last night when i slid
into the mastodon and who was sitting
alongside of me but him dressed up in a
suit of evening clothes

   i get talking to him sort of casual and
all at once it flashes over me that the bag
he carried off the ferry must have belonged
to the suicide and there might have been
something worth while in it

   so i says  what was in the bag 

   he almost fell out of his chair and by
the way he tried to cover up i knew id
struck something live

   he admitted though he pinched the
suicides bag and said there was nothing
in it but some dirty clothes but here he
was living at the mastodon spending right
and left and where did he get it
nothing but money



  just then a lot of society folks came
along and knew him old college chum
stuff they took him away with them to be
gone all night dinner theater supper

   just as a matter of precaution though
i didnt expect to find anything i waited
a couple of hours and slipped into his room
i opened a trunk and found a bag in it i
opened the bag and its chock-a-block full
of bank notes

   if id beaten it right away everything
would be all right but i couldnt walk out
of the hotel with a bag without questions
so i figured on counting the cash and tuck-
ing it away all over me im about up to
a hundred thousand when in blows hilwin
like a boob id forgot to lock the door
 boob is putting it mild complimented
hansen

   i cover him with my little automatic
but theres a lot i want to know about the
money and all of a sudden he kicks the
gun out of my hand busting the hand

   ought to have busted your head pick-
ing pockets is about your limit moriaty
so its just as well you turned over this deal
to me

   all right i know i pulled a bone but
dont rub it in what can we do now

   find out who the money belongs to
once we know we can shake this feller
down

   but supposing we cant find out
you dont suppose a couple of hundred
thousand is kicking around without an own-
er this man who jumped off the boat stole
the money from somebody if he was hon-
est and it belonged to him he wouldnt have
jumped would he would you commit sui-
cide with a quarter of a million unspent in
your traveling bag course not

   this crook just lost his nerve that
proves he was an amateur most probably
some bank cashier you say it was in
small bills

   twenties nearly all of it

   hard to trace he wasnt such a sap
when he started this remorse is hell
answer the phone will you

  moriaty obediently picked up the tele-
phone  wants you

  flansen reached for it  that you ser-
gean t  wh at luck 

  he listened for a couple of minutes to
a recital of crimes from the other end

   thank you sergeant youll hear
from me soon

   nothing resembling this reported from
anywhere theres been time enough too
if this fellow hilwin has been sporting
round for three or four days its kind of
queer

   whats to be done

   get a line on hilwin find out what
he did before he grabbed the bag find out
where he worked and where he lived learn
what story he told to explain the change in
his condition be very careful though not
to tip anyone off about him we dont
want anybody butting in on this case but
us

   hunting for a needle in a haystack try-
ing to trace a guy in new york

   you poor fish hes probably in the
city directory if hes been working in
new york a year hes there and if he
isnt youll find him in the jersey city di-
rectory if there are a dozen harry hil-
wins look them all up

   supposing you do find out all about
him what good will it do

  hansen lost his patience go do what
i tell you and dont bother me with ques-
tions i know what im about

   oh all right grumbled moriaty pick-
ing up his hat  ill see you this afternoon
and spill what i get

  after he had gone hansen called up the
sun detective agency and getting his con-
nection talked with the manager

   that you jim i want a good smooth
operator put on the trail of harry hilwin
hotel mastodon no he aint done any-
thing but a friend of mines jealous of his
wife and wants to know what this fellows
doing all the time dont do anything but
keep tabs on him i want to know who he
sees and what he does every hour of the
twenty-four all right put two operators
on him if you have to but dont fall down
on it	i

  after he had hung up mr hansen
opened a box of cigars picked a good one
bit off the end spat it out viciously lit up
and leaned back in his chair with an air of
complete satisfaction


argqsy-allstory weekly

  blissfully unaware that a couple of pri-
vate detectives were devoting their working
hours to him harry hilwin puffed peace-
fully upon an expensive cigar and waited for
ruth she came a sweet and demure vi-
sion in a gray costume and so different was
she from the befurred and befluffed damsel
of the night before that she had to smile at
him to be recognized

   i had the hardest time getting here
three of the girls tried to pull me to the
plaza with them and a man friend of mine
overtook me on the avenue in his car and
put up the most persistent argument that
i should go for a ride with him

  im flattered

   youd better be lets get our tea im
growing to be a regular english girl with
my tea at four oclock its funny how
you get into a habit isnt it

   i hope youll get the habit of having
tea with me

   how well you work said ruth with
mock admiration chattering thus they
passed into the tea room figuring they
were safe for an hour the dark foreign-
looking man went away on a little business

   how is it you have time to take girls
to tea in the afternoon arent you in busi-
ness she demanded when they had set-
tled themselves comfortably

   why-er im not doing anything just
at present harry explained in some em-
barrassment  ive got a couple of deals
on that may keep me pretty busy soon but
i hope i can always find time to do things
with you

   what is your business when you are
working at it she asked with true female
inquisitiveness

   im what you might call a promoter

i	sort of give things a push and get them
going he was thinking of his play ven-
ture of the early afternoon

  you must come to the house and meet
father he is the dearest thing lets me
do anything i like never interferes but
a regular playmate when i want him to be
harry thought of the cold sardonic ex-
acting old slave driver who had pitched him
out so unceremoniously and tried to fit him
into the picture painted by his daughter
but he couldnt it was too much

  the conversation became more intimate
ruth was obviously interested in hilwin
actually he was the first man who had se-
riously attracted her in her three seasons
of dinners and dances he felt her sweet-
ness and her charm and he did not try to
deceive himself that he was not rapidly fall-
ing in love with her under normal con-
ditions he would have let himself go

  but who could tell what was going to
happen to him in the next few weeks or
months if he should meet her father how
quickly the old man would send him about
his business if he did not advise the police
to find out where he got the money he was
spending while ruth was deciding to
herself that she would see a lot of hilwin
he was endeavoring to steel himself against
ever seeing her again with the result that
he agreed to join a group for dinner and
theater next night he to call for her at
her home and thats the way they left
things

  the foreign-looking operator had been
back at his post for an hour before harry
brought ruth out and placed her in a taxi-
cab jake bill and millie had been wait-
ing for him for half an hour when he ar-
rived at the meeting place next day accom-
panied by a lawyer recommended to him by
bill cromwell all the way up in the taxi
the lawyer tom evans a friendly and in-
telligent young chap had been trying to
dissuade harry from the theatrical venture
if he had been able to listen in on the con-
versation in jakes office before their ar-
rival he would have tried harder

   its this way jake was explaining
 after i left your flat millie i got to fig-
uring out that wed better get the best script
and best score we could find for this show
since we have a chance to clean up our-
selves on it now this  queen of my
heart  is a bunch of junk and the score
aint so good bill played it over so we
hunted around and found a piece thats a
lot better

   you aint even going to give the poor
gink the show he bought scoffed millie

   were going to give ourselves a run for
our money this fellow who wrote  queen
of my heart  wanted regular royalties but
we found an author whod take half the
nothing but money



usual give us the other half and waive his
royalties entirely for four weeks

   what good is that if the show is rot-
ten

   it aint so rotten offered bill  scores
better than the other one book needs a
little jazzing but we can do it

   and the leading role how about that
   oh its yours kid dont worry

  the conversation was interrupted by the
arrival of the angel as harry had not
heard the name of the piece he had pur-
chased the day before he was quite unaware
of the shift and his lawyer who was pre-
pared for ordinary traps did not dream that
his principal was so utterly careless as not
to know what he had bought

  accordingly the contracts were quickly
drawn providing that one-half interest in
a musical comedy called  lovely laura 
was sold to henry hilwin for  by
jacob rubenstein who bound himself to
produce the piece do whatever other financ-
ing might be necessary and draw no salary
for his labor

  from a legal standpoint the contract was
fair enough jake knew of a lot of ways
of getting around it but for once that gen-
tleman felt inclined to be reasonably on the
level harry was luckier than he realized
in that respect

  when the papers had been signed millie
hastened to appropriate the angel  lets
go have tea dear and we can talk about
the play

   dont want to talk about it replied
hilwin  mr rubenstein how long will it
take you to produce this

   oh about two or three weeks to cast
it five weeks rehearsals and open in new
york after two or three nights out of town
to knock it into shape

   it will be two months before you can
open

   dont see how it can be done any
quicker

   well dont delay any more than is nec-
essary

   whats your hurry dear demanded
millie playfully squeezing his hand as it
lay on the table

    oh just anxious to see whats going to
happen

  inwardly he was saying  two months
where will i be in two months and will
they let me out of jail to see the first per-
formance

   dinner to-night asked millie ten-
derly

   sorry but ive got a dinner and theater
engagement

   to-morrow night

   maybe ill call you up

chapter v

a difficult bird to handle

ttthen hilwin had departed with his
yy lawyer jake looked after him and
shook his head in perplexity

   he beats me this cash is the best in
the world but whats he trying to get out
of it makes you the prima donna and
ducks dates with you trusts me with the
whole sheebang and dont even want to
watch me work aint heard the words
and music yet and dont seem to want to
well all i hope is we get the show on be-
fore the lunatic asylum finds out he got
away

   if he escaped from an asylum hes the
best heeled lunatic i ever heard of com-
mented bill  i think hes deeper than we
suspect watch your step jake

   im in this thing to hand broadway a
wow ill think about gypping him out of
his share if its a hit maybe though i al-
ways said if a guy was square with me id
be square with him

   huh grunted millie if he makes
an honest man out of you hell do more
than the lord did

  millie had two sides to her a bitter cyn-
ical one developed by her tenement house
origin and her experiences in vaudeville and
musical comedy and a society veneer
which went well with strangers

  howlands lawyer had been much im-
pressed by her

   some girl that miss duroy she seems
quite taken with you he remarked to hil-
win  if she ever asked me to make a
date with her i wouldnt turn her down
you can bet

   pooh sniffed harry  shes just be-


argosy-allstory weekly

ing nice to me because im buying in on
the show and shes to be leading woman
she doesnt fool me

   somebodys fooling you or you
wouldnt be in it at all

   nobodys fooling me said harry a
little testily  you must admit that a lot
of money is made in the show business
 yes by those who know

   not always lots of boobs like my-
self have bought in on pieces put on by pro-
fessional showmen and made a lot out of
it i know im taking a chance but no
more than in any other business

  you think so i know how you could
have invested that  and made a sure
profit of five or ten thousand in a very
short time the odds are ten to one against
you ever getting anything out of  lovely
laura 

 whats in a name quoted hilwin air-
ily  but look here evans whats your
proposition ive got some more money
evans looked at him in amazement
 are you serious

   sure

   well ill tell you next door to me is
a real estate concern and you know the
money that is made in real estate

   i dont but go on

   these fellows brown and harlow
have taken a tract of land about twenty-
five miles out and are developing it for
homesteads easy commuting distance
good service its a country village that
has been jumped by the real estaters up to
this time but its all right ive bought
a lot myself got a girl picked out and
pretty soon im going to build a little home
out there

   the lots are going like hot cakes the
idea is to buy a dozen of them and hold
them for a rise if i had the money id

do it

   sounds all right agreed hilwin
 how do you see this place

   eskdale on the hudson take a train
from grand central three-quarters of
an hour out harlow homesteads is what
they call the place

   ill go look at them to-morrow said
hilwin as the taxi stopped at the lawyers
building  thanks for the tip

  evans looked after the retreating taxi
with much the same perplexity which rub-
enstein had displayed

   how a fellow who does business like
that got his money in the first place gets
me he said to himself  must have
found it

  he was right but he didnt know it

  it was with considerable trepidation that
harry climbed the steps of the big house
in the east sixties early that evening and
asked for miss simpson he had been wor-
ried all day about a possible meeting with
his ex-employer and he had been on the
point of phoning that he could not keep his
appointment he knew however that if he
broke an appointment with ruth at this
stage of the game he would probably not
get another and he didnt quite see how
he could get along without frequent meet-
ings

   this way sir said the butler  miss
ruth will be right down and she wants you
to wait in the library

  hilwin walked briskly into a richly fur-
nished room and came face to face with old
man simpson

to be concluded next week

david had cast off his wide brimmed
hat so that the moonlight which
streamed upon him took from his
face the golden brown tint that covered but
did not hide the red flush of his cheeks
now his face was shining in a silver glow
and his smooth cheeks his curved lips his
curling black hair gave him the aspect of
shining boyhood but it was a boy whose
dark eyes burned with an intolerable spirit

and it was his eyes rather than the gun
in his hand that held the men transfixed

clear in the night and the cattlemen wrho
heard it found that it possessed the same
intangible quality of his eyes there was a
magic in them both  stick up yotir

not seem that they defied him it appeared
rather as though they were held motionless
by his gaze and silenced by his voice

over to the barebacked pony and its
wretched burden he continued to face the
men as he did so and they turned fasci-
nated following his movement reaching
the drooping steed he drew from his hip
pocket a knife and with his teeth opened it
but his eyes never left the men before
him they flashed like questing fires over
the many faces and not one of the men
who yielded to their spell could have ex-
plained what held him motionless

  the knife opened david shifted so that
the hand which held the knife was close to
the pony then that hand ascended fol-
lowing preests dangling leg finding his
thigh his waist moving about the waist to
the prisoners hands

   drop that knife it was the harsh
voice of dasent

  david looked at him his boys face
seemed to betray neither surprise resent-
ment nor disquietude but his eyes still
burned

   no he said  preest aint goin to
hang to-night

  dasent glared across at him trying to
match those eyes with his gross fury

  drop it quick kid he warned
 yore up against twenty guns

   not if i was up agin a hundred

  the knife had found its goal and the
steel was cutting now at the twisted hemp

   if you cut that rope its the last thing
you do yelled dasent  if you was the
old man himself - you couldnt stop this
party 

   its all off the boys voice rang out
in a sudden burst of purpose it struck
the air with the lilt of a passionate spirit
and seemed to sweep across the barren
land with a sound of prophecy  you
cant stop me now

  but his eyes had been long centered upon
the livid face of dasent and he failed to
see the quick movement of the swarthy
cow-puncher nearest his elbow that
movement was a leap forward and a
lithe kick and with a cry of pain the boy
saw his fathers gun sail through the air
while the hand that held it went numb
with pain

  instantly a dozen hands fell to as many
guns and the group of men closed in but

to their amazement the boy stood fast
with a lightning exertion of strength he
cut through the cords which held preest
bound and threw the knife with a trium-
phant gesture on the ground

   stand back he commanded  an
listen to what i got to say without
comprehending the unleashed spirit that
had so long lain suppressed in the soul of
the boy they instinctively obeyed it

  you got me covered cried david
 you can shoot me to pieces blow orf my
head but it dont signify i say preest
aint goin to hang to-night

   you dasent you aint the law and
my father he aint the law ive cut preest
free if you want to hang him then shoot
you can only do it after im dead here in
front of him

  talk down kid-hes a hawse thief
one man called out but he spoke rather in
pity than in protest

   then theres a law to deal with him
stand back

  the boy blanched beneath his sun
browned skin as dasent moved forward
but this pallor made his face shine with a
more silver glow

   if you aint out o there damn quick
growled the man  well shoot preest
dead

  the boy looked desperately about him

   i cant help that he declared but
you got to account for him to me and
with a sudden movement he dived for his
fathers gun

  as he did so the swarthy cow-puncher
whipped up his gun and fired at the cring-
ing preest but the bullet missed wide for
preceding the explosion of that cartridge by
so fine a margin as to blend its din with
the same reverberation another gun was
fired and the swarthy cow-puncher stag-
gered back clutching a shattered arm

  from behind the cypress tree aleck shef-
field stepped forth and two guns glistened
in his hands

   stick up yore hands cowboys  he said
sharply and this time no sense of mysti-
cism or amazement held the old mans
committee still they yielded instantly
to the practical menace of those twin muz-
zles and the incisive promise of that voice

                          	a

   now hold em up an lets see you
drop them guns quoth aleck blithely
he paused until he was sure he had been
obeyed then  the kid heres ridin herd
on preest fer a spell he said  an i want
he should ride away without no more
shootin

  he turned on david with apparent care-
lessness  just take yore man and pick
him out a hawse he advised  then ride
like hell to a place you an me know of
he seemed to ignore the others while he
made sure that the boy understood him
but no man dropped his hands

   david still holding his fathers gun still
silver white from the peril that was past
gazed on his friend doubtfully

   no more gun-play aleck he said
 just justice is all thats worth dyin for
he took the bridle of the pony on which
preest sat and started to lead it from the
hill

  justice dasent burst forth with an
ugly laugh  fine talk to give to yore
fathers hired gunman

  davie swung about

   if theres been a parmelee on this
range thats been blind to what justice
means he cried  you can know now
dasent that theres a parmelee here thats
goin to protect it

  his clear boyish voice was all alive
again and dasent felt an irrational discom-
fort before the gaze which pierced him
 an aleck sheffields my friend added
david proudly

   then yore dad  have ter get another
bodyguard sneered dasent and david
remembering the respect which each man
had paid to alecks gun realized for the
first time why his friend had so constantly
remained at his fathers side he turned
to aleck with a new light in his eyes but
that gentle humorist was intent upon the
group before him

   s long dave he drawled  best
light out an let these gents relax their
arms jud dasent there hes already get-
tin loosed up conversationally

   no gun-play david spoke very
crisply

   none of my startin aleck assured
him and he stood there humorously ad-

    	a

juring his prisoners for long after david
and his hostage had departed

  when he considered that time enough
had elapsed to give david ample safety
he lightly slipped his guns into their sep-
arate holsters

   its been a nice evenin boys he
remarked pleasantly but i got to go
ridin you-all had best stay here a spell
cause i shore like to ride alone moonlight
nights like this

  his voice mysteriously lost its pleasantry
without seeming to change its tone  the
first gent that comes in sight of me the next
half hour he said  is shore unfortunate
and weary of this life

  and backing away from them he turned
quickly at the hilltop and was in the saddle
and away before the first man reached for
his discarded weapon they did not follow
him

chapter ix

the bitter bitter sentence

when healey the cook and chung
lee who endured life as his ap-
prentice found old man parmelee
on his hands and knees in the doorway of
his bedroom they lit a lamp there and
would have carried him to the bed but
parmelee balanced himself on his two feet
and stated that he was about to dress
himself and deal with the events of the
night in person healey fearing delirium
or stark madness protested stoutly but the
old man had his way

  something had happened to him there in
the darkness he couldnt understand what
physical aberration could have turned the
world black and taken away his mind for
that intolerable moment but he convinced
himself that it could be nothing serious
and proved his triumph over it by standing
erect while his body cried out for bed and
donning his clothes while a nameless fear
obsessed his unconscious mind for a
strange elation possessed him his heart
was full to bursting with the satisfaction
that surged in with the realization that
david had accepted his challenge

fully dressed he rocked unceasingly in


argosy-allstory weekly

the chair before the fireplace and clenched
his teeth tightly so that the tumultuous
emotion in his heart would not spill out in
soliloquy there was no doubt in his mind
as he recalled the boys furtive visit to his
room and the purloined gun that david
had sallied forth to deputize for him in the
hanging of harper preest and he rocked
his stricken body in impatience as he waited
for news of that event

  in spite of the stroke that had befallen him
in the darkness in spite of a sickness which
filled him with that subtle inadmissible un-
easiness for the future he was upheld by
the elation he felt in the knowledge that
david had pledged himself to the life of
what bartholomew parmelee conceived to
be a man so when dasent and his frus-
trated cortege came cantering to the ranch
in the pallid morning they found him gray
faced and gaunt in his chair but they
found as well that his face was illumined
with a smile

  he almost arose in his eagerness as
dasent and tansey entered the ranch
house with their resentment bubbling at
their lips

   where is he old man parmelees
voice was exuberant in anticipation
 wheres the boy he demanded it
appeared almost as if he were ready to take
his son into his arms

  dasent stared at him amazed

  rode all to hell he snapped  an
preest with him whats yore game any-
way

  it was interesting to see the effect of that
speech upon old parmelee it was interest-
ing to see how his eyes narrowed how his
teeth set and the muscles of his face tight-
ened bulging under the skin of reddish
gray it was an exhibition of perfect con-
trol for the mans iron nerve had well-
nigh snapped under this brutal revelation
that his dream was dust that something
had gone wrong

   talk sense he rasped coldly  where
is david

  dasent examined the autocrat in per-
plexity his amber black flecked eyes
smoldered upon the old man they seemed
to be always watching as the eyes of a
leopard watch the trainer treacherous

eyes they were and now they were clouded
with perplexity

   how shd i know he protested  he
rode in all burnin up with crazy ambition
he stuck up the party an took preest away
with him

   i dont believe it said parmelee

   he stuck us up  tansey loudly flew
to the aid of his companion

  old man parmelee gazed from one to the
other of them savagely

   yore lyin to me dasent he gritted
 yore workin between you to throw me
down ant yore fools enough to think you
can do it now tell me the truth of this
business without any of yore lies an yore
sneakin his voice whipped the air like
a lash  did harper preest get away from
you he demanded

  the kid stampeded the party whined
dasent doggedly

  parmelee moved in his chair like an ani-
mal in the confines of a cage too small it
was as though he were bound and strained
at his bends

  tell me whats true he demanded

   ive told you dasent flung the words
out angrily  we had it all fixed to swing
him orf the kid comes in and throws a
gun on us- he paused uneasily  did
you send him he asked suddenly

   likely id send him  snarled the old
man  yore crazy or its the kid he
never threw a gun in his life

but he did he stuck up the whole
party and by god if you want the truth
we damn near shot him full o daylight
a dull flush rose under the old mans
skin

  the kid did that he cried out in a
terrible voice so that the two men started
and were discomposed  my son david
he stopped the hangin

  dasent nodded  he took preest orf
with him he replied

   and where was you what was you-
all doin you mean to say you let a yellow
lxvered kid take preest out o yore hands
like that

  dasent frowned  i told you how it
was we took the gun orf the kid and had
him crawlin but aleck sheffield horned in
an covered their get-away

   an preest got away it was an ex-
clamation full of bitterness suddenly par-
melee straightened convulsively in his
chair  get em he roared with extraor-
dinary passion  bring in that boy to me
an ill snake whip him ill thrash the hide
orf his body at that moment aleck
sheffield entered the room and the old man
sprang to his feet and stood quivering to
greet his bodyguard  where is he he
screamed  tell me that

  aleck gazed upon him with a frown

   yo-all re takin big chances bart
raisin up thataway he drawled  best
sit yoself back an dont get all stam-
peded

  glaring at him with unquenchable sus-
picion parmelee relaxed into his chair
again

  sheffield turned his attention to the oth-
ers  all fixed up pretty he said gently

  parmelee broke in upon him snarling
with rage his voice harsh with menace
you double-crossed me

   i stood by dave aleck corrected him

   stood by a yellow kid who didnt even
have the guts to see through his spite on
his own father the old man charged vin-
dictively

  alecks eyes flashed keenly over the two
informers then turned warm with enthu-
siasm on old man parmelee

   if youd seen him youd talk differ-
ent he explained softly

  yes id talk with a rawhide whip
spat forth parmelee  thats how id talk
to him dont lie for him aleck i know
how he went in spite to humiliate me an
how he backed down an cringed when he
found men to deal with oh god what a
thing to have for a son a dishrag

   which yore ridin the wrong pony
every time quoth aleck  dave he didnt
cringe none at that party less its cringin
when a man holds back a locoed catamount
with nothin to fight with but his eyes an
his everlastin grit he flung his words
directly in dasents face  jud dasent
here bein the catamount he finished
easily

   you- dasents resentful voice
trailed off into silence as aleck hand on
hip smiled genially upon him

  parmelee gazed about upon them all un-
easily in his heart was arising then the
first sense of panic he had ever felt his
body was urgently insisting to his mind
that he was old old and that his hold
upon these men was no longer strong he
was surrounded by wolves whom he had
broken to the traces and uneasily it was
in his mind that they did not respond as
usual to the crack of his whip

   what is it aleck he cried with sud-
den petulance  for gods sake whats
got into the boy you know him you
been with him more than any other is he
mad what is it

  aleck gazed down upon him seriously

   its something you aint never known
about bart he answered  youve run
this range like a top rider runs a rodeo
you treat men the same like they was ani-
mals you break the bad ones and those
you cant break you kill

   well this kid of yours is the first man
youve met that aint in no degree an ani-
mal hes a man all through and you
god help you dont know it you call him
a woman when he shrinks from the wran-
glin fightin herd you talk yore sneerin
insults to him when he puts in his voice
against gun-play

   but its justice hes got in his mind
its a clear high-up spirit hes got in his
heart thats so far above the mind of you
an me that we cant rightly understand
it but you you talk of whippin him
for it you talk of breakin him like a
beast to run with the rest of the herd
shucks

   can a man who would take that treat-
ment do what he did to-night i tell you
he walked into that slather of man-killin
cow-punchers like a young god walks in
amongst lions he carried yore gun in his
hand but did he use it no i tell you
he didnt ever have any intentions of usin
it

   no what then did he pack it for
dasents thin voice cut into alecks recital
with a sneer

  ill tell you why he packed it cried
aleck turning upon him  he told me
as we rode together into a place we know
of he packed that gun so that you would


argosy-allstory weekly

not jeel you was up against a man without
defense he said that if you hung preest
it would be over his dead body and if youd
shot him down his gun would never have
answered back

  parmelee glared up at the speaker with-
out any sign of sympathy when he spoke
his words had the effect of a detached cu-
riosity his harsh voice held no note of
compromise

  c he didnt crawl he asked

  he faced that pack of coyotes with
more nerve than ever i seen in my life
alecks voice fell deep with the warmth of
his feeling  an im here to say that
nerve aint the word that kid stood there
on the hill with the light of an angel in his
eyes he held em back by a spirit you
an me cant know of an by god id have
shot down my own brother himself if hed
tried to hurt him then  his voice fell into
a quieter vein

   i was standin by the tree bart an
watchin close because on the ride over
id found out that i was backin that kid
before you or myself or the whole tarna-
tion world an when buck saunders threw
up his gun i shot it out of his hand
because after seein the kid make his stand
there on the hill id of shot to protect him
if id never seen hair nor hide of him be-
fore

   that kid of yores is a man clean
through an hes a higher kind of man than
you or me or this whole range has ever
seen if he wants to stay out in the chap-
paral all his days im with him if he
wants to hold preest against you or the
whole united states army my guns behind
him

   an if you got half the heart an soul
in you that shines out o his two eyes you
will be with him too an whats more
youll thank the everlastin god that hes a
son of yores

  old man parmelee had listened to this
mans deep restrained voice without abat-
ing the cold glitter of his eyes it was his
custom to keep all his argument and reason
in his mind when he spoke it was only to
voice his conclusions and he voiced them
now

   that boy he rasped  has taken out

  of my hands the power that god has given
me hes thrown my own words back into
my face an spited an humiliated me an
now hes won over my best man you say
that yore takin his side agenst me all
right

   go out an tell him that i got a rawhide
whip next my chair in the daytime an
hangin over my bed at night when he
wants to come back here im goin to take
that whip and flay the hide orf him

  the iron unwavering monotone of his
voice gave his words the ominous signifi-
cance of an immutable sentence aleck
sensing this looked down on him with a
quality of pity in his eyes that caused
old man parmelee to grit his teeth in re-
sentment

  u ill tell him that yore doin as wrdl as
could be expected said aleck dryly and
he turned to dasent and tansey  i dont
want no company he warned them suc-
cinctly and without further words he strode
from the room

  the old man sat silent and the others
made no sound as they listened to the noise
of the hoofbeats which followed alecks de-
parture the silence was broken by par-
melee he clapped his hands down upon the
arms of his chair so that they made a
sudden sharp noise in the stillness of the
room

  get out and after them he shouted
with a furious impetuosity  get them
get preest if you have to ride to hell for
him an dont let nothin stand in yore
way

  dasent sprang to his feet he had been
watching the old man narrowly throughout
this strange exchange of violent emotions
and now as he spoke he seemed inspired by
some subtle demon

   you want them he cried feverishly
 you want them even if we have to
fight

   i want harper preest if you have to
kill orf a hundred men to get him old
parmelee roared  get him thats all

   dead or alive demanded dasent and
he appeared to hang some mad significance
upon his question

  old man parmelee glared up at him as
if himself on the verge of madness  dead

  or alive he shrieked and he settled him-
self back in his chair to grin crookedly as
he heard them go

the bloodhound bays

dasent took the trail as a hound
takes to the scent and like the bay-
ing of a hound his voice sounded a
boisterous accompaniment to the chase
snuff tansey had never known the dour
cattleman to give such loose rein to his
tongue and dasent himself knew that the
hot words which sprung from his lips were
the voice of a passion over which he was
fast losing all control

   sheffield will take us to him he cried
out as they urged their tireless ponies
through the darkness  taint likely he
got far n we got to follow him follow
he swore luridly with a laugh that was in
itself a curse  like huntin down a lobo
he growled and rode for a moment in si-
lence

   shucks jud tansey protested stout-
ly  aint no manner o sense in ridin
thisaway its old man parmelees dirty
work no hurry

  dasent replied with a burst of resentful
protest that seemed to be addressed rather
to the air and the spangled sky than to the
man beside him

  l into the rough country thats how
theyll ride he snapped  into the foot-
hills theres a bunch of settlers out
there up under the mountains hell he
exploded with sudden irony  one flash
of aleck sheffields gun an theyd give
everything they got that hombres good
fer board an lodgin anywhere on the range
without anybody takin contracts to adver-
tise it thats where we got to git to
up under the pajaritos but to-night
now obviously he was putting to him-
self an urgent question

   right now it would be nice for to hit
the straw grumbled tansey but dasent
ignored him he seemed driven even as he
drove his tired pony

   he wouldnt try fer the hills now he
declared  the kids close to the home

  ranch tansey hes close-hes near
sheffield seen him before he come to the
ranch we got to trail sheffield an he
aint hittin no mountain trails its shef-
field we got to cover hell lead us to em
hell take us to the kid

  his eyes roamed over the gray horizon
feverishly his face twitched but tansey
was not convinced

   lots o time to-day we sleep-shef-
field will preest he wont be able to wig-
gle well round him up poco tiempo
but the devil was in dasent that night
a devil which snuff tansey was at loss to
account for as he was puzzled at the terri-
ble parody of a smile that dasent now
turned upon him he accompanied it with
a voice low and choked with that devilish
fervor

   he said  dead or alive  he snarled
 you heard him you was there  dead
or alive thats what the old man said
 but we aint his cattle-we aint his
dogs he dont own us to make us work
without sleep for him tansey was
whipped into protest  let him wait
dasent seemed to let the others words
smolder in his mind

   you go back to the creek snuff he
ordered suddenly  git yore sleep an let
the boys git theirs he drew rein and
tansey pulled up beside him

   thats sense approved tansey

   go on ordered dasent  me im
ridin lines on em you be ready with the
boys to ride by noon

  he watched tansey canter away into
the mist which preceded sunrise then
turning his pony he set out upon the quest
which appeared to possess him like some
evil spirit of medieval lore he rode fast
and far and before the sun wras high he
had visited five different ranches which he
suspected might shelter his quarry

  with reckless disregard for what peril
must have threatened him if he had run
his men to earth he rattled doorways at
midnight and hailed astonished ranchers
to their windows but he didnt find his
men when he arrived at the abandoned
ranch at bitter creek his pony was done
and he himself bore the pallor of a fatigue
which surpassed weariness while the devil


argosy-allstory weekly

that showed in his eyes drew his ashen face
to a dreadful tensity and upheld him
against the poisons of exhaustion which
weighed his body down

  he left his pony to droop in the shade
of the cypress tree and charged into the
bunk house to awaken the tired men with
a voice that was high pitched and strained
to the verge of cracking

  a strange scene followed as several of
the number set about preparing a meal in
the kitchen of the ranch house which al-
though long abandoned as a habitation
had been often used for the ranch work
of which old parmelee made it occasionally
the headquarters it had become as a
matter of fact an outpost of the old mans
dominion and the cow-punchers of his out-
fit were as familiar with it as with the
buildings of their home ranch they bus-
tled about now occupied with their do-
mestic duties blithely unconscious of the
incongruous spectacle which they pro-
vided

  they were a motley crew and composed
as many different types of manhood as any
group of its size in any part of the world
would possess but this much they had in
common a sun tanned leanness of counte-
nance and an awkward twist of the legs
which severally had been bestowed by the
hot sun and an undeviating devotion to the
saddle also while each countenance might
differ each countenance was rough in that
sense of the word which denotes an excess
of masculinity untempered by a womans
influence and unsoftened by solicitude for
feminine regard the group that filled the
ranch house had the barbarous aspect of a
pirate crew-and like a pirate crew they
placed upon the life of a man no value
save that which the man himself imposed

  while the rude breakfast was prepared
dasent sat silent or silently strode like a
nervous cat about the room rolling and
smoking innumerable cigarettes his dark
eyes glittering from the hollows of fatigue
and his haggard face bore out grotesquely
his likeness to some beast of prey waiting
for the bars to fall which caged him from
the hunt he met their questions with
monosyllables of protest and they revealed
another characteristic of their kind when

they resigned themselves to patience with
good humor

  they ignored him as they bustled un-
handily about their absurd housework and
when all present fell to the wretched fare
upon the rough board table few words
were spoken the unclean coffeepot had
been drained to the dregs and the last
canned bean devoured when dasent inter-
rupted the coarse pleasantries that passed
across the board with a terse disclosure of
his purpose

   theyre hidin out he announced ab-
ruptly

  we still out to get em asked one

  dasent glowered at the man for a second
and then answered with a ferocity that
brought their eyes upon him in a narrow
appraising gaze

   we herd them in if it takes a year
he snapped

  you didnt get no whiff of his trail
last night tansey was scarcely less
weary than his leader

   i tell yer hes hidin out i want you
punchers should git out to the hills and
comb them like you was lookin fer ticks
you an me snuff were ridin the range
i dont want to think them hombres is
siltin easy in any ranch around

  he sat with his elbows on the table and
glowered moodily into the distances which
the walls seemed to open to his gaze  we
will root em out if theyre dug in as deep
as hell he cried suddenly and then
lapsed into a silence that had the singular
effect of seeming as sudden as his speech
the rest were silent too

  then one pushed back his chair and the
others excepting tansey followed the
sun was now high gleaming ruthlessly on
the rock littered country without and the
men turned to that sun baked exterior with
an apparent reluctance as if they were
unaccustomed to facing the rigors of the
heat in their work of every- day as they
grouped in the doorway dasent suddenly
leaped to his feet and hurled a storm of
words upon them

  dead or alive he cried in his high
strained voice  thats what the old man
said yore to bring them in dead or alive
and there aint to be no foolin that  let
valor



happen what happened last night ef there
is resistance shoot em down ef preest
dont come shoot him an shoot quick
likewise dont fool with aleck sheffield
shoot on sight an- he caught his
breath suddenly gulping the boy
his voice cracked  if the boy throws
talk shoot him hes got to come back
dead or alive

  the men in the doorway regarded him
gravely he stood leaning over the table
glaring back at them

   thats what the old man wants he
gritted and save for a brief pause for as-
surance they accepted that command
without a word

   there wont be no foolin said merle
sandies as they trooped out through the
door and his words were a tribute to the
far-reaching power of old man parmelee
 meet here tonight

   shore fer supper

  when the door had closed behind them
dasent sank down into his chair his
mouth was twisted into a queer complacent
grin but there were beads of perspiration
on his forehead tansey addressed him
with labored carefulness speaking slowly

   seems like yore takin considerable
chances jud takin the old man up thata-
way theyre all primed to shoot daylight
out of these fugitives

  dasent grinned with more assurance

   the old man said it he repeated

   but theres the kid

   shore 

 it wouldnt be so good if he got shot
 an why not isnt that what the old
man said dead or alive he said an
that meant the kid inclusive again the
queer cracked note came into his voice

   an if that aint what he meant hes
got hisself to blame he cried  you said
we aint his dogs nor hawses but thats
how he treats a man all right hes got
hisself to blame aint he if we take his or-
ders straight

  revelation dawned in the mind of tan-
sey and incredulously he acknowledged it

  my godfrey jud he cried yore
lookin fer the inside of hell

   im lookin to even things up with old
man parmelee asserted dasent

  tansey looked at him curiously he was
listening to a voice which resounded in his
memory the voice of harper preest  two
skunks cant play without fightin the
man had cried and he had added some-
thing about the teeth of old parmelee in
dasents throat

   no chance  he warned

  dasent grinned

   its a chance in a hundred there
aint nobody on this range but knows how
the old mans dealt with me this ranch
was mine this house i built myself an
hauled the lumber through the sun in a hell
of work an sweatin

   he took it-the range knows that he
took me over lock stock an barrel and
there aint nobody that aint sneered at the
way ive played in with him since doin
what he tells me playin the right bower
to his ace takin orders

  he grinned down upon tansey now with
a satisfaction that soothed his agitation and
made him to appear almost unctuous in his
complacency  the old man he aint
been one to sneer oh no not him
theres two kinds o men he brags to my
face one fights him an the other he
breaks me im broke he laughed
queerly

   broke to harness i am broke an all
reliable to do what he tells me to the last
gasp now wont it be sort of nice tan-
sey wont it be sort of high up an satis-

there were three of them in a cave
it had been a boys dream of pirates
and buccaneering that had led david
to that rocky canon eight years before and
it had been the everlasting undying spirit
of boyhood deeply rooted in his heart that
had caused aleck sheffield to follow the
youngster there and throw himself into the
pirate play while at the same time he had
manfully but good naturedly scoffed at the
intensity of the little fellows pretense

  the young man and the little boy had

played that pirate game in their wild cave
together with such earnestness of imagery
on the boys part and on the part of the
man such sympathy as the boy in him and
his loyal affection for david combined to
engender that they had quite failed to no-
tice the years pass by even now in that
place they could find the spirit of boyhood
and win it back again

  david stood in the entrance to the cave
and he was cut clean from foot to waistline
by the black shadow of the rocky wall be-
hind him on one side of him lay the dark
cool interior on the other jagged and shat-
tered walls of rock that crowded the floor
of the canon and made intricate corridors
of stone which baffled search in the
thousand years before david and aleck had
come there no horseman had ever entered
that mass of forbidding stone

  david had clambered down from the
canon rim on the day he first discovered it
his lithe body wriggling heroically from toe
hold to hand grasp on the jagged surfaces
in the many mysterious games which fol-
lowed he had come with aleck as smuggler
pirate macedonian conqueror or indian
scout and they had devised many shifts of
knotted ropes and flimsy ladders for the
descent to the fantastic depths it had
been years before they worked out a path-
way from the canons mouth through
which they might bring their ponies as a
hero of arabian nights adventure threaded
the mazes of far dreams

  and such was the gigantic litter of the
shattered granite through which that pass
ran such was the varied pattern of the
shadows which were cast and so brilliantly
deceptive were the patched colorings of the
rock that many horsemen might have
threaded that maze at once and cheated
the watcher from the canons rim of any
glimpse of a moving thing

   i told you that the pirates cave d
turn out useful david gloated as he stood
in the entrance

  aleck grinned remembering the good-
natured ridicule with which he had often
covered the protest his mans mind had
made against playin injun with a kid

   you win dave he admitted  they
wouldnt no more find us here than a tick

in a tub of axle grease not unless they
ride plumb over the edge then we eat
hawse meat fresh instead of out o cans
he was heating corned beef in a skillet over
a fire that burned against naked rock and
found vent for its smoke through a natural
crevice

  the third member o the party gazed
from an obscure comer of the cave with a
mixture of hunger and resignation

  u i aint kickin about the pirates com-
plained harper preest  but i shore wished
you left the centipedes out o this yere
cave

  jhe reclined upon an outspread tarpaulin
making no move to assist his saviors with
their housework and his attitude appeared
to be one of criticism his long and narrow
face turned on a neck of remarkable thin-
ness as he looked about the cave

  u are them hawses goin to be fed he
asked

  they had ignored his first complaint but
at this aleck while not acknowledging
preests presence in the tiny shelter gave
the matter consideration

   when you an me was in the smugglin
game dave he said  it was shore re-
grettable we didnt smuggle in some hay
them hawses will have to be fed in the
night

   an if we have to ride em to-day they
flop remarked preest sardonically

  david whose dark eyes had been watch-
ing alecks movements without a sign that
he had heard the remarks of either man
spoke with the reflective gentleness of a
boy eighteen years of age who is dreaming
dreams

   you know aleck he said  when you
spoke about the time we was smugglers or
pirates in this cave it sort of bobbled me
all up in my thinkih because when you
said that i was standin here lookin out
over the shadows on the rocks an-its
sort of funny-but i wasnt anything else
but just a kid agen an thats just what
you an me was doin-playin pirates to-
gether he peered into the cave of re-
flectively

   lord aleck he said  it dont seem
like theres any time gone since then it
dont seem like i was a man now an them
valor



games was all over an done with it
dont seem like that real enemies with real
guns might come down- from the canon top
an hunt us out in real earnest its a queer
thing aleck

  aleck for whom this was a trifle pro-
found endeavored to evade the issue

   everybody grows up dave he said

   shore it aint that but everybody
dont grow up to find things like they are
here on the range aleck everybody dont
grow up to see men fightin like rattlers
fight king snakes killin an murderin for
the meat they want an the power in other
places aleck i think there are kids grow
up to see men live together like you an me
an there must be places where when a
mans right he can lift up his head an say
so an dreams an games like ours aint
only things for kids to play at but the
right things that come into a boys head can
stay there an grow an be the things he
lives for in the friendship of all the men in
the world

  aleck turned from his cooking and look-
ing into the boys eyes saw the inevitable
fire there davids light serious voice went
on sounding a strange song in the cave

   it seems like that if that kid who used
to play with you aleck was another kid
not me but some other kid that i knew
an the high dreams he had was torn to
pieces in front of his eyes like these here
dreams have been why aleck i think id
want to fight for that kid id go to the
men who hurt him an id say  give this
kid back his dreams give this kid back
the things he knows are right you hurt
him an you bruise him like he was a dog
that had done you wrong-but he aint
hes only a kid who can see things right
an id fight for him aleck because id be
feared hed lose out and get to be like the
others

  his voice stopped and he stood sil-
houetted against the sunlight as if quite
contented that his words should bring no
answer aleck had turned back to his cook-
ing before the boys voice had finished but
preest had not missed a word

   thats damn foolishness he ordained
scornfully and aleck turned on him
passionately whereupon it developed that

he had turned back to his cooking because
his eyes were strangely dimmed

   shut up  he cried shortly  you
aint worth lickin his boots preest an
yore due to keep yore trap shut now
his last word served effectively to silence
the protest which arose to the lips of the
astonished man and aleck turned almost
apologetically to david

   dave he said  theres a stack of kids
in yore boots that wouldnt have only an
obituary to pronounce on them high-up
thoughts an dreams you speak of you
yore still up an fightin for em which i
want to say that me im fightinfor that
kid you spoke of too and he turned
quickly to his skillet

  when he considered the mess of canned
meat was sufficiently cooked he whisked it
from the fire and set it down steaming
upon a grocery box which occupied the cen-
ter of the floor then he took a number of
tin pie plates in his hand and dealt two
of them onto the rude table as if they were
cards dealt from the pack taking a third
in his hand he looked contemplatively upon
the recumbent form of preest

   you wanna eat he asked silkily

  preest tilted his narrow face upward
peering at him

   you go to grass he said amiably
 you talk o high-up loco aspirations an
such an then you plumb torture a man

   give him his dinner aleck pleaded
david sheffield protested

   now dave he urged  you know how
you said i was to have free say about this
he turned to preest  you know how the
deal stands he warned him  when you
come clean you get fed

   i told yer how it was i cant do no
fairer than that can i he cried

   likewise you told a tarnation lot o
lies quoth aleck  when i asked you
real gentle what the old man wanted yore
hide for you talked up all virtuous an un-
truthful now the kid here hes riskin his
neck fer you an i dont want he should
take no chances on a stacked deal when
you lay down yore cards all plain and regu-
lar tellin me just what old man parme-
lees got to hang you on then you eat

  preest stared at him closely fingering
with a lean hand at his belt which was loose
about his waist

   i told you he snapped obstinately

   you told me you was a shinin angel as
innocent as a new thrown calf i want the
truth drawled aleck

   a man cant starve whined preest

   thats my argument grinned aleck

   an if i tell the honestergod truth

   it depends

  preest appealed to the boy

   if i lifted a maverick it aint any
worsen what the old mans done he
pleaded david had to think that over he
regarded preest with a thoughtful frown
his earnest eyes dark in the diffusion of the
light that glared in the entrance behind
him

   then yo shore nuff been rustlin cat-
tle snapped aleck

   what then demanded preest

  aleck would have retorted with an an-
swer but davids quiet voice was quick be-
fore him

   i told my father he said  that if
youd been stealin cows there was a law to
take care of you thats why i did what i
did if you shore nuff been stealin cows
then we take you to the sheriff

  he spoke very quietly as a youthful
judge whose mind was immutably fixed
upon his judgment but the calm level
voice of the boy seemed to strike preest
like a lash suddenly white as death he
leaped to his feet and glared wildly about
the terror of a hunted animal upon him

  i knowed it he cried and the cave
echoed his despair  you turn me over
to the sheriff to westock another of
his hounds you turn me over to be hung
to justice cried david he sprang
to his feet his cheeks aflame with protest
 its to the law preest i dont aim to
punish you its just what the law says
wtanting words he turned to aleck appeal-
ingly  tell him aleck

   set down dave urged that gentle-
man  an eat yore food while its hot
you preest youd best take some food
too we know how you stand now

  preest stood rubbing his damp palms
upon his thighs

  id ruther starve than take chances
with westock he growled

   eat urged aleck  the kids playin
this game to save yore neck he turned to
david who was reluctantly seated on the
caves floor beside his plate  but you
give him over to westock dave an hell
hang shore as shootin he said

   westocks the sheriff protested
david

   theyll take him away from westock

   but thats-thats-

   no it aint not in this country
westock he wouldnt do no more than just
turn him over at the first sight of dasents
guns hes got his orders westock has

  david gazed for a moment upon his
friend gazed too at the wretched prisoner
they had saved from the hanging then
without a word he bent his round head to
the food before him and the three fell to
evting wtith that solemn discontent of men
who can find no words for thoughts which
rankle

  david first broke the silence after he
had polished off his plate and scraped the
skillett of all that his companions left he
arose to his feet and spoke with that quiet
determination which since the night before
appeared to have developed from an oc-
casional characteristic into an integral part
of the boys nature

   aleck he said  im goin home an
see dad

   no  aleck arose quick in protest he
remembered the old mans parting shot

   got to the boy voiced the conclu-
sion to which long thought had brought
him  this things got to be straightened
out

   but theyre huntin the country for
us aleck suddenly stepped to the boy
and took him by the arm he spoke as a
fond brother might speak to a younger
one bending his head a little to peer into
the boys eyes gripping his arm firmly as
if to steady him against the shock of words
 dave dave old kid i didnt tell you
all the truth about the old man dave
hes out to get preest dead or alive an fer
you dave hes out to take orf yore hide
with a rawhide whip

  david had need of that firm arm then
valor



his body leaped in the mans strong grasp
as the body of a colt leaps at the touch of
the branding iron his smooth cheek
blanched and having yielded to the shock
which wracked his body he stood rigid gaz-
ing with hurt eyes into those of his friend

   he-said-that a low unbelieving
voice that came out of the boys hurt soul

   thats what he said dave aleck
might have been a mother then soothing
her troubled child there was that infinite
tenderness in his voice that note of sym-
pathy which revealed that he too suffered

   then i must gol cried david  i
must go to him aleck i must

   you cant do nothin dave

  i can david exclaimed

   what can you do

   i can bring back that little dawg she
gave me  and without further speech
david disappeared into the maze of rocky
passages which led from the cave to the
place where their ponies were

  aleck stood stricken with amazement
the boys last cry had been so astoundingly
unexpected had revealed a hidden current
of thought in his mind of which aleck had
had no suspicion

   the little dawg he whispered to him-
self

   the kids loco growled preest

   shut up snapped davids friend

vanishing dividends

lank jim hendry had established
the monkey-wrench brand in the val-
ley of the pajaritos in a day when the
cow-punchers were all dark faced vaqueros
the horse herd a caballado and the limpid
patois of the mexican peon was the lan-
guage of the range so the monkey-wrench
outfit was among the oldest of the country

  young james hendry having inherited
that outfit took advantage of the prosperity
which lank jim his father had wrung
from it to play the cattle baron in the
stockyard district of a great city and leave
the sun-baked spaces of his native range for
what men he could employ to ride them
it had been several years since his last visit

to the range and now he had rolled out
of the east by roads of steel and in the
comfort of a soft cushioned motor car be-
cause the prosperity of his ranch had
seemed to wane

  he was a shrewd business man was jim
hendry and under the suave and polished
manner he had acquired in the disposal of
fat dividends was hidden an instinct that
brought him quickly to a personal investi-
gation of this the least of his enterprises
when the balance sheet sounded its alarm

  madge had accompanied him because
the west had appealed to her sense of the
romantic-and she had decided to come a
respect for the decisions of ones daughter
develops amazingly with the prosperity of
ones affairs so do her decisions

  they had been here six days now
hendry far too wise to  raise dust  as he
knew the ranch employes would expect him
to had spent that time in genially making
the acquaintance of his men studying the
country and sending many fears for his
intentions fast to sleep

  madge had learned what it is to ride the
ponies of the range in a huge stock saddle
and had further gone afield to fish in the
clear green waters of the rio felix and to
fetch from white oak the litter of puppies
which her favorite dog had sired she had
promised herself another adventure soon
for surely it was only right that she should
keep an eye on the puppy that had gone
to the boy on the trail frank the kennel
man would want to know about them all
it was a part of the business of owning
thoroughbred dogs

  where is dasent

  her father asked the question quite
amiably at the luncheon table and madge
listened for the reply she had heard that
name before lew brady whose appear-
ance was made remarkable by the fact that
he had hair the color of tow and no chin
whatever assumed his famous worried look
lew was a kitchen hand and chore boy at
the hendry ranch and he was often wor-
ried

   hes out on the range i reckon he
ventured

  hendry frowned

   i thought the men came in every night


argosy-allstory weekly

these days he said  dasent doesnt do
any line riding does he

   not a lot explained the youth  but
theres a sort of committee out right now
they want this harper preest thats been
rustlin cattle an such dasent hes in
charge

  wheres the sheriff

  lew betrayed a flutter of confusion but
overcame it manfully

   hes out too i reckon he said
hendry ate for a moment in silence he
meant to go slowly he divined the futility
of running counter to the customs of the
country and he was only vaguely aware ef
what those customs were

   when he comes in he said  tell him
i want to see him

   shore lem lolled back against the
sideboard and chinlessly watched them eat

   dasent said madge reflectively
 thats the man who  dont exactly work
for two men at once  she imitated
davids drawl very prettily

   what do you mean by that asked
her father with some amusement

   the boy i gave that puppy to ex-
plained madge  his father took over
dasents ranch and now this man dasent
does things for his father and works at this
ranch as well

  hendry thought that over factory espi-
onage had been to him an elementary means
of affecting the profits of his competitors
this appeared as if he had unearthed the
reason for the diminution of the profits of
his ranch

   who is this boy he demanded

   i dont know who is he mr brady
her request was laden with an ineffable
sweetness and lew not for the first time
was seduced by it

  must be old man parmelees david
he spilled forth

   old man parmelee hendry was try-
ing to recollect that name

   shore hes over twelve miles this side
of the bitter creek trail lew conscious
that he was babbling and yet helpless un-
der the mischievous eyes of his employers
daughter wobbled his lower jaw spasmodi-
cally  hes all right he added weakly
 i want you to go and tell grey that im

going over the books this afternoon said
hendry shortly

   shore lew hurried off upon his er-
rand he was glad to leave the field of
those disturbing eyes

  goody cried the iady then you
wtont wrant the car

   no where do you plan to go

   over to old man parmelees smiled
madge  ive got to look after that poor
puppy

  hendry gave her a quick glance of sur-
prise having scented an unscrupulous
rival in this old man parmelee he had
taken it for granted that madge had sensed
it too but now gazing at her he immedi-
ately discerned that she had been quite
deaf to the real burden of his questioning
her mind really appeared to be upon the
puppy and its future it occurred to his
resourceful mind that this might not be
without its value

   a good idea he said  i think it
would be nice for you to make friends with
these people theyre really our neighbors
you know tell mr parmelee that ill
come over and call myself

  she smiled brilliantly

   thats a good daddy she cried and
patted his hand so that he was reminded
keenly of the love he bore her

chapter xiii

warrior bred

madge drove up to the parmelee
ranch very prettily the wheels of
her car spurned the broken rocks
of the roadway with a noisy rattle and her
tires whined on the clay she whirled up
the terrace and brought up short with great
neatness and when she sprang from the
car her slim form in riding clothes of thin
apple green material flashed in the sunlight
like the embodiment of spring

  old man parmelee sitting in his chair
must have been immeasurably surprised at
her appearance but his countenance be-
trayed no sign of the effect her coming
made

   are you mr parmelee she asked
prettily
valor



    thats me he admitted and his frozen
blue eyes played upon her like the reflection
of sunlight from the ice

   im madge hendry she said and held
out her hand he took it but that was be-
cause he knew of nothing else to do he
held it for an instant but his hand hardly
closed upon it  were visiting the ranch
she explained

    shore

   i your son here she asked
 david

   he stared at her silently for a moment

    hes away he replied finally

   i-we met down at the creek-at the
dasent place she said and stopped short
for his cold eyes had darkened

    you gave him that pup he demanded

   yes she smiled brilliantly thats
what i came here for to see the puppy
how is it

   again his gaze slowly examined her in a
cold silence he dwelt upon her costume
redolent of expensive eastern shops he
observed her untanned lace with the flush
in her cheeks and her bright eyes he no-
ticed her hands soft and white unmarred
by toil

    you an david ought to be right good
friends he remarked and instinctively
she resented the frigid sarcasm in his voice
 there aint no girl in these parts thats
soft enough fer david to know and men
he finds them rough

  he leaned forward suddenly and his
voice took on a darker significance it
startled her having in it the essence of a
passion which had never touched her life
 what did that kid tell you he de-
manded

    tell me she cried unaccountably in-
dignant

   he spoke to you about that dasent
ranch

   she instantly divined the reason for his
anger this matter of dasent the man who
worked for two masters at once had caused
david to shut up like a clam and her
father to take on the thoughtful brow of
business hours there was some magic to
make men rude in the position of this man
dasent

    no she answered  he wouldnt an-

swer questions they told me that out in
this country people who were polite didnt
ask them

  old man parmelee grinned dourly con-
cealing a stormy sea of resentment this
girl with her dainty clothes and unspoiled
airs this offspring of hendry the absentee
victim of his rapacity called forth neither
kindliness nor courtesy from him and
now she was flinging his words back into his
face

  again old man parmelee felt that un-
easy sense of waning power again he felt
that his hand was no longer as strong to con-
trol as it was in the past and he revolted
against it

   yore friend david he said brutally
 is away hidin in the hills he played like
a fool an a woman till i took him in hand
to train then he spited me his lips
curled in an unpleasant smile as he saw her
troubled frown  i got men out on the
range now for to round him up when they
bring him in im going to show him what
it means to cross me 

  still regarding her with his bitter sar-
donic eyes he arose slowly from his chair
tt was that pup that done it he burst
forth with unreasonable resentment  his
yellow livered sperit couldnt bear to see
the pup treated like a dog 

  he put forth one hand and took her by
the arm

   now you come with me missy an ill
show you what im goin to do some time
youll see him again then i want you
should tell him iust what you seen done
here to-day

  he stepped toward the door his hand
strong upon her wrist

   but no  she cried although she felt
no panic  i cant go in with you

   come on in he grinned  dont you
be scared you got to see what im goin
to do you got to see it come on
without the slightest fear and with con-
siderable curiosity she followed this queer
man into his house and shuddered at the
barren disorder of the room into which he
led her

   set down he said and indicated a
chair she seated herself and watched
him as he walked stiffly and evidently with

great effort over to a far corner of the great
room

  there he stooped suddenly and picked
up in his big hand the puppy she had come
to see he held it by the scruff of the neck
and bore it to another corner of the room
where from a littered table he procured a
pair of enormous shears then he came
back to her and placed the puppy on a
packing box beside her chair holding it by
the loose skin about its shoulders

  there he said with the strange dis-
turbing grin upon his face  now you look
what im doin im goin to trim this
pups ears an im goin to clip his tail an
i want you should tell him of it when you
see him 

  she jumped to her feet and drew away
from him

   but why should i she cried

  she divined that behind the glistening
malice of his eyes lay something of greater
significance than this trivial matter of trim-
ming a puppys ears and he was not
loath to betray it

   there aint no wickedness like the
wickedness of a boy to his father  he cried
bitterly  an to save a brute beast its
proper treatment hed undo the work of my
life

   i want him to know that the pup
got its sufferin anyway i want you should
tell him how it yelped an cried when the
shears cut into its flesh how it howled in
pain in spite of his playin the fool

  he fastened upon her a smile which was
a leer and she stood transfixed by this
revelation of the tortuous pathways of the
old mans mind it seemed incredible that
he meant thus to triumph over his son but
she didnt know that a passion more crafty
than the sense of triumph was at work

  she didnt know for instance that old
man parmelee confident that david would
see this girl before ever he thought to return
to his father counted upon her recital of
this scene to bring david hurrying home
it is possible indeed that old man parme-
lee was not as blind to the peculiarities of
his sons ardent temper as he seemed

  he grasped the puppy with needless vio-
lence bunching in his great hand the loose
skin about its shoulders hurting it so that

it wriggled in protest but gave forth no
whimper of pain

   torture he called it he sneered as
he raised the shears  like a woman
would i want you should tell him how his
puppy squealed

  she gazed upon him with eyes wide open
her face blank in puzzlement

   but that dog wont squeal she cried
 its an english bull terrier they never
cry out 

  the shears clanged as he dropped them
on the box and leaned there with one hand
heavily upon the board he stared at the
girl as if he were a child and she his
teacher inflicting a distasteful lesson

   it wont his tone was so lugubrious
that she smiled as she answered him

   mercy no it would take more than a
trimming to make that puppy cry his
father is shropshire rex the third she
caught her breath suddenly appalled by the
cloud that fell upon him sweeping the un-
fortunate animal up in his hand he looked
at it as if it were a thing accursed

   wont cry he roared  i say it will
cry i want it should cry ill make it
and hurling it to the ground he kicked at
it viciously

  dont do that she cried and seized
him by the arm  thats mean thats
brutal 

  he brushed her hand from him and in
an excess of rage jabbed at the puppy with
his heel

  yelp yelp out howl he cried
 i want he should know that it hurt

  the puppy having injured a leg in its
fall and further tortured by the mans
vindictive foot edged away snarling and
limping but it did not cry out nor did it
run away instead it hurled an infantile
defiance at the man growling bravely
through its clenched milk teeth at the brute
which kicked it

  madge impotent against the mans fury
cried out one angry inarticulate cry and
darted forward to take the dog from his
way but old man parmelee pushed her
aside with a warning

  git away he cried ill kill the
little rat and he would have done so
too killed it or maimed it in his insensate

fury but as the girl staggered back from
his rude shove the door opened and david
entered the room

chapter xiv

the knout

 a int you got nerves aint you got
feelins screamed the exasperated
old man as he stumped forward
leaning on the table to lunge out with
one foot at the wretched puppy but
david sprang lithely from the doorway to
push his father back and sweep the little
animal up in his arms

  you leave it be he cried its
mine

  with the injured puppy clutched against
his breast the boy tossed back his head and
fixed shining eyes upon his father

   thats one thing you got to leave be
he said

  man and boy ignored the girl as they
stood there facing each other old man
parmelee having been pushed almost from
his precarious balance by the exuberance
of davids onslaught now firmly grasped
the high back of a chair before him and
stared at his indignant son

  as usual with these two a turmoil of
thought passed in their minds between what
time they spoke and madge kneeling on
the hard earthen floor saw the face of
old man parmelee as his mind worked furi-
ously in that silence become gradually
harder gradually beclouded by the dark-
ness of a ruthless determination

  his hands left the back of the chair and
in his peculiar stiff-legged manner he
walked to the wall beside the fireplace he
spoke as he walked and madge hendry
watching and listening felt her heart con-
tract within her as she sensed impending
tragedy the boy stood with the puppy in
his arms folded to his breast and watched
his fathers movements

  his face was flushed so that his cheeks
shone apple red and his dark eyes glowed
handsomely he seemed marvelously un-
perturbed yet there was a certain set alert-
ness in his face and a great deal of resolu-
tion

   so you come back said his father as
he moved to the wall you come back
an the first thing you do is to sling yore
spite out at me like a rattler

  his voice rose to a sudden harshness
 well im glad you come he cried  i
told aleck sheffield what i was goin to do
to you when you come back an now im
goin to do it f im goin to whip you till
you yell out for mercy and his hand
clutched the stock of a rawhide whip that
hung at the mantel side

  springing to her feet the girl gasped out
something incomprehensible inarticulate
but neither the boy nor the man took notice
of her

   father you wont in that cry
david voiced all the trust of a boy in his
fathers love and fairness but the wretched
man was deaf to the meaning of his voice

   hal yore afraid i knew it i told
em the old man strode across the floor
to the boys side  save yore whines an
yore pleadin he rasped  cause youll
need em now

  david turned to grasp his father by the
arm but with great violence old parmelee
tore his grasp away

  yelp now he cried and raising the
whip he laid it with all his might across the
boys straight back

  a-a-a-a-h david caught his breath
but that was all he drew up his shoulders
after that and his head shrank down in
an instinctive physical resistance to the
blows which his father showered on him

  cry out yell yelp like the yellow
dawg you are old man parmelee shouted
and he lashed the boy again with all the
strength of his arm the third stroke
snapped loudly and the boys shirt was
ripped open as if by a knife

  david clutching the puppy to him made
only one single sound it came thickly
through clenched teeth and was preceded
by a sharp intaking of the breath as the
fifth blow lashed across his back he jerked
out the one word  no 

  no no no stop youll kill him
shrieked madge and she grasped the old
man by the arm with a sweep of that
arm he flung her away and she fell back
into a chair

  she leaped to her feet again and ran
terror stricken to the door but found no
help there she ran from one comer of the
room to the other vainty without reason or
control and came back to stand clutching
at a chair back seeming to feel every blow
which fell upon the boy and she felt the
more keenly because she could now see the
mark of the lash upon his naked back

  old man parmelee had stood for a mo-
ment relaxed after flinging the girl from his
arm and david turned to him with com-
passion in his eyes where parmelee had ex-
pected to find pain and resentment at
that the old man raised the whip and
flourished it in the boys face

   youll defy me he gritted  youll
fix yer face to laugh at me you think i
cant make you cry his passion was ex-
traordinary ludicrous

  in a sudden uprush of passion the old
man seized the boys shirt collar with both
hands and ripped the shirt from his back

   now he cried  youll beg for ever-
lastin mercy the whip whined in the
air and crashed viciously as it bit the
smooth skin of the bare torso

  madge shrieked davids head sank for-
ward the puppy dropped to the floor and
the boy drooped supporting himself with
his hands upon the table the terrible old
man braced himself feet apart

  then blind to the red welts on the
smooth skin of the boys straight back he
raised his whip and brought the lash down
again with a vicious whine a scarlet stripe
appeared as he raised the whip once more
but david except for a writhing of the flesh
beneath that satin skin gave no sign that
he was hurt again the lash fell and the
boys back quivered as a thin stream of
blood showed that the skin was cut through

   cry out fight you puppy cried
the furious old cattleman  yelp out or
ill flay you alive

  insanely he plied the lash gasping with
the effort of every stroke flaying that satin
skin with a madmans ardor but david
his head low on his breast and one arm
flung across his eyes in a protective ges-
ture which suggested that he tried to shut
out an intolerable sight jerked forth the
thick word no

  you will you will the whip
cracked on the flesh again

  david caught his breath there was a
shriek of agony struggling in his breast for
utterance and the sweat streamed into his
eyes blinding him also there was an ani-
mal that tore at his muscles urging him to
turn  his tormentor and rend him with
his hands

  he was not conscious of how he writhed
and twisted as he supported himself therf
against the table he was not conscious
of anything save an agony of pain a
passion of black fury and the desire to fall
senseless and unconscious for evermore

   crack fell the lash biting into the bleed-
ing flesh cutting the boys young body with
its curling cruelty a tremulous sigh
escaped from davids lips he bit one
wrist to keep his agony from utterance
his form drooped pitiably and his head
sank lower

   you cant look at me you cant
fight you cant howl you cant look me
in the face gasped the maniac who
wielded the lash

  for answer david dropped that guard-
ing arm from his eyes took up his dog in
a protecting clasp and drawing himself
erect with a great effort he turned upon his
father the light of his brown eyes and all
the conflicting passions which they held
no cry could have voiced the dreadful ar-
dor of his eyes and the flame of them
framed by the boys glistening brow and
clean cut unfurrowed face struck the old
man with an awful accusation

   dad- said the boy and that was all
he said it was protest and uncompre-
hending pain

  old man parmelee stood with the whip
in his hand upraised he glared at the
burning and intolerable passion of his sons
straight gaze for a split second in awful
silence and then it was he who crooked one
arm across his eyes

  it was the old man now who tried to shut
out a sight he could not bear to see and
as the whip hand and the lash fell to the
floor there burst from his lips a stream of
profanity which was the horrible voice of
a man who in that moment knew no god
he stretched out his arms as he screamed

                        	a
valor



his eyes glared glassily and a thin foam
gathered on his lips

   its there he screamed with the in-
coherence of his dark emotion  its there
in his eyes still there and he tottered
in his place as a tree totters before falling
he would have crashed as the tree falls to
the floor had not david leaped forward
and upheld him

  madge saw the boy do this and she had
looked upon the entire incredible scene
through the red mist of nightmare and she
saw the old mans great hand clutch the
boys shoulders so that as david wincing
upheld his father the mans hand was
stained with blood she saw that david
desired to support his father to a couch and
it released her from the horror that held
her like a spell

  she stepped forward to help him but
david turned his dark eyes upon her and
his glance held her away for his eyes con-
tained an eloquence which was more moving
than speech

   its my father he murmured  its
between us two we can do all we have to
do for each other alone

  with his tortured back still naked to the
waist his face wet with the perspiration of

his agony and the lips she had seen so red
in the sunlight now livid and twitching with
great pain david supported his father ten-
derly to the couch against the wall there
he laid him down and bent for a moment
over him

  then he arose to his full height and drew
his torn shirt about his shoulders once
more quivering with the pain it caused
him this done he paused for a moment
and breathed deeply then reaching to his
hip pocket he drew forth his fathers gun
and gently placed it above the head of the
unconscious man when he spoke he
spoke with an even low voice and he ad-
dressed the inert figure of his father with a
queer confidence as though he knew his
words were heard

   there was a time he said  when you
was whippin me that i wanted to kill you
i wanted to kill you dad an that thats
the worst thing that youve done

   you made me so that i wanted to shoot
you but i aint holdin it agen you
dad-i-

  he stood silent for a moment contem-
plating the drawn gray face of the man

   i aint he finished with a strange
calmness in his voice

to be continued next week

 the shadow

twas vespertide i idly dreamed
beside the summer sea

   out on the rocks the starlight gleamed
      where the mermaids used to be

   i heard the dreamy lullaby
      the sirens used to croon-

   a shadow drifted through the sky
      beneath the misty moon

 a

fancy smote the bondmans chain
that linked me to lifes toil-

that romance-tree bloomed once again
in the dead years sacred soil

i breathed the balm of south sea isles
in the tropics golden sheen-

   then a biplane whistled through the miles
      mid the fumes of gasoline
by jack bechdolt

his name was daly-simms daly
he appeared one winter day at the
outside of the rail which separates
the general public from the office force of
the j k blevitt company and demanded
j k blevitt in a loud ringing voice he
was not an unusually large man but he
was clad at the moment in a coat of horsy
checkered tweeds a violent caterpillar fur
hat and smallpox-pitted yellow shoes a
bolshevik tie and various other impedi-
menta which expanded him in the shocked
vision of the beholders his face had a
ruddy glow and as he smiled he displayed
gleaming teeth that would have done credit
to the bogus grandma in  little red
riding hood

  j k blevitt chanced to be passing j
k blevitt was a thin dark saturnine
nervous business man with a hundred wor-
ries and anxieties constantly riding him
at the loud noise blevitt turned to the rail
with a snarl  im j k blevitt young
man

  good cried simms daly heartily

   i am the man you have been looking for
  mr blevitt i am a go-getter

    simms daly leaned across the separating
  rail before j k blevitt could move and
  his hand plucked something from the
  shoulder of mr blevitts coat

     pardon me mr blevitt daly said
  and ostentatiously deposited the hair he
  had plucked from mr blevitts shoulder
  far to one side

    dont do that cried j k blevitt
  irritably

    simms daly laughed in high good hu-
  mor-a ringing loud empty laugh like the
  guffaw of the happy jackass  its all
  right mr blevitt its all right it was
  not a blond hair no sir it was gray
  an oldish hair mr blevitt-one of your
  own gray locks

    j k blevitt hated to be pawed by
  strangers if there was anything he de-
  spised it was the imputation that a blond
  hair might be found on his shoulder if
  there was one thing certain to make his
  blood boil it was a reference to him as
  
the goat-getter



gray haired or elderly all three of these
unpleasantly violent emotions seethed and
bubbled within his breast as he glared at
the stranger

   as i was saying mr blevitt simms
daly went on unperturbed by j k blev-
itts glare im a go-getter i am the man
you are iooking for to jazz up your sales
force and im ready to go to work right
now

   damn you sir i dont want a sales-
man-and if i was starving to death for
a salesman i wouldnt take you it was
on the lip of j k blevitts tongue to say
this to simms daly but he did not
say it

  the fact was j k blevitt needed a
salesman very badly that morning-a man
to visit the down town trade blevitt
swallowed his indignation and managed to
growl fairly mildly  come inside ill
talk to you

   you know the down town box trade
of course said j k blevitt after a short
chat in which simms daly did most of the
talking to terminate the interview blev-
itt already had agreed that daly was to
go to work and show what he could do

  you know the down town trade in boxes
daly

   no i dont never had the pleasure
daly quoth in a good loud voice display-
ing all his fine teeth cheerfully  nope
 well then how the devil-

  there there daly cried fending off
his new boss with a soothing gesture which
brought his palm to rest affectionately
on blevitts trembling shoulder  there
there dont you worry blevitt i will
know em ill know em like my own
brothers by this evening everythings
o k blevitt ill get your orders

  by the eternal youd better said
j k blevitt in a strangled voice  youd
better show me

  inwardly blevitt thought with vast sat-
isfaction that he would not be bothered
with simms daly for many hours daly
would come back empty-handed or with
a pitiful showing of orders and out daly
would go assisted figuratively speaking by
the toe of the j k blevitt boot

  but simms daly came back that evening

with such a sheaf of orders that even j k
blevitt relaxed his grimness blevitt spoke
to his cashier  put daly on the pay roll
for a week until i can find a salesman
who doesnt incite me to murder

ii

  j k blevitt talked with rudolph
reed his general manager and a silent
partner in the j k blevitt company
rudolph reed was ten years younger than
blevitt though he did not look it he
was a man of fine physique military car-
riage and calm dignity he dressed with
meticulous care always carrying to busi-
ness his walking stick his neatly creased
gloves wearing his dove-hued spats and
prince albert coat

  j k blevitt was the boss-a man feared
and loved-but rudolph reed was the king
of the office a fair and just king whose
person was held sacred

  reed had just returned from an out-of-
town journey

   i had to take on a new down town
salesman while you were gone rudolph
said blevitt

   ha i thought i saw a strange hat on
the rack as i came in

  strange blevitt cried strange
youd have seen a stranger coat under the
hat if youd looked twice and wait till
you see what goes with the outfit ru-
dolph i guess i picked a lemon-

   a dud is he

  blevitt frowned  he can sell like a
blue streak reed raised his eyebrows in
question  yes said blevitt  he can
sell i cant very well kick out a man who
sells twice as much as murphy used to in
the same territory can i rudolph

   why should you j k

   wait till you meet him just wait till
you know him rudolph if you can stand
this pest i wont ever say another word
come along i want vou to know simms
daly

  j k blevitt dragged his partner and
manager to the outer office and up to the
desk where simms daly was most com-
fortably established simms daly was
going over his order book humming a tune


argosy-allstory weekly

in his fine resonant voice he hummed
continuously the same tune over and over
you could hear him all over the room a
battery of eyes poured black looks upon
him from every direction simms daly
was oblivious of the hatred he engendered
by his happy music

  simms daly damped his order book down
upon his desk with a bang like a bomb
exploding in the quiet office swinton the
bookkeeper jumped a foot off his high
stool his precisely poised pen dropped
a nice fat fluid blob of black over the neat
column of figures he had just transcribed
from the day book swinton gazed at the
wreck with a compound of despair and
wrath

  bertha edge the pleasant blond stenog-
rapher hit the keyboard of her machine
with both clenched hands and broke a type
bar

  albert the office boy dropped the carafe
of drinking water he was bearing to j k
blevitts desk and the broken glass crashed
far and wide

  simms daly had clapped down his order
book at sight of the boss he was cheerily
unaware of the devastation he had created
 morning blevitt he hee-hawed

   shake hands with mr reed our gen-
eral manager blevitt snorted in trembling
rage  this is mr daly rudolph-
daly was out of his chair with a bound
and his willing hands propelled the chair
violently toward reed dalys hand
clamped onto reeds shoulder and sought
to press reed into the chair while his
other hand caught at reeds walking stick

   no no-i wont sit down reed pro-
tested  no you keep the chair

   nothing doing reed daly declared
fighting to get the walking stick let a
lame man stand not me

   lame reed gasped

   lame blevitt snorted  where do
you get that stuff daly

  daly paused in his struggle stared and
uttered his jackass guffaw  i thought he
was lame he carries a cane

  a sickly poisoned silence came over the
office as every man and woman caught his
breath in the silence albert the office
boy uttered a shrill ghastly giggle and

tried to turn it into a cough in spite of
himself a dull red came into reeds cheeks

  you bonehead j k blevitt sput-
tered  i suppose you think charley
chaplin is lame because he carries a
cane

   thats one on me boys simms daly
chortled blithely  yes sir thats certain-
ly one on me but sit down and you too
blevitt he seized another chair and
pushed it at blevitt go on sit down
im a lot younger man than you two i
dont mind standing

iii

   wtell said j k blevitt when reed
stopped in his office at lunch hour  you
saw it what are we going to do with it
how are we going to get rid of daly-
thats the question

  reed shook his head his cheeks still
burned a little as he thought of his cane
 what can we do j k nothing so
far as i can see-

   can you stand for that bounding
kangaroo with the jackass laugh blevitt
demanded his eyes bulging

   its terrible reed admitted earnest-
ly  terrible and the worst of it is the
bounder doesnt know hes offensive did
you see his eyes when he called us old
men he really meant well-

   damn what he meant hes got to be
fired rudolph how that laughing hyena
manages to sell the trade i dont know
but he cant stay on here

   be fair j k you cant fire a man
because you dont like his laugh-especially
the best salesman youve got weve got
to be fair

  j k blevitt bowed his head reluctantly
 all right rudolph i guess youre right
at that

  swinton the bookkeeper met bertha
edge on her way to work one morning
 say im sore as a pup i couldnt get up
to the partv at your flat last night ber-
tha

   swinny bertha said earnestly a
strange trace of bitterness obscuring her
usually good-natured face  some people
have got all the luck-you for instance
the goat-getter



   luck i dont call it luck missing out
one of your jolly evenings-

   jolly maybe they were jolly once
this one was gosh-awful ghastly if you
get what i mean oh what an ending for
an almost perfect party

   why bertha what-

   listen bertha said tensely grasping
the bookkeepers arm by way of emphasis
 it was this pest simms daly like a sap
i let him in oh my gosh swinny-

   what swinton gasped

  bertha whispered tensely you never
guessed swinny hes a barytone--

   you dont mean to say he sings-in
company

   does he i might have guessed it
from the noise he makes around the office
but i never tumbled even when he showed
up with a brief case bulging with sheet
music i supposed it was just some kind
of sample case right in the midst of a
fine evening everybody getting chummy
and talking and laughing and cutting up
this boob ducks out gets his music and
takes the center of the floor  well boys
and girls uncle simms has got a nice little
surprise for you uncle simms is going to
sing a little piece

   and he did yes indeed he did he
sang  asleep in the deep and that one
about the  sands of the desert and a wop
opera song about donna somebody and on
and on and on nothing could stop him
short of an ax-and his skull would turn an
ax probably just ruin a real good blade
nobody talked after that swinny the
party was blotto

   pretty soon one and another said they
guessed theyd have to drift along they
didnt even wait for refreshments-no-
body but one or two tried and true friends
-real pals and simms daly of course
he stayed till i yawned in his face and
threw him out wanted to sing to me alone
but i stepped on that

   ghastly swinton sympathized  it
must have been a massacre something
has got to be done such as poisoning to
fix that go-getter

   goat-getter you mean bertha edge
declared morosely  hes got mine ill
broadcast 

   you said it bertha hes getting
everybodys goat

afternoon of the day before christmas

  throughout the j k blevitt office rigid
discipline of business had relaxed the
lunch hour rule was forgotten employees
straggled in at two oclock and at two
thirty their bundle-laden arms and the
excitement in their faces excuse enough
for one day

  blevitt and reed were in blevitts office
j k blevitt was in a state of nerves tech-
nically known as a blue funk no high-
strung actor facing his first night suffered
as j k blevitt suffered on this one after-
noon of the year

  it was the custom of the blevitt organi-
zation to make christmas presents bo-
nuses graded in amount according to earn-
ings and length of service were distributed
by the head of the company as a santa
claus j k blevitt was a complete bust-
a flop

  the best j k blevitt could do was
stagger feebly into the big office bearing
his basket of envelopes read out the name
of each employee and hand him his pres-
ent with a nervous glare that suggested he
was passing out two-week notices to every-
body and sincerely hoped they would all
starve to death in most pitiable circum-
stances before they got another job

  once the employees had burst into j k
blevitts office with a presentation walking
stick and a traveling bag they made
speeches at him blevitt never fully re-
covered from the horrors of the day nor
his fear that the performance would be re-
peated

  that the blankety blank dash asterisk
fools would keep quiet and take his money
and let him alone was the dearest wish of
his deeply sensitive soul he loved them all
if only they wouldnt show any indecent
gratitude

  reed was busily checking over the bonus
list and the envelopes  all set he an-
nounced calmly

  blevitt groaned a hollow croaking
prophecy of disaster


argosy-allstory weekly

   rudolph he said turning tragic eyes
on his partner  you do it 

  reed shook his head  no they expect
it from you j k

   rudolph im damned if i will

   yes you will j k buck up be
a man

   why should i i dont like this santa
claus business i tell you ill forget my
confounded speech good lord where
is that speech blevitt began to paw his
desk sending papers flying  here said
reed calmly supplying the manuscript
 its short enough you cant possibly
forget it

  j k blevitt glanced once more over the
speech muttering its commendations and
good wishes to the employees under his
breath

   come ont said his partner  time
to go

  as reed opened the door blevitt grasped
him anxiously holding his arm back  ru-
dolph you-you havent got a drink about
you something real fiery

   good heaven no j k why youre
a rabid prohibitionist

   i know it said j k blevitt tear-
fully  been one all my life hate the
stuff-hate the sight of it but rudolph i
wish to heaven-i was drunk right
now 

  reed opened the door and shoved his
partner through

  simms daly had been waiting for this
moment

  simms daly had heard from office gos-
sip of the annual christmas presentation
he was all primed for the joyous occasion
for an hour he had been circulating about
the office plotting

  wthen j k blevitt tottered feebly into
the room the center of all attention simms
daly sprang to his feet and loosed his great
barytone voice

 for hes a jolly good fellow

for hes a jolly good fellow

for hes a jolly good fe-he-low

which nobody can deny-hy

daly brayed lustily at the end of the
verse in which a few straggling shamed
voices had joined daly roared now

boys and girls everybody he brayed
again right lustily

for hes a jolly good fellow

and the chorus became more general in-
cited by the mans overpowering ego the
office force rose en masse and advanced
upon j k blevitt who faced them speech-
less white with terror clawing feebly with
one arm at his basket of bonuses with the
other at rudolph reed

  join hands everybody simms daly
yelped

  they joined hands and circled round and
round their helpless trembling victim roar-
ing over and over

for hes a jolly good fellow

  albert the office boy swinton the book-
keeper bertha edge the stenographer old
and young high and low the decorous of-
fice force of the j k blevitt company
went mad together romping around j k
blevitt until his head swam and he stood
weaving giddily roaring out their nonsense
about his being a jolly good fellow while
he glowered feebly and the sweat of a death
agony streamed down his white face the
uproar quieted finally

   give him a cheer boys and girls
yelped simms daly he began

 hes all right

whos all right-

in the approved manner of all cheer lead-
ers and the office force followed his lead
swept off their feet and driven to insanity
by his noise and their own

  if j k blevitts fondest desire of the
moment had come true and heaven had
stricken them all dead quiet could not have
come more suddenly absolute quiet in
which the flushed panting mob faced their
employer

  simms daly yelped  speech speech
everybody knew that it was j k blevitts
turn now

  j k blevitt gasped

  gone was all idea of speechmaking of
doing anything except getting away from
there self-preservation natures primal
law ruled j k blevitt

   here he cried
the goat-getter



  he threw his basket of envelopes at them
and staggered feebly to his private office
rudolph reed bearing up his limp form

v

  j k blevitt had his arms on his desk
top and his head buried in his arms from
time to time he still shook unexpectedly
with violent emotion

  rudolph reed came in from the outer
office  i got them untangled at last he
reported  everybody has his own envel-
ope and is happy

  j k blevitt gave a deep ghastly groan
 let me alone just let me alone cant
you

   all right j k reed agreed soothing-
ly all right

  from the outer office came a sudden burst
of song it was the jackass barytone of
simms daly warbling happily jubilantly

   till the sands of the de-hes-ert grow
co-ho-o-o-o-id
and the scrolls of the he-heavens un-
fo-ho-o-o-o-ld-

  no j k blevitt screamed leaping
from his chair  no no no 

   no what asked rudolph reed look-
ing up from the statement he was studying

   till the sa-hands-of the-de-hesert
grow co-o-old simms daly brayed

reed shuddered  ghastly isnt it

   i wont have it shouted j k blevitt
hoarsely  i wont why should i this
is my business isnt it ill fire that in-
fernal goat-getter to-day

  rudolph reed started to nod enthusiastic
agreement then a sudden frown checked
his nod  oh i say j k this is christ-
mas

   i dont give a whoop what it is ru-
dolph

   be fair j k be fair he is an-
er-goat-getter as you say he gets on
everybodys nerves yes but you wouldnt
throw a man out of a job to-day the
day before christmas-

  id throw that pest out of a job on
his wedding day-if i had a chance

   no reed said firmly  no you
wouldnt think it over spirit of the sea-

son j k  peace on earth good will to-
ward men- 

    peace on earth  how are you going
to get peace even in this office while that
jackass bays the moon

   jackasses dont bay the moon-dogs
may reed smiled

  in spite of his temper j k blevitts lips
twitched  well anvhow ill get rid of
that bird a long time before the sands of
the desert grow cold you watch my
smoke-

   surely but not to-day

   well-all right blevitt conceded
grudgingly  have it your own way

  reed rose his business finished at the
door he paused  i dont know why i
should fight dalys battles he burst out

 hanged if i do he gets my goat too
you know

  reed took the puzzle to his own desk- -
in his own office he was still wondering
irritably why it was he always averted the
ax from the neck of simms daly when the
door burst open and simms daly presented
himself with a loud cackling  well well
well greetings rudolph

  reed looked up in his eyes the cold
steady regard he sometimes used to squelch
objectionable pests  yes daly

  simms daly was not feazed by reeds
death-ray eyes the paralyzing chill of
their steady glance ricocheted harmlessly
from his thick complacence

  daly pulled up a chair uninvited and
jaid a hand on reeds arm reed hastily
moved the arm but dalys hand followed
it with a reassuring friendly pat reed
set his teeth and endured  well daly

   hows my sales record daly demand-
ed  made a pretty fair little showing the
three months ive been with blevitt eh
rudolph

   yes reed said grudgingly but always
fair yes very tidy

  you said it rudolph tidys the
word pretty darn tidy if you ask me
you know rudolph ive done just about
fifty per cent better than any man with
blevitt to-day now havent i

   your record speaks for itself daly

   it certainly does you know rudolph
it just occurred to me if i was to leave


argosy-allstory weekly

blevitt-if i was to quit-it would make
an awful hole in his business now wouldnt
it

   oh i dont know

   yes you do know dont hedge ru-
dolph in his exuberance daly slapped
rudolph reed on the back

  reed moved his chair until the desk was
between them he gritted his teeth and
tried to keep his eyes off a heavy paper
weight so enticingly near his hand

  if i was to quit it would take two
live hustling go-getters to keep up the pace
i set all by myself daly looked serious
 and yet blevitt only pays me the salary
of one salesman i dont know about that
i think id better talk this over with
blevitt

   yes reed said hastily  if thats what
youre thinking of tell it to mr blevitt
hes the man to see he added with sud-
den genuine astonishment  how the devil
you manage to sell our goods-a man with
your manner-your perfectly hellish man-
ner-i dont know i dont indeed

   you have noticed it youve noticed
the fault in my manner dalys ruddy
face grew serious almost mournful a sud-
den humility came over the man reeds
words seemed to crumple him up

  daly burst out  its apparent i know
the fault is glaring i try to kid myself
that it doesnt show but it does show i
try to cover it up but it wont cover up
not altogether but im working on it
rudolph day and night i am striving to
correct it

  simms dalys eyes glistened with a great
ambition

  i will correct it he vowed  i can
i shant stop until i do rudolph if it
takes my right leg i will overcome my lack
of confidence-my confounded timidity
 timidity reed gasped  did i un-
derstand you to say-

   now rudolph i know you want to say
something nice something to spare my feel-
ings but dont do it lets face facts
im a man and not afraid to face facts
i am timid im too sensitive no mat-
ter i will overcome it

  simms daly drew a deep breath and
looked highly resolved

  rudolph reed was prey to a virulent
mixture of astonishment and indignation
that left him helpless to do or say anything
fitting to the revelation he felt slightly
giddy again his eyes strayed to the heavy
paper weight and his fingers itched to hurl
it at simms daly but what would be
the use to do that would only spoil
a good bronze paper weight

  simms daly sank his voice to a confiden-
tial pitch he rose in order to clamp his
hand on his listeners arm while he confided

   let me tell you something old man
just between you and me you think im
timid now i wish you could have seen
me a year ago in just one year the
change that has come over me would aston-
ish you if you only knew

  a year ago this very christmas ru-
dolph i picked up a magazine i read
an advertisement an advertisement that
began  you too have a personality-de-
velop it

   it was an ad for a wonderful discovery
the invention of the interallied psychologi-
cal research laboratories-a bunch of
world famous scientists teaches you how
to overcome your natural faults how to
make an impression how to convince others
how to hold a company of brilliant men and
women by your conversation how to enter-
tain how to sell yourself get the idea

   every man has got it in him the book
says so and i have proved it look at
me

  simms daly drew himself up for inspec-
tion

  look at me rudolph

  his voice rose to a dramatic climax
 and would you believe it a year ago to-
day i was as hopeless and insignificant a
little runt as you are yes sir rudolph
nothing but a shy insignificant timid un-
derdeveloped pinch of nothing the living
image of what you are to-day

   reed sat perfectly still petrified at this
revelation

  the shock of it really had paralyzed him

  a dozen retorts a dozen methods of an-
nihilating simms daly rushed through his
mind but his mind knew it was no use
nothing he could do nothing he could say
nothing in the world ever would get under
the goat-getter



that rhinoceros hide and puncture the fel-
lows monumental self-satisfaction reed
felt like a man going under for the last time
and not a straw in sight to buoy him up

   yes sir daly repeated happily
 thats exactly the way i was listen old
man im going to lend you that book it
will do you a lot of good

  he turned to the door now i guess
id better have it out with blevitt

  something snapped in reeds mind and
brought events into sharper focus  wait
he said  ive got to talk to blevitt first
sinking for the last time rudolph reed had
finally perceived not a straw but a whole
life raft christmas or no christmas this
marble-headed jackass was going to get
what had so long been coming to him

vi

  reed paused before he opened the door
to the outer office and exchanged a last
word with j k blevitt both men were
grinning wide wicked grins

   no slip-ups now j k no softening
or relenting

  j k blevitt grasped an imaginary ax
in both hands and flourished it around his
head he ran his thumb across the imag-
inary cutting edge of the imaginary tool and
declared grimly  this ax has got an edge
like a razor bring on your victim
reed paused uncertainly  it seems kind
of a shame after all doing this on christ-
mas

   youre too timid rudolph daly was
right youre a little timid runt

 damn him reed groaned he
brought it on himself he opened the
door and called into the outer office  oh
daly mr blevitt will talk to you now
simms daly came in humming in his
resonant barytone he sat himself in the
chair j k blevitt offered him with a flash-
ing smile for his audience

  reed had a mental picture of a man sit-
ting down in the electric chair but with a
difference in the electric chair a man
knows what is going to happen to him

   you wanted to talk to me j k
blevitt grunted

 yes blevitt i did the victim

reached his offensive paw toward j k
blevitt and succeeded in getting in a friend-
ly pat on blevitts arm before blevitt got
out of range

   i hope youll take what i am going to
say in the spirit it is meant i know you
will daly said  im sure youre eager
to do the right and square thing blevitt
youre a good old scout

   thanks j k blevitt choked

   and in a way blevitt im sorry to
bring up this matter at christmas time
after your open-handed liberality to all of
us i-it doesnt seem grateful but a mans
got to think of himself first hasnt he

   yes said j k blevitt he smiled
craftily  thats all right my boy speak
whatever is preying on your mind

   i will yes indeed were all friends
here i hope we understand each other
well as i was telling rudolph ive sold
more goods for you than any two men ive
built up your business havent i

  blevitt said gravely  undoubtedly the
present state of excellent prosperity in the
j k blevitt company is largely due to you
daly

   yeah and im a crackerjack go-get-
ting salesman just like i told you when i
came here

   no use denying it daly

   im probably worth right now more
than any two men working for you eh
blevitt

   indubitably

   eh

  yes yes you are my boy why
deny it

   but i only get the pay of one salesman
dont i

  j k blevitt nodded sympathetically

   when im worth twice as much

  j k blevitt performed a secret little
pantomime of a man testing the razor keen-
ness of an ax preparatory to sinking said
imaginary ax into the thick skull of simms
daly this for the benefit of rudolph reed
who acknowledged the comedy by the
slightest flicker of an eyelash aloud ble-
vitt agreed  you state the case preciselv
daly

   then said daly  we come to the
point


argosy-allstory weekly

   yes daly we come to the point  for
the benefit of his friend and partner j k
blevitt gave his imaginary ax a preliminary
imaginary flourish he interrupted simms
daly who was about to go on  wte come
to the point admirably put and the
point is i see that you have discovered what
i knew for a long time daly youve
found out you are worth far more money
than the j k blevitt company pays for
your services

  the goat-getter nodded brightly

   and as i understand it daly you are
here now to inquire just what i am going
to do about remedying this condition in
other words you think you are entitled to a
very substantial increase in pay

   yes blevitt but-

  blevitt did not heed the interruption
 and you are just about to inquire what
i am going to do about it now wait
daly- blevitt held up his hand to pre-
vent interruption his suavity had been
getting more sugared with every word j
k blevitt was coming to his point and
his point was meant to be a crusher-noth-
ing short of one neat devastating chop of
his imaginary ax that would drop the offi-
cially figurative head of simms daly into
the basket leaving on the face a look of
deeply pained bewilderment  now daly
i am going to tell you exactly what i am
going to do about this request of yours for
bigger salary and-

   hold on hold on blevitt no you
got me wrong old man

   ah no daly im sure i havent got
you wrong

the

   but you have blevitt im not asking
you to raise my pay

   you are not what blevitt roared
rudolph reeds lower jaw obscured his
necktie so far open was his mouth

   no daly cried  of course not i
wouldnt ask you to raise me blevitt
why i know as well as you do old man
that the j k blevitt company cant af-
ford to pay me what im worth i know
that thats why i just dropped in here
to tell you i am quitting the first of the
year

   you are-quitting blevitt murmured
feebly  pardon me daly im getting a
little deaf did you say-

  blevitt im sorry im really sorry
simms daly cried contritely  but cant
you see i owe it to myself ive got to get
all that im worth everybody agrees on
that so i just got a half dozen fellows
with capital to back me and i am starting a
box business of my own beginning on jan-
uary i thats what i wanted to tell you
simms daly rose leaned across the desk
and seized the limp hand of j k blevitt
pumping it heartily he then snatched the
limper hand of rudolph reed and pumped
that and as a final assurance that all was
sweetness and light between them he
clapped j k blevitt heartily on the shoul-
der and cried  no hard feelings eh no
thats fine merry christmas blevitt
simms daly vented his empty jackass
laugh and strode out of j k blevitts of-
fice humming in his resonant barytone on
good terms with all the world and best of
all on good terms with himself

margots farewell

efore they reached the hotel george
directed the driver to stop

   wed better say good-by right
here he extended his hand to harbison
and his wife last of all he held the cool
hand of margot in both of his and then with
a sudden impulse raised it to his lips

   it would be taking a chance to have
any one at the hotel see me he continued
 youll probably find no one around even
the night clerk is apt to be asleep at this
hour just the same if any of valdezs
detectives happened to be around and saw
us together they might follow you to the
boat and make trouble

   i guess youre right replied jim har-
bison  but ill see that margot gets safe-
ly aboard ive got a pocketful of amer-
ican greenbacks and i notice that these

coffee-colored south american cops are just
as partial to them as the kind we have in
new york

   i can trust margot to you

   your wife is safe in my hands george
why if id lose her id miss the brightest
star that ever came out of south america
and big profits for me when you hear
the whistle toot youll know that your wife
is on her way to broadway and glory
george was half out of the car when
margot impulsively threw her arms about
his neck and once more he felt her warm
lips but they were on his cheek and he
realized that it was an act of gratitude
not of passion  good-by he said hoarse-
ly good-by and good luck

  george and tina left the car just a few
blocks from their own apartment and
slipped through the deserted streets where
even the earliest risers had not begun to
show themselves

this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for october 




argosy-allstory weekly

  in the sitting room which they shared be-
tween them george sank down in a chair
and let his head fall on his arms that rested
upon the table before him

  he was tired clear through disappointed
and humiliated margots unemotional
good-by kiss had told him more decisively
than words that he was not her husband
not her lover but only her good friend
that was something but not enough from
a wife

  tina stood behind his chair and let her
fingers run through his dark hair wishing
that she might dare to stoop and kiss the
locks that curled so slightly under her
touch

  poor boy she murmured in a voice
that was as tender as a mothers  you
are so tired and so unhappy i would do
anything in the world to comfort you
george had no words to answer her he
felt too sick and sore

  tinas eyes brimmed with tears as she
felt or imagined she felt him shrink from
her touch

   dont worry george things will come
out all right margot will make a hit in
new york and after a while shell miss you
and will coax for you to come to her
george did not reply he did not raise
his head only his deep and labored
breathing showed that he was suffering and
could not be comforted

  things worked out fine continued
tina as if she were talking to a child
 dont you see the girl is safe now
away from valdez and out of reach of that
beast who calls himself her guardian

   but shes gone-she said good-by
without any more feeling than if i had
been old gian bori or the pianist at the
cafe im nothing to her

   dont say that of course youre
something to her why she owes every-
thing to you when she comes to her
senses shell realize it

  silence

  then tina continued soothingly

   you know dear some girls are like
that they cant show what they feel-
why away down in her heart a girl may
be just crazy with love and yet-and yet
you may think by the way she acts that

shes cold and reserved-like margot-or
she may laugh and cut up like a wild crea-
ture-when her hearts just breaking you
never can tell about girls theyre like
that

  her hand which stroked his hair trem-
bled a little as she smoothed his dark curls
but george shook it off as he rose im-
petuously

   oh its hell tina its hell to care
for anyone like that

   i know it is boy its-its some-
thing fierce--but listen youre all tired
and excited cant you settle down now
and get a little sleep

   no i cant sleep my room seems
like a jail no that isnt it ive got her
pictures all over the place and i cant bear
to look at them i dont know what i
want to do id like to get drunk

  tina threw open the door of her own
room  come in here she said  its
cool here and-and there are no pictures
george glanced in at the room that
looked so virginal in the cool light of the
early morning the little white bed the
floor bare except for a couple of small rugs
the gray walls

  over the head of the bed facing the door
wtas a small blue and white image of the
virgin above a tiny font of holy water

  but tina had not told the truth when
she said there were no pictures in her room
on the little table beside a book or two
and a vase of flowers was a framed photo-
graph of george with a quick gesture
she laid it flat and placed a book upon it

   come in george she said  -do
you know in all the time weve lived here
youve never been inside my room

  too worn out to protest george stag-
gered in gazing about the immaculate
chamber with bloodshot eyes and threw
himself heavily on the bed

  in a few moments he was asleep

  tina listened to his deep breathing for
a little while then assured that he had sunk
into the stupor of exhaustion she silently
and swiftly slipped out of her tattered
dress the black and scarlet costume that
had been ripped and clawed by brambles
on the mountain trail and tossed it into a
drawer
the dancing doll



  she kicked off her slippers and stepped
into dainty mules of blue and white then
filling the basin with cold water she washed
her face and neck and arms glad of the
refreshing chill

  finally she slipped into a negligee of blue
and white and seating herself before her
dressing table shook out her hair and be-
gan to brush the cloudy black masses

  but as she looked in the mirror she was
not studying her own features fine and
spirited as those of a gypsy princess she
was looking at the reflection of george
who was stretched on her bed his brows
no longer knitted and his mouth no longer
drawn in suffering but relaxed in the bless-
ing of sleep

  as she looked at him the girl was think-
ing of that other girl who had won this
man so easily and as easily tossed him aside

  i wonder mused tina i wonder
what i would have done suppose it was
my act that had knocked over that theater
manager suppose mr harbison had said
to me  youre positively the worlds best
demon-dancer you come to new york
with me and ill give you a thousand a
week and whats more ill have your
name in the biggest lights on broadway
the whole town will be talking of christina
bianca suppose hed said all that to me
instead of to her-

  tina mused on the vision of glory for a
moment while the brush caressed her black
hair then she said aloud   you go plumb
to the devil mr harbison thats what
id tell him

  with difficulty the girl restrained her im-
pulse to stroke the head that was dreaming
on her pillow but as she stared at it with
her big black eyes full of tenderness there
was a sound at the street door

  who could be trying to enter at that time
of night

chapter xix
tinas wiles

as the girl strained her ears listening to
the ominous sounds without she heard
the low mutter of peremptory com-
mands then there were footsteps of men
coming up stairs

  she hurried to the window two figures
were standing by the opposite wall look-
ing toward her apartment

  tinas eyes grew wide with apprehension
and she ran into the sitting room-to listen
at the hall door

  there were men-how many she did not
know-moving about outside she thought
she could distinguish the clank of metal
there was a click as if a revolver was being
cocked

  swift as a darting swallow the girl
snatched up georges cap and threw it back
of a mirror

  she fled into her room and shook george
by the shoulders

   quiet she whispered  not a word
there are men outside valdezs men 

  george was awake instantly his jaw set
his hand instinctively reaching for his gun
eager to jump in and fight but the girl
cautioned him with finger on her lips

   not yet youve done enough fight-
ing

  suddenly there was a sharp rap on the
outer door then a succession of knocks as
if somebody were tapping the panel with
a revolver butt

   whos there cried tina and she left
george for a moment to throw back the
covers of her bed

   whos there and as she called in
tones of surprise she was backing george
against the wall beside her bedroom door

   stay there dont make a sound  she
whispered and as the knocking was repeat-
ed louder than ever she ran to the hall door
and opened it a crack

  instantly it was forced open and three
men had crowded into the room while a
couple more could be seen in the corridor

  one was in uniform a young smartly-
dressed police lieutenant with a military
mustache black against his clear olive skin
he carried himself with the swaggering air
of an army officer

  the others were in plain clothes detec-
tives of a nondescript appearance that
would never have been picked out among
the half caste population of rio

   what do you want asked tina back-
ing away from them

  the officer twisted his mustache and
gazed at her with insolent admiration


argosyrallstory weekly

   we want that assassin we want
george marchand which is his room

   that is his room and as she pointed
the two detectives sprang at the door
wrenched it open and rushed in

   hes not there george has not been
home to-night cried tina

  the detectives could be heard overhaul-
ing the room as if they expected to find
the man hiding under the bed or behind
the chairs

  they were cursing furiously perhaps to
prove to themselves that they had no fear
of  that vile assassin

  lieutenant rico stared suspiciously
around the sitting room then eyed tina
doubtfully

  but the girl clung to his arm in what
seemed an impulse of panic  oh dont
let them hurt me she cried youre a
gentleman save me from those ruffians
 i wont let them hurt you replied the
officer with a chivalrous air it is only
george that we want

   oh i tell you hes not here hes not
been here all night there was a row at
the cafe and he must have been afraid to
come home

  the detectives came out of georges
room  the brigand is not there they
said

  the officer glanced at the revolvers in
their hands and smiled sardonically

   lucky for him i see you were talcing
no chances

   would you shoot him down without a
chance to surrender

  tina stood before the officer with clasped
hands and terror in her face

  the lieutenant threw out his chest a
little as he replied

  not i it would take more than a
bandit like that to terrify me these fel-
lows would shoot him on sight but i-i
would just look him in the eye and subdue
him even if i did not have a weapon i
would subdue him

   how brave you are exclaimed tina
 a brave man is always cool in the face
of danger

  the girl was so evidently impressed by
his heroism that the lieutenant could not
help feeling kindly toward her

  how these timid little creatures adored
strong determined men

  there was a pause a moment of em-
barrassment as the officer searched those
frightened black eyes that drooped before
his frank appreciation

   must you be going now asked tina
shyly breaking the silence

  the officer came to himself

  as a matter of form you must permit
us to search your room he bowed with
exaggerated gallantry  a mere matter of
form i assure you

  tinas long eyelashes fluttered down on
her cheeks to meet the mounting color as
she spoke in frightened accents  must
you must you go into my room my
bedroom

   i have orders to search the house re-
plied lieutenant rico  but dont be
frightened i wont let my men in i wont
distress you

  youre kind youre a gallant gentle-
man breathed tina and she slipped back
into her room swinging the door against
the wall where george was concealed re-
volver in hand

  holding the knob she said  see for
yourself there is no one here

  the officer stood in the doorway and
swept the cloister-like bedchamber with
a glance his eyes rested upon the nar-
row white bed with the cover thrown back
he saw the image of the virgin above it
and hastily crossed himself

  never in his career had the officer been
nearer death than at that moment for
georges finger was on the trigger in his
eyes shone the fire of a man who was des-
perate with exhaustion and the strain of
pursuit if the lieutenant had looked be-
hind that door it would have been the last
act of his life

  instead of that lieutenant ricos eyes
met those of tina and he unconsciously
gave his mustache a little twist

   youll pardon the intrusion my dear
young lady mere matter of form he
murmured naturally he would not be
here but-orders you know

  and as he backed out of her bedroom the
officer added  i shall call at the cafe we
shall become better acquainted yes
the dancing doll



  tinas only answer was a smile but it
ravished that susceptible heart

  a moment later the footsteps of the in-
truders clattered down stairs and out into
tiiu street

chapter xx

valdez acts

what would pedro valdez do about
it that was the question on the
tongue of all rio

  the politician had insulted a married
woman and the husband had knocked him
down it was a public beating-not a thing
to be hushed up

  for the next few days the town was talk-
ing of nothing else and the newspapers kept
the gossip going the latest issues were
in demand in every club and public bar in
rio

  the coffee drinkers on the avenida drew
their heads together over the tables as they
read the headings

  young bloods declared that george was
right-that they too would have knocked
down the big boss in such a case

  but the older men declared that valdez
was taking too much time when they
were young-and they twisted their white
mustaches defiantly-such an attack on a
leading politician would be instantly wiped
out in blood in those days an affair of
honor was not allowed to grow cold-a
blow a challenge and at dawn the next
morning-crack-crack the pistols spoke
the short deadly words of the code an
insult like that demanded nothing less than
blood

  george going about his affairs at the
cafe la scala no longer feared arrest
brooding savagely over the loss of margot
he was longing for a fight

  the one thing he dreaded was that he
would be shot at or knifed in the back by
some paid thug he got into the habit of
scrutinizing carefully all the strangers in
the cafe he had a terrible shock one night
when he thought he recognized an old ac-
quaintance from bleecker street not one of
the gang but a fellow who sometimes drove
a car for them-but when he turned for

a second look at the man he had disap-
peared

   i guess i just dreamed it thought
george  what would tony be doing in
rio

  in those days george was the center of
attention the man who had defied the
big boss but he was no longer  the brig-
and the vile assassin

  to valdezs opponents he was a hero to
others he was the doomed man awaiting
execution at the point of the brazilians
sword or the muzzle of his duelling pistol

  for pedro had a reputation for gallantry
a fighting don juan

  meanwhile valdez sulked in his villa
though he spread threats of terrible venge-
ance abroad through the active tongues of
his hangers-on he did not take immediate
action

  perhaps he hoped that george would be
frightened at the rumors of slaughter and
sneak out of town perhaps he wished to
conquer by scaring his enemy to death

  but his parasites returned to tell him that
george only smiled at the tales of valdezs
skill with the sword and did not seem
greatly worried when he heard that his
enemy could shoot out a candle at forty
paces

  lieutenant rico whose order to arrest
george had been revoked spent much of
his time hanging over tinas desk he de-
clared that george was a terrible fighter
with sword knife and pistol and had slain
many men in duels in the streets of new
york-to say nothing of the wild indians
who lurked about that city he said this
so often that he finally believed it and be-
gan to admire the man he had tried to
arrest

  all this gave valdez something to think
about he instructed his confidential
agents to look up georges record in the
united states-question every man in rio
who had ever been in new york

  he even thought of bribing george se-
cretly to leave the country it would be
worth money to save his face that way but
somehow nothing came of this

  reluctantly he prepared to fight

  it was guy dalby who finally goaded
him to action the song-and-dance man


argosy-allstory weekly

had made such a nuisance of himself
ever since the word of margots marriage
had been spread that valdez was tempted
to throw him out bodily

  guy loudly blamed valdez for the girls
escape and when he ferreted out the truth
that she had gone to new york under con-
tract to dance on broadway he acted as
if the brazilian had been party to a fraud
on her guardian

   i know whats the matter youre
afraid otherwise youd take it out of that
low fellow somehow youd have him in
jail sell out his cafe make him pay dam-
ages

   you must be crazy retorted the en-
raged valdez  how can i sell his cafe
gian bori is part owner and he has
friends in rio

   well then why dont you fight him
i say are you really afraid of that beggar
because if you are ill fight him myself
such taunts were not to be borne they
might cost him his leadership in rio val-
dez flushed under his dark skin his heavy
lidded eyes flamed with resentment and
he clenched his fists as he threw curses
at guy dalby in english and portuguese

   ill fight the scoundrel he growled
that same night two young men of the
lounge-lizard type entered the cafe la
scala and drew george into a quiet comer
they had the honor they explained
haughtily of bearing a challenge from
senor pedro valdez

  there was only one alternative if george
would make a public apology his insult
might be overlooked otherwise they de-
sired to know the name of his seconds

   you expect me to apologize cried
george  ask pardon of that kidnaper-
that thug

   yes an apology-here in the cafe
before his friends-will avert bloodshed
pedro valdez is dangerous i advise you to
accept his generous offer

   valdez can go to hell with his gener-
osity he wants to see blood does he
fine hell see gallons of it his own
one of the young sports bowed and pre-
sented his card george read the name
 carlos pulcherio and the address at the
jockey club

  ill send my seconds to you in an
hour george said to-morrow morn-
ing ill have the pleasure of letting day-
light through your fat friend tell him to

make his will

  the elegantly clad youths bowed with
elaborate politeness and left the cafe as if
they were afraid of touching something un-
clean

  once outside they breathed more freely
 what a savage exclaimed carlos pul-
cherio  these americans of the north
uncivilized 

  his companion assented  drinkers of
blood they are indeed savages v
but an hour later they were discussing
the arrangements for the duel with one of
their own countrymen george had been
able to find only one acquaintance who un-
derstood such matters and that was lieu-
tenant rico the admirer of tina

  that gentleman when asked for advice
was delighted to be of service to tinas
supposed brother

   allow me to act as your second he
cried  forget that i took orders from
valdez to arrest you in an affair of
honor such things are overlooked valdez
is not a personal friend of mine no he
would not hold a grudge against me for
this it is quite impersonal and he
added with a smile  if you kill valdez
i need not fear him if he kills you he will
be pleased either way i have the pleasure
of serving you without danger to myself
but tina when she heard of what was
planned did not show such confidence
 dont trust that man too far she warned
that night in their sitting room  make
sure that your gun is properly loaded dont
let them slip blanks into your gat or do
you dirt some other way

   why do you think your friend lieu-
tenant rico would double-cross me

   no-not that hes straight-but hes
not very bright

  she pondered for a moment then added
 but maybe he wont be so dumb when
hes dealing with men just the same you
watch out

   ill take care they dont put one over
on me and one more thing

   yes george

                          	a
the dancing doll



   if im not so lucky-if i dont come
back-i want you to have all ive got
margot is taken care of by her contract
i wrote her a letter and left it with gian
bori to mail to-morrow shell under-
stand

   you want me to have your property
in case-

   sure-youre my pal i wrote it down
on a paper and had old bori witness it
but tina suddenly began to cry her
body shook with sobs

  oh george it gives me the willies to
hear youve made your will why did you
do it why i dont want your damned old
money

chapter xxi

two shots

george patted the shoulder of the
weeping girl her tears flowed for a
while then suddenly tina threw back
her head and brushed her hands across her
eyes

   forget it kid she said  that will
i mean

   why

   because theres only one thing to think
of plug him

  the girl fumbled at a thin silken cord
about her slender neck and drew a small
object from the warmth of her breast

  here wtear this she exclaimed
 this was blessed by a priest not by one
of these padres but by a real priest at
home-father luisi

  george received the amulet gravely as
she hung it about his neck her hand
touched his throat and the contact tingled
she was vibrant with pent-up emotion

   good night tina ive got to sleep for
a while-steady my nerves

   good night boy-good night

  she was at the door of her room when
suddenly she turned and ran back

   kiss me good night george her
arms were about his neck  no-dont
look so serious smile im not kissing you
good-by im kissing you for luck

  and tina was smiling as their lips met
for the first time

    a

  but once behind her own door the smile
had vanished she was on her knees turn-
ing a blanched drawn face imploringly to
the little image of the virgin

  protect him she whispered in ago-
nized prayer  dont let him get bumped
off madre di dio keep an eye on george
and dont let that dirty bum croak him
she stayed on her knees through the night
until the gray that heralds the dawn stole
through the shutters

  before daybreak tina slipped into
georges room on tiptoe he was fast
asleep and his face was as placid as if no
worry about the outcome of the duel had
ever troubled his dreams

  tina glanced about the room as she
touched him on the shoulder the walls
were bare the photographs of margot
had all been taken down and put out of
sight tina wondered why was it because
he found it too painful to look at them or
-she scarcely dared to hope-was he be-
ginning to care less for that beautiful
blonde with a heart as cool as the northland
of her birth

  george awoke at her touch and while
tina made coffee in the sitting room she
could hear him splashing away in cold
water she had drawn for him and
presently he came out smiling and whis-
tling his hair all rumpled from the bath

  the coffee was ready but george did not
sit down to drink it instead he walked up
and down the room sipping the hot brew
with boyish impatience

   one would think you were going to a
picnic said tina with a forced smile

   its a picnic for me but not for val-
dez ill be back again in a couple of hours
and then our troubles will be over

  she looked at him with wide questioning
eyes

   tell me one thing-are you going to
shoot to kill asked tina breathlessly

   no ive got it all figured out that
might mean more trouble ill put a bullet
through his arm and let it go at that

  there was the sound of a motor in the
street

   heres rico now with the car
said george  good-by kid-ill see you
later


argosy-allstory weekly

   good luck boy plug him for me 

  he was gone

  tina stood at the window looking
through the venetian blinds and saw the
boy she had prayed for leap into the car
between lieutenant rico and another of-
ficer his manner was as jaunty and gay
as if they were going off for a fishing trip
he glanced up waved carelessly to the
girlish figure in the window then turned to
talk to his two companions

  tina strained her eyes to follow it as
the motor slipped away in the gray light
then she dragged her feet wearily to her
bedroom as if she were being led to exe-
cution

  once more she fell on her knees before
the virgin and prayed silently

  the meeting place was a clearing on the
hilltop not far from valdezs country house
the villa where the party had been given
although george and his friends had much
farther to go they were first on the ground
when valdez did arrive with his seconds
and a gray bearded surgeon carrying a case
of instruments he looked surly and heavy
as if he had quieted his nerves with alcohol
or some drug

  the politician was very imposing in frock
coat and silk hat and the young men who
seconded him were fastidiously dressed

  while the seconds were measuring off the
ground the politician carefully laid aside
his coat and vest folded them and placed
his high hat on the pile of garments then
he stood with his arms crossed like the hero
of a melodrama scowling at george

  after a few moments consultation rico
returned to george and said in an under-
tone

   ive been told that you have one more
chance to apologize even now if you wish
to ask pardon before these gentlemen
senor valdez will let the matter drop

   were wasting time said george
 when does the shooting begin

  the pistols were not the sort of arms
george was accustomed to but heavy duel-
ing weapons firing only one shot they
were loaded with great formality by the
seconds and the choice was determined by
lot

  as he took his position in the field cov-
ered by dewy grass george could feel the
cool morning breeze from the sea blow
through his light shirt and caress his body
from where he stood there was a long
sweeping vista over the sleeping city the
broad harbor and the glory of the sea at
dawn a full throated chorus of birds was
jubilantly greeting the new day from the
tree tops their joyous music seemed to
echo back from the sky tinted like a pearl
and rosy in the east

  how beautiful the world was every
sunrise was a fresh miracle

  and waiting for the seconds command
to fire george felt a little swift pang a
feeling something like terror at the thought
that when the sun did rise he might not be
alive to see it

  his jauntiness had not been just a pose
until that moment it had actually not oc-
curred to him that a bullet from valdez
might strike him dead

  from life to death in a single second
george saw it in his minds eye as a bird
in careless flight through the air sudden-
ly there is a report a scattering of feathers
and the creature that was so full of life and
joy and energy drops a limp bedraggled
thing-dead

  in the instant that george realized that
he was facing death things seemed sud-
denly to take new values life itself the
mere fact of existence seemed tremendous-
ly precious just then

  before that he had simply taken it for
granted just as he had taken for granted
the best things of life his youth his
strength his friends the devotion of the
best little friend of all-tina

  tina what a plucky little kid she was
and what a friend time and again she
had stood by him and pulled him out of
one scrape after another why even this
very morning she had drawn his bath and
made his coffee and sent him on his way
with crisp words of courage

  she had smiled but all of a sudden he
realized that she must have been holding
back her tears she had given him her
amulet and at this moment no doubt she
was praying for his safety

  she loved him
the dancing doll



  the thought struck him like a blow
lina loved him and he was facing death
within a second with his mind dwelling
on that black eyed gypsylike little pal in-
stead of margot

  it was of tina that he thought when
he was about to die it must be tina that
he loved and he could never tell her
he was certain now that in valdezs gun
there was a bullet with his name written
on it

  but that certainty that came with light-
ning speed did not disturb his aim at
the word he raised his weapon and fired
swiftly

  the two shots rang out as one

  valdez with a scream of rage staggered
back clutching his left arm the gush of
blood had dyed his shirt sleeve a bright
red

  but george had fallen forward and lay
still with a bullet through his chest

  at the same moment with her face
turned up to the virgin tina was crying
piteously  oh dont let him die oh
dont let him die

chapter xxii

for a purpose

it was just an hour after george had
waved a jaunty good-by to tina his
seconds were on their way back to the
city with the stern pale faces of men who
had just looked at death lieutenant rico
wondered how he could break the news to
georges sister

  the more he thought about it the more
he felt that it was impossible it would be
like striking that lovely girl a blow in the
face

  how could he stand before her and tell
her that he had seen her brother shot
down that the doctor had shaken his
head after just one glance that george
was dead

  impossible he could not say such things
to the girl he had gavly flirted with night
after night at the cafe lieutenant rico
had courage of a sort but not that sort
he ordered the car driven to the cafe la
scala and although the place was not open

at that hour in the morning he battered
on the door until pierre vigney the old
pianist appeared with rumpled hair and
thrust an angry face through the crack of
the door

   where is gian bori asked lieuten-
ant rico  i must speak to him at
once

   hes at home in bed where he be-
longs growled the musician  what do
you want to see him about at this time of
the day

   its about his partner

   george has anything happened to
george

   dead shot through the chest
pierre vigney grasped the doorjamb to
steady himself against the shock
impossible george dead

   shot in a duel by valdez

   ah that duel so it has come off and
our poor boy is murdered

   why do you say murdered valdez
was in danger too in fact he was shot
through the arm it was a fair fight-
george was not murdered he was slain
on the field of honor everything was per-
fectly correct interrupted captain reyes
the other second with a lofty air

   oh yes everything was quite accord-
ing to the rules lieutenant rico assured
the old man he seemed to feel that no one
could have any complaints to make after
that statement  i give you my word
everything was perfectly correct

   correct bah a-ah you assassins
you are all assassins down here in this bar-
barous country what will gian bori
say the old musicians voice trembled
 bori thought of him as a son-almost
and his wife that adorable girl like a
little fairy who is waiting for him in
america and his poor sister what will
she say

   it is about his sister that i want to
talk to you lieutenant ricos dark eyes
were troubled  some one else must break
the news to her i cannot face her

   i can well believe that exclaimed the
old man fiercely  any one who had a
hand in that crime would not care to face
her

   why do you call it a crime old man


argosy-allstory weekly

demanded captain reyes  i tell you it
was an affair of honor

   ha ha  laughed pierre vigney bitter-
ly  if there was any honor in the affair
pedro valdez would not be involved in it
i saw how it all began i saw how valdez
insulted our lovely margot when george
knocked him down he should have killed
him outright-that would have been just

  pierre vigney nodded his gray head
mournfully like a philosopher who has seen
a lifetime of suffering then added  such
is life the wicked man the aggressor tri-
umphs the just man is slain life is like
that

  the seconds turned to go  weve done
our duty said lieutenant rico  it was
very painful will you tell his sister that
tell her she has our sympathy-from the
heart

  and he placed his hand on his chest with
a theatrical gesture

  pierre vigney set out on his errand it
was the most painful journey in his long
and unhappy life the few short blocks that
he had to walk before reaching tinas
apartment his feet seemed to cling to the
sidewalk as if they were held down by
chains

  laboriously he climbed the stairs to her
room and tapped feebly on the door tina
opened it pale and haggard and at the
sight of the wretched face and bowed
shoulders of her friend she knew all that he
had to say

  youve come about george she
whispered through dry lips from which all
the blood had fled

  the old man nodded mournfully and
the tears rolled down his withered cheeks

  tina clutched her breast with both
hands

   is he badly hurt she stammered

   killed

  with a despairing moan the girl dropped
as if a bullet had struck her the old man
was forced to lift her and stagger painfully
under the inert body

  when he laid her on the bed pierre
vigney was horrified her face was so
ghastly her breathing so spasmodic it
appeared that she was dying before his
eyes

  frantically he hunted for brandy to force
down her throat for cold water to badie
her forehead and finally he ran out to find
a doctor

  when after a long search he did suc-
ceed in bringing a physician to the apart-
ment it looked as if help had come too
late the girl lay there like a corpse

  the doctor worked over her with
restoratives but his efforts only caused her
to open her eyes feebly like a dying
woman

  they sent for gian bori and his wife
who declared that she would sit at the girls
bedside until she was cured but even her
care was not enough it was necessary to
find a trained nurse as well and for days
and weeks the girls life hung in the bal-
ance

   it is nothing unusual declared the
physician  for a girl with a high strung
nervous temperament to be prostrated by
such a shock as the news of her brothers
death

  while tinas life hung in the balance
gian bori and his wife did not leave the
apartment they directed pierre vigney
to arrange for the burial of their murdered
son

  but the old man returned from an inter-
view with valdezs secretary and brought
the word that the body had been given a
christian burial

  the politician himself was not to be
found the bullet in his arm had con-
fined him to his bed but the secretary
had been courteous and expressed regret
at the sad occurrence his employer so
he said was remorseful at the outcome of
the duel and had paid the priest and the
undertaker

  pierre vigney had even visited the ceme-
tery and seen the fresh grave

  it was a high-handed proceeding gian
bori stormed and raged at this fresh out-
rage but what could he do the boy
was dead perhaps after all valdez had
meant well in having him buried

  he could only show his grief by ordering
a handsome monument to be placed over
the new grave and he spent all the af-
fection that he felt for george in devoting
himself to tinas recovery
the dancing doll



  it was a month before the girl was able
to leave the apartment and drive to the
cemetery where she laid a wreath on the
stone that bori had placed there pale
and broken in spirit with little trace of the
former madcap dancer she returned list-
lessly to the house and when gian bori
and his wife begged her to come and live
with them she refused like one who has no
comfort in life

   no no-i cant stay on in rio she
said  the place is hateful to me every-
thing i see reminds me of george and i
cant stand it

   what will you do then

   i want to go back to new york i
have friends there you did not know it
but i have an old father perhaps when
i am home again it will be easier to for-
get

  gian bori dealt most generously with
the girl in the settlement of georges estate
he did not seriously oppose her return to
her home when he was once convinced
that she could never be happy in rio

  and thus it came about that tina took
passage for new york two months after
the duel while the lover she mourned as
dead was fighting his way to recovery on a
plantation in the jungle

  he was being nursed back to health by
the best physician that valdez could pay
for everything that money could buy was
used to save his life

  nevertheless he was a prisoner he was
a captive kept by pedro valdez for a
purpose

chapter xxiii

a perfect revenge

it was not because pedro valdez had
suddenly grown tender-hearted that he
was trying to nurse his enemy back to
life on the contrary he was so enraged
by the wound in his arm that he would
have been callous enough to leave the body
where it fell

  but the surgeon dr ribiera returned
to the fallen man after the arm had been
bandaged to assure himself that the victim
was really dead

  to his astonishment he found the heart
fluttering feebly no more than the faintest
spark of life but that was enough with
the instinct of a healer he worked with all
his skill to snatch the dying man from the
jaws of death

  georges seconds had already gone away
in the car the surgeon had told them to
notify the relatives and that he would ar-
range to have the body removed but
when he found that there was still hope
he insisted on carrying george to the near-
est house and that was the villa of pedro
valdez

   why should i help you save the life
of that scoundrel snarled the politician
 that anarchist-the scum that tried to
assassinate me

   it would be nothing less than murder
to do otherwise protested the doctor
 you are a man of honor a gentleman not
a murderer

   all right was the grudging response
 bring him along and do as you think
best but it would give me greater pleasure
to put my pistol to his head and blow out
his brains

  an hour later valdez was in bed trying
to restore his strength with morning choco-
late when guy dalby was announced he
had rushed up from the city breathless with
important news

  oh i say he exclaimed as he saw
the bandaged arm resting stiffly on a pil-
low  the beggar plugged you did you
return the compliment

  valdez scowled at his visitor over his
chocolate

   i killed the blackguard he may have
crippled me for life-why i may even lose
my arm-but i killed him at least i hope
i did 

   you killed him oh i say that spoils
everything 

   im not sure whether hell pull through
the doctor hopes to save him but i dont
think hes worth the trouble

   i want to see him get well declared
guy with decision

  you you want him to live i thought
you hated him as much as i do

   i want him to live because his trou-
bles are just beginning listen valdez


argosy-allstory weekly

weve got his record that beggar is want-
ed in new york for murder

  the politician started so violently that
he almost upset his cup the movement
jarred his wounded arm and made him cry
out in agony then he stared at dalby
with bloodshot eyes

   is it true youre not drunk-or
crazy

   its true old dear the detectives
have been questioning every stranger in the
city about george marchand they round-
ed up an immigrant from new york an
italian who claimed to be a chauffeur a
rather fishy sort i think but he says he
knows all about george marchand his
real name is george marcanda and this
fellow describes him perfectly even to the
scar on his cheek he recognized george
in the cafe la scala

   so ive been fighting a duel with a
criminal snapped valdez flushing with
rage

   yes he got away from new york
after killing a policeman one of his con-
federates was caught and executed he was
a notorious gangster happy george they
called him

   if id known that before i wouldnt
be sitting here with my arm in a sling
growled valdez  and that fellow would
have been in a cell where he belongs

   quite so you could have honorably
refused to fight a man of that sort-a
fugitive from justice you could have held
him in jail for extradition

   it may not be too late yet if dr
ribiera pulls him through we can cable
to new york and they will send an officer
to take him back it would be a happy
day for me if i could hear that he was
executed

  but guy dalby tapped his wrist with a
forefinger  i have a better plan than
that old dear he said  there is a re-
ward offered for this murderer it seems
that some millionaire in new york was a
friend of the bobby who was killed the
reward is quite handsome-ten thousand
dollars

   well what about it

   just this suppose i go to new york
and get all the facts in the case then i

can inform the police and claim the re-
ward you put up my traveling expenses
and well split fifty-fifty

  valdez made a magnificent gesture

   the money is nothing to me what i
want is to see this brigand executed to
think that ive been struck in the face and
shot by a common criminal

   to say nothing of being cheated out
of the girl you want added guy dalby

  you are right valdez snarled i
want to see that scoundrel suffer

   im with you on that at the same
time that reward means something to me
even if its just small change to you if
we dont handle this right somebody else
-that italian who knows him-may step
in and claim the reward now heres a
plan thats perfectly topping who knows
that george is still alive

   only the doctor and my seconds-all
trustworthy men the report has been
spread that he was killed

   righto that makes it very simple
let every one believe that george was
killed say that youve had him buried
a man of your power can fix the details
fake a death certificate and bribe the un-
dertaker you can even have a fresh grave
made in the cemetery for a perfect alibi
meanwhile keep george out of sight until
i can go to new york and claim that ten
thousand dollars reward

  valdez smiled with evil pleasure the
scheming and deception that was required
added a certain zest to his revenge

   there is one little detail that you have
forgotten my dear friend he suggested
 it will be the finishing touch to our little
plot

   lets hear it

   i will advance you the passage money
to new york i will let you keep the
entire reward the whole ten thousand dol-
lars in return for this you will see to
it that george is taken back to be exe-
cuted

   yes yes-thats the agreement

   and in addition you will bring back
your lovely ward i am very anxious that
before george goes to his death he shall
know that i have possessed margot what
do you think of my plan dalby
the dancing doll



  guy extended his hand  its topping
old boy well make that fellow squirm
if your surgeon can only keep him alive
well both even up our old scores

  meanwhile in a shabby bedroom that
had once been used by a servant george
lay gasping feebly only his painful
breathing told that he was alive for his
face was deathly pale and he had not re-
covered consciousness

  the doctor shook his head despairingly
more than once during that day while he
wrestled for the life of george marcanda
time and again he thought that the fight
was lost but every time the stubborn vi-
tality of the patient pulled him through

  dr ribiera was a devout man a good
catholic and a believer in miracles his
scientific training had not shaken his faith
in divine intervention

  when he saw the amulet that tina had
hung about georges neck he wondered
whether this young mans life was not
spared by some power beyond the realm of
science

   by rights the bullet should have killed
him he murmured  perhaps some wom-
an who loves him is praying for him and
god is listening to her prayers and the
good doctor made the sign of the cross

chapter xxiv

tiie working of the plan

for weeks while george wrestled with
death he was kept out of sight in
valdezs house only dr ribiera was
permitted to see him and that good man
was given no hint of the revenge that pedro
valdez was planning against his patient

  on the contrary when the doctor in-
formed valdez that george was recovering
more slowly because he worried at getting
no news from his friends the politician in-
vented some messages from gian bori
from tina and even from margot

  they were reassuring messages that the
sick man was too feeble to analyze very
carefully under their false hope he be-
gan to gain so that in answer to valdezs
q uestion the doctor announced tnat george
would be able to travel soon

   i have no more hate for that young
man valdez assured the doctor with an
oily smile  for though my arm still gives
me great pain-yes even though you tell
me that it will always be weak and stiff-
yet i do not hate him

  you are a good christian senor val-
dez and the surgeon made the sign of the
cross  our lord teaches us to forgive
our enemies

  valdez smiled at the doctors simplicity
and continued  it is my plan to take the
young man to one of my estates the
change of air the quiet life on a coffee
plantation will do him good

   an excellent idea agreed the doctor

   and you shall go along my worthy
friend you will be paid well for your time
and your only duty will be to see that the
young man is completely restored valdez
dismissed the surgeon with a lordly ges-
ture and turned to his correspondence

  guy dalby had reported from new york
and his plans seemed to be working out as
he desired

  still there was a certain vagueness about
dalbys letter some of the sentences were
so rambling that the politician wondered
whether the man who wrote that letter had
been quite sober

  but he gathered that there was a re-
ward offered for george marcanda and
that when the time was ripe guy dalby
would claim it meanwhile a few hundred
dollars would be welcome

  of margot little was said in the letter
it seemed that harbison had taken her out
of the city probably to some place where
she could rehearse for the act that was to
startle broadway dalby had not seen her

  valdez smiled as he thought of the little
surprise he had for both guy and margot
and most of all for george this was his
surprise

  the marriage that had been made the
pretext for a duel instead of summary jail
proceedings was no more than a fraud val-
dez had decided to search the records right
after georges departure and then had fol-
lowed a long interview and a very painful
one for the official who performed the cere-
mony

  that tricky old aguirre had been turned


argosy-allstory weekly

inside out like a sack under the searching
questions of the political boss he had
been forced to admit that the legal forms
had not been complied with that he had
taken money to doctor the records and fake
certain documents

  under the bullying of valdez the old
man crumpled up and cried like a baby
he was finally released pallid and trem-
bling glad to escape losing his position
and to keep out of jail

  the price of his freedom was the sworn
statement that the marriage was no mar-
riage at all but a plot with intent to de-
ceive and defraud

   this will be my little present to
george muttered valdez with a smile
it will cheer him on his way to execution

  it was with difficulty that the politician
had restrained himself from going into
georges room to gloat over his helpless-
ness but he took a savage pleasure in hav-
ing dr ribiera recite the details of the
boys sufferings and his painful conva-
lescence

  he liked to imagine how the spasms
would shoot through georges body as he
breathed with that bullet-torn lung

  every time his own stiff arm gave him
a twinge valdez would think of the suf-
fering that his enemy was feeling at that
moment and he rejoiced at the still
greater suffering that would follow when
his rival would be handed over to be ex-
ecuted

  he had learned that the legal execution
in new york was not shooting not be-
heading not the garrote but electrocution
he thought it must be very painful

  he even experimented with an electrical
machine that gave slight shocks and would
hold on to the handles until it would seem
that his wrists would swell and burst then
he would try to imagine how a man would
suffer to endure that agony until death

  he hoped that dr ribiera would make
the patient strong and vigorous so that the
torture would last a long time

  so when george was finally loaded into
an automobile one night and sent across
the mountains under the doctors care it
was as a steer that is to be fattened for the
butcher

  george was too weak to protest he
was not able to stand and the jolting of the
car gave him a great deal of pain but the
doctor told him again and again of his
rivals kindness and his forgiving spirit un-
til george almost believed that a miracle
had happened in the soul of his enemy

  then he would have a vision of pedro
valdez like a moving picture the heavy
face the pouches under the thick-lidded
eyes the insolence of the sensual mouth un-
der its long mustache and he would won-
der how dr ribiera could be victimized by
such a man

  at the end of the motor highway the
doctor and patient were forced to continue
their journey over rough mountain roads
in an ox cart

  it was a primitive affair with two enor-
mous wooden wheels that screamed on their
axles like souls in purgatory

  dr ribiera was horrified he had not
realized that they would have any hard-
ships on the trip but it was too late to
turn back the best he could do was to
direct the driver to proceed very cautiously
and to make long halts as they journeyed
through the primeval jungle

  from day to day the road became less
traveled the huts of the natives or peons
were farther and farther apart and the un-
broken mass of the tropical forest seemed to
close in upon them like a sea of heavy
poisonous green

  it was not until the end of the sixth day
that they reached the coffee plantation one
of the most remote of valdezs estates

  there they were received by the foreman
a dusky giant part portuguese part ne-
gro who was reputed to be an illegitimate
half brother of his employer

  manoel received them with a meaning
smile he had received complete instruc-
tions from his half brother and knew what
was expected

  the guests were to be given a small
house by themselves furnished with provi-
sions and other supplies and were to be
kept incommunicado

  george was not to be allowed to escape
and manoel thought he could manage that
no peons ever escaped from the plantation
that he managed
the dancing doll



  outwardly he resembled the serfs who
worked for him he wore dirty cotton
trousers a ragged shirt that exposed his
chest with its growth of hair and his bare
feet were protected with primitive sandals

  but in one or two details he differed from
the peons from a cartridge belt hung a
heavy  a quirt always dangled from
his wrist and wherever he went he carried
a carbine slung from his saddle when he
rode and laid across his knees when he was
sitting down

  those weapons the only ones on the es-
tate represented the law of that clearing
in the jungle

chapter xxv

in the tropic night

at first manoel treated george and the
l doctor with a careless good nature
they were provided with quarters of
their own a primitive hut near the ranch
house and supplied with food

  the strangers were something to break
the monotony of life on the plantation and
as long as the novelty lasted the manager
was willing to drink fiery spirits with them
play cards and otherwise condescend to
something approaching friendliness

  but it seemed like the playfulness of a
bear an untamed gigantic brute who had
them in his power he was a savage who
might turn on them to rend and slay with-
out notice

  as george recovered his strength under
dr rib i eras care the half-caste put more
contempt into his familiarity and less bluff
sportiveness

  manoel would address him by nicknames
that might be either meant as insults or
merely facetiousness he would deal him
heavy slaps on the shoulder-that might be
meant cordially but that might be taken as
real blows for manoel had muscles like a
buffalo

  sometimes he did not send food to the
hut-forgot it on purpose once he sent
his house boy with a jar of drinking water
that was unspeakably filthy-a specimen of
his ffrim humor

for some time george did not guess the

cause of this needless brutality he won-
dered whether manoel had been instructed
by his half brother to make their life mis-
erable by a series of petty injuries and in-
sults

  it was dr ribiera who enlightened hirm
 its that girl rosita who is causing
all the trouble my friend

   rosita that indian girl that manoel
is fond of

   shes not exactly indian she is a mix-
ture of the brazilian jungle native negro
portuguese you would do well to treat
her with great diplomacy

george flushed  ive hardly looked at
manoels woman is the filthy brute jeal-
ous why i wouldnt touch the creature
 thats it you show too plainly that
you regard her as dirt under your feet

   what else is she

   a woman the doctor smiled shrewd-
ly  in this little kingdom in the wilder-
ness rosita is a du barry a pompadour
she can make or break any one who crosses
her

   all right ill be civil to manoels cof-
fee-colored favorite

   do but for heavens sake be careful
not to overdo it if the savage who fon-
dles her should regard you as a rival it
would be sudden death for both of us
george laughed but he was a bit uneasy
nevertheless it was a difficult course to
steer and he found it so as soon as he
began to show the slightest friendliness to
the dusky charmer

  when he touched his cap and bade her
good morning in the clearing before the
ranch house rosita threw him a languorous
glance from her great melting eyes and her
lips parted to show the whiteness of her
teeth

  a little later she took occasion to pass the
shady spot where he was sitting and once
more that look of invitation was flung over
her shoulder

  she paused for a moment to see if he
would respond and when she moved on a
purple flower was lying on the ground where
she had stood

  george had merely nodded at the second
encounter nodded a little curtly for he felt
a sudden terror of the girl


argosy-allstory weekly

  rosita was not ugly at all now that
their eyes had met and he had seen the lure
that lighted from under her drooping eye-
lashes he realized with a little shock that
rosita was a beauty a savage creature no
doubt but possessed of a violent and sen-
sual beauty like that flower with the heavy
petals that she had let fall

  after a time george rose and strolled
carelessly across the cleared space picking
up the flower as he passed it

  it was heavy the petals were fleshy
and its heart seemed to be cloyed with rank
honey a sweet odor came from its depths
perfume so overpowering as to be almost
repellant

  george examined the tropical flower care-
fully he had never seen one just like it
before he held it to his nostrils for
a moment then stuck it in his belt and
moved on

  that same evening george caught a
glimpse of the girl as she sat before the
ranch house nestling in the curve of ma-
noels burly arm even while her lover
was in the act of caressing her rosita man-
aged to flash a signal to this white man her
latest caprice george quickened his steps
to avoid a scene

  he played cards with dr ribiera until
late that night

  the heat was intense and the two friends
retired to their hammocks hoping that they
had induced a drowsiness by their late hours
that would send them to sleep in spite of
the oppressive heat and the attacks of
mosquitos

  dr ribiera was lucky he managed to
drop off to sleep but george tossed and
rolled until the hammock swayed under him
and his single garment was wringing with
sweat

  his mind had been busied with thoughts
of tina more and more her image so gay
and provocative so daring and tender at
once had filled his waking hours and his
dreams

  several times there had been messengers
from rio ragged peons in charge of ox
carts loaded with supplies george had in-
quired whether any of these had brought
letters from his friends

  manoel had grinned carelessly and re-

plied that there were no letters but that his
brother pedro had sent warm regards to
his guest and assurances that his friends in
rio were well and happy-that they looked
forward to georges return

  to dr ribiera this sounded perfectly
satisfactory and when george confided his
doubts and anxieties to the physician he
was promptly reassured if his friends did
not write well-the doctor shrugged and
threw out his hands-it was because there
was nothing to write about why worry
as soon as he was well enough pedro would
return his guest to rio the duel and all
other unpleasantness would be forgotten

  so argued the confiding and generous-
hearted dr ribiera a man of such gentle-
ness and innate goodness that he could
hardly imagine the depths of evil in other
souls

  but george had no such childlike faith
as on many nights before he lay awake
this torrid night and wondered about tina
and margot

  margot was in new york long before
this was her name already shining in
lights on broadway then tina his mind
came back to her again and again when
would he see her to tell her that he had
discovered it was she and no other that
he loved

  finally unable to endure any more he
sat up touched the earthen floor with his
bare feet and slid quietly out of the hut
into the brilliance of the tropical moon-
light

  not a light burned in all the plantation
only the radiance of the full moon lighted
his path it glinted from the leaves of the
coffee bushes it bathed the tops of the
huge forest trees and cast profound inky
shadows beneath their masses of foliage

  the silence was broken only by the in-
describable calls and twitterings of small
creatures of the night and by the raucous
breathing from the house where manoel
slept

  from the ravine that lay in the direction
opposite to the ranch house came the plash
and gurgle of water george turned and
followed the trail to the stream

  after a plunge in the cooling waters he
might be able to sleep
the dancing doll



  as he cautiously felt his way down the
slippery path the breath from the under-
growth filled his lungs with a warm sickly
whiff of a hothouse

  it was full of mysterious strange odors
perfumes of flowers that might be as poi-
sonous as they were sweet the odor of
decaying leaves and of wet moss a strange
mingling of the scents that betokened life
and death in fevered riotous contact

  leaves and twigs brushed against his
face a creeper caught his leg and he could
hear a snake slither away at his approach
ferns brushed against his knees as he drew
near to the bank of the stream

  when he paused ankle deep in the rivu-
let there was a swift stirring in the bushes
as if a wild animal had been startled at
his intrusion

  without other warning george strug-
gled in the sudden embrace of two warm
clinging arms and a body that clung to
him as a python winds about its prey

chapter xxvi

just one lash

hot lips forced themselves upon his
mouth and clung

george could feel the rise and fall
of her bosom as the girl absolutely invisible
in that forest darkness held him to her with
all the abandon of her unchecked emotions

  for a second his own young blood an-
swered her his heart beat in rhythm to her
own and he was on the point of yielding

  then something pride of race the bal-
ance of reason that civilization brings to
bear against the clamor of the senses made
him resist

  or perhaps it was something more per-
sonal the thought of that other girl-a
thought that made these fierce embraces
appear merely bestial

  with a sudden angry movement george
exerted all his strength and thrust her from
him she was hurled headlong to the
ground and sprang up a quivering passion-
ate wild thing

   what the devil are you up to who
are you

 you-you can ask me that after-

after wearing my flower her voice came
plaintive and charged with passion from
the darkness

    rosita 

  george felt a chill of horror at what he
had escaped he was in no less danger
even now if manoel should find him in
the forest with his sweetheart no vengeance
would be too terrible and manoel car-
ried the only weapons on the estate power
of life and death was his

  if george had cared for the girl-if he
had even been inflamed by her ardent ad-
vances he might have taken the risk of
death by torture but rosita with all of
her physical allure was nothing to him

  and for that reason the very violence
of her onslaught turned his indifference to
loathing

   keep off he commanded in a sharp
whisper

  he dared not raise his voice for fear of
bringing the little community down upon
them in alarm

  dont touch me keep off

  she was approaching him on her knees
trying to draw him down to her

  then with a sudden return of prudence
he bent low and whispered in her ear  not
now my beautiful rosita manoel is
awake i heard him stirring another
time and he had fled up the trail to
his hut

  george slept no more that night he lay
awake tortured by the heat the singing in-
sects and the thought of what might re-
sult from this encounter

  he made up his mind to escape from the
plantation as soon as possible the dan-
ger of finding his way through the jungle
would be great the risks from wild animals
from poisonous snakes and insects from
hunger and exhaustion and the pursuit of
manoel

  but to stay here subject to the caprice
of rosita who was the object of that giant
savages affections that meant certain
death

  he would escape from the plantation
the very next night somehow he would
secure food and perhaps a revolver but
one way or another he must escape and
soon


argosy-allstory weekly

  the next morning rosita saw him from
a distance and turned her back her man-
ner was sullen and angry and george real-
ized that she had found manoel asleep on
her return to the house she had seen
through his ruse and was furious

  worried at the premonition of impending
disaster george retired to his hut he
crawled into his hammock and tried to get
some sleep he suffered from a slight fever
and the sight of food nauseated him

   come on my dear friend urged dr
ribiera about mid-day  this will do you
good see theyve sent us a stew of rice
and chicken from the ranch house

  but george shook his head and the doc-
tor mixed him up something from his med-
icine case instead

  dr ribiera smacked his lips over the
unusual luxury of chicken and rice stewed
with peppers and ate greedily

  in an hour he was dead

  the end had come so suddenly a violent
attack of cramps followed by convulsions
of the final agony that george did not have
time to call for assistance

  he stared at his friends body with
horror

  suspicion-more than suspicion a cer-
tainty of what had happened dawned upon
him

  picking up the dish with the remains of
the chicken stew he threw it into the court-
yard and instantly dogs were fighting over
the bones the largest and greediest of the
curs was the one who first showed the re-
sults even as george watched him the
gaunt and mangy hound commenced to dis-
play symptoms of uneasiness he ran
about in a staggering trot snapping and
staring blindly and presently collapsing in
a heap he was seized with a spasmodic con-
traction of the muscles that ended in a
death struggle

   poisoned as george gasped the ter-
rible word horrified at the death which
had been planned for himself and his
friend he saw a strange figure in the door-
way of the ranch house

  a man dressed in neatly pressed white
garments was a unique figure in the jungle
even dr ribiera and george had been un-
ble to keep themselves presentable

  as the stranger emerged from the shadow
of the doorway approaching georges hut
with deliberate heavy steps his features be-
came recognizable

  it was pedro valdez

  george strode out to meet him with his
fists clenched valdez whistled over his
shoulder and manoel appeared followed by
rosita she was arrayed in unaccus-
tomed finery evidently in honor of the
masters visit

  george faced the group with blazing
eyes

   you murderers he screamed  you
cowards you assassins youve poisoned
dr ribiera

   whats all this pedro turned to his
half brother with raised eyebrows and anger
in his voice

  manoel shrugged  hes crazy i dont
know what hes talking about

  only rosita shrank cowering from pe-
dros stare

   dont deny it cried george  the
doctor is in the hut dead he ate the
food you sent him i fed the scraps to a
dog look he pointed an accusing fin-
ger at the hound that lay lifeless in the
sun

  the politician glared at his brother

   what kind of tricks have you been
up to snarled pedro  it is unfortunate
that the doctor should have perished-but
i could overlook that he was unimpor-
tant but this man he flashed an evil
smile in georges direction  he has been
reserved for a special punishment

  valdez faced george with a triumphant
sneer  how do you like it here on my
plantation eh so far it has been good
but wait first you will be flogged then
you will be worked like a slave and every
week you will receive another flogging

   and that is not all your dear friend
guy dalby has gone to new york to tell
the police you are here you will be ex-
ecuted bound to a chair and tortured by
electricity according to the law of your bar-
barous country how do you like that
george was aghast at the plot devised by
guy dalby and pedro valdez his tor-
mentor turned to manoel and continued

   but i told you that you could work this
the dancing doll



fellow with the peons i said you could
even beat him-not too much-but i ex-
pressly forbade you to kill him who has
tried to poison him

   i know nothing about it said manol
sullenly all i know is that i have made
up my mind to have him flogged to-day
 flogged to-day why

   strung up and flogged by the two
strongest blacks on the place declared
manoel  rosita swears that this wretched
pasty-faced outcast tried to make love to
her-would you believe it the scoundrel
had the audacity to try to take away my
girl 

  valdez looked at rosita with a slow ap-
preciative smile  did he succeed my pret-
ty one did he force you to give him a
kiss

  rosita let her eyes droop shyly and then
she flashed a look of anger at george  let
me see him flogged she begged

  at a whistle from manoel two negroes
had come running and george found him-
self in their grasp even before the wound
had weakened him george would have been
helpless in the grip of these half-naked
giants

  pedro valdez smiled sardonically as he
drew near the girl and allowed her weight
to rest on his shoulder  you little devil
ill wager it was you who tried to poison
him he spoke in caressing accents

  no no no cried rosita but id
love to see him flogged i would like to
flog him with my own hands please
she clasped her hands in supplication  let
me hold the whip -just one lash

the line that lasts

they talk of  lines  that maidens  pull 

  with men and hint of methods clever

they speak of  bluff  and  talk  and  bull

  theres just one line that lasts forever
and never fails its always had em
the men and hauled em on the shelf
since eve demurely lisped to adam

   now tell me all about yourself

they talk so solemnly the men

   of womans ruses sly and skillful

they call her weak and vain-and then
they call her proud and strong and willful
no wonder every flapper smiles

  who knows as half the flappers do

the simple phrase that so beguiles-

  its  now lets talk of you-just you

perhaps shes warm-perhaps shes cold-

  perhaps shes plain-perhaps shes pretty-

perhaps shes shy--perhaps shes bold

  it doesnt matter mores the pity

she doesnt need a childish pout-

  a rippling laugh-a low sweet brow-

for when she says  lets talk about
yourself he loves her anyhow

a sharp wind nagged at the lower city
as janet murdock came out of the
blade building and made her way
across city hall park it was a blustery
sort of gale picking up stray bits of paper
as it scampered along and lifting sudden
eddies of dust into the eyes of the hurrying
throngs it sent the blood whipping
through janets veins and the color flood-
ing her cheeks there was still time--they
did not receive visitors at the tombs until
two oclock-for a brisk walk before keep-
ing her appointment

  appointment was hardly the name for it
she thought grimly it seemed a thorough-
ly fruitless undertaking to her and she was
annoyed with the whole affair there had
been no appointment made-wade had seen
to that-and she had no certainty that the
warden would grant her an interview with
mme le montague she knew from long
experience the impatience of prison officials
with anything that smacked of a sob story
especially with the trial so near at hand
but it had been wades idea-and with
him to think was to act

  no other city editor shed ever known
but would have had the whole thing ar-

ranged beforehand so that it would go otr
smoothly and the success of the venture
be assured wade was not that kind  no
favors was his motto let everybody
work out his own salvation

   just go dowm to the visitors house
he had ordered  send in your card and ask
to see mme le montague ever been in-
side of that visitors house say its a
scream no privacy-no conference cham-
bers for the favored ones to sit and dis-
cuss things on the q t with their friends
no siree its the essence of democracy-
a sort of bedlam let loose get in and give
us a picture of her in that atmosphere
shes a good looker the police reporters tell
me play that up shes one of the slick-
est crooks in the world if shes pulled that
job-fifty thousand dollars worth of liber-
ty bonds-think of it lets hear your
impressions-the general environment is
what we want shes in with all the riff-
raff of the city tell us how she sizes up
with judy ogrady ask her anything you
like-what she thinks her chances for ac-
quittal are if she has any friends or rela-
tives with her anything you like-but
get the atmosphere 


judgments



  the walk in the bracing air had a sooth-
ing effect on janets temper and she felt
her impatience subside and her interest
quicken as she turned into center street
and saw the gray granite walls of the tombs
just before her a large crowd had gath-
ered in the street and janet soon discovered
the cause of their interest they were all
intent on a gate in the prison wall marked
visitors entrance

  so she must stand with this seething
mob until they saw fit to admit her this
would have pleased wade-no chance here
for any special consideration

  janet glanced curiously over the crowd
people of all races and nationalities were
jostling for positions of advantage here
and there sad eyed italian women lugging
heavy infants in their arms while others
tugged at their voluminous skirts waited
stolidly a slender little woman of the
orient clad in her native dress stood apart
trying to appear unconscious undoubted-
ly the innocent sufferer of some episode of
the tongs was janets thought colored
men and women long-whiskered jews
plain americans of every caste and condi-
tion crowded the narrow street

  a slim little italian girl engaged janet
in conversation her sweetheart was in
there yes he had been in a stabbing
affair in halting english interspersed with
many pious ejaculations she related the
story calling upon all the saints to wit-
ness his innocence did janet think there
was danger of his being convicted courts
were so cruel

  janets attempt at reassurance was sud-
denly cut short the gate was open the
line was moving

  she found herself inside the building in
a long corridor on one side of which be-
hind a rail and a wire caging ranged a
series of booths these booths were al-
ready occupied by prisoners the air was
alive with wails and calls and conversation
shouted in every tongue eager questions
hurled across the space halting answers
from gray and hopeless lips sobs and gig-
gles and angry epithets

  how useless thought janet was there
any one there able to pick his answer from
that bedlam of sound poor wretches

what an interloper she felt in the face of
all that misery her old irritation with
wade arose again and she was about to
struggle toward the entrance when an at-
tendant approached her she told him that
she had come to see mme le montague

   ill see if shell come down chances
are her counsel wont let her talk to any
one

  janet thanked him and waited her little
italian acquaintance had gained entrance
and was standing near shouting to her
sweetheart on the opposite side janet
watched the dark eager face with its swift
change of expression as a perfect torrent of
emotion poured from her lips the only
word he uttered but it came at regular in-
tervals was a repetition of  si-si- but
his face glowed

  janet smiled and moved nearer shes
brought him good news poor soul shed
speak to the girl later might be a story

	 m

m it

   mme le montague  see you miss
shes over there

  janet turned and looked across a tall
dark woman clad simply but perfectly in a
black crepe gown the long lines accentuat-
ing her grace and slimness looked ques-
tioningly across the gap her dark eyes
set in a face of extreme pallor had an ex-
pression that janet found it hard to fathom
they were not unfriendly-for when janet
bowed her rouged lips parted in a smile

  she gestured deprecatingly at the motley
throng as if apologizing for the poverty
of her welcome then in a low voice she said
something in rapid french janet moved
nearer above the din she heard her own
voice frame the question

   on the eve of your trial mme le
montague the blade would like to know
upon what you base your hope of acquit-
tal how crass and bold it sounded the
words were scarcely out of her mouth be-
fore she wished that she could take them
back

  at the mention of the blade janet no-
ticed an almost imperceptible straightening
of the womans figure-as if bracing herself
for an attack but the lips continued to
smile as she pressed forward and in per-
fectly collected tones said


argosy-allstory weekly

   upon ze evidence of course mademoi-
selle a bon droit-

   will you have friends with you
madame are your people in this coun-
try there was a full minutes hesita-
tion then janet caught the answer

   i am alone in zis countree a weary
little smile played about the corners of her
mouth and janet knew she was studying
the effect of this answer upon her ques-
tioner then wearily  it is imposseeble
mademoiselle-this mob -indicating with
a shrug of her expressive shoulders her
feeling for her associates- i weesh i might
spik wiz you in private but no-it is not
permit please excuse i am sorry
mercil

  janet watched the trim figure move down
the corridor once she turned and the
small red lips parted in a smile she cer-
tainly did not look the criminal more
she had the air of a philosopher who awaits
the opportune moment to confound her per-
secutors-her judges-the wades of the
world-as an afterthought

   well at least ill keep an open mind
decided janet  the french when they
do turn to crime make unusually clever
criminals ill go easy on the sympathy
stuff-be careful about forming any snap
judgments

  janets story made the last edition-just
a report of the interview with a generous
dash of atmosphere to cover the sparsity of
real news but wade was pleased

   good stuff miss murdock he volun-
teered  glad you didnt lay on the mush
that womans guilty you go along with
briscom in the morning hes doing the
trial from the news end but id like a fea-
ture story every day size her up in your
own way and give the women of new york
a chance to see what crimes one of their
own sex is capable of if you handle it as
well as you did this one we ought to put
on twenty thousand in two weeks

  janets thoughts went back to that slen-
der dark-eyed girl so palpably an alien to
her hideous surroundings and she was on
the verge of telling wade just what she
thought of him and his cruel convictions
but a job was a job and she had plenty of
use for hers so all she said was

   well well let the state try her first
remember shes innocent until they prove
her guilty

   well it wont take em long to do that
he chuckled as he moved away

ii

  janet was early in the court room the
following morning and awaited with some
interest the arrival of mme le montague
when she was brought in all eyes were at
attention she came swinging down the in-
closure her well-poised head sleek and
simply coiffed turning neither to the right
nor left she seemed unconscious of her sur-
roundings until she took her seat at her
counsels table then she sent swift darting
glances about her when her eyes chanced
to rest upon janet her lips parted in a
smile and she gave a quick nod of pleased
recognition

  all stood for the entrance of the judge
and the trial was under way as the selec-
tion of the jury proceeded janet found
herself as interested in the type of man
selected as mme le montague herself ap-
peared to be the frenchwoman held whis-
pered conversation from time to time with
her counsel and janet noticed that it was
after one of these that the prospective juror
was usually challenged

  apparently she had much to say in the
choice of her jury it was an interesting
pastime when one had nothing at stake and
janet fell to picking the men with whom
she would care to trust her fate evidently
her ideas did not always conform to the
ideas of mme le montague for on two
occasions her attorney challenged the men
on whom janet had looked with favor

   wonder what she feared in them
janet mused  they look like men with
open minds

  finally it was accomplished the jury
box was full the district attorney opened
for the people janet listened to the flow
of oratory as he brought home his conten-
tions to the jury the state would prove
was his contention that the defendant-
pointing an accusing finger at the slender
girl seated just ahead of janet-this de-
fendant had been an accessory to the theft

                        	a
judgments



of fifty thousand dollars worth of liberty
bonds of the issues of  and 
she had pledged these bonds at various
times throughout the country and witnesses
would prove that the woman who pledged
these bonds and the defendant in this case
were one and the same her accomplice
had already been tried and convicted but
with that exaggerated sense of gallantry
peculiar to the french refused to implicate
the defendant in this case it now remained
for the jury when they had heard the facts
to find her equally guilty with the man

  janets story that day concerned itself
with interesting bits of the trial and mme
le montagues apparent reaction to all that
went on about her she gave a gossipy
analysis of the spectators mentioning a few
names of prominent people who because of
the nature of the crime had been interested
though the court room was scarcely half
full janet had a column of good human
interest stuff and again wade was pleased

  as the trial moved on janet wondered
at the courage of the defendant witness
after witness testified as to the pledging of
the bonds the trial ran from new york
through cincinnati louisville kansas city
tulsa el paso and always the destroying
fact came out that a woman-a french
woman-young and attractive-had ap-
peared as one of the prime movers in the
transaction

   is the woman in this court room
thundered the district attorney

  yes the defendant is the woman

  through it all she sat apparently un-
moved it was hard to connect her in any
way with the figures of the underworld who
came forward to give their testimony fre-
quently a suggestion from her brought forth
a cross-question that left the witness floun-
dering for an answer-often totally dis-
credited in the eyes of the jury

  after one such occasion as this janet re-
solved to express herself a little more frank-
ly in the evening paper the witnesses had
lied and been shown to lie she could see
that even the jury was convinced of that

  every day the court room was more
crowded until the day on which the state
rested its case there was scarcely standing
room

   	a

   all due to your stuff laughed bris-
com  pretty soft for you sob sisters we
do the deadly work of the trial and you get
all the attention for a little personal opinion
its getting the public though the papers
selling like hot cakes old wades tickled
to death

   i think most of his pleasure is due to
the fact that he thinks im against mme
le montague keeps warning me not to
forget that a liberty bond has a symbolic
interest as well as a negotiable value

   well i think it pays to handle him a
bit carefully he doesnt have any qualms
about cutting the pay roll you know

  janet gave this last speech considerable
thought during the next few days her ar-
ticles were interesting the public and hordes
of letters were coming in the court at-
tendants were beginning to have trouble
handling the crowds and on one or two
occasions lately she had surprised an ex-
pression of interest on the face of mme
le montagues attorney when he looked in
her direction and as yet she had hardly
given voice to her convictions would she
dare if she were on the jury how would
she vote

  if it were any other city editor but wade
to-morrow shed say what she thought but
to-morrow something urged her to be cau-
tious better hold off until something hap-
pened that left no question of doubt in
her mind after all what did it matter if
she didnt make the most of her opportu-
nity it would soon be forgotten news-
paper work was like that you might pull
the biggest scoop of the year on friday

  not until the state had rested and the
defense had opened its case had she a
chance to express the thoughts seething
within her rackham mme le montagues
attorney a dapper gentleman of the old
school had many new and surprising bits
of evidence up his sleeve these he pro-
ceeded to exhibit before the bulging eyes
of the spectators as a conjurer produces

his rabbit he did not dwell upon the help-
lessness of the defendant rather he told of
her surprise that a mistaken identity could
so artfully conceal the truth of a situation

  he had witnesses to prove that at the
times stated mme le montague could not
possibly have been in the places mentioned
for at those times she was at her home in
paris or right here in new york tulsa
kansas city places she had never heard
of-though he begged the pardon of those
communities for her indifference to their
existence witness after witness came for-
ward to substantiate his claims most of
them stood up well under the fire of cross-
examination occasionally one would
flounder helplessly and janet found herself
breathlessly studying the faces of the jury
to see the devastating effects of the break-
down

  then the defense played its trump card
rackham put his client on the stand and
led her through the various incidents of
her life touching on paris bordeaux lon-
don and lastly new york she had a sur-
prising memory and was nonplused that
any one should think for a minute that
she was involved in the crime that the
state had accused her of then rackham
turned her over to the district attorney
she was charmingly gracious never for a
moment losing her fine poise even when
his attacks on the adventuress type of
french woman became exceptionally point-
ed after repeated attempts to break down
her story during which he became notice-
ably irritable he finally gave up and dis-
missed her

   will you kindly stay in the witness
chair for a moment mme le montague
rackham was suave and smiling then to
the attendant  please call miss felice
monteux

  there was an expectant hush as miss
monteux came swinging down the aisle and
stepped up beside mme le montague her
surprising resemblance sent a thrill through
the spectators people nudged each other
commenting upon the unusual likeness
after the first gasp of surprise had subsided
and the witness had been duly sworn rack-
ham asked

   mme le montague have you ever seen

this woman before indicating miss mon-
teux

   no

  rackham turned slowly toward the jury
for a full minute his glance rested on the
twelve men in the box then very deliber-
ately he turned and addressed miss mon-
teux

   miss monteux have you ever seen this
woman before pointing a long index fin-
ger at the defendant

   no came the tremulous answer

  again he waited and the significance of
the pause was not lost upon the court room
he wanted the almost unbelievable resem-
blance of the two women to fix itself in-
delibly upon the court and jury then
 that is all mme le montague

   miss monteux he continued  is of
course innocent of any connection with
the crime he explained that he was
merely using her to prove how close a re-
semblance might exist between two people
entirely unrelated and entirely unknown to
each other this had happened to mme
le montague-might happen to any inno-
cent person unfortunately she was the
victim of just such a circumstance

  questioned by the states attorney miss
monteux repeated over and over the same
answers she lived with her widowed
mother in an apartment in the west seven-
ties was employed in a down town shop
where all the girls were highly interested
in the outcome of this particular case
they all read a certain paper each night
and discussed the situation as it was pre-
sented by a woman writer on that paper

  janet flushed as she heard her name her-
alded through the silent court room miss
monteuxs likeness to the pictures of mme
le montague had often been spoken of by
the girls in the shop and in some unac-
countable way this fact had reached rack-
hams office one of his assistants had ap-
peared at her place of business and asked
her to appear in court at first she had de-
murred fearing that they might in some
way connect her with the crime but on his
assurance that nothing unpleasant would
come of it and urged on by the other girls
who felt that it was in the cause of jus-
tice she had come
judgments



  that afternoon janet let herself go she
wrote her whole soul into her story laid
particular stress on the web that could wind
itself about one once they were within the
toils of the law drew a picture of the frail
defendant her helplessness in a foreign
country her appealing wistfulness on the
stand the courage of the other girl who
had braved publicity that justice might be
served closing with a denunciation of cer-
tain witnesses for the state who had proved
themselves perjurers this done she put
on her hat and coat and walked stormily
out of the office job or no job shed done
what she thought was right

  wad was waiting for her when she ar-
rived the next morning  i see youve
tried the case and returned a verdict he
said scathingly  ive opened moren a
hundred letters already from sentimental
fools all raving over the injustice of our
courts want the blade to start a crusade
to end the persecution of innocent women
innocent bah i told you to go easy on
that sympathy stuff your first articles
were fine but this last is maudlin well
be the laughing stock of the town once
the jury returns its verdict 

   mr wade -janets eyes were blazing
- you sent me to this trial instructed to
write it from a womans standpoint i lis-
tened carefully to the evidence and only be-
cause i used the greatest restraint was i
able to write those first stories yesterday
i wrote what i thought and felt regardless
of the job i may be wrong but i intend
to be sincere if you want me to quit
all right but im going to say what i think
is right if i continue

   well to-days the last day finish it
out i suppose a lot of sentimental women
are waiting for you to tell them how to
think so get busy but remember theres
a jury on the job and its their privilege to
bring in a verdict to-day please god
he wen u back to the desk and janet thor-
oughly disgruntled stuffed a few sheets of
copy paper into her bag and started for
the courthouse just wait until mme le
montague is acquitted-ill walk up and
tell him to take the old job if he hasnt
any more confidence in my judgment than
that i dont want to work for him

  mme le montague smiled brightly and
waved a small white hand in her direction
as she sat down beside her attorney and
once rackham turned and bowed graciously
to her	j

  the entire morning was spent by rack-
ham in a resume of his clients case and
the states attorney consumed the afternoon
with his side of the story finally after a
day in which she found it increasingly diffi-
cult to keep her mind on the matter in
hand as hour succeeded hour the case was
turned over to the jury janet decided to
wait in the court room until the verdict
was returned she could not face wade
again and dared not write her story until
she knew what the answer was to be

  mme le montague left the room but
before she went she leaned over and thanked
miss murdock for the interest she was tak-
ing in her case

   it has been such a comfort she said
in her halting english  to feel that some
women understand the position i am in
your articles have been very won-dair-ful 
and rackham had added to this  yes
miss murdock you seem to have sized the
situation up exactly i have been very
much interested in your daily story

  how janet wished that wade might have
heard this rackhams opinion was not to
be taken lightly whatever he might think
of mme le montagues

  janet read the evening papers and wait-
ed briscom went out and bought them
sandwiches and coffee and still they waited
all sorts of wagers were being laid by the
reporters and the attendants as to the out-
come of the trial and janet listened and
laughed indulgently at the banter of the
crowd once briscom asked her how she
was getting along with wade

   oh we had a real run-in this morning
ive thought pretty seriously of resigning
once the trial is over

   dont you do it dont let him scare
you out a fellow who worked with him
out in st louis tells me that hes got a
bug on convicting women he got up
against some kind of a feminine panhandler
out there nine or ten years ago and she
got a cool thousand away from him he
never made much of a holler didnt want


argosy-allstory weekly

it known what an easy mark he was but
since then hes down on the slick woman
crook he contends that a murderer isnt
in it with these thieving scoundrels

  so that wras it janet was glad for some
explanation of his vindictiveness

  finally when everybody was fearful that
it was to be an all night affair the judge
was summoned from his chambers the jury
appeared and the defendant was brought
in she was pale  but thought janet
 no paler than i  

   gentlemen of the jury have you
reached a verdict came the singsong of
the clerk

   we have we find the defendant -
janet strained forward-not guilty

  in a moment bedlam was let loose the
court rapped for order thanked the jury
for their services and dismissed them mme
le montague was everywhere shaking
the hands of the jurymen kissing rackham
on both cheeks then making a lunge for
janet she embraced her warmly

   you splendid girl you have done so
much to help me i must see you and have
a talk wiz you i sail on saturday can
i not see you to-morrow for just a leetle
while-to show you that i do thank you
it has all been very won-dair-ful at my
hotel then to-morrow for ze luncheon tell
me that you will come

  janet thanked her  im sure ill be
delighted to come

   oh sank you bon ami au plaisir de
vous revoir and she was borne smilingly
away on the arm of her attorney

  janet hurried to the office to write her
story it would make the first edition in
the morning as she sat down to the type-
writer she looked hastily around for wade
he was not there too bad she would
have reveled in a bit of gloating to-night
if he were at all caustic she could resign

iii

  mme le montague proved a charming
hostess where she had been so subdued
and reserved during the trial she was all
smiles and life this morning she was in-
terested in janets work and asked innu-
merable questions about every phase of it

did she work with men how were they
as business associates

  janet laughingly confided that with the
exception of one they were all splendid
good friends and fellow workers wade
the city editor was hard to get along with
too bad too because of course he had a
lot of power then as briefly as possible
she told of the trouble he had made for
her each day her trial stories had appeared
 but its all in a lifetime i suppose it
could be a whole lot worse

  mme le montague looked steadily at
her then with little clucks of dismay ex-
pressed her sympathy for one forced to work
with a person of such intolerant views

   i have always found miss murdock
ze men have ze best of it we poor women
must suffair is it not so but you in your
profession have ze pow-air to help so many
unfortunate women in my countree the
pen is very pow-air-ful here it is the same
is it not mademoiselle and you ma
cherie must always be true to your sex-
dont let ze men get ze best of it but why
do you stay on zis pa-pair wiz ze so cruel
man

   well laughed janet  i cant very
well afford to give it up though ive thought
it might be the best thing to do ive
grown sort of attached to the blade dont
know that you would understand it but
when youre doing this kind of work you de-
velop a sort of loyalty to the sheet you
work on which makes it hard to break
away then too it might take me several
weeks to land something else and im in
no position to be out of work that long
you see im not a saving damsel

  but you would like to what you say-
queet-if he does not pair-mit you to ex-
press yourself independently

   thats just it and janet laughed at
the french womans understanding

  she enjoyed the hour they were together
immensely and bade her good-by with a real
regret she was pleased when mme le
montague insisted that she would remember
her always  some day i will show you
that i appreciate ze rare judgment that you
have shown had been her parting and
janet went back to the office with a light
heart
judgments



  a society assignment occupied her that
afternoon and a meeting of the state feder-
ation took her out of the city for two weeks
when she returned wade strolled over to
her desk she had not seen him since
the trial

   well i see you got your wish he be-
gan  your story aroused all the senti-
mental senses of justice in the city i hear
and sent all the duplicate editions of the
montague woman flocking to the court to
prove that she couldnt possibly be herself
good work but in a poor cause now
heres the case of a woman who ought to
be acquitted plenty of chance to drench
yourself and public in tears she only
murdered a beast of a husband after he
had tried to brain her her trial opens
this morning go down and see what you
get out of it of course she wont be good
looking and youll not be impressed by her
clothes but remember listen occasionally
to the testimony and he was gone

  gone before janet had a chance to rise
and tell him how little his judgment
amounted to he need not try to insult her
shed been right all the time twelve men
had borne her out in that

  well shed hurl the job in his face any-
way the job-that was the worst of it
still she must quit she had been right
wade was wrong

  she glanced through the drawers of her
desk making a neat little pile of her per-
sonal belongings

  idly she reached for the mail that the
boy had just placed for her one letter at-
tracted her attention it was addressed in
a vivid fashionable script and bore the
postmark  paris

  janet tore it open it was from mme le
montague

  my dear mlle murdock

   i have only just arrived home but you
  are in my thoughts so much now that i
  am free i do wish so much to give freedom
  to other girls who are forced to live or work
  where they are unhappy please accept the
  inclosed from me it will help you until you
  are able to find another position far from the
  wade who makes you so unhappy in your
  work you will know of ways to dispose of
  it i shall never see you again for i leave

  paris almost immediately ma cherie but
  please think of me always as
  your sincere friend

               jacqueline le montague

  janet unfolded the inclosure and studied
it for a moment it was a liberty bond
of the issue of  for a moment-a
long moment-she stared at it then a
wave of anger and chagrin taking possession
of her she looked quickly at the letter again
there was no address given she sat star-
ing at the thing while around her came
tumbling the house of pride and self-confi-
dence and assurance that she had built for
herself so happily at the close of the trial

  taking a plain white envelope from her
desk she slipped the bond within and sealed
it carefully this done she glanced toward
the desk wade was scanning some copy
before him his shade was low over his
eyes she wondered what he would have
given that moment for a sight of that bond
she put on her coat and hat-started for
the door returned and went up to wade

   ill take that assignment mr wade
what court did you say it was in

   oh yes let me see its in general
sessions part  referring to a memoran-
dum on his desk  give us some good
stuff but be careful in your judgments

   judgments mused janet to herself
 strange things-judgments

  she glanced at her watch fifteen min-
utes to get to court five of these would
do-the other ten could be spent to a better
purpose

  as she left the building janet veered
off toward the bowery she walked rapidly
until she came within sight of a dilapidated
brown stone front the only remaining re-
minder of a past grandeur in the squalid
neighborhood a sign on the stoop an-
nounced that in this house daily dinners
were served to new yorks homeless poor
a large red box marked  contributions to
the fund for the maintenance of this
worthy charity  hung from the railing
janet glanced hurriedly about no one was
in sight it was still too early for the line
of  down and outers  to be forming as
she passed the box a plain white envelope
slipped from her fingers into it

holloways consternation
the mental states of most boys
iis age was only momentary he
picked up two guns from the floor

  his master was lying on the staircase
landing with the bulky hunched form of
mccorkle on his chest wing and parson
were disarmed the negro quintilian had
crouched behind that tower of spiritual
strength his mistress the latter had
turned toward the stairs but checked her-
self with a realization-probably inborn-
that she was stepping into the path of bul-
lets she remained still the dominant fig-
ure whose grim face had not so much as
blanched at the smell of gunpowder

what stage could have been more per-

fectly set than this-to kindle the heart of
a boy tim holloway with a gun in each
hand stepped into as great a climax of
drama as his imagination had ever evoked
the power to solve everything was in his
two wiry little hands for the first time
in his life he was in a position to engage
in a glorious and righteous combat-to shoot
to kill and what was more heroic more
enthralling than this he found himself
transformed suddenly into a two-gun man-
that most dreadful of fiction characters
which had been the idol of his dreams

  it must be noted-that except in his
dreams-this was the first time tim hollo-
way had ever fired a revolver at a man it
had always seemed a very simple matter
but he was greatly disillusioned and as
for firing two guns-that took a miracle of
co-ordination which most fighters-includ-

ing tim holloway-did not possess tim
had never known that it is the hardest
trick in the world to hit a man with a six-
gun and if you fire two guns at once it
is well nigh impossible

  tim banged away each shot kicking back
at him with such energy that he thought
both of his wrists were broken mccorkle
having disarmed cameron stood up and
looked at this little mouse-eyed tousle-
headed figure hurling his shots in every cor-
ner of the room- the big man burst into
a roar that cut in sharply with the hoarse
barking of the guns he had often boasted
that he would let any two-gun man stand
up and pot away at him-provided of
course that he used both guns and here
was this little urchin backing away with
each kick of the guns making an heroic at-
tempt to kill four men-succeeding only in
breaking a large amount of valuable glass
and antiques

  he kept pulling the triggers a crock-
ery vase smashed to bits a leaded pane in
the stained glass window burst into a
thousand cracks like a spiders web a
peruvian jug split in half with a shower
of red wine then abruptly tim hollo-
ways two guns snicked on empty shells
his heroic role was over there was a
sudden silence an exhilarating smell of
powder and spilled wine in everyones nos-
trils a tangle of smoke lifting upward over
the candles which flickering in the series of
percussions again resumed their pallid ver-
tical flames

  again mccorkles roar burst into the
silence he bellowed in his laughter like
an ox

   here you parson he cried pointing
to cameron  take this swobs iron and
keep him covered

  parson obeyed going up to the landing
and standing guard over the disarmed and
helpless cameron

   no dont kill him mccorkle advised
 no killin unless expressly called for
well save him he might know where
some treasures hid we can break his legs
-sure but no wanton killin as the sayin
goes

  mccorkle thumped down the stairs and
with tremendous shoulders and mountain-

ous belly still rolling in chuckles he crossed
the room toward tim holloway

  tim stood very much disillusioned with
his role of two-gun man he sniffed in
anger and embarrassment wiping his nose
with his sleeve he crouched as the giant
mccorkle approached him as if threatening
to spring at the mans throat

   you lay a hand on me you pot-bellied
lubber and ill tear your liver out with
me bare hands tims hair gave the
definite effect of bristling

   zowie but hes got a bit of spirit-
this little wharf rat  mccorkle roared with
delight  now then my little cocky let
me have them irons

   avast there or ill let you have em
athwart yer chin

   mccorkle reached for the boy gathered a
fistful of his costume and tossed him into
the air catching him again by one leg he
held him upside down giving him a good
shaking he not only shook out the two
guns from his grasp but likewise an aston-
ishing shower of cartridges that had been
stowed away in every part of his costume

   so help me god youll pay dearly for
this tim cried when he was again set
upon his feet  tim holloway never for-
gets 

  he yanked viciously at his shirt which
had worked up in a tangle about his arm-
pits  whoever ye are yell never smell
grass again-not if i know it ye can
lay to that he pulled down his sleeves
and took another hitch in his belt  ill
never forget-not till me dyin day so
help me

  in between his incontinent guffaws the
ponderous mccorkle managed to say

 damned if he aint built after me own
heart just the sort ive always wanted
for to pipe me up in the mornin-for to 
whistle for a breeze when the weather 
aint makin hed be a mascot to bring
good luck to any ship bgod come on
puss-in-boots im goin to sign ye up
thought id have to bump you off into hell
-where that scruffer up theres goin-
he pointed a turtle-shelled thumb towards
cameron- but im goin to save ye
yere too good to bump off yere a little
treasure-thats what and im goin to


argosy-allstory weekly

save you- he burst out again in an up-
roarious jeer- and make a two-gun man
outn ye 

  mccorkle looked around the room-
again the undisputed master of the scene
the interlude had slightly delayed him in
his work of burglarizing the old chateau-
but what of that until now the game had
been utterly lacking in adventure and ex-
citement except it might be added for
those brain-heating swigs of the chatelaines
liquor now excitement had come in
earnest contrary to his first intent mc-
corkle concluded that he would have to do
some killing and the thought together with
the intoxication of the wine gladdened him

  they all waited in an expectant and om-
inous silence for his command he looked
about at the attentive anxious faces dor-
set had made bold to come from out the
protection of that arras he stood with
feverish and frightened eyes-his mouth
pursed in the pride of his recent felicitous
stroke that shot of his had solved all of
his masters problems

  a good trick dorset the chief com-
mented-as his eye fell upon the ragged
figure and the ghastly grinning face  but
if you hadnt been so crazy scairt from the
first you wouldnt have missed your man
come here lets see your hand

  hesitant and shy the cockney engineer
presented himself before his skipper
 hold out your hand dorset held it out
as if expecting the extraordinary honor of
shaking with the great mccorkle  just
as i thought mccorkle sneered  shakin
like a flyin jib faugh all right you
watch the women and children thats
all youre good for when you aint stowed
away in the lugger greasin up the mule

  he pointed over his shoulder at the
chatelaine  git that old flat-footed dame
there to set down shes makin me crazy
and lock the ole black up in that thar
closet he cant do no harm but the rooms
gettin hot if he stays on deck any more
well all dither off in a faint for want of
air

  dorset obeyed herding the negro into
the china closet the door was slammed
upon him the old chatelaine sat down
and dorset took his position as their guard

  now then mccorkle turned his at-
tention to the most important matter at
hand-to the only source of actual physical
danger-that man who had attempted the
humanly impossible feat of holding up an
armed gang

  cameron sat on the stair landing with a
slight stream of red clotting his forehead
pale and yet fully possessed of his strength
and senses he presented a defiant and sav-
age picture parson the octoroon stood
crouching anxiously over him with a
gun muzzle not two feet away from his
chest

   leave me put this lubber out of the
way chief parson counseled  he aint
a pleasant lookin customer first thing
you know well have another fight on our
hands-which we aint got time 

   do em all in-thats my advice  little
dorset cried  here yerve got me wiv
three of these balmies on me hands cos
why btime me if i know shoot em orl
dahn-every one no i aint afraid of
this ole gel here-nor of the black nor of
the little codger but any one of em will
pop the daisy on us if we let em live kill
em all dead men tell no tyles

  mccorkle already in his cups settled
back in the cathedral chair while his three
ministers of state discussed this matter ac-
cording to his inveterate custom he held his
peace whenever there was any discussion
whenever his men proposed he would dis-
pose

  he looked to the ancient and the worldly-
wise seaman wing who as yet had offered
no advice

  inasmuch as wings main concern was
the immediate acquisition of treasure he
was not so much obsessed with the fear of
states prison if they massacred every one-
in the house there was the possibility that
no one would ever know where the bulk of
the lafitte and raiglon treasure was hid-
den

   keep em alive he said curtly  tor-
ture em till they tell us where every cop-
pers hid give me my share and im
through 

   through is it-wiv his bloody ands
washed yuss just as i thought dor-
set cried  i stays here tied to the apron
buccaneer blood



strings of this old baggage-and wiv a little
snipe a-kickin of me shins and that rot-
ten old negro besides yuss a jolly
evenin for me-aint it while old wing
-blitherin softy that he is-ransacks the
ouse and makes orf with any swag he finds
kill em-i tell yer shoot em dahn-all
three of em-as well as that codger up
there

  dorsets right captain the octoroon
counseled  heres this house full of
treasure waitin to snatch and weve spent
the night palaverin leave me blow this
mans brains out-here and now

   dorset aint right hes scairt to death
-and wants to murder every one in sight 
wing said  and the same for you par-
son-bein youve got enough negro blood
in yer to make yer yellow aint nothin to
be scairt of git the swag now-and in a
hurry-thats my advice captain

  captain mccorkle took a swig and
belched-unmistakable signals to the men
to hold their peace and listen to his pro-
nunciamiento

   dorset and parson is both right

  this had its effect-it was a grim sen-
tence cameron heard the softly uttered
words from the height of the stair-
landing he madea gesture-stopped by
the steel muzzle now poked against his nude
chest the chatelaines face showed a
dreadful-an implacable pallor

   but while we go through the house
dorset stays guard mccorkle continued
 wing aint a fool we cant go aboard
of em all at once its the last of the
raiglon race-and there may be secrets
wing is right

  wing stood his white but sea-stained
head nodding in the full halo of the can-
delabrum

   now that gentleman up thar- mc-
corkle said pointing his thumb at cameron
 yes yes hm we cant keep our cake
-and eat it-can we now he goes but
first a few questions of a personal nature is
to be axed and answered then the hya-
cinths will take care of his carcass

  the chatelaine still remaining calm be-
fore the insolent and hideous little dorset
who stood guard at her elbow cast an im-
ploring glance upward as if to plead not

before god but before the six raiglons up
there in the gloom of the walls

   then theres one thing else mccorkle
added  as we was sayin theres a little
gal driftin around somewheres we must
get her in tow otherwise we run afoul of
her in the dark no tellin what a raiglon
gal will do

   then for the loot-ay captain wing
prompted excitedly

  mccorkle took another swig and looked
up-following the gaze of the old chate-
laine his brow furrowed then as if
musing to himself he concluded his judg-
ment

   as for this here house-there aint no
man wholl swear by his soul that this
house is standin if it warent standin to-
morrow who is there to ax questions no-
body good to-night when the loots
out-when these here prisoners is stowed
away in some glory-hole below- mc-
corkle paused before finishing his sentence
he wanted to make sure that every one in
the room heard there was no doubt about
the tensity with which they listened to each
word even the chatelaines eyes dropped
-and met his

   i said to-night he concluded  the
house burns

  the old chatelaine of the raiglon house
looked up again to her gods  witness
this tragedy she might have prayed to
them  you wielded your power against
mightier and nobler enemies do you look
down upon this waterfront scum besmirch-
ing the remnants of your house is your
glorious power vanished forever are you
mere shadows will you frown will you
grin will you forever threaten to lift your
swords and do nothing come down to
us fighters seamen raiglons

  these were the unuttered thoughts of the
ancient lady the actual spoken words
were coming from mccorkle-a smooth
soft sentence slightly slurred by drink

   come below skipper and stand by
well attend to you first

  in response to this command cameron
got to his feet he was about to start down
the stairs when he saw a very peculiar
change come over mccorkles face the


argosy-allstory weekly

bushy black brows lifted the red-veined
eyes bulged the pudgy lips opened

  cameron looked around at the faces of
the others dorset had craned his long
neck showing a gulping adams apple his
cavernous narrow-set eyes lit with a pecu-
liar fire

  	wings white head stopped nodding-a
very intense gesture the octoroon who
was at camerons side turned about and
looked over his shoulder towards the dim
shadows above

  the chatelaine seated until now in a
buddhistic contemplation of her gods gave
evidence for the first time that evening of
an appalling fright

  it was clear enough-this change of look
and attitude of every one in the room
jacqueline was coming down the stairs

  she was coming-totally unschooled in
villainy-to cast her power whatever it
was in the balance of that nights combat
she had a power that wielded by many
women in the past had won battles she
had the blood of great fighters coursing in
her veins she had a beauty compounded
not only of the enchantment of girlhood-
but of a long race of circes

  cameron turned around impulsively in-
tent upon warning her to flee but it was
too late she came

  mccorkle saw the slender fragile hand
lifting the edge of her robe-she had thrown
some sort of embroidered garment about
her-a dazzling flame of color dorsets
long jaw dropped as the gold slipper flashed
in a ray of light with a gleam of a high
and delicate instep and the pale skin of an
ankle parsons muddy eyes widened as
he saw the wax-like shoulder emerging from
the dark as if floating from fathomless
depths of black water into the soft green
sunlight just below the surface thus were
the paintings of the raiglons eternally
emerging from their shadows

  she descended to the landing where
cameron was waiting and there she stood
beautiful flaming with a coquettish scorn

  her ancient grandam saw her and she
stood up clasping gnarled and mummified
hands she had prayed to her gods-those
six presences-to save the remnants of
their earthly kingdom

 and from the darkness above-which
they inhabited-they sent  down this
avenger

chapter xxil
jacquelines wiles

  as she stood on that stair landing jac-
queline was on a level with the por-
traits of her ancestors this was per-
haps the reason why mccorkle noticed the
similarity between her features and the fea-
tures of her ancestors the faces of those
portraits grim and menacing had imprinted
themselves deeply upon mccorkles mind
they haunted him although he did not
look at them now-such was the intentness
with which he stared at the girl-he saw
those lineaments dimly reflected in this one
living and lovely face all the grimness
and cruelty of those visages had been ren-
dered down into a composite of rare beauty

  before any one spoke a thought passed
through mccorkles mind it was a thought
which seemed to tickle his risibilities his
swollen paunch sagging over the tightly
drawn belt began to ripple sending a suc-
cession of chuckles into his throat till
now he had been actually afraid of the third
occupant of the raiglon mansion-the girl
this was the dreadful unknown quantity
whom he had pictured hiding in one of
those dark rooms ready to kill whoever
came too near her he had expected to
see another woman built on the heroic lines
of madame raiglon and with the added
danger of youth here instead he saw this
little shadow of a being-this spirit his
guffaws rolled out the very gusts of his
breath might have been enough to blow
her away-so mccorkle felt-as you blow
out a candle flame

   so this is the jane i thought was goin
to stick a knife athwart our backs-ay
mates he laughed  a jane no that
aint quite the word a queens more
like it 

   a lulu says i  the undersized dorset
piped up gleefully

  u shut up you little skunk mccorkle
growled  when it comes to women theres
only one thing to say to such as you-and
buccaneer blood



thats  belay and you too wing youll
break your neck star in thataway avast
there parson stand off this heres a
state occasion

  mccorkle lumbered up to his feet
 now then lady im greetin yer heres
lookin at yer come down to me and ole
mccorkle will show em how a lady had
orter be treated no belay what the
hell are you doin parson

  for some reason or other the sight of
parson standing up there on one side of the
girl and about to offer her his arm incited
mccorkle to a fit of white-hot rage par-
son was an octoroon parson was an
escaped criminal he was the offspring of
the tidewater scum of baton rouge and
here finding himself on a grand staircase
with a beautiful woman he proposed to
blossom out as a gentleman mccorkle
never realized the boundlessness of his hate
for this man parson  you damned
kinky-headed swine you lousy half-
breed you sweatin yellow-blooded afri-
can so you think you can give your arm
to a lady cornin down the stairs-is it
mccorkle roared he had an honest opin-
ion that the very touch of parsons hand
would be an insult to the girl

  mccorkle indeed felt the necessity of
etiquette of a finely conducted ceremony
the ancient house had its effect upon him
he was not in a barroom he was in the
presence of the elite those superbly arro-
gant ancestors were watching him if he
had not been drunk he would have had the
disagreeable feeling that he was an un-
washed hog let loose in a splendid banquet
hall being drunk he felt adequately
equipped to meet the situation parson was
an eighth black and hence belonged to the
same caste as the negro butler dorset
was so covered with the grease of his mule
engine that he besmirched any thing he
touched wing was a palsied inebriate
there was only one gentleman of that quar-
tette-and that was mccorkle himself

  jacqueline was frightened at what she
saw the four together-and so close to
her-were far more terrifying than the dis-
tant view she had had from over the balus-
trade upstairs she put out her hands im-
pulsively and clung to camerons arm

  that was the picture the octoroon
whipped into his place slinking to the back-
ground a gun still in his hand bearing
upon the back of cameron then out in
the light was the full length figure of
cameron his wet pirate garb clinging to
his superb and supple body his head low-
ered like a beast driven to bay and threat-
ening a last stand with its mate by her
momentary qualm the girl had melted into
the picture of which cameron was the
dominant figure

   so ho mccorkle cried surprised
enough but not baffled  hes good enough
to take yer arm-aint he now whoever
he is with them rags on i dont know
cant guess but hes fit to be your part-
ner-aint he even though hes a pris-
oner he wont be fit ten minutes from
now to be the partner of nobody lay to
that my pretty 

  the incongruity of the situation appealed
to mccorkle it was dramatic it was
grim here was a beautiful lady on the
arm of a condemned man her partners
life-so mccorkle said to himself-would
not last as long as a single one of the can-
dles in that candelabrum at the opposite
end of the table cameron being con-
demned to die had assumed a certain fas-
cination mccorkle was delighted with the
sight of both-the beautiful girl and the
man whom he was about to torture and
kill he took a swig gulping holding his
glass as if to drink their health he could
not help but thrill at the splendid picture

  two creoles bgod both of em
he cried  come on down-escort her to
the table skipper thats the way
youre a creole born-whatever yare-or
whatever them rags is supposed to mean
parson-you half-breed skunk-stand by
not too close to em dont let her get a
whiff of ye dorset belay grinnin or ill
knock out yer teeth off with yer cap thar
wing and stand by

they came down with her hand upon
that knotted arm the girl felt a new power
within her-a reassurance she had al-
ready tasted of the strength of that arm
physically spiritually they must be
stronger than these fulsome beasts physi-
cally because of cameron spiritually be-

cause of the six gods looking down upon
them as she stepped down those stairs
she looked at mccorkle with scathing con-
tempt she was flushed hot with pride
and anger she spoke to cameron in a
trembling whisper

   they shall not harm you

  they shall not harm you he re-
peated  be brave i can fight

  you are stronger than they-than any
man they can not stand up against you
 no have courage once i can lay
my hand upon a weapon-

   there shall be time i myself can see
to that there shall be time-and to
spare

   or if- he went on dropping to a
scarcibly audible whisper and without turn-
ing to her- if they themselves were with-
out anns-

   yes then you could prevail with
ease-

  he was whispering just as he led her to
the floor  for your sake-

  they stood before mccorkle

  with the vivid illusion that he was a
courtier enacting a splendid and graceful
ceremony the hulking and steaming mc-
corkle bowed retaining this position-a
difficult one because of his mountainous bel-
ly he thrust out his hand with a gesture
that was not without a certain reptilian
grace fat men it is generally admitted
perform with a brevity of movement of ex-
ertion mccorkle was static but when he
moved a limb-one was reminded of an ele-
phants trunk he had reached out to take
the girls hand

  the old chatelaine saw this she had
arisen from her chair and stood grasping it
-now finding herself tossed about in a hur-
ricane of fears and emotions how simple
it had been to keep her equanimity when
she faced her enemies alone how differ-
ent it was now that she was a spectator and
her daughter was facing the same pack of
beasts

  jacqueline was facing a different sort of
crisis would she meet it-the chatelaine
asked herself-as became her blood had
those raiglons of old passed down their
heritage from one generation to the other
in vain was there yet a strain of that im-

  maculate courage in the blood of a raiglon
woman just how much of the wiles the
cunning the wisdom of those old pirate
brides had been bequeathed to this jac-
queline who had ever been kept from any
touch of sin

  the wrinkled grandam watched there
was only one course open now no force
was left subterfuges evasions the
finesse and trickery of a beautiful girl-that
was the only course of salvation

  jacqueline put out her hand laying the
tips of her fingers upon the tattooed fist mc-
corkle had thrust before her that ges-
ture had been taught her well perhaps
she did it now through an instinctive fear
as one might avoid recoiling from a dan-
gerous looking dog who is licking ones
hand

  mccorkle of course steaming like a tre-
mendous side of pork mocked the pre-
scribed gesture of a courtier and kissed her
fingers

  instead of withdrawing her hand the girl
said sweetly  monsieur is so gentil

   im what

  parson who was part cajan inter-
preted the mademoiselle is shinin up
to you captain

  one side of mccorkles mouth grinned

   be yourself gal be yourself come
over here-and set down well have a
drink together ay-no still clinging to
that sea-cook clutchin his sleeve agin-
ay dont do that dont be a barnacle
to a sinkin ship you see this here candle
she saw his thumb with its thick nail like
a turtle-shell  when that candle bums
down to here your gentleman-friend will
sink mccorkle flopped into his chair
 dont be a barnacle cast off there

  the girl came alone to the table

   set down here next to me

  she obeyed mccorkle turned to cam-
eron with an expression of grim amusement

   now then skipper well leave you
watch the proceedings i want you over
there abaft them candles with the light on
your face-sos you can see em burn
he called to the impatient wing  here
you droolin lubber fasten this gentlemans
arms to that there stanchion he pointed
to one of the posts of the grand staircase
buccaneer blood



  tim holloway watched this unspeakable
humiliation of his heroic master

   you lay a hand on him you swob-
head he yelled to wing  and ill tear
out your liver with me bare hands

   so ho mccorkle bellowed in laugh-
ter- the little cabin-boy agin ay stands
up for his skipper damned fine if youre
that sort me little squawlin terrier ill
make you captain mccorkles cabin-boy
what a sacrilege tim shook his whit-
ened fist  think im goin to be your
cabin-boy you blowsy scruffer he cried
 you aint no captain-lest its for some
tidewater flat boat theres my captain-
and its from him tim holloway will take
orders-not for no blunt-bowed saggin
bargeman the likes of you

  mccorkles humor was slightly irritated
 very well then-if youre his cabin-boy
you can join him wing make this little
yapdoodle fast again that other stanchion
one on each side of that there compan-
ionway

  wing obeyed taking the kicking claw-
ing tim by the scruff of the neck and ty-
ing him on the corresponding post on the
opposite side of the grand stairway

  mccorkle looked around there was
still one other person who had not been
properly disposed of-the old chatelaine

   madame he said with mock gracious-
ness  bein youre a perfect lady-and
well on in years-i dont want to shock
you with the sight of whats goin to hap-
pen suppose you stow yourself in that
there closet till the storms blowd over
in there monsieur the grandam ex-
claimed she saw jacqueline pale with
anger at this indignity and she saw wing
and dorset approach to force her in if she
disobeyed

   who are you monsieur to give me this
order she asked in a blaze of wrath

   hes a blitherin pot-bellied sea cook
tim holloway cried from his post

  stow that gaff mccorkle roared
 bind that kid athwart his mouth with his
bandanna hes gettin me crazy

  parsons carried out this order removing
the crowning pirate touch of tims figure-
the bandanna swathed about his skull-and
wrapping it across his mouth

  there-thats better mccorkle said
with considerable relief  he dont look
so brave now-but he sounds better he
turned to the chatelaine  you still layin
to thought i told you to git

  i will go monsieur the old woman
said proudly-fearing the humiliation of
being handled by wing and dorset  but
do not forget monsieur for whatever you
do in this house you will have to account
to them she pointed to the hovering and
watchful ancestors and then passing the
door which wing opened for her she sub-
mitted to her imprisonment

  mccorkle was now in a position to enjoy
himself the old chatelaine and her serv-
ant were safely stowed away in a closet
cameron was bound to a post on one side of
the grand staircase with the gagged little
urchin on the other the only inmate of
the household now who was neither bound
nor imprisoned was the girl

  the first desire in mccorkles mind was
to impress this girl with his bravado and
deviltry what better way to do this than
to give her the supreme thrill of seeing
cameron shot down mccorkle wiped the
sweat out of his eyes

  you see that gentleman over there
he asked pleasantly  look at him sharp
because youll see somethin itll be a
show worth seeing-this derelict ship set-
tling always a great sight to see the last
minutes of a wreck and in particular if
this young skipper is your- mccorkles
eyes narrowed-  tell me this first is he
your man

  it was of course a time to lie cameron
knew it the girl herself knew it she
must not turn mccorkles drunken jealousy
upon cameron when but a moment before
it had blazed so hysterically upon the octo-
roon parson

   how can that be monsieur she asked
blandly

   then what is he to you

  to me how can he be anything to
jacqueline monsieur

   then what the devil is he doing in this
house i thought they was only three peo-
ple in this house how come he breezes
in with all sails set and tries to stick me
up


argosy-allstory weekly

  jacqueline recalled the sinister suggest
tion mccorkle had made about torturing
the inmates of the house into divulging the
hiding place of the raiglon treasure from
this at least she could save cameron

   i have never seen this man before this
very moment monsieur

  this seemed to break a terrific tension
mccorkle lit his pipe and puffed a cloud
of strong smoke

   never seen him afore this-ay hm
well how come thenhe wanted to shoot us
all down

   he came out of the swamps monsieur
the girl said masterfully  probably a devil
-such as they say haunts this place
mccorkle chuckled knowingly  very
likely except that i had a go with him-
up there on the landin and found he was
made of flesh and bones and good hard mus-
cle its likely hes a devil outn the
swamps oh yes hes a devil all righto
 beggin your pardon capting dorset
said in his soft humble voice  i dont want
to interrupt yer conversation with the iydy
but i got some information on that very
point wing comes to me when i was
aboard the lugger sayin as how you want-
ed me i comes hides behind that anging
and i fires at this here gentleman in ques-
tion you know how i shoots capting
never misses i dont its my opinion
that i got him in the mouth-and that it
didnt phase him

  mccorkle bellowed in laughter

   oh yuss larff dorset forgot his hu-
mility  but you dont know wot hap-
pened to me afore wing fetched me i was
on the lugger waitin in the mist when
outn the swamps there comes a pirate like
them pictures on the walls rises ymight
say floatin toward me and then shelp
me god he jumps me yuss devils can
tear you up same as any humans least-
wise this one could then bindin me ands
he goes below rifles the lockers of car-
tridges comes above and by that time a
fore-and-aft rigged vessel comes sailin
outn the dark with the little cove aboard-
the snipe as ive just locked up behind this
door thats wots happened to me cap-
ting since i seen you larst and all-in-all
it looks like wot this here gel says is right

youre dealin wiv the devil hisself if i
know anything

   i aint listenin to no hopheads yarn
mccorkle sneered  if the mans cruisin
around here with that pirate rig on he can
trick drunks and women-but not ole mc-
corkle he swiped that ammunition from
us did he well ill do a little swipin
too ill give him a swipe with a bit of
lead athwart his guts

   you can not harm him the girl said
in a calm voice

  what the hell mccorkle cried turn-
ing to her  cant harm him-ay ill
show you-

  hes invulnerable she said

   oh yes invulnerable no doubt about
that mccorkle laughed but you
just look here do you see this here hand
of mine he held up a pistol with the
muzzle pointed directly across the table to-
ward camerons chest  is my hand trem-
bling the girl saw the thick leathery skin
drawn tightly across his knuckles a
dragon was tattooed on it-writhing in the
thick hair

   not a shiver to that hand is there me
gal one little touch of that trigger finger
and your devil sinks back to hells fire
where he hails from look here-are you
watchin i squeeze the trigger slow-
without movin another muscle in me hand
look at me i tell you why the hell dont
you look

  he watched the girl through the corners
of his eyes mccorkle wanted an audience
for this dramatic ceremony he was inher-
ently a conceited man this fat lumbering
waterfront drunk he liked the adulation
of his henchmen and they supplied the
demand he liked the adulation of women
-any women-but particularly one like this
girl beside him he was strutting for her
the prairie cock was lifting his feather
tufts raising his tail spreading and droop-
ing his wings but the girl-in the man-
ner of prairie hens was uninterested at
least she was uninterested in him

  mccorkles eyes bulged till they turned
yellowish what was she doing actually
smiling-her lips curling her white cheeks
dimpling-a smile that reflected all the se-
duction the witchery the wiles ever used
buccaneer blood



  by a raiglon woman-or any woman in
  the history of the world

    it was a smile that any man would have
  died for-but mccorkle saw that it was not
  bestowed upon him

    it was bestowed upon that man whom
  mccorkle hated more than any one else in
  the world-the octoroon

    and the octoroon was reciprocating in
  dumb and fearful adoration

chapter xxiii

 fight for me

  aflame had been kindled-slow but
  consuming-a flame that would
  spread if not with rapidity with cer-
  tainty of enveloping everything it touched
  the egoistic brute man childish and cruel
  was afire with those two passions either one
  of which could have made him mad in his
  drink-the passions of love and hate

     as if standing too close to that fierce
  heat the octoroon a sensual and slow-
  thinking man caught fire the girl was
  staring at him her forehead blushing her
  eyes shining astonishing of course-but
  then again why was it was it not pos-
  sible-so parson reflected-that this girl
  saw something in him which all other wom-
  en had missed she was a savage little
  creature jio doubt of a savage race kept
  away from all contact of men and civiliza-
  tion of the men there-parson mccor-
  kle wing dorset and that fellow in the ri-
  diculous pirate garb-who would be the one
  most likely to appeal to a woman of her na-
  ture a man of stature and strength a
  man with the swarthy complexion of those
  paintings on the wall in other words-
  parson himself

    he had a claim upon the girl she in-
  vited it he would not stand by-without
  fighting

    mccorkle looked up at him the chief
  was seated gun in hand leaning across the
  table parson was standing not far away
  from the prisoner cameron yes the flame
  wras slow venomous spreading like the blue
  flame which spreads across spilled alcohol
  it went up into the octoroons peculiar slate-
  colored eyes

  mccorkle saw the light there it was a
new experience to be glared at thus by a
half-breed because of the smile of a white
woman

  that smile under ordinary circumstances
would have meant little-perhaps nothing
but in this situation it meant everything
the girl was helpless-the prey of any one
of the four renegades who wanted to take
the trouble to pack her off to the lugger
to old wing this was of course the limit
of folly as soon as he saw the girl he knew
that trouble was coming it generally came
after the loot was divided in old days it
was a mere matter of casting dice for some
screaming clawing mexican wench and
that was all there was to it but here ap-
parently their chief mccorkle had forgot-
ten all about the business at hand which
was to get cameron out of the way and
then ransack the house parson also had
forgotten the main issue both men were
glaring at each other in a duel of glances
the ferocity of which that old sea-dog wting
had never seen equalled in his sixty years
of piracy

  yes mccorkle was going to shoot his
henchman parson down there was little
doubt about that parson himself saw it
and mccorkle knew that he saw it

  that was the trouble the hulking brute
sitting there with his ponderous greasy el-
bow on the ancient linen tablecloth and a
six-gun balanced in his hand was afraid
parson having been set as the particular
guard over the dangerous cameron-was
standing also with a gun in hand

   parson from the look in your eye
which i aint never seen there afore to-
night i figures youre aimin for to pull
off somethin powerful impolite

   i reckon you aint callin me a kinky-
headed swine agin sir parson said

  wing shook his head excitedly dorset
let out a low groan as if some one had
kicked him cameron stood with arms fold-
ed still facing death at the point of mc-
corkles gun his heart leaped within him
but no change of expression came to his
face in the moments silence a silvery
laugh came from the throat of jacqueline

  mccorkle tensed every muscle the
laugh had cut into him like a dagger


argosy-allstory weekly

  the octoroon echoed the laugh-breath-
lessly-showing a gleam of even white teeth
through his thick lips

   you reckon i aint doing what mc-
corkle almost whispered

   i said i reckoned you aint callin me
a kinky-headed swine again

   oh i aint aint i well maybe i
am

   i dont hear you

  never was there a more beautiful obbli-
gato than jacquelines laugh offsetting the
husky whisper the guttural taunt

   it comes to me mind parson that you
been gettin a better balance on that er
weapon which you holds in your hand
when you got a nice holt ready to smash
me youd like for me to call you some-
thin wouldnt you now sos youd have
an excuse to shoot down your chief

   i dont hear you callin me nothin
sir

   be careful not to move that thar gun
parson my hands ready youve seen
this here hand of mine juggle afore this
many a time

   my own hand aint exactly like mo-
lasses sir

  mccorkles breath came in puffs his
forehead beaded with blinks of sweat a
silvery laugh was ringing within him vi-
brating shaking some nerve excruciatingly
as a sound wave will shake a taut wire he
was going to show that girl how he treated
his men he had waited to perform for
her-showing her what punishment he
could inflict when there was the slightest in-
fringement upon his rule or dignity and
now he was given a chance-more than he
had bargained for

it was his uppermost motive-to show
her but here when the chance offered
he found that detestable half-breed facing
him with a gun and actually taunting him
and the girl was laughing

  without taking his eye from the octo-
roon he said  wing shag over there
alongside of him and frisk his gun

   why do you order him to do that
chief parson asked loudly menacingly
 disarm me for why will i stand here
and leave you pump lead into me-just to
show that thar mademoiselle how brave you

are hell no show her how you can
shoot down this gentleman- he nodded
to cameron- but notjhow you shoot down
parson 

  you will give your gun to wing par-
son mccorkle said quietly that tone
was always obeyed in past arguments  i
figure you want to take a little pot at me-
which delays our evenins work surrender
your gun-or ill call it mutiny

  the octoroon found himself in a quand-
ary his master was resorting to an au-
thority which for many years had been re-
spected not only by wing and dorset but
by parson himself

    taint mutiny sir parson said in a
totally different voice  itd be plain mur-
der if i gives this here gun up theys too
many prisoners here which had orter been
shot long afore this why the hell dont
you shoot some of them no you want for
to shoot me sir-because of that woman
high yaller you calls me dont you cre-
ole thats what i am and i aint yaller
in the guts-like some tidewater skippers
this here gun stays in my hand for to
protect myself agin you chief

  wing did not step too close to the octo-
roon in his first intent to obey mccorkles
order he found himself however in the
position of a mediator

   did we-all come to get treasure mates
or did we come here to knife each other over
some flat-footed woman which a woman
spells shipwreck no matter who nor where
nor when- i knew damned well what sort
of weather was makin chief when you
got soused and we found a gal in the
house well and good im satisfied the
gal-she belongs to you chief

  he turned to parson shaking his bony
finger at the blue lips the tightened eyes
 you hear what im sayin parson that
aint because youre part negro no sir i
aint intimatin that its because the chief
alius gets first choice of the women not
only in our gang but in every gang in the
world thats settled shes hisn-and
good riddance if she got stowed away some-
wheres afore a typhoon blows us all to
hell

  this speech was extraordinarily success-
ful in relieving the deadly tensity dorset

  a
buccaneer blood



relaxed perceptibly parson and the chief
shrugged their shoulders muttered oaths
looked at each other as if waiting to see
who would put away his gun first

  but there was one other person in the
room who refused to accept wings speech
as a solution jacqueline was turning over
a phrase or two of that cracked old voice
 shes hisn-thats settled-the chief al-
ways gets the first choice-

  she spoke up calmly her voice seemed
to come in what had been a momentary lull
in a storm

   i am not his she said

  mccorkles hand fell so that the gun
thwacked loudly on the table  whats
this he cried  you say you aint mine
well damn me if that aint a hot one ill
show you if youre mine or not

   by what right monsieur do i belong
to any one else-but to them she pointed
to the raiglon portraits

   say look here lady mccorkle said
as if speaking to a stupid little child  you
dont seem to get the idea of this party
we aint guests-like you seem to be pre-
tendin were outlaws we didnt come
here to no pink-tea party we came for
to strip this house of anything thats worth
a mexican peso and there aint goin to
be anythin left of the house-no nor any
humans neither-when were through oh
yes youll be left you dont have to worry
about bein shoved off into them lilies-not
you 

  jacqueline did not seem to be worried
about her fate nor for that matter did
the murderous threats of the chief seem to
horrify her the rifling of the house and
the massacre of its occupants seemed to be
a more or less plausible course of events
to this raiglon daughter of course she
did not condone it but back there in her
subconscious mind it seemed a very natural
procedure

   in that case she said sweetly  i be-
long to the most courageous man

   now youre talkin mccorkle roared
banging the tablecloth with his fists
 thats more like it to the most
courageous wow thems your words is
it  most courageous -which is me

   it is possible monsieurjacqueline re-
      a

plied  but what glorious deeds have you
committed to prove that

  mccorkle chuckled  i dont like to cast
any bouquets at myself lady you ax
captain mccorkle what hes committed do
you well thats hard to answer to tell
just what crimes i aint committed would
be a easier way of answerin that there
question

   monsieur will permit me to suggest that
crimes may be either courageous or cow-
ardly so i have been taught by my grand-
mire

   bgod there aint two ways about the
crimes mccorkle commits the chief
shouted drunkenly

   if you stood up and fired upon a man
who is himself armed- the girl suggested
craftily-

   ay what the other muttered in sur-
prise  damn me if i aint stood up
against a dozen men who was armed-

   yes because many men are slow and
imperfect in their aim the girl admitted
 monsieur was not afraid when that petit
whom you have imprisoned in the closet-
shot at you and your men but there are
men who are quick and dangerous- she
added deftly-such as that one she
looked again at the hateful and arrogant
octoroon

  mccorkle swallowed this he had no de-
sire to resume that humiliating duel of eye
and word with the half-breed the half-
breed was  dangerous and quick  as the
girl had said parson and mccorkle had a
desperate respect for each others speed and
accuracy that little score would be set-
tled later meanwhile each man could bide
his time

   why should i fire on a pal of mine
mccorkle asked smiling through trembling
lips

   ah yes you are the gentil chief the
girl said  and yet i have a grave ques-
tion in my mind as to which of you two
gentilhommes is the braver 

   well damn you for the sassy little bat
that you are ill show you how brave old
mccorkle is ill shoot down everyone in
this house-here and now ill shoot down
the devil himself if he came down and sat
at this here table 


argosy-allstory weekly

   yes monsieur the girl taunted  if
the devil were disarmed 

  the blood went to mccorkles eyes he
lurched forward emitting a string of foul
epithets which he now directed upon this
new object of his rage-the girl as he
reached for her with both hands as if to
rend her to pieces his eye fell upon a
threatening and dangerous looking figure

  although bound cameron stood strain-
ing at his post the muscles of his neck
knotting veins swelling as if at any moment
he might free himself leap across the table
and try his luck in a combat of bare hands
against four men who were armed

  mccorkle strained his eyes as if the
vision were not clear to him in the last
few moments of violent emotional crises
he had completely forgotten this young
weed-slimed pirate-clad athlete the
girls hands were gripping mccorkles
wrist he felt them-incredibly smooth
soft

   you forget she said  that the devil
is not armed

  ha true enough the baffled and
fuming chief cried  you was leadin up
to that wasnt you you little minx you
damned glib-tongued charmer im a cow-
ard if i shoot down me enemies-thats it
aint it got to give em a chanst well i
guess damned well not ill leave dorset
plug him when the time comes it does
dorset good to do my shootin always
makes him think hes powerful ornery gits
his nerve back for him mccorkle settled
back comfortably

  the girl breathed heavily after that long
period of withholding her breath  as for
you lady the chief resumed  i reckon
youll want me to prove im your man by
some ways else than shootin down this mr
puss-in-boots a-standin there made fast to
that stanchion

   yes the girl replied with an attempt
at indifference  by standing up before
some one monsieur who is armed there
is the honor of duelling for a girls hand-
in which case neither side has an advantage
in arms if you want my hand fight duels
for me thus my grandmere taught me
are ladies of our blood won or lost

   well i wont back out of no proposi-

tion like that mccorkle said with a swag-
ger  never refused a fair fight in my life
-nor a foul one for that matter who do
you want me to bump off

  that man

  again mccorkle found himself face to
face with parson

   why that man mccorkle managed
to sneer  duel with him hes a black
 he is great of stature the girl said
 and he is swarthy of complexion-even as
my forefathers whose faces were bronzed by
the sea-

   this cooks face was bronzed by some
negro grandmother mccorkle said

  now that parsons gun was in his holster
the chief was not constrained to choose his
words so carefully

   nevertheless monsieur the girl in-
sisted  there is something about this lieu-
tenant of yours which i am unable to de-
scribe i see in him something that is at
once graceful and savage-which i fail to
find in the rest of your band even-if you
will pardon me monsieur-in yourself
that was enough mccorkle was ready
to fight anybody-and with any weapons
his one regret was that he could not have
a nobler opponent to shoot down than this
smirking kinky-haired long-armed gorilla
who had never had a girl smile upon him
before in his life

   come on then damn you for a hell-
brewin catamount ill kill anybody-
even a half-breed-and with me bare fists
if you want it thataway

   with swords the girl said

   swords-hell mccorkle cried  that
blacks too good at anything resemblin a
razor fists is what i says 

   if not swords jacqueline said  then
let it be a duel with pistols

   that aint bad either mccorkle con-
sented

  it was high time now-if the outcome of
past arguments had any bearing-for the
octoroon to lose his nerve there was the
tremendous psychological balance favoring
mccorkle-the balance between captain
and deckhand white man and half-breed
mccorkle was a master bully parson had 
a good yellow streak but in this situation
both men were aflame the girl had en-
buccaneer blood



raged one by her laughing and made the
other think he could win her fear was
crowded out

   im willin parson said with consid-
erable dignity  well make it a duel-as
between two gentlemen sir

   oh for hells sake mccorkle snorted
 between me and a rotten octoroon
thats the kind of a duel well have

   dont be shootin each other up
chief wing pleaded  weve got a good
job on our hands dont hash it just be-
cause you run afoul of a woman git her
outn the way and well collect our swag
let em go to it-the two balmies
dorset tittered out of the side of his gray
lips  let em do each other in-all the
more in it for you and me

  this was just the answer to wings ob-
jection very well then let the chief and
the half-breed have it out one less to
divide the loot

   if youre goin to settle your bally
troubles do it quick  dorset advised
 here i am guardin your prisoners for you
-which ive arf a mind to chuck the job
standin here ready to be knifed any minute
while you two swell around like two lords-
orl for the sake of that spunky little bag-
gage op to it i says

   sure hop to it thems my senti-
ments mccorkle cried  win the lady
by fair means-thats my way steal her
no sir not me win her like a gentle-
man-

   yes-like a gentleman the octoroon
said dramatically

   who the hell said you were a gentle-
man the other snorted  theys only
one creole in this here dool come on
all hands stand by wing you watch this
here sea-cook that he dont jump us when
we turn our backs to him he lurched
out to the center of the floor parson saw
that the hulking bully was half seas under
a gun duel properly regulated could
scarcely be fatal to a sober man

   im ready sir the octoroon said pom-
pously

  oh youre ready are you ready for
hell-thats the right way to put it come
on back up sternwise keep your hand
away from the holster till you take ten

paces come about and then-if you aint
already luffed up into hell you can fire

  mccorkles commands were obeyed in
fact the duel materialized almost to the ex-
tent of that final implication the girl
following his order dropped a napkin cam-
eron stood bound on one side of the stair-
case the boy on the other wing watched
with his white head nodding like the pendu-
lum of a clock in time to their steps dor-
sets eyes shone with an unhealthy and
ghastly pleasure he hated and feared and
was bullied by both men what a triumph
to see them eager to kill each other which-
ever one fell dorset was glad whichever
one fell-it was the girls victory

   ten steps mccorkle himself had
made that stipulation the gentleman half-
breed had agreed to everything a high-
born lady was to be his prize if he won he
was fighting an intoxicated man-that in
itself a cowards move it seemed like a
certain and glorious victory

  it might have been a victory for the octo-
roon if mccorkle had made it an affair of
honor instead of a murderous farce when
the chief had covered half the distance
walking with a dramatic stagger toward the
grinning dorset he turned it might have
been dorsets grin that made him mad
yet this is to be doubted it was more
probable that he had planned the whole
miserable travesty of honor from the first
he took five steps wheeled suddenly and
with a drunken reel fired

  jacqueline suppressed a scream cam-
eron leaned forward straining at the straps
which were holding him back he would
have torn the hulking bully to pieces and
yet it was his sustained conviction that
everything must take its course he knew
enough to stay out of this fight like every
one else there he had nothing to lose and
much that might be gained

  the victim-the  creole gentleman 
who had aspired to the hand of a creole
lady and lost-staggered as if he himself
had drunk too much of the chatelaines hot
liqueurs his gun dropped he gripped
his shoulder his arm flickered like a
broken wing as he reached to grasp the out-
stretched arm of an inscrutable and ghostly
personality-a suit of mail mccorkle had


argosy-allstory weekly

said the half-breed could fire if he had a
chance before being  bumped into hell
that was the truth of the whole matter
except that the octoroon was not killed he
swayed staggered forward as if auto-
matically going through the process of tak-
ing his ten steps turning and firing but
he could not lift the empty hand

  instead he fell face forward

  mccorkle warmed his cold palm with
the gun-barrel-a comforting feeling he
turned to the girl-his flat huge face
flushed but sheepish in victory

   did you see that he asked rubbing
the barrel in the manner of a man rubbing
his hands in a satisfied way  a good dool
now-warent it ay what didnt you
like it what did you want aint you
smilin i won didnt i look at him
lyin there groanin tryin to roll over
what-he didnt turn why not i said
to turn after five steps didnt i say five
steps dorset

   i thought you said- dorset checked
himself grinning  sure you said five
capting eard you with me own ears

   you said ten steps monsieur jac-
queline spoke up softly but unable to hide
a scathing contempt for this sort of combat

   ten was it mccorkle exclaimed
 holy cripes ten- thought i said
five steps what a mistake-phooey
well well-i took five and he was takin
ten well well anyways thats the rea-
son i didnt kill him i seen him standin
on on the same tack y might say so i
plugged him in the shoulder kept him
from smashin away at me no dont give
him a swig wing hes all right lyin to
he wont be snortin around so much leave
him lie to for a spell

   ought ave done him in i say dorset
was whining  yerll have more trouble
than ever wiv him now that yerve give him
somethin real to grieve abaht finish the
job i say

   that aint my way mccorkle said
magnanimously  now that ive got him
on his back i forgives him thats my
way but bein he might be rememberin
the grievance-snd turnin it over in his
mind for to do me hurt well keep his gun
for awhile keep temptation out of his

way-as the saying goes here dorset
youre a particular friend of the half-breed
you keep his gun for him thats fair
dorset accepted the weapon eagerly
 oh yes capting im a particular friend
of mr parson i am ill see that he be-
haves ill put a stop to his hanky-panky
im thankin yer capting 

  jacqueline had knelt down by the side
of the wounded man and put a glass of
sherry to his lips

  now then my gal mccorkle said
impatiently  is there any more dools you
want me to fight for you

   before god no monsieur i the girl ex-
claimed  this is enough 

  enough youre satisfied ive won
you you dont want me to bump off any
one else then-for the sake of winnin you
monsieur you have won this duel
it is enough you are the bravest there
is no more necessity to prove that 

  mccorkle beamed his huge flat face
scarlet and dripping and then at the cli-
max of his victory he again caught sight of
that intrusive and menacing prisoner whom
he had neglected to dispose of he pointed
to cameron how about this cook here
maam might youd like me to fight a
dool with him

   no no monsieur he is nothing to
me a stranger who came to this island
unbidden lock him up monsieur if you
will-as your prisoner and in doing it
you will confer a favor upon my grand-
mother and myself but if you consider
my own womanly feelings-i beg you not
to shoot him down like a dog before my
eyes no duels monsieur you are su-
preme in courage no man can match you
 i better bump him off anyway mc-
corkle grunted with drunken persistence

   monsieur the girl cried throwing
herself between mccorkle and cameron
 i promised you that if you won me in
fair fight i would be yours it is enough
monsieur what more do you want take
the treasures of this house take me but
shed no more blood i beg you monsieur
in gods name

  the girl was bewitching mccorkle
feasted his eyes upon her flushed face her
dilated flashing pupils her luxuriant and
buccaneer blood



disheveled hair her excited lips she was
flattering him-a much more engrossing
matter than that helpless prisoner

   better leave him as he is chief said
old wing always the craftiest and most
cautious  no use killin him yet might
have use for him if hes the girls lover
i know a good way to use him  wing still
remembered that ace card-the torturing of
prisoners when there was a possibility of
their divulging secrets

  still mccorkle was engrossed with the
vision and the music of that girl pleading
with him flattering him proclaiming the
victor making violent and immeasurable
promises to him everything else was shut
out of his inflamed consciousness even
the cracked voice of wing came as if from
another room another time-inconse-
quential

  irritated at any possible interruption to
his glorious love affair mccorkle silenced
the old man  damn you wing for a
bawlin ole woman well leave him live-
for a spell

  indeed what did mccorkle care for a
disarmed and innocuous stranger like cam-
eron now

  wing nodded-perhaps in favor dorset
stood guard malignant and gleeful in his
power the octoroon whom he hated and
feared was lying in a corner of the big
dining hall nursing his wound

  the girl sank into a chair exhausted
trembling her oval face-flushed a mo-
ment ago-was now pale but still vivified
with the consciousness of a victory she
raised her face to the six raiglons above

  as her grandam had prophesied mc-
corkle had forgotten to reckon with those
six presences

   all right chief old wing said  were
all set now for you and me to strip the
house

chapter xxiv

dorset on guard

no one was more satisfied with the
trend of events than mccorkle his
vanity had been tickled and a balm
of pervasive content came over his spirit

 those very elements which had enraged
 him had become a source of tremendous
 satisfaction

   the chatelaines liqueur which had ex-
 cited him now drugged him parson was
 no longer a taunting--and arrogant figure
 towering in defiance before a splendid
 tapestry he was merely a pile of sopped
 rags emitting fitful groans and pitiable
 oaths at the psychological moment the
 menacing parson had been hurled off the
 stage it was like whisking away a red
 zerape from before the eyes of a maddened
 bull out of sight the inciting color was
 forgotten

    yes high time now mate to get the
 stuff together dorset stays guard over the
 two gentlemen the old lady and the black
 wont do nobody no hurt if they stay in
 that there glory-hole parson stays where
 hes at-unless dorset wants to take a pot
 at him for fun and the young mmoi-
 seue- he repeated that grotesque travesty
 of a knight kissing the hand of a lady-
 youll stay on deck with mr dorset
 whos a gentleman bom when wing and
 i finish strippin the house then ill come
 back and well have a weddin

    i have made my promise monsieur
 the girl rejoined convincingly

    and well want to tap a keg or two
mccorkle stipulated  itll be one of these
 here creole fiestas-nothin less-bein its
a weddin of a pirates daughter

   the girl watched him take a candle from
 the iron sconce and reel off toward the
 stairs he walked up exaggeratedly erect
 the candles from below as well as that
 which he held projecting his shadow in
 varied directions old wing took another
 of the candles and hurried off into the ad-
 jacent room his head nodding eagerly

   the five who were left in the room-the
 girl cameron tim the wounded man and
 dorset-remained silent at first there
 was a strange change in the tensity of the
 air now that mccorkle was gone the
 girl had caught a last glimpse of him as
 he lurched against the huge oaken door
 of one of the upper chambers wing could
 be heard in the next room shambling about
 clanking the old locks and chains like a
 restive ghost


argosy-allstory weekly

  in the center of the stage now was dor-
set with his long ghastly head and his puny
body dorset was in the habit of reflecting
his masters mood mccorkle was tri-
umphant and self-satisfied and so was dor-
set he had just had a considerable meas-
ure of power thrust upon him he was
quite self-satisfied-as was mccorkle the
octoroon who had often bullied him and
twisted his weak wrists was now lying in
the depths of ignominy and helplessness
wounded and disarmed he presented no
menace to the ordinarily apprehensive dor-
set the only other sources of danger ex-
isted in the two bound prisoners and a
frail girl the closet was securely bolted
upon the chatelaine and old quintilian
dorset was satisfied

  he represented the giant mccorkle he
now was the bandit chief the conqueror
in fact he understood so well that he was
the viceroy in the absence of the king that
immediately upon mccorkles leaving the
room dorset strutted over to that cathedral
chair and flopped into it

  the chair swallowed him all the girl
could see was the long haggard face the
bony forehead the huge grinning mouth
the solid arm of the chair hid his body but
jacqueline saw the thin nervous hand
placed upon the cowl of a carven monk

  dorsets mouth-out of all proportion to
the narrow face-widened until she saw the
clot of blood in the comer-the result of
that blow dealt him by his master when on
the lugger the grin widened intermina-
bly the bruised lips pulled across his
teeth until he broke into a chuckle

  parson stays where hes at he was
laughing as if to himself  thats what
old mac says  unless dorset whos a
gentleman born wants to ave a bit o fun 
didnt you ear him say that cricky but
thats a good one yuss i aw a gentleman
-slop me gob  he cried belligerently turn-
ing to the girl as if he had heard a tinkle
of a laugh she was sitting at the table
scarcely an arms length across that yellow
linen from him  a gentleman born thats
wot englishman born and bred in lun-
non oh yes ive had these here sherry
nightcaps too- he tossed one off and
made an attempt to belch like his master

blood came to his head-to his eyes and
to the end of his nose giving him a splotchy
unhealthy appearance  look here me
gel you can tell a blood when yer sees
one

   i can monsieur 

   you can tell a man as done a bit of
travelin in his day

   that i can most certainly monsieury
 do i look like a rotten ole tramp-as
that man lyin there

   by no means monsieur

   or like wing he asked hotly  by
wing i mean that dodderin balmy whose
ead keeps swingin like this he closed
his eyes and wagged his own grinning hag-
gard head  and as for mccorkle dor-
set shook his fragile grimy fist  pha-ah
thinks he can swell around here like he
was to the manner born-as the sayin
goes a big sweatin blowsy bargeman
thats orl he is we englishmen you
know go in for blood-ancestors and orl
that youve got it i can see them por-
traits up there-every one of em has some-
thing which youve got on your fice shelp
me and that ole gel in there actirf as your
chaperone-shes got it and here comes
a ole rozzer like mccorkle wantin to grab
you and that aint arf of it he wants to
marry you-thats wot wont be satis-
fied i tell yer till he can say hes a creole
creole is he ph-tht

  he paused as if his weak body had spent
itself in this tirade the bound cameron
glowered with a terrific contempt the
wounded man off there in the corner of the
dim room groaned out a series of vitupera-
tive oaths the  ghost  in the next room
was clanking locks gathering loot

  but jacqueline-so dorset noticed very
definitely-was looking at him with a re-
sponsive a sympathetic fire

  looke ere dorset thrust his ghastly
head over the splendid linen  you tell
me-cross yer eart did you notice a
difference between me and them three
clods

   beyond the shadow of a doubt mon-
sieur

  dorset emitted a sharp quick snarl like
a cat spitting  ya-a-ah i knew it
yer goin to try and come it with me i
buccaneer blood



knew it when i first sat in this chair-yuss
me lydy he shouted in a thin voice that
seemed scarcely to carry beyond that table
 i thought so goin to truck wiv me-
same as you did with him but he was arf
seas under-mccorkle was-and i aint
he wanted to rotten row it like a creole-
and so he swallowed your gaff you prom-
ised him yourself-and he believed it-the
poor softy but not me you aint no
little goer me gel i knows a little goer
when i sees one but you aint youll
stick a knife acrost him first bloomin
chamce you git dont tell me dont
smile at me me gel i wont be put upon
youre tryin to undo the bally lot of us by
your wimings wiles-but ive ad my lesson
with wiming-long afore this-damn you
orl-ot ones and cold alike

  jacqueline remained calm and unmoved
under this gush of invective she was
studying him-his agile thin fingers his
grimaces his bubbling mouth his narrow-
set triumphant twinkling eyes she looked
at him with the passive amusementof a
little girl watching a jumping-jack as if
trying to discover what string was being
pulled to cause such comical antics

  wing had shambled into the room his
arms full of altar cloths silver sconces a
censer a chalice an ornate compass he
heaped these antiques upon the table his
eyes gleaming his chest heaving

  dorset waited wrinkling his pimpled
forehead in a frown as if this intrusion of
wing with his loot were a personal affront
the old seaman shuffled out nodding his
white head affirmatively as if to say
 yes theres lots more its endless the
quicker i go for it the more well have

   think you can truck wiv me do you
dorset went on muttering at the girl find-
ing a tremendous exhilaration in scolding
and bullying something weaker than him-
self  ya-ah good mind to clump yer
one in the mouth a good mind to-
yuss i said ive a-

  he spoke tonelessly disconnectedly as if
trying to say one thing while thinking an-
other

   i wont be put upon-not me he
was not looking at the girl now although
there was the same grimace-compounded

of a vicious frown and an insolent smirk
his look was focused on something just as
fascinating

  that pile of stuff which wing had heaped
upon the table seemed to grow in luster
with each moment that dorset stared at
it certain details-a jewel on the chalice
a band of gold on the sconce a cluster of
semiprecious stones on the altar cloth-
caught dorsets eye the heap of antiques
placed there on rich yellowed linen seemed
to kindle into a dull glow under the candle
light dorset blinked and as he blinked
succinct rays of green and yellow light radi-
ated from the heap as if there were buried
flames in a mass of embers

chapter xxv

the five-and the one

g hey are merely heirlooms mon-
sieur jacqueline said  there
is no other worth to them
dorset had left his cathedral chair and
was now examining the stuff which old
wing had brought

  it was ridiculous to suppose that wing
would have left anything of real value on
that table if he had found a jewel that
could have been classed as precious he
would have pocketed it himself dorset
knew of course that wing had examined
everything he had left there that was
the reason he had taken so long a time in
collecting one handful of loot mccorkle
was taking a still longer time-an indica-
tion that he was meeting with more success
the gels right he said disgustedly
the stuff heaped on ancient linen illumined
by soft candle beams had looked more
precious than it was it was flamboyant
and further it kindled the imagination
 heirlooms-is it and so it is bgod
good for the museums back in norleans
-if you can sell it to em the real stuff
wing keeps and this here truck is what
i gits-while wing and mccorkle rifles the
ouse

  it is worth nothing monsieur-this
heap jacqueline said  except as heir-
looms to us they mean much-to you
they are worthless


argosy-allstory weekly

  aint no doubt about that old gel
dorset grunted  now you can see how
i gets treated the leavins-thats orl
nothin more same story every time
shelp me but i wont be put upon-not
me that arf-breed bullied me aht of my
share moren once but he wont do it
again strike me dead if he will old wing
hes a sharp one too-but he dont bother
me minds his business too old to bully
me all he cares for is to lay his bloody
ole ooks on his share counts the pen-
nies never bothers me its this thing
on the floor and- he lowered his voice
malignantly-and mccorkle

  the girl was still studying that miserable
face  why is it that all men are afraid
of him-this monsieur mccorkle-this
drunken marauder

  there you ave it dorset exclaimed
 marauder-drunk-thats wot and we
all cower before his swank like puppies
gave me a hell of a flip under the lug a
while back left me aboard to have a go
wiv the blahsted ghosts in the swamp
thats the way he treats me while he goes
after the swag then here i am again-
a-watchin of you wimin and that pile of
refuse over there in the corner a-nursin of
his wound-and them two coves tied up
there thats wot i gits but i wont be
put upon-not me-ill turn one of these
days you can jolly well lay to that me gel
one of these days dorsets goin to turn
 turn now-and i will help you the
girl said softly

  dorset looked at her and laughed hide-
ously  i suppose youll be arskin me for
me gun next-ay wot

   no no i could not touch a gun
could jacqueline handle a gun with these
fingers she held her palm out-and he
seemed momentarily fascinated it was a
beautiful thing-particularly when the soft
transparent skin with its inner flame of
coursing blood was compared with gun-
metal  at least jacqueline herself is not
afraid of this great bully of yours

  well damn me for a pie-can dorset
burst out  if you think you can shame
me-i guess not im scairt stiff of the
ole growlin rozzer makes me shiver in
every bone of me body and hes just

abaht broke every bone in me body-wot
with his kicks

   you are a slave monsieur you are
not an englishman

  orl right im a slave

   but you are free from this man- she
pointed to parson- who persecuted you
 i damn well know it 

   if mccorkle had fallen in that duel-
she suggested

  dorsets eyes kindled  yuss that
would have been a bit of orl right either
way i won if mccorkle was aht of the
way- he lost himself a moment in con-
templation

   would you be a serf any longer mon-
sieur

   i guess not wed arrange these here
jobs to suit ourselves-wing and me hes
a sharp un the two of us could git rich
this old bleeder mccorkle wants to sit
dahn and make it a jubilee-when he goes
on a maraudin expedition done it afore
this-many a time likes to git the gels
together-and the liquor goes in to rob a
ouse and his mind wanders-imagines hes
in a pub look at how hes acted here to-
night wed have had this job finished-
arf an hour ago-if wing and me managed
it id have stuck a knife into them two
coves there he pointed to cameron and
tim  cast them into the bayou then
stripped the ouse the lydies oh yuss
id have drunk your ealth and said good-
evening im a gentleman when it comes
to that

   ah monsieur that is the truth be-

tense before him i shall smile upon him
buccaneer blood



and drink and suffer him to kiss my hand
-this hand monsieur

  again she showed her hand to the dis-
traught dorset-a hand that was far too
beautiful to be kissed by a brute he so de-
spised and hated  if i do this monsieur
and the monster is concerned only with the
pleasure of the moment-and forgetful of
all danger-then it will be a safe time for
some one to slay him

   holy cripes  was all that dorset could
say he had no voice it was a stage
whisper intense retching consuming

   i heard you there i heard you by
hell the hollow moaning voice of par-
son from the further corner of the banquet
hall broke into the tense periods

  dorset shivered and took in his breath
with a hissing sound the girl watched
him

   you eard who dorset shot out bel-
ligerently  if you eard me say anything
against the capting just let me know and
ill stick a knife acrost you wiwout an-
other word

to do shell help you you can do it

fight mv shoulders smashed and its kill-

o	--

and grin his voice trailed off into heavy
and rhythmic moans

   who do it me me kill mccorkle
oh my winkie wot a good one

   are you a coward the girl asked
sweetly

  he snapped at her  yuss damn me
im a coward course im a coward-the
yellowest coward that ever was born
think id try to come it with that-

 monster  as you calls him i guess jolly
well i would wow if he ever so much
as heard me complain thered be a plantin
-or a drownin-thats more like it

  he seemed to lose himself in thought
again while the girl maintained silence
and the rhythmic moans of parson came
across the room as an obbligato to dorsets
soliloquy

   he wouldnt bung the word-that rot-

ter down there he was saying evidently
he had a terror that the very thought of
mutinying against the chief might in some
way leak out  and ow about this here
man fastened to the stanchion and frownin
at me theres the hell of a fine mark to
have listenin to every word-aint he

   naturally enough i myself want to see
him dead cameron protested calmly

  there you have it dorset parson
raised his voice again  theres five of

in your own blood-do you think you four
could fight mccorkle oh yes a fine
bloody encounter that would be ill say
he done you in when you stood up agin him
armed now ow much help are you

  the sound of a man in the next room
shambling with evident difficulty grunting
bumping up sharp against the oaken door
interrupted dorsets tirade the wounded
octoroon struggled up to his elbow break-
ing off the rhythm of his moans

   its wing- the latter said  hell
help-if the girl knows how to get him
the girl-shes on my side parson said
still with a conviction that although she
was playing with the others like a cat with
mice-she could not possibly be playing
with him  youll help me get even
mamoiselle i fought for you-like you
wtanted youll help me

  dorset started to jeer-but his sour
laughter broke off suddenly he was con-
cerned with matters of tremendous import
wing was coming-wing the doddering
and crafty the cautious the gold-lover

  he blundered through the door puffing
and groaning at the great weight in his arms
-an open chest which he had piled with
loot dorset thrust his head out of his
coat like a turtle and leaned across the
linen to the girl he spoke softly out of
the side of his bruised mouth  wing--

by f morton howard

  a single soft tap on the door dis-
turbed the complete silence of close
a  application in the private office of
that old established firm stebbings 
mortimer of flaming sword lane city
the junior partner frowned at the inter-
ruption but steadfastly continued his study
of the big ledger on his desk the senior
partner without raising his eyes from the
mass of correspondence before him me-
chanically emitted that loud inarticulate
drone with which it wras his habit to accord
permission to enter

  slowly noiselessly the door opened some
eighteen inches and the face of a mild
middle-aged little man peered around it into
the room neither partner gave any recog-
nition of his presence and for a while he
remained there gazing in timid perplexity

from one to the other of the two preoccu-
pied gentlemen

  with every moment of his wait his ex-
pression deepened in dubiety until it became
one almost of anxious apprehension un-
able at last to bear the embarrassment of
his position any longer he stealthily with-
drew his head silently closed the door and
after a period of dull hesitation in the pas-
sage outside summed up sufficient courage
to rap for a second time with greater force
and urgency

 come in
impatiently

  again the door opened and again the
mild little face peered round it

  well jerked the senior partner
glancing up  oh its you chedworth
he observed not unkindly  come in

 fussed the senior partner
oh come in do

s
the desperate young man



   the small insignificant personality of
mr george henry chedworth sidled
through the doorway but kept hold of the
handle of the door as though to maintain
a line of escape

   well what is it you want ched-
worth

   mr chedworth without replying gazed
in a constrained apologetic way first at
the senior partner and next at the unheed-
ing junior partner and next at the floor
where he appeared to find great interest
in the pattern of the carpet the senior
partner taking note of these symptoms
immediately conceived a suspicion

    if youre thinking about applying for
an increase of salary chedworth- he
began crisply

  oh no sir-not at all disclaimed
mr chedworth  nothing of the sort
sir i assure you

    glad youve more sense than to bother
me with things like that said mr steb-
bings mollified  well now what is it
you wish to see me about

   awkward murmured mr chedworth
fidgeting with the lowest button of his
waistcoat  hard to explain sir sort of
-sort of favor

   mr stebbings mistrustful of this last
word grunted in an indefinite and some-
what unencouraging way

   i want to-to give notice- blurted
out mr chedworth

   notice cried mr stebbings  no-
tice of what

   resign explained mr chedworth
backing a little closer to the door  i
want to give up my job here

   even as he spoke the words struck him
as crude and ungrateful and he cast about
in his mind for some polite addition to
soften the asperity of his announcement

 been very comfortable here of course
and so forth and so on he declared hus-
kily  been here a good many years now
be a bit of a wrench to leave still-

   he passed his forefinger round the inner
side of his collar and gazed appealingly at
mr stebbings the senior partner sat
back and stared at him in an aloof offend-
ed manner the junior partner flickered a
cold glance at mr chedworth rasped

 then why leave and straightway re-
sumed his close scrutiny of the ledger

   i-i been left a fortune mentioned
mr chedworth diffidently

   what barked mr stebbings

   been left a fortune repeated mr
chedworth as though he were making a
confession of something of which he was
ashamed

   you-youve been left- demanded
mr stebbings

  he broke off and swung round in his
chair to look at the clock on the mantel-
shelf

  mr chedworth at once comprehended
the significance of the action

   oh no sir-it isnt that he inter-
posed hurriedly  i-i know quite well
what im talking about i aint been any-
where this morning except-except just to
the lawyers the chief clerk gave me per-
mission it-its quite right sir i been
left a fortune

   but hang it all chedworth pro-
tested mr stebbings with the petulance
of one asked to accept the incredible
 you with a fortune

    it-it is rum aint it sir agreed
mr chedworth  i cant hardly believe
it myself not yet

    depends what he calls a fortune ob-
served the junior partner poring a little
nearer over the ledger

    three thousand pounds a year stated
mr chedworth bashfully

   three thousand pounds a year
echoed mr stebbings in a kind of angry
skepticism

   rather more if anything said mr
chedworth apologetically  left me by
my grandfathers brother course i never
guessed sir-

   are you sure there isnt some mis-
take interrupted mr stebbings  it
may be a hoax have you actually got the
money yet

    fixed it up this morning sir finished
the last bit of business about it thats
what i got permission to go to the lawyers
for been arranging it and settling it all
this last three weeks sir and now its
done i cant hardly believe it i didnt
believe it could be true myself thats why


argosy-allstory weekly

i never said anything about it before in
this office didnt want to give em a chance
to laugh at me but now-

  but have you actually drawn any
money yet persisted mr stebbings

  mr chedworth produced a faded old
wallet from his breast pocket and opened
it to give view of pristine paper contents
 drew two hundred this morning as a
start he said  in fives and tens and
two fifties no trouble about that

   are you sure theyre genuine

 i got them straight from the bank sir
 um-m observed mr stebbings and
appeared to be a trifle disappointed
 sounds all right he conceded reluc-
tantly

   oh i know its all right sir asserted
the little clerk  the papers and things
ive had to sign holford  jackson they
are the solicitors most helpful theyve
been sir

  mr stebbings after a long brittle pause
rather testily announced that he was jig-
gered

   so was i sir when i first heard it
eagerly agreed mr chedworth  and so
-so i do hope gentlemen you wont take
any offense at me wishing to leave you-
you see how it is

   my grandfather never even had a
brother as far as i know mr stebbings
stated fretfully as though he were drawing
the attention of providence to an instance
of unfair treatment  oh well he end-
ed magnanimously and rising from his
seat held out his hand to the fortunate
legatee

   very much obliged to you sir im
sure mumbled mr chedworth redden-
ing with gratification

   congratulate you said the junior
partner looking up and nodding and look-
ing down again

   and thank you sir and-and i shall
be sorry to leave the firm

   we shall be sorry to lose you ched-
worth said mr stebbings handsomely
 of course i suppose youd like to leave
at once to-day

 thought id finish the week out sir
 yes you would remarked mr steb-
bings and though he did not explain his

meaning more fully he regarded the mild
little man with something like amused af-
fection  pon my word chedworth its
only now that youre going- youve been
with us a long time and youve been a-
a faithful servant chedworth

  mr chedworths eyes brimmed all the
long years of drudgery on a grudged in-
sufficient salary were forgotten in this one
moment of frank admission

   i-i always tried to do my best sir
always been my-my motto so to speak
and i-i dare say youre wondering what
im going to do with myself in future sir
now im-im independent

   launch out a bit i suppose put for-
ward mr stebbings  theaters motor
car-that sort of thing eh go in for gar-
dening eh conservatory and all that
sort of thing have a good time all round
 golf laconically remarked the junior
partner crouched over his desk

   as a matter of fact- began mr
chedworth awkwardly  well-you see
my wife-

  he stopped shook his head in a puz-
zled way and tried a fresh line  thats
-thats where the favor comes in that i
mentioned just now he said  i-i told
her you had taken me from the indoor staff
and given me a job as commercial traveler
for the firm

   but-

   she-she dont know about the legacy
ive thought it all out very careful sir and
i-i believe im acting for the best i
dont want her to know about the money
it -it  only spoil everything for her
 i dont understand chedworth do
you think its quite fair- i mean-

   my wife- well its difficult to ex-
plain sir shes-shes sort of ambitious
and the people shed meet on our three
thousand a year-theyd snub her shed
never be comfortable always trying to
claim her position and getting snubbed
you see what i mean

   out of her element said the junior
partner

   exactly sir wed move to some swell
neighborhood and-and she wouldnt be
happy nor comfortable but if i-if shes
got the extra money to spend what she
the desperate young man



thinks im earning as a commercial shell
be just right shell stay in the suburb
where we are move to a bigger house of
course and buy furniture and things and
still be able to queen it among her old
friends shell like that

   sounds quite reasonable admitted
mr stebbings  but-

   it wont really be cheating her con-
tended mr chedworth earnestly  shell
be able to have all the things she wants
when i told her about the-the commercial
traveling job she was as pleased as pleased
and-well theres me sometimes she-
well shes a managing sort of woman gen-
tlemen and if i was a commercial trav-
eler id be away from it all it would be
a rest a change for me and of course the
money  be there all the time it  be
there for the children when i-when the
time comes and of course if ever any-
things wanted i can easily make up some
sort of story to account for being able to
spare the money

   well of course its entirely your own
affair you know best said mr steb-
bings

   i do sir i know just what its like
at home and i-i know mrs chedworth
and i honestly believe its for the best all
round can but try it for a bit any-
way

   and youd be away from home on holi-
day most of the time

   ive earned one all the years i been
married- you dont know broke out
mr chedworth with a quivering protest-
ing vehemence that gave the two partners
some considerable insight into the condi-
tions of his domestic environment  never
had a holiday yet-not a real one just
slog slog slog-here and at home some-
times wished- no rest no-

  come come chedworth urged mr
stebbings concerned  pull yourself to-
gether man you mustnt let yourself go
like that

   nerves muttered mr chedworth in
rueful extenuation  theyre all wrong
overstrained never had a chance to ease
up nagging and-and one thing and an-
other not but what she aint a good wife
to me he asserted  but-well-

   sit down invited the senior partner
 tell us a bit more about the legacy and
-and so forth if he wishes mortimer i
dont see why we shouldnt help him with
the commercial traveling story do you

   be a charity grated the junior part-
ner assiduously turning to the next page in
the ledger

ii

  half an hour later mr chedworth
emerged into the clean quiet drabness of
flaming sword lane he had quite re-
turned to his usual air of gentle respectful
deference to the world in general but in
his eyes was a little light of expectancy
of half fearful half eager anticipation but-
toning his worn coat he allowed the tips
of his fingers to rest momentarily on the
bulge of the fat wallet in his breast pocket
he thrilled at the touch of it and smiling
very cheerfully at an equally cheerful sky
he struck off toward the roaring rattling
thoroughfare which was at the end of the
byway

  all was going just as satisfactorily as he
could wish his employers had promised
hijn that they would support to the full
his statement about being one of their
travelers should mrs chedworth or any
other person show an embarrassing inquisi-
tiveness in the matter at any time and
the partners had persuaded him to begin his
holiday at once and had sent him off with
repeated expressions of good will and kind-
ly interest

  it was true that they had not directed
that he should receive such of his salary
as was due him but that he was confident
was quite an oversight

  and now on the advice of mr steb-
bings he was going to stand himself a
lunch to celebrate the occasion it was
not to be an ordinary unimaginative city
lunch mr stebbings had insisted but an
elaborate meal in courses with a bottle of
wine and a cigar and coffee and a liqueur
to end up with

  mr stebbings said that he would have
invited him to just such a lunch himself
had he not unfortunately had an engage-
ment already he very helpfully how-
ever supplied mr chedworth with the


argosy-allstory weekly

address of a restaurant he could recom-
mend

 mr chedworth was now sitting out for
this restaurant and that was why he looked
both expectant and apprehensive for this

i	was the first time in all his life that he had
ever contemplated lunching appropriately
in that delectable region known as  up
west he had snatched hurried arid lit-
tle meals in cheap teashops in oxford
street and the strand before now when
the exigencies of business and hunger had
synchronized with his presence in the neigh-
borhood but this was to be a real slap-up
elaborate affair and though he assured
himself that he was going to enjoy it he
knew that the ordering and consuming of
it presented ordeals which would perplex
and embarrass his sensitive shy little soul
 but he had made up his mind to go
through with this lunch he agreed with
the senior partner that it was the one right
fitting way to signalize the beginning of
his new life of affluent leisure here was
luxury within his reach after years of
carking unremitting economy and he
must welcome it in the time honored
way with the ritual of food and drink

  what was more he was going to do the
thing properly with no stint and with all
the correct high preliminaries and conse-
quences he intended to take a taxicab
to the restaurant to go on afterward to a
theater where amusement might charm his
mind and assist his digestion and after-
ward-home and mrs chedworth and the
children and the stress and strain of bicker-
ing domesticity as a corrective

   a man was selling violets at the corner
of flaming sword lane and mr ched-
worth after a little hesitation bought a
bunch of them because it seemed to him
that the circumstances demanded a but-
tonhole as outward and visible expression
of festive intents

    mustnt go home weaning em though
he reminded himself

   he knew the devastating criticism that
would greet his appearance at home with a
bunch of violets in his lapel his wife
would want to know why he bought them
and where and how much he paid for
them and then she would begin to talk

about economy and drag in mention of
boots that needed repairing and crockery
that needed renewing and all the four
children would be listening--gladys in her
quiet lethargic way and cedric with a grin
on his sallow face and kathleen would
stop her piano practicing and young nor-
man would probably ask a silly question or
two about violets and buttonholes on pur-
pose to egg his mother on

  no it wouldnt do to take his button-
hole home with him he would drop it
somewhere on his way back he hoped
they would be picked up by some one who
liked violets as much as he did and who
would be pleased to find them so fresh

  he stood at the edge of the pavement
in an effort to secure the taxicab which
was to be the first of the days luxuries
empty cabs passed him this way and that
at frequent intervals but none stopped at
his timid beckoning most of the drivers
made it clear that they did not want to
notice his summons-two or three of them
slackening speed glanced at his shabby
insignificant little figure and shook their
heads contemptuously and drove on so
at last he had perforce to swarm on a bus
and travel westward between an irate stout
lady and a snuffy old gentleman who kept
grunting and wriggling aggressively it was
something of a come-down but mr ched-
worth felt the pressure of his plump wallet
against his breast and he found it wonder-
fully stimulating

  and presently he dismounted from the
bus and found his way to the desired res-
taurant twice he approached the portal
and then shied and drifted past it but
the third time he approached the entrance
he became involved in some way with a
large hilarious party descending from taxi-
cabs yielding himself to the line of least
resistance he was swept with this happy
crowd through the door and into the lounge
of the restaurant

   so far so good murmured mr
chedwick thankfully and then perceived
that a uniformed porter was scrutinizing
him with a suspicious eye

  lunch said mr chedworth firmly
to the fellow though inwardly he was in a
tremor
the desperate young man



   your hat sir remarked the porter
regarding mr chedworths obsolescent
headgear with a fixed inimical stare

  mr chedworth convulsively removed
his hat

   cloakroom on the right stated the
porter as one engaged in repressing an af-
front to the establishment

  mr chedworth went obediently to the
counter of the cloakroom and surrendered
his hat to another uniformed attendant who
gazed at it with a similar sardonic mis-
favor to that exhibited by his colleague

   how much queried mr chedworth

   no charge

   tip you now and get it over offered
mr chedworth with some idea of buying
the mans respect and good will  and
your pal-does he-

   we share-sir

   right you are said mr chedworth
and banged down a half crown on the coun-
ter very affably and conspicuously  thats
between you

  hed show em he was a jolly sight better
off than they were guessing by his hat
but the fellow did not seem greatly im-
pressed indeed his pained disdainful
mien suggested that mr chedworth had
been close-fisted and indelicate perhaps
thought mr chedworth it wasnt so much
of a tip after all half a crown was a lot
to him-used to be anyway but this
was an expensive place he wondered
what he would have to tip the waiter he
ought to have remembered to ask mr steb-
bings that bit awkward when you were
not used to tipping

  mr chedworth found himself being
shepherded into a vast glittering noisy
apartment where one waiter passed him
to another along the narrow aisles that ran
between the crowded tables he followed
his guides blushingly and uncomfortably
with increasing realization that be was an
incongruity in this confident well groomed
throng more than once he sought to glide
into some vacant chair but he was inexora-
bly conducted to a remote corner where the
ultimate waiter after one single appraising
glance at him accepted delivery of him
with no more zeal or interest than he would
have accepted delivery of a sack of straw

  rather surlily he accommodated mr
chedworth with a seat at a table where
he could see little and could be but little
seen himself mr chedworth decided that
he was the kind of customer they wished
to keep out of sight as much as possible
quite frankly he didnt blame them on
the whole he was glad they had taken this
line with him hed enjoy his lunch all
the more

  there were two other guests at the table
but they had finished their meal and were
clearly meditating departure one of them
-a big leather faced man with two fiery
pimples on his cheek and an air of dour
angry opposition the other was a much
younger man plainly dressed in clothes
which were no longer new but still pre-
served an appearance of quality and good
taste the face of this young man was
handsome in a boyish way but it was
pallid and troubled and he was sitting back
with arms folded staring dejectedly at the
tablecloth

  mr chedworth beyond a furtive apolo-
getic smirk at them as he sat down did
not give heed to either man for he was
now confronted with the task of ordering
his lunch and the prospect filled him with
trepidation

  the matter however proved unexpect-
edly easy for no sooner had mr ched-
worth indistinctly mentioned  er-lunch
please than the waiter whipped out three
or four suggestions as though they were
commands and then without waiting for a
reply walked away

  he had returned with a disconcerting
number of little dishes and was ranging
them before mr chedworth when abrupt-
ly the big man opposite pushed back his
chair

   well im off he announced brusque-
ly  busy thanks for the feed

  the younger man rousing himself from
his dejection turned appealingly to his
companion

   then-then you wont he asked

  the big man pursing his lips tightly
shook his head

   but-but- pleaded the young man
and laid his hand on the others sleeve

   no good said the big man  it


argosy-allstory weekly

cant be done my boy sorry he ended
perfunctorily and rose from his seat

  the younger man rose too but his com-
panion had already begun to make his way
toward the distant door the young man
staring blankly incredulously watched him
go and then slowly resumed his chair

   that finishes everything he whis-
pered and sat forward with his elbows on
the table and his palms pressed against his
temples

iii

  me chedworth by covert inspection
of what other people were doing contrived
a creditable handling of his hors doeuvres
though his instincts trained by a lifetime
of economy rather rebelled at leaving so
much in the little dashes to be taken away
again by the waiter

  his soup presented no difficulties and
he tackled the fish course with a relieved
zest for somewhat to has surprise it was
recognizably fried fish

  and then came doubt and perplexity
again for the waiter setting a leather-
bound pamphlet before him asked none
too hopefully

   wine sir

   er yes said mr chedworth  a
bottle

  the waiter opened the list and flicked
his finger nails across it

   which will you have sir

   er- hesitated mr chedworth
 what do most of em have

   a nice champagne sir suggested the
waiter

   er-yes-champagne decided mr
chedworth

  of course he ought to have remembered
champagne was notoriously the correct
thing for an occasion like this

  	er-not too much he called after the
waiter

  thereafter his lunch proceeded with a
delightful smoothness for the waiter now
developed an easy friendliness toward him
and was proving himself most helpful and
mr chedworth enjoyed his champagne
sipping cautiously at it and finding a rare
relish in the flavor and prickle of it

and as the meal progressed a soothful

benignancy began to steal over him and
with it there came a strange sense of bold-
ness and equality he glanced about the
crowded restaurant and reminded himself
that after all he was probably a good bit
richer than most of these dressed-up people
here still it was capital to be enjoying
ones self as an equal among them he
hoped every one was finding as much pleas-
ure in lunching as he was

  his gaze fell on the young man opposite
he was still sitting there in a dejected at-
titude stirring his feet now and then as
if about to leave but coming back to
inertness again as though he could not
bring himself to face the world outside

  mr chedworth felt sorry for the young
man it was so clear that he was in trou-
ble of some sort pity everybody could
not be bright and cheerful on a day like
this

   er- began mr chedworth impul-
sively addressing the young man and nod-
ding his head at the bottle of champagne
 would you care-i mean-will you join
me in a glass

  the young man despite his listless ex-
pression was surprised by the offer

   no-no thanks he said

   do you good encouraged mr ched-
worth and to his own surprise began mas-
terfully pouring champagne into the young
mans glass  first time ive been here
he mentioned as a sort of vague explana-
tion

  the young man sipped at the wine and
setting down his glass moodily eyed mr
chedworth

   its the last time i shall be here he
said

  mr chedworth did not like this it
seemed to him that there was an insult
concealed in it somewhere he resolved
to leave the young man alone

  a few minutes later a fresh question of
procedure presented itself to him he
beckoned to the waiter

   i never thought-about my bill i
mean he said

   yes sir asked the waiter becoming
vigilant at once

   i suppose they can change a bank note
here for me

                         	a
the desperate young man



   how much for

   five pounds

   oh that  be easy enough thought
you meant a big one sir

  in some oblique way mr chedworths
vanity was wounded a five-pound note
had always seemed such a stupendous thing
to him and here was a man who classified
five-pound notes as small mr chedworth
felt that his own importance as a cham-
pagne customer was in jeopardy and he
resolved to impress the waiter

   better change a ten-pound note for
me if its as easy as all that he said
drawing out his wallet and making play
with the wad of notes  here you are
he went on selecting a note with some
care and then examining it with an as-
sumption of casualness  no thats a fifty-
pound note he pointed out with secret
pride in this clever display of his wealth
 what about this no thats another fifty
and this lot is the fiver ah heres the tee-
ners change me one of them will you
the waiter went off respectfully enough
on his mission mr chedworth looking
across the table as he put away his wallet
found the young mans gaze fixed brooding-
ly upon him

   theres two hundred pounds in there
mr chedworth could not help telling him
and nodded as though to say  now snub
me if you can

  a thought recurred to mr chedworth
wthat about tipping the waiter he was in
a quandary he did not want to be mean
on the other hand he did not want to be a
fool and overdo it he resolved to risk
another rebuff from the young man op-
posite

   by the way wonder if youd mind tell-
ing me he said leaning forward confiden-
tially  this waiter chap-what ought i
to give him i-i never been here before
you see never been to any place like this
before he admitted frankly  want to
do the right thing

  the young man seemed to be waking up
he sat back and examined mr chedworth
shrewdly

   having a little holiday eh he sug-
gested

  in a way i-ive done with work

   	a

   retired questioned the young man
and seemed puzzled to reconcile mr ched-
worths faded coat and frayed necktie with
this theory

   thats about it i-i got enough to
keep me going for a bit anyway returned
mr chedworth

  he forgot that only he himself could
appreciate the humor of this remark and
he winked genially at the young man to
emphasize his drollery

   saved it up or-or speculation asked
the young man

   neither declared mr chedworth
with wine-warmed joviality  yesterday

i	was a bit of a confidential clerk and to-
day im-im a man of means

   how did you manage it queried the
other with eager swelling interest

  but mr chedworth suddenly decided
that he had confided quite sufficient amid
strange surroundings to a young man who
was quite unknown to him didnt do to
tell everybody your private affairs

  he therefore shook his head reticently
and determined to change the subject of
conversation

   nice lively district this i dare say
he remarked  wouldnt mind living
round here myself thats to say when i-
when i hadnt got to be somewhere else
do you live anywhere round these parts

   i yes only a few streets away

   no wonder you drop in here for your
meals

   oh to-day-well i had to meet some
one business you know where do you
live

   oh a long way out answered mr
chedworth evasively  but what id like
to do is to find a room somewhere handy
round here-not too showy of course
theres particular reasons about that
what i shall be looking for is a nice quiet
place where-where i can be private
where-where certain folks would never
think of looking for me thats the sort
of place im after

  the young man sat looking at him with
a strange intentness mr chedworth-
pleased to think how diplomatically he had
stated his requirements-awaited a reply

   come along round to my place in-


argosy-allstory weekly

vited the young man suddenly  weve
got a spare room it might be arranged-

  he rose urgently his face was no longer
pallid but flushed and his eyes were
shining with repressed excitement he
lurked restlessly while mr chedworth set-
tled his bill and gave largess to the waiter
three minutes later the young man and
mr chedworth quitted the restaurant

   sure it wont inconvenience you me
coming round this time of day asked
mr chedworth

  the young man laughed wildly incom-
prehensibly

  contrary to mr chedworths expecta-
tion it was to quite a shabby little by-
street in the neighborhood that the young
man led him

   oh its all right-youre quite safe
he exclaimed perceiving his companions
surprise  poor but honest weve got
the top floor over this shop

  he pushed open a door and led mr
chedworth up flight after flight of dark
stairways

   in here he directed and took mr
chedworth into a front room which though
small was furnished with admirable taste
and richness

  the young man glanced quickly about
the apartment

   my wife must have gone out he
observed  so much the better

  mr chedworth noticed the tone of re-
lief and idly attributed it to a notion that
mrs young man must evidently be rather
of the formidable pattern of mrs ched-
worth

   sit down invited his host indicating
a comfortable armchair and mr ched-
worth sank luxuriously into its broad
depths

  the young man went to a bureau and
stood sidewise to mr chedworth while he
fumbled something from a drawer into his
pocket then seating himself opposite his
guest he regarded him inscrutably for a
full half minute

   about that room prompted mr
chedworth uneasily at last

   that was only the bait said the
young man

   eh ejaculated mr chedworth

  the young man going over to the door
locked it and put the key in his pocket

   here said mr chedworth half rising
with a ludicrous expression of alarm on his
mild little visage

   listen ordered the young man  i
want eighty pounds and youve got to
lend it to me-or give it to me i dont
care which ive got to have it and im
going to have it

  mr chedworth gaped helplessly at him
im desperate declared the young
man i warn you

  he drew a small shining revolver from
his pocket

   are you going to give it to me without
any trouble or-

   dont-dont be so ridiculous gasped
mr chedworth  let me go i aint
going to-

   im going to have it-eighty pounds
ive got to have it and youve got two
hundred 

   i wont its-its robbery

  mr chedworth was terribly frightened
but money had always been so tremendous-
ly important a thing to him that the yield-
ing up of a sum like eighty pounds was
such an inconceivable demand that blank
amazement overshadowed even his fears

   robbery said the young man
 rather late in the day for you to quibble
about robbery isnt it

  robbery it is insisted mr ched-
worth  ill go to the police i shall-
the young man laughed in loud mirth-
less scorn

   oh of course youll go to the police
he sneered  thats likely isnt it dont
bluff man-dont bluff

   i-i aint bluffing denied mr ched-
worth unsteadily  ill go straight to em
and tell em how you-

   oh no you wont-you wont risk
that what about your own little affair-
that two hundred pounds wasnt that a
robbery eh do you think i cant put two
and two together

   what do you mean quavered mr
chedworth  its honestly mine i-

   honestly why man youve given
yourself away over and over again to me
a man like you with all that money on
the desperate young man



you and squandering it in an expensive
restaurant and you said yourself that you
were only a clerk yesterday what does
all that point to and on top of that try-
ing to find somewhere where you can lie
low no dont try to bluff it out youve
got that two hundred pounds from some-
where somehow theft or blackmail or
whatever it was youve got it and youre
going to give-yes give me eighty pounds
of it

i shant i wont youre all wrong
 eighty pounds demanded the young
man im letting you off lightly im
not taking a penny more than i absolutely
need the biters bitten my friend

   you wouldnt dare kill me

  	i could i tell you im desperate
  you wouldnt dare

the young man perceptibly hesitated

   well  dont know but if you dont
give up by the lord ill hand you over to
the police

   go on challenged mr chedworth
thrilling with relief  do it i shant give
you a penny hand me over to the police
 and what good will that do you
youll get a year or two in jail far wiser
to give me what i ask

   i wont stoutly returned mr ched-
wrorth marveling at his own courage

   give it to me or ill take it screamed
the young man in a sudden access of pas-
sion  give it to me

  he strode forward pointing the revolver
straight at mr chedworth the little man
after one dread glance at the others new
expression capitulated

  all right-ill pay he panted
 heres-heres the money

  with trembling fingers he counted out
the notes and thrust them at the young
man

  just in time breathed the latter
snatching at his booty  another five
seconds and- oh i cant i cant
he cried wildly and pushed back the notes
into mr chedworths hands  i cant do
it its the first time-

  he flung himself into a chair and cov-
ering his face with his hands broke into
weak sobbing

   here give me the key quavered mr

chedworth as much shaken by his reprieve
as by the peril of the last few moments
 let me get out of this give me the key
i shant-

  the young man dragged the key from
his pocket and dropped it at mr ched-
worths feet mr chedworth eagerly bent
to pick it up and as he did so there came a
hurried rapping at the door and a womans
voice anxiously called out

   brian are you there brian whats
wrong dear let me in-let me in at
once

iv

  the young man dashed the back of his
hand across his eyes and looked up at mr
chedworth

   its-its my wife he said  dont
give me away i dont want her ever to
know i must have been mad-mad
mr chedworth fumblingly unlocked the
door and opened it on the threshold
stood a young and very beautiful woman
she ran into the room and bent over the
young man mr chedworth stepping
thankfully out onto the dark landing
pulled the door to behind him and leaned
trembling against the banisters

   the police he whispered to himself
 straight to the police trying to rob me
-revolver and all the police-theyll-
he stopped a disconcerting thought
flashed atlnvart his resolve thered be a
police court case and it would be in the
newspapers very likely and then it would
come out that he had two hundred pounds
on him and that hed met the chap at
lunch and then mrs chedworth would
want to know all about it and thered be
the end of his dream of idle cheerful little
holidays by himself and mrs chedworth
would have a lot to say about hiding the
news of the legacy from her

  no it wouldnt do after all hed lost
nothing hed just keep quiet about the
affair and in a way he was feeling rather
glad that this decision had been forced
upon him that young lady-she looked
so alarmed and anxious shed done him
no harm and dare say the young fellow
was in a pretty awkward fix

 been mighty desperate myself over
-

argosy-allstory weekly

money before now thought mr ched-
worth with a faint glow of sympathy and
understanding  never so desperate as
that though of course not revolvers and
that sort of thing always kept myself in
hand hadnt got the pluck to do other-
wise maybe and in the end it always
come straight with me still if youre
pushed hard for money- no i shant
say nothing to the police about it let
em go

  he made his way slowly down the stairs
on the first-floor landing a stout dishev-
eled good natured sort of woman came
out of a door and examined him with
amused interest

   been up to the top of the ouse aint
you she asked

  he nodded her gaze traveled over his
clothes from faded hat to patched boots
and she took him for something like what
he appeared to be

   another of you eh she remarked

 what do you mean-another of us
 bills bless you your sorts going up
and down them stairs all day didnt get
paid though did you ill lay none of
em ever do

   i-i aint a bill

   summons then eh antagonistically
surmised the woman  thats worse
theres always one or other of you blood-
suckers-

   and i aint a summons neither de-
nied mr chedworth indignantly

   you dont mean to tell me youve come
from the old man demanded the woman
in some excitement

   old man what old man

   is father mr carfords father

   oh hes got a father has he

   yes and a nice specimen he is too
quarreled with the boy wont have a
thing more to do with im because -e mar-
ried against is fathers wishes and her
such a nice young lady too its a sin
and shame and if youre a friend of the old
mans-

   nothing to do with me none of em
disclaimed mr chedworth and went on
down to the street

  he hastened away from the house quick-
ly enough but gradually his pace slackened

and at the corner of the road he halted
deep in meditation and at last he swung
round and briskly retraced his steps

   may as well do a bit of good if i can
he told himself  whats the use of money
otherwise besides another time he might
be more desperate and it would be a pity
if that young wife of his- rum he re-
flected  ive often wished some one d
come along to help me and now here am
i going to help some one else i feel ive
got to do it i suppose thats because ive
been through it myself

  he climbed the stairways again and
rapped at the door of the young mans front
room

   er-what about that room youve got
to let inquired mr chedworth as the door
was opened

  carford staggered back gasping

  mr chedworth caught a glimpse of the
girl beyond and he frowned in caution at
the young man

   the room the empty room stam-
mered carford its-its this one
he led mr chedworth into a vacant room
adjoining

  mr chedworth quietly shut the door
and turned to the young man

   going to ask you a question he said
 what did you want that eighty pounds
for

   because well be homeless to-morrow
im broke

   what-broke and lunching at restau-
rants

   i was giving a man lunch it was my
last chance i thought perhaps hed lend
me the money but he was like all the rest
of them

   married against your fathers wish
didnt you asked mr chedworth bluntly

   yes whats that got to do writh you

   wont he help you persisted mr
chedworth

   no hes finished with me

   what about your wifes people

   shes an orphan why do you-

   got an idea about lending you the
money myself said mr chedworth

   you oh if you would no-i for-
got i-id rather not i know how you

the desperate young man



   paying a pretty high price for your
honesty aint you

   i dont care i confessed about-about
that to the wife and ive promised-
well get along somehow ill pay off
everybody in time once i get the chance

worth

   no the young man had to admit

   spent all your money on the furniture
eh bill of sale on it and its being claimed
to-morrow-aint that about it i thought
so youre in a nasty hole my boy and
if your father dont give in-

   hell give in sooner or later

   meanwhile mr chedworth remind-
ed him  youve got to live how are you
going to do it now will you let me lend
you the money out of-of what ive got in
my pocket

   no no i tell you it isnt fair of
you to tempt me i dont wrant to get
mixed up in your-

  mr chedworth held out some bank notes
to carford the young man struck them
to the floor and strode from the room

 hell do decided mr chedworth
 hes straight enough

  he picked up his notes and followed the
young man into the other apartment

   that room will just about suit me
he said  ill get it furnished this week
its just the sort of place i want and-and
i dont mind paying a sort of premium for
it say-say a hundred pounds

the

   i told you- began the young man
only to be interrupted

   im going to tell you something first
about me and my-my circumstances its
a secret mind but its true and i can
prove it to you and-and i dare say i
can fix up some sort of a job for you just
to carry you along for a bit sort of part-
time secretary eh im looking for some
one like that what i can trust now you
listen to what im going to tell you about
myself and promise youll keep it dark

  a buttonhole shrilled mrs ched-
worth when her husband warily entered his
home that evening

  i-i forgot guiltily exclaimed mr
chedworth  had-had rather an excit-
ing day my dear

   exciting what happened

   oh nothing-nothing special just
been fixing up about the commercial trav-
eling i start out on the road next mon-
day

   and a good thing too she declared
 but why you should go wearing vilets at
your age-

   bought em for you my dear

  i dare say she returned cynically
 it was just a bit of extravagance and
youre trying to get out of it you know
you cant afford to go squandering your
money like that

undying malice

while he mastered himself and as
the blood began to circulate more
quickly and his limbs grew supple
he fought for time strictly on the defense
but before three exchanges lascelle seemed
to realize the strategy of his antagonist
and he flung himself heart and soul into the
combat

  it was a masterful attack the blade
alone deft as it was in the hand of clovel-
ly could never have saved him from those
assaults but in his own peculiar fashion
he danced back swerving his body from
side to side before the assault

  once the darting point leaped so close
that it touched his temple near the eye
again it slipped through his shirt and rubbed
its cold length against his naked side

  for five minutes death was constantly
before him but at the end of that time the
numbness had left his legs his wrist was
again flexible and he had regained that per-
fect balance upon his feet which is of all
things most necessary to the fencer who
fights for his life

  he had been driven to the edge of a plot
of roses before that time of self-mastery
came to him one backward step would
entangle him hopelessly in the soft mold
and to gain that advantage lascelle pressed
his attack with a relentless fury

  the smiling confidence with which he
had begun the battle had left him his
expression was a settled and malignant
sneer in every thrust he fought to kill with
the hunger of one accustomed to slaughter
sweat glistened upon his forehead from his
work but his eyes were brighter than ever

  the crisis had come in the distance

this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for september 


clovelly



clovelly saw the four men crouched in the
intensity of their interest following the at-
tack and the defense with little movements
of their hands as though they recognized
the working of two masters here and were
intent not to miss one portion of the lesson

there was the crone too laughing in the
moonshine and the lamplight and rubbing
her withered hands in a savage ecstasy

  there last of all was cecily with her
hands clasped and her face raised she
was praying-and for his victory

   god in heaven cried clovelly to his
heart of hearts  if she is not true there
s no truth on earth

  he put by thrust and lunge he gave
oack an inch in spite of himself and felt
his right heel sink a little in the treacher-
ous soft garden earth

   more art monsieur i more art and less
strength he said to lascelle i have
played with you long enough in a mo-
ment i begin to give you a lesson

   you dog snarled lascelle  here is
he final stroke 

  and he lunged to the full of his long arm
and agile body but venom had made
him hold that stroke an instant too long
and beating it aside with a strong parry
clovelly side-stepped into the open and
danced away from the garden edge into the
center of the turf where the footing was
irm beneath him

  there was a general shout to attest this
important achievement and again the voice
of the hidden watcher

   bravo clovelly lascelle you are
matched 

  lascelle repaid that exclamation with a
snarl and closed again a feint a lunge a
thrust in rapid succession then he rushed
in past the point of clovelly until their
bodies struck together

  there was no room to use swords then
there was no time to shorten the weapons
either and lascelle twisting his leg about
that of clovelly cast him off balance and
threw him heavily

  it would have been the death of any
ordinary man but clovelly was no inert
and stunned figure he landed on the turf
as a cat might have landed and twisted
lightly to his feet again

  even so he would have died but lascelle
thrusting murderously when his man fell
had missed his twisting target and passed
half the length of his rapier into the turf
before he could disengage his point clovel-
ly was on his feet

  foul cried the voice of the hidden
watcher  a foul stroke lascelle by
heaven

  the fortunes of war answered las-
celle panting with his work  luck has
saved you clovelly for the last time

   hear me lascelle said clovelly anger
making him cold according to his peculiar
nature  this is not clovelly it is the
ghost of darnac come to take revenge upon
you i remember now it was such a trick
as this that killed darnac but it has failed
now you are a dead man lascelle

   you lie groaned lascelle

  but he gave back a little as if to recover
breath and looked furiously around him
at the black faces of the four men who
watched and who had instinctively run
closer at this display of unfair tactics

   aye said clovelly instantly  look
around you lascelle your last look at
the moon your last scent of the night
wind you have not a minute before you
darnac-darnac-is waiting

  and he leaped in to the attack

  lascelle gave back returned with a coun-
ter assault maintained even war for half
a heart-breaking minute and then retreated
again

  there was a tumult in the court the
hidden watcher was shouting his enthusi-
asm the four men quite won over from
lascelle by his recent exhibition of foul
play now cheered the victorious progress of
clovelly but the latter fought even more
with his tongue than with his sword

   stand fast lascelle he panted
 brave frenchman do not run away i beg
you

  lascelle grinned in the savagery of his
hatred but he dared not waste breath upon
an answer still the dancing point of the
englishmans rapier was before his eyes
and still he retired

   beware the soft ground cried clovel-
ly suddenly

  lascelle in spite of himself uttered an


argosy-allstory weekly

exclamation of fear and leaped to the side-
straight into the point of clovellys weapon
a swerve at the last instant saved him
from a death stroke but the leaping steel
pierced his left forearm between the elbow
and the wrist and brought out a quick flow
of blood

  a fresh shout came from the watchers
and now a richly dressed man ran into
view it was that hidden watcher with the
vaguely familiar voice it was the duke
of ipswich

   his grace said clovelly  has come
to see you die now lascelle he added
ironically  for the glory of france and
remembering that narrow dark street in
orleans where you murdered darnac-

   devil groaned lascelle and drove in
for the finish

  he came half blindly the narrow sword
of clovelly danced then the flicker of the
steel went out and the point was deep in
the frenchmans body

  he fell without a groan the rapier
still clutched in his hand was drawn across
his breast

   clovelly he gasped  i am a dead
man

   i hope not said clovelly  i hope
not lascelle a villain i have no doubt
you have proved yourself this night but
i pray that death will not rob the world
of so fine a fencer come here-in the
name of god some one with a skill in
wounds come to look to poor lascelle-

  the four came running ipswich himself
was hurrying forward when lascelle mut-
tered 

   it is too late my friend i feel the
darkness in my brain i felt the sting of
death when your point entered me well
i have given it to enough i have given
it to enough lean closer to me monsieur
i have done a foul thing to-night in this
battle i shall repay you with a confes-
sion

   of one thing only lascelle confess
to me that when you destroyed darnac
in orleans it was not through fair battle-

   lean closer-lean closer i am weak
clovelly i have no strength to speak
loudly

  clovelly holding back the others as they

ran up with a gesture leaned above the
dying man

   monsieur  said lascelle  all who say
that they saw me kill darnac lie the
street was empty what happened was
this i had fallen by tripping on a damned
loosened stone as darnac stood above
me i cried out for mercy he accepted
my surrender like a gallant and generous
man and as he leaned to lift me from the
ground i stabbed him thus

  he had been moving his sword as he
spoke until the point was addressed to his
target now he thrust suddenly at clovel-
lys breast the latter was no better than
a dead man for no movement of his own
could have saved him from the sudden
and treacherous thrust but one of las-
celles own companions who had been
watching his face intently jerked clovelly
sharply to the side so that the point of
the fallen mans sword pricked through his
shirt only

  a thousand curses groaned lascelle
 you de graumont i shall return from
the grave to haunt you

  de graumont shrugged his shoulders

   i saw the devil come into his eyes he
said quietly  and i knew by that that there
was trouble coming god be thanked that
i acted in time or this murderer would
have taken another victim with him to hell
 lascelle said ipswich speaking with
a voice full of horror and yet with something
of compassion as well  you are fast dying
there is only one thing that can be done
for you whatever gifts you have to friends
or family-whatever messages you wish to
send give them to me they shall be de-
livered i promise

   friends echoed the dying man thick-
ly  family

  he broke into a stifled laugh which
choked away to nothingness his arms
and legs twisted convulsively together
then he lay still looking up to the broad
white face of the moon with dull eyes he
was dead

   a plague has been removed from the
world said his grace of ipswich kneeling
by the motionless body  i call you all
to witness that i have never yet read or
seen or heard of such malice yet now
clovelly



that he is gone god rest him and give him
peace in english ground

  so saying he closed the eyes of the
fencer he raised the sword from the limp
hand which could no longer hold it

   and my friends continued the duke
 since he was a blackguard but yet a
matchless man with a sword and since
fencing is of all arts the most noble it is
fitting that no hand after his should manage
this weapon it was given to him i believe
by a prince of the blood royal of spain
let it be buried with him

  with this he snapped the rapier across
his knee dropped the broken fragments
upon the ground and turned away

chapter xxxii

the fog begins to lift

what clovelly saw when he wiped
his sword blade and put it up in the
sheath again was not the dead man
on the ground or the broken rapier neither
did he hear the words of the duke except
as a meaningless echo for his whole mind
was bent upon cecily his wife

  she no longer prayed but leaning weak-
ly against one of the pillars which made
a portico on the west side of the little
court her head was fallen and the steep
shadow lay across her face clovelly took
heed of this with a peculiar agony of spirit

  is it despair because her tormentor
has conquered or is it utter thanksgiving
because i have not fallen

  these were the questions he asked him-
self sadly but in the meantime his grace
of ipswich had taken possession of him
and was dragging him into the house pour-
ing forth a jovial confession of his villainy
covered slightly by a pretense of a mere
sporting spirit

   i was tired of hearing the frenchman
praised as the paragon of all earthly swords-
men i made a bet with ormonde that i
could furnish an englishman who would
whip lascelle to death in a fair fight hand
to hand foot to foot sword to sword

   ormonde was so confident that he of-
fered me odds of three to one but i dis-
dained the taking of them for i knew that

you would be my champion clovelly and
i knew that an english hand and an eng-
lish heart would match any in all the
world

  in the meantime they had come close
to cecily and the hand of the duke turned
to iron on clovellys arm

   by all thats holy whispered his grace
 i had forgotten her present me

  and clovelly as he murmured the name
of the great noble and saw ipswich sweep
his finest bow to the girl told himself that
he had come to the end of the bitterest
part that ever a man had been called upon
to play but there was still more before
him even crueller minutes to outface the
duke ushered them both into the house
and as they walked on he found an oppor-
tunity to whisper in clovellys ear

   is she stout oak and willing to give
truths a name he asked  or is she
mincing with her words does she take
greater care of herself in her talk than in
her actions

   your grace muttered clovelly guard-
edly  she is a puzzle which i have not
been able to solve i have ridden with her
on the road all these days but i know less
about her at this moment than when i first
caught sight of her

   that makes me think you a philoso-
pher clovelly it is usually in the twen-
tieth year of a mans married life that he
begins to find his wife extraordinary but
you clovelly are an exceptionally rare
and lucky fellow you have probed the
nature of your wife to the bottom in half
a fortnight-

   my lord said clovelly through his
teeth  no more talk about man and wife
if you please

   what man did you not really marry
her

   only with words-an empty cere-
mony

   by heavens clovelly did you hire a
false priest for the purpose have you
gone to such a length as that

   no clovelly replied heavily  we
were married by a man of god-and i wed-
ded her with a ring

  his jovial grace of ipswich stared at
his companion and stared far harder with

wonder when he heard the pirate muttering
to himself  what have i done what
have i done

  hark clovelly whispered the duke
 tell me by all thats wonderful have
you a conscience in this matter

   what asked clovelly starting as
though out of a dream

   this little trickster  a pretty-faced
girl-

  you are right you are a thousand
times right i thank your grace for re-
calling me to myself no no i have no
conscience in the matter only knowing
that in this way and in this way alone
i shall be able to sail the main again
and do the work i have sworn to do there
 spoken like the true clovelly of whom
all london i swear talks half of every
day

   the ship is prepared for me then

   she is ready-ballasted with a good
cargo manned by a selected gang of mur-
derers thieves cheats coiners deserters
adventurers they would storm the tower
of london for a shilling a man youll
love them clovelly and they have the
clear presentment of their characters writ-
ten at large in their faces

  good said clovelly but his voice
somehow was weak

  so they came into a little room which
it was apparent was part of the dukes
peculiar quarters it was no more than
an alcove with some shelves of books a fire
burning to the side a persian carpet of
tangled reds and blues and golds upon the
floor some monstrous dragons and other
works in china according to the newly in-
troduced fashion and above all a hanging
lamp which was supported by a slender
chain of gold and cast up as it burned a
slender stream of vapor which curled across
the ceiling and then dropped into delicate
rifts through the room which it filled with
the most exquisite fragrance

  the central table which was of ebony
richly inlaid with ivory was covered with
a litter of papers at which his grace had
just been working he knocked them into
a heap sat lightly upon the edge of the
table swinging a foot and waved cecily
and michael clovelly to chairs neither

of them however moved clovelly because
he was deep in thought and the girl be-
cause she was beginning to turn cold with
fear

  we have now come to the time for
our agreement said ipswich in his pleas-
antest manner  i presume you know
madame that your husband is presently
called away to duties in a very distant
land and that i am to serve as your pro-
tector during his absence

  there was a frightened cry from cecily
which brought a frown of surprise to the
face of the duke and made clovelly start

   michael she demanded  what does
it mean

   i have promised he answered finding
it hard to meet her great eyes  to bring
you to a heaven upon earth and here it is
what will you have cecily great wealth
power half the kingdom at your beck
it is common knowledge that his grace
is the key to the kings heart and you will
have the turning of it

   you have sold me

  his grace stepped to the farther side
of the chamber and waited ill at ease at
this unexpected turn of events rubbing his
chin with his finger tips and looking hastily
from one face to the other but clovelly
saw that his eye was kindling and in-
deed cecily had never seemed so lovely as
she was now with fear making her pale
and despair giving her courage

   sold you echoed clovelly gloomily
 i have only done my best to advance
you what higher position could you ask
 to be your wife michael-your true
wife to love you-to honor and obey you
michael michael you have sworn to pro-
tect me 

  and now light broke upon the mind of
michael clovelly he looked wildly about
him upon the luxury of that room where
a whole fortune had been lavished to make
the comfort of a single corner of a house
he stared again at his grace of ipswich

  the evidence of his eyes and of his ears
had been against this woman to damn her
as one who loved pleasure only but here
was evidence almost equally strong that
she preferred poverty with him to all that
wealth could do for her
clovelly



   your grace he said  we must talk
further upon this matter

   let madame retire to the next room
said ipswich biting his lip

  he went to the door and opened it upon
an adjoining chamber

  no no cried cecily if i leave
you what may happen to me god alone
knows why should you talk to him

   there is no other way said michael
shaking his head

  then he went to her and took her hand
and as he stood close to her she felt his
whole body trembling with excitement

   can you trust me cecily he said
she lifted her head at that and looked
him steadily quietly in the face there
is a strength and a courage needed to meet
the weight of a mans eye but strength
and courage were in her and this sad
unshrinking patience gave her beauty such
a poignant grace that clovellys heart
ached

  he could only say  wait in the next
room beyond this door you will not be
long alone

   is it good-by michael she asked him
quietly and before he could answer she was
gone through the door

  he closed the door upon her and turned
to ipswich who was regarding him steadily
beneath a scowl of anger

   mr clovelly he said grimly  i fear
that the country has had an ill effect upon
you or is it considered good manners even
in the country to whisper before ones
host

  clovelly flushed but there was such a
wealth of happiness crowding into his heart
at that moment that he could not be angry

   your grace he explained  we must
come to a new agreement

   ah

   i agreed to bring the lady to you

   exactly

   and i have done so

   in a manner-yes

   and now my lord i shall take her
away from you

  by the dear heavens clovelly you
are mad to say so

   your grace said clovelly  will hold
me to my contract

   strictly clovelly i have seen her
man i reached for gold and i have found
diamonds let her go again i am not
quite witless my friend

   my lord clovelly remarked  i have
in my time been a sufficient rascal i have
been a pirate a swashbuckler an outlawed
highwayman and do you think that i shall
now hesitate to steal away the woman i
love

   i have fulfilled my contract i tell you
i have brought her to your house as for
the ship which is your price let it sail or
sink for all of me i want none of it

   only cecily i desire and her i shall
have by force if need be but surely your
grace will not attempt to keep a woman who
has shown that she has no liking for you
 for the moment perhaps not the
duke admitted  her head i see has been
turned by her galloping ranting fighting
cavalier who has dragged her from her
fathers house and half across the kingdom
but that will pass i know ways to soften
stubborn hearts clovelly

   no no- for the matter of her present
reluctance-it is a mere nothing

  it is not to be considered and as for
taking her away with you again - tush
man she has been bought and sold i do
not care to put a new price on her as for
taking her away by force-i tell you clov-
elly that i have a dozen men here any
two of whom could stop you

  these statements clovelly seemed to con-
sider for a time leaning against the wall
and looking down at the floor but pres-
ently he stepped without a word to the door
turned the key in the lock and dropped it
in his pocket

   you are quite right sir he said
 there is only one way in which i can
safely take her away and that is through
your command

   how will you buy that from me tell
me clovelly i warn you that i have
taken a deeper fancy to her than to any
trifle that has met my eyes these many
years for she has more than beauty
clovelly she has brains the clever minx
can play the part of virtue as well as any
good woman i ever saw and-

   my lord you are speaking of my wife 


argosy-allstory weekly

  ten thousand devils clovelly are
you mad

  you speak of prices and purchases i
can pay a great price sir

   of pirate gold clovelly sneered the
duke

 of pirate gold my lord do you see
and slipping his rapier from its sheath
he made it swerve so dexterously through
the air that the yellow lamplight flashed
solid upon it

  ah cried ipswich is that the
tune you will murder me to take the girl
safely away with you

   if it is necessary said clovelly calm-
ly  i shall stab you to the heart my lord
and take my wife away with me

  his grace turned crimson with anger his
rapier hissed and hummed in the air he
brought it forth with so much violence
then he saluted clovelly deliberately

   you are already half-spent with fight-
ing lascelle he observed  do you de-
liberately challenge me in spite of that

   in the name of god said clovelly
 begin 

   she is worth the price  cried his grace
as if the picture of her beauty had at that
instant flashed more brightly across his
memory  clovelly you are right gold
cannot buy a woman the metal is too
base the steel alone is worthy of her
on guard

  he gasped out the last word as he lunged
with fury his sword was flicked away
with a touch of the other blade so soft that
it was like the pressure of a bare hand
and the duke suddenly was aware that it
was one thing to see clovelly fence--it was
quite another to feel his opposition

  a thousand light quick hands seemed to
surround clovelly and pushed danger gen-
tly away from him for a moment he stood
on the defense then he began to attack

  his grace was a brave man a thousand
times proved moreover he was an ex-
quisite fencer who fought like an artist of
infinite invention to the very last he
would be dangerous

  but against the rush of clovellys attack
against that onslaught of a dozen schools
of fence he was carried back as a log be-
fore a tide through the door of the study

and into the larger chamber beyond he re-
treated where the clicking of steel on steel
sounded smaller and colder and raised many
little echoes from the walls

  still he kept a good front while his
breath held but when his wind was gone
he was helpless the point of clovellys
rapier flickered before his eyes

   your grace gasped clovelly  let us
make an end you see that the advantage
is in my hand but god forbid that i should
use it-

   damn your courtesy said the noble-
man hotly  i am as ready to die now as
a year hence 

  and with this he rushed blindly in upon
clovelly the latter might have killed him
three times during that blind advance but
instead he chose to glide out of the way
dancing back until ipswich should come to
his senses

  then fate took a hand against the con-
queror clovellys foot lodged on a small
rug which slipped from beneath him as if
the floor had been greased he landed heav-
ily upon his side his wrist striking so solidly
that the nerves wtere numbed the rapier
clattered from his fingers and he lay pros-
trate and helpless before his enemy

  it appeared for an instant that ipswich
would pass his weapon through the body of
his opponent he leaned above him with
his face swollen and reddened by exertion
his sword quivering in his hand

  surrender clovelly he commanded

   the devil has played on your side an-
swered clovelly  do with me what you
will i shall not surrender

   you are in my hands

   stab and be damned

chapter xxxiii

an unendurable doubt

his grace was often cruel but never
wantonly so now he shook his
head

   if you were any other man in eng-
land he said at last  id send the blade
through you clovelly but ive an idea
that you are a man of honor my friend
rise
clovelly



  clovelly stood up white-lipped from the
shame of his defeat almost the first that
had ever come to him sword in hand

   tush man tush  said ipswich  you
act as though some fat old man had beaten
you or some boy newly come into his
swordship and his oaths but i tell you
man that no man living can say that he has
seen ipswich worsted with the small sword

   matters went a bit against me at first
my wind is short and im damnably out
of practice but aside from that and the
bit of bad luck which brought you a fall
i think i should have paid you home be-
fore the end

  thus spoke the duke raising his spirits as
he argued more with himself than with the
other he had been a desperate and half-
beaten man a moment before shamed and
helpless before the swordsmanship of clov-
elly

  but now as he talked of the battle he
smoothed out the doubt from his brain he
was laying the basis for a magnificent lie
concerning that battle which would be
bruited through the fashionable circles of
london the next day and as he thought
how much that tale would do to establish
him as an achilles as well as a paris he
could not help looking upon his associate
with a greater warmth of good feeling at
least clovelly made no reply and his si-
lence might be interpreted as an agree-
ment

   however continued his grace  i
have no desire to use my sword to make
my fortune-or to save it even we have
fought for the lady fairly and honorably

   chance and the sword gives her to me
i might make no other payment but in-
stead i shall carry out to the letter my first
agreement with you

   the ship is prepared you may take
command of it when you will and that
should prudently be as soon as possible
for the kings men are looking for you
clovelly old hampton has put another
five hundred pounds on top of his standing
reward to any one who will bring about
your capture-or your death

   there is only one thing in the world
which is of any concern to me said clov-
elly

   the spanish main of course to a
man of your metal there must be action
england is a dull place by gad i feel it
myself every day only dull habit makes
a fool of me and keeps me here

   not the spanish main there is only
my wife my lord

  ipswich made a wry face

   you love her clovelly

  the husband shrugged his shoulders

   but how under heaven you can said
the duke  is a miracle to me you are
a man of pride and you have seen with
your own eyes and heard with your own
ears enough to-

  clovelly groaned

  and at this his grace drew back a little
and looked at clovelly with new eyes

   this is the way of it then he nod-
ded speaking more to himself than to clov-
elly  the tale of samson and delilah
over again

  clovelly was silent

  take up your sword said ipswich
suddenly

  clovellys eyes gleamed then with a
sigh he murmured  will you run that
risk again my lord

  his grace smiled faintly

   i have nothing to fear from that
damned subtle blade of yours he declared
 you are an honest man clovelly you
are a thousand times more honest than you
yourself guess and i have nothing to fear
from you that sword will be locked into-
the sheath until i give it permission to be
drawn

  clovelly stooped without a word and re-
placed the weapon in its scabbard

   now my friend i can offer you a fail
gamblers chance

   my lord

   the spanish main to which a vow
leads you has shrunk to a small pond i
take it

   there is more treasure in one word
from her than in a thousand galleons your
grace

   poetically expressed very much to
the point but concerning another matter
if you should attempt to live with her as
man with wife consider that you are also
marrying your doubt of her


argosy-allstory weekly

   god knows it

  you will put only one meaning upon
the smiles of men you pass in the street
 i shall endure it

   you think so now but i tell you
clovelly you are wedding yourself to an
infinite torment whose fire shall not cease
to burn if you live five score years

   it is true groaned clovelly

   in spite of all this you will have her
   if god will help me to her

   now clovelly your doubt of her was
based chiefly upon a story told by one
man

   talk of marberry-and the evidence of
my own eyes

   eyes and ears will lie i say pull your
cloak about your face and go to marberry
wring the full truth from him if it is as
black as i think you will fiad it then i am
trusting that you will never wish to lay
eyes on the lady again but if you make
that rascal confess that he has lied then
your doubt vanishes like a pricked bubble
clovelly raised his head with a start

   and while i am gone-the lady-

   remains here with me

   my lord

  i have said it she remains here with
me while you work in your own way i
work in mine when you return even if
you wish to have her i trust that i shall
have persuaded her that there is happiness
with ipswich

  clovelly turned pale

   only persuasion will be used on my
honor and ill wager you a hundred
pounds clovelly-

   my lord on this subject i do not bet
   your answer then

   there is only one choice for me i
must take it and leave her here-god de-
fend the right

  you have grown into a pious pirate
clovelly but now start on to your work
adieu

   adieu my lord

   you have ways of making the fellow
speak even against his will

  a smile of infinitely cruel malignity ap-
peared upon the grim face of michael clov-
elly then gathering his cloak about him
he retreated to the door bowed and dis-

appeared his grace stepped to a bellcord
and pulled it whereat the soft-footed ran-
dal instantly appeared at sight of the
crumpled displaced rugs an overturned
chair and the disorder of his masters per-
son his eyes grew big

   say nothing guess nothing randal
commanded the master  to-day i have
mastered the finest blade in the world fight-
ing upon equal terms bring me a glass of
sherry then lay out that newest suit of
plum-colored velvet quickly quickly
i have a great campaign to make 

chapter xxxiv

gossip

there was need for the porter who
worked in the service of edward mar-
berry to be a man of discretion and
of perception he gave the young gentle-
man who wished to see his master so im-
portunately one glance and was about to
close the door and shut the fellow into the
outer dark when something caught his eyes
-of sufficient importance to make him open
again hastily and stare at the man out-
side he now seemed to make sure for
suddenly he began to smile more with his
eyes than his lips and stepped back waving
to the stranger to enter

  the later slipped with a light step within
the door a slender figure rain-beaten with
a cloak of black which time had rusted a
hat with a bedraggled feather and boots
enriched with red mud half way to the
knees

   im sure said the porter  that mr
marberry will see you-sir

  and with an odd accent upon the last
word he left his guest and disappeared into
his masters room he came again with his
smile now broad enough to be plainly vis-
ible and he ushered the nameless stranger
into a high-ceilinged room at one end of
which was a table covered with various
bottles and several glasses beside the
table resting in a great reclining chair
heaped with pillows was the invalid who
had been recruiting himself and killing the
time with recourse to the wine-bottle

  it was edward marberry himself not
clovelly



yet recovered from a wound which he had
received at sword play with clovelly not
many days before suffering of the flesh
had been less than the suffering of the
spirit of this man who could not bear to be
shut away from all of his old delights of
fluttering around the court of haunting the
fashionable coffee-houses of hearing a rare
word from a wit here and a profound judg-
ment there of sipping like a bee at a thou-
sand flowers a thousand bits of gossip
spiced with malice and blending all that
pollen into a honey of delicious lies to be
given freely away to those who were his
friends

  how could ned marberry endure a life
cooped within half a dozen rooms no mat-
ter that his friends came often about him
the aroma of the tales they told him was
staled already by time for what is the
joy of sitting still like an old woman over
her knitting and listening to the chattered
scandal which two granddaughters rattle for
each other and for her ears

  far sweeter far sweeter surely to over-
hear a conversation whispered in a corner
of wills coffee-house with so keen an ear
that all the double meanings are deciphered
and unspoken things are added to the spok-
en how exquisite a delight to probe
through the conversation of two fops and
under the flowing of their banter to discov-
er the very names of the ladies of whom
they talk

  in such arts was marberry a master he
was indeed a known genius in his line and
those who wished not for the rank and open
talk of the court but for those hidden un-
dercurrents and for those overtones of mis-
chief hunted him out and made much of
him if perchance he would open his budget
of news

  for although it was known that he would
rather invent lies than be discovered with-
out what he reported to be a  new tale
yet his lies were so cunningly planned and
always based at the foundation upon such
bedrock of truth that they never failed to
come near enough to the truth to make
some beauty in whitehall turn pale or
some gentleman at a fashionable tavern
wince while the steel glided through his
spirit

  but having been confined to his room
or damned to it as he phrased his impris-
onment every hour and every day infinitely
increased his misery and he was now in a
poisonous frame of mind so that a smile of
nervous malice was constantly upon his thin
lips and wrinkling his haggard cheeks and
his tongue carried a mortal sting in every
sentence

  he watched the shadow of the closing
door before he looked up from his chair to-
ward his visitor although the face of the
stranger was thoroughly masked by a high
furling cloak collar yet marberry saw
enough to make him shrug his shoulders
and laugh

   youve ridden through the mud then
he said  lord betty youve come on a
far journey like a little fool dont stand
there like an idiot with your face still
masked come come

   any man with an eye in his head could
tell by the mincing manner in which you
stand with your feet so close together that
there is a woman beneath that cloak and
a damned silly one i believe but show
your face minx im tired of talking to a
wall

  at this the collar of the cloak was low-
ered

   by all the dear heavens  breathed the
voluptuary half rising himself from his
chair until the sudden burning of his wound
made him release his hold upon the arms of
the chair and sink back again

  then  clovelly shouted marberry

   a little louder sneered clovelly
 london will be glad to hear that i am
come

   have you dared to show your face in
the city cried marberry when the
whole town is placarded with descriptions
of you and rewards offered

   i have brought some few along with
me said clovelly

  he plucked some crumpled handbills out
of his pocket and cast them upon the table

   the price of my head goes up he ob-
served casually  what with the contribu-
tions of the worthy squire and my lord pen-
nistone i considered that there was enough
offered to make me a fat prize even to a
prince of the blood royal but now in comes


argosy-allstory weekly

the solid puritan oliver perth and claps
a round two hundred pounds upon my head
in addition slife mr marberry this is
a forwarding of the kings justice with a
vengeance eh

  marberry gazed upon him fascinated

   but what brings you to me he asked
 why are you come to me rather than to
any other in london

   partly said clovelly  to confer a
favor and partly to receive one

  and the nature of these favors
u why marberry i confer a favor upon
you by giving you a subject for gossip am
i wrong half of london will flock to
your chambers when they learn that the
celebrated man-killer and robber michael
clovelly actually presumed to call upon
you and tell you anecdotes of the open
road

  but what anecdotes will you tell clov-
elly

   i should not presume to put words into
the mouth of a master i abandon such a
small matter entirely to the invention of
mr marberry

   you are kind marberry declared
smiling in spite of himself

   but said clovelly  do not have me
kill too many men i detest bloodshed on
my honor six or ten you may reasonably
put in but there call a halt you may tell
them also that clovelly drank your health
in your own wine

  here he poured a glass of sherry from the
bottle which was standing on the table
tasted it cautiously rolled it in his mouth
until he had formed an opinion of its ex-
cellence and then drank off the rest of the
glass as slowly and as luxuriously as a cat
finishing a plate of cream

   will it serve asked marberry

   it is good it is at least good enough
i have tasted some sherry lately that was
like a mixture of plum juice and fire com-
bined you are a lucky fellow marberry
to have such wine under your roof

   i am very sensible of that but since
we seem to have finished with the favor
which you are doing me what is the favor
which i may do for you

   a simple one but one of the greatest
importance you must know that every

true highwayman marberry warms his
heart in his constant isolation and loneli-
ness by reflecting that most of the world
is constantly talking about him all lonely
men are vain you know

   and what you may do fbr me is simply
to repeat the details of my visit to you with
a few embroideries from your fancy-just
such as you think will furnish a good tale
thus we are both benefited

   clovelly this is all beside the point
you have come to london-

  to hear the talk about myself i have
been loitering through the streets of lon-
don all day tasting the gossip and picking
up odds and ends of information about my-
self and above all enjoying the safety

   if you were seen

   i shall not be simply because people
see only what they expect to see and be-
cause they are blind to the unexpected i
could walk through london for a month be-
fore the hue and the cry would be raised
against me when i had heard what i
could in the nooks and the corners i de-
cided to come to you so that my call might
serve to give you a basis for invention

  it is true  murmured marberry  his
grace of ipswich will forget that he and i
have fallen out and will come to hear the
odd tale from my own lips

   i have no doubt but that you will make
a very good thing of this visit

   it is a treasure clovelly i forgive you
the thrust that chained me here i am your
friend

   you are very kind sir

  but now to come a little closer to the
cold facts of your call-you are out of
money clovelly you have come here seek-
ing a little cash

   nonsense when there are so many
fat wallets in london one does ones beg-
ging with the edge of a knife it cuts the
strings of purses painlessly

  at this though he burst into a soft
chuckling but all this while his glance
never wavered from the eyes of his host
and though he laughed his expression grew
not a whit more pleasant this was un-
easily observed by marberry yet he forced
himself to laugh in company with his
strange guest

                          a
clovelly



   you are rare clovelly

   and yet marberry i confess that there
is another reason for my coming to you-
keep your hand from that bell-cord my
friend good while i stand here chat-
ting you are thinking what an excellent
figure i would make upon the scaffold be-
side jack ketch are you not

   in the name of heaven do you think
me such a brute as this

  but he could not constrain his blush

   enough marberry we know each
other

   then-be damned to you for a knave
what will you have

   the truth about a very small matter-
a matter as small as a woman in fact and
her name is madame clovelly 

chapter xxxv

darkness flees

marberry waved his hand as one
who will take up a conversation only
by compulsion so to speak

   women at best are poor things for
talk clovelly said he

  clovelly sat down lightly on the broad
arm of a chair and swung one foot in the
air as he continued  you are a known
man marberry not a man or a woman in
london but knows what a clever devil you
are with the ladies they cannot resist
you man

  the other smiled in spite of himself

   no talk of that he remarked care-
lessly

  but it must be talked of when all
london is willing to listen and to believe
but marberry i was with milverton as i
think you know on a certain night when
we saw you leave a certain garden which
shall be nameless

   i remember growled marberry  and
the next morning milverton would walk
with me i peppered him properly and then
in come you with your damned sword magic
and run me through

 by the eternal heavens clovelly it is
neither right nor fair for such fellows as
yourself to take the field against simple
honest gentlemen what chance have we
 a

against you no more chance than a man
off the streets has to match the tricks of a
master juggler

  he shuddered as he remembered

   if i had known about you then what i
know now he said  id have seen you
damned before id have engaged you id
have set a gang of bullies to maul you in
the streets by night to keep off the meet-
ing 

  he shivered again  pour me another
glass of that sherry clovelly im cold
through and through when i even think of
it you might have killed me on the spot
-with no more effort upon your part gad
there was a life-a special malice in that
sword of yours i swear to heaven that it
worked against me of its own account and
of its own accord

   you say much too much sir but con-
cerning the lady-for you see i did not
kill you

   what about the lady what about
the lady asked marberry sharply  what
the devil have you to learn from me about
the lady youre married to her arent
you

    after a fashion of speaking i am
after a fashion after a fashion
what mean you by that

   you are testy mr marberry but the
question i wish to ask may be very short-
ly put

    put it then put it then and be damned
im tired of this talk clovelly

   in one word then was milverton
right

   about what no damn him hes never
right

   ah

   one would think that i had given you
a present of a great estate to judge by your
face what is it you want to know of me
 you have already answered me when
you said that milverton was wrong in
thinking that cecily medhurst had been
your mistress

   did i say that then well

    is it not true man

   you are very pale clovelly

    is it true marberry

   fore god one would think that you
loved the girl


argosy-allstory weekly

   no matter for all that you destroy
my very soul by refusing to speak say
yes or no

   to what

   marberry if you push me too far re-
member that i am a man of violence and
i have been in places where sick men had
scant grace

   come lad i only teased you its
about cecily is it but you cannot come
to me expecting to pull out all the secrets of
my inward life like a soul-doctor to whom
im confessing my sins

   i have not expected it for nothing
look here my friend look here

  he drew his hand from his pocket and
clapped upon the table beside marberry a
long almond-shaped emerald the other
took it up with a cry and looked to it with
a keen and knowing eye

   very good upon my word he de-
clared  this will do indeed clovelly
this is a very precious jewel or else i am
a blind owl no by the lord if this green
heaven came near me the blindness would
leave my eyes to let me see it and this
is an exquisite and a perfect jewel my
friend what the devil do you mean with
it

    its the price my friend its the price
im paying you for one bit of that truth
drawn from your inner life tell me
were you the messenger of oliver perth
only or were you in truth in that garden
on a mission of your own

  the face of the roue wrinkled to a smile
very good he murmured very
good indeed of course i was there sim-
ply as the messenger of the roundhead

   marberry you smile

 i cannot help but smile-when i think
that i was only the messenger of perth
clovelly staggered and dropped his hand
upon the back of a chair to support him-
self

   it is true then he whispered  and
she is as black as i have guessed

  marberry shrugged his shoulders and
cherished the emerald between his hands

   for such a price-one must tell the
truth even about a charming lady my
friend even though the truth is a fire that
burns you

  then brighter than the shining of the
jewel the blue-white of the naked sword
blade shone in clovellys hand

   what a good work it would be he
snarled through his set teeth to loose that
jackal soul of yours and send it hunting in
another world than this what an act of
charity it would be

  marberry shrank from him and twisted
both his hands into a knot before his face
to keep from his view the quivering bright
death

   do you mean to murder me clovelly
for telling the truth

  no but for most damnably lying
you have two seconds in which you may
commend yourself to god-if you have a
god marberry you are about to die

   no  screamed the wounded man cow-
ering in the chair his lips grinning in the
agony of his fear  in the name of mercy
clovelly

   speak the truth then

   i shall-i shall-

  he choked and gibbered in his frantic ef-
fort to speak while the terror nearly froze
his lips

  now commanded clovelly

  i came from perth to her gasped
marberry

   is that the truth

   the whole truth

   you lied when you hinted that she
served you as a mistress

  i lied clovelly

  to make the world think you invinc-
ible with women

   yes-yes-before god you shame me
but that was the reason

   and you sacrificed the pure name of a
blameless girl for that same reason

   i confess it

   tell me this-have you ever dreamed
or guessed at evil in her

  no gasped marberry twisting in his
chair as the foulness of his sin was drawn
out from him in its full horror  i swear
to you clovelly that so far as i have
known her she has always been more of
a saint than a woman

  there broke from clovellys lips a wild
shout of joy he cast up his hands his
face suffused with color
clovelly



   then instinct was right he cried  it
has told me the truth whenever i have been
near her it has roared out to me above the
evidence of my eyes and my ears she
had met you secretly for the sake of perth
with the courage and the pure heart of a
blameless girl she dared to interview you
in the middle of the night and dismiss you
herself from the gate of the garden

   she did

   marberry-you consummate devil oh
cecily my beautiful-

  and he turned and rushed from the room

  when he was gone marberry reached for
the bell-but a second thought made him
draw back his hand again whatever he
had lost in that interview he had gained
a jewel of which a king might have been
proud

  he leaned back in his chair again the
congested look of fear and shame left his
face the emerald lay like a pool of the
purest beauty in the palm of his hand it
was more to this voluptuary than any
woman

  but in the meantime clovelly had
reached the street with a brain on fire for
the dread which haunted him now was that
at the very moment when he discovered the
perfect purity of cecily she would be lost
to him

  it was strange enough he thought that
she could have preferred him to ipswich
even for an instant but it would be a
miracle indeed if she still preferred him
to the duke when the latter had had a
chance to show himself in his most winning
fashion to her and display before her all
the resources of his fortune all the talents
of his person

  it was white harry that he rode through
the streets of london but even the speed
of this powerful animal was slower than
a snails pace dragging him wearily out the
oxford road white harry was staggering
with exhaustion when his master at last
flung himself from the saddle

  into the court ran clovelly and there
the solid blackness struck him in the face
no light was burning all was sordid
darkness

  it so sickened him that he felt his
strength give way at the knees he stag-

gered to the nearest door the handle
turned at once and admitted him to a
pitch-dark hall he called out he knew
not what and the long echoes rolled away
the house was empty

  and then feeling what it meant-that
cecily had indeed made her choice and that
ipswich had taken her with him to another
dwelling-all his agony broke from him in
a terrible cry cecily

  he dropped upon his knees he covered
his face with his hands no tears came from
his eyes but his body shivered and was
wrenched with agony for this he told
himself mutely was the judgment of god
come upon him here was the end of his
strength here was a defeat which all his
skill with the sword could not redeem but
he was wrecked as utterly as a fine ship
struck suddenly upon a reef

  then it seemed to clovelly that he heard
that voice of infinite sweetness calling to
him out of the distance of his memory
 michael  as she had called on that other
night when he had lost her in the wood
and she had guided him back to her with
her own voice at that memory he felt he
should go mad

  and ah what a consummate fool he had
been to doubt her after that final proof of
faith what a fool to make the slightest
question of her after once looking into the
crystal purity of her eyes

  but small and far yet vibrant with
grief and fear he heard that cry again
 michael

  it is not possible groaned clovelly
 god having seen me and judged me
would not let me find her again this is
all an illusion to drive me mad

  a door opened and into the thick black-
ness of that hall came her very voice like
a blinding light to clovelly

   michael

  he tried to answer but his throat was
aching and stiff with the marvel of this
thing then he stretched out his arms al-
though he could not rise from his knees

  he managed to utter a sound he knew
not what word but it brought a wailing cry
of joy down through the darkness toward
him until suddenly she was within his
arms she was kneeling before him she was

weeping and the catch and the panting of
her breath stirred against his cheek

   i have heard everything from that dog 
marberry he told her  i know it all-

i know everything of your sweetness and
goodness-of my blindness-

   and i michael know only this-which
is that i love you i love you my dear-
est-

  afterward they could speak of lesser
things they could descend out of the sweet-
ness of their lovers heaven to the dull and
foolish earth and light a taper to aid their
eyes and then she gave him a letter which
ipswich had left with her for her husband
when he came he tore it open and read
within

  clovelly

  i have made your peace with the king

  you are no longer an outlawed man there

  is only one punishment for having doubted
  the blessed angel who has been foolish enough
  to love any man-that is to find her in a
  dark house alone in the meantime know
  that that house is yours and everything in it
  you will see that if i sometimes pay much
  for the services of a crafty man and an evil
  woman i shall pay much more for the friend-
  ship of a strong man and a good woman
  god bless you both with happiness she is
  a dear child i blush for my folly that i
  should have dared to doubt her

the scoundrel marberry must be left to me

                                               g i

  when they had read that letter they
blew out the taper and sat silently in the
darkness again watching the moon rise over
the woodland and then pass into the fra-
grant gloom of the chamber where they sat
creeping across the floor until their feet were
bathed in silver and the tendrils of the vine
which swung at the window were little
branches of purest silver also

         the end

 v	u	tr
harbinger of age

 iwty years are not many to tell the truth-
      well fifty and some odd then

 but what is that in these days when youth
 lasts on until threescore ten

 i know that my hair is the least bit gray

 and possibly thin on top

 but goodness me i can golf all day
 or waltz till the players drop

 i dont eat gruel and i need no cane

 and i havent grown sour nor staid

 my hearings good and my teeth pertain

 and i still have an eye for a maid

 to-day at the smythes-betty brown was there-
 nineteen and an imp for fun

 and some one bet that she didnt dare
 to kiss me well betty won

 she kissed me light as a whisp of spray-

 not giggling nor shy nor bold-

 but quite in an every-day thoughtless way

 and i know that im getting old

from the lone tree which adorned the
highway from encina to trinidad
hung four dead men pendant like
flying foxes or monstrous cocoons to the
gnarled dry branches grass as sparse as
a tartars beard vainly tried to cover the
ground and made a charred forest for big
lazy ants horned toads basked in the shade
of skeletal shrubs and a little way off a
pinto pony impatiently pawed the sand
beneath the tree his hands propped behind
him lay a man over his buckskin chaps
and glossy tall heeled boots sprawled the
grotesque shadows of the bandits

  the man was brown and had gun-metal
colored eyes which gazed out across the
desert it was gray and rumpled as a
great fallen tent and cactus and yucca trees
stuck through it like the hands and arms of
giants caught in the wreckage along the
base of the distant hills a freight train
crawled and then entered a tunnel like a

string of red ants to the left through a
yellow haze as of pollen dust were faintly
visible the squat misshapen buildings of a
town from which a road projected toward
the oasis along this road advanced a khaki
colored dust cloud

  after a while through the blur a horse
was visible and the dim outlines of a wagon
later the wagon was seen to be a buck-
board on the seat of which slumped a
lone driver

  when he drew up beside the tree the dust
wake floated ahead and enveloped him then
slowly precipitated onto the road the man
on the ground shoved his gun back into its
holster then sat up and clasped his knees
there was no need for caution here buck-
board horse and driver were on a last
feeble race to the scrap heap

  with his sleeve the stranger smeared a
streak of mud across his brow and raised
his eyes to the hanged men


argosy-allstory weekly

   do you know what youre sitting un-
der he drawled

  the other looked up through the filigree
of leaves and branches at the pleasant blue
and gold of the sky the sun was like a
pan of sizzling butter and floating across
the zenith were feathery white clouds--
swishy clouds as though swept by some
celestial broom then against the white
background appeared three black patches
which glided back and forth described
great swooping circles and finally hovered
for a while almost motionless he brought
his gaze back to the limbs of the tree and
grunted to the question an indifferent af-
firmation

   kind of a funny place to sit aint
it

   i used to know some of these guys
replied the man under the tree  im sort
of interested

  there was a brief silence as the stranger
turned and spat at a cactus leaf on the far
side of the buckboard he missed and the
road spat back a puff of gray dust  darn
good job though

  the other looked up blankly

   i say its a darn good job-hanging
those fellows

   yes i guess they were a pretty bad
lot some of them were good scouts though
take that one hanging on the end there
he could fight with anything from a beer
bottle to a rapier and he was a prince to
talk or drink with sierra sam always had
something of the old time cavalier about
him look at those mustachios for in-
stance and that crimson sash around his
waist even his rope necklace he wears
with a distinguished air

  the buckboard driver dropped the reins
his horse nearly fell  you seem to be
quite an admirer of his

   i am on the other hand that fellow
next to him was a surly cuss you couldnt
trust him long enough to blink your eyes
he looked up to where hung zapato the
half-breed renegade with his eyes and
tongue disgustingly protruding  he was
brave all right but you could never be sure
his delight in disemboweling gringos
wouldnt be directed against yourself

   who was that next to him the

stranger pointed to a pair of great feet
which dangled from the topmost branch

   walrus bill there wasnt an ounce of
meanness in old bill there was just barely
room in the big hogshead for his heart and
he used to kill deputies with all the good
nature of a mastiff

  the driver looked again as though to re-
assure himself that bill was dead  its
funny he said  i never knew any of
those guys ive lived around here for
thirty years and that little one on this side
is the only one that even looks familiar

   little dude davie you would have
been more apt to know him he acted as
a link between the band and the express
companies and banks he looks ridiculous
there dont he beside the walrus davie
used to be a forger and pickpocket but
he got tired of being respectable so he came
out west

  the stranger crossed his legs and leaned
back one arm holding apart his head and
the seat  you didnt happen to know the
chief too did you id be willing to trade
the whole lot for him hes the cleverest
crook weve had out here since the early
days

  the man under the tree flicked an ant
from the tall heel of his boot  i dont
know he said dubiously  i figure its
more luck than anything else with a little
ordinary head work thrown in maybe

   how do you mean

   well the night they were caught for
instance the chiefd be hanging up there
now only he happened to be in town with a
toothache

   whered you get that

   we go to the same dentist

  another gray puff from the road and the
driver grew reflective

   yes he conceded  that was luck all
right but take that express robbery he
pulled last month that train was a regu-
lar traveling arsenal and yet they wasnt a
shot fired

   just an example of the head work i
was telling you about the chief figured
the jobd go off a lot smoother if the
guards had ammunition without any pow-
der in it so one of his gang who was work-
ing with the company fixed it up for him
an engagement in trinidad



  the stranger leaned forward his elbows
resting on his knees  i still claim though
hes clever yet theys always one weak
spot in the best of them hes going to
get caught seeing that girl of his in trini-
dad

   im not so sure about that either
shes got a pretty good head of her own
the driver pulled a plug from his pocket
brushed the dust from its gnawed edges
and then took a prodigious chew when it
had found a comfortable bed in his mouth
 you know more about this fellows busi-
ness he said  than anybody i seen
whered you get all your information

   i work up at red mcdonalds place at
las palmas the gang used to come in
there and i guess the chief took a liking
to me when hed had a few drinks he got
confidential

  a gleam of intelligence lighted the wiz-
ened face of the owner of the buckboard
he scratched his head and examined the
other perplexedly  thats most in-
terestin he said  but i cant quite get it
clear why i never met you before red
mcdonalds is one of my favorite saloons
 i just helped out once in a while in the
evenings probably i was off when you
happened to be there

  now the driver absorbedly studied his
new acquaintance who looked back ques-
tioning  excuse me said the stranger
 for staring at you this way but you look
surprisinly like a brother of mine who went
out to the coast

   they say theres a double for every-
body in the world the other answered in-
differently he strained sand through his fin-
gers and a reply formed on the drivers lips

  then of a sudden a road runner skimmed
and whirred past within a foot of the rick-
ety buckboard the stranger grabbed the
reins of his frightened horse and from un-
der his denim jacket there was a flash of
nickel plate the man looked up with a
start as the deputy confusedly buttoned his
coat for a minute they stared at each
other wondering how much the other knew
then

   werent you goin to say something
when that road runner disturbed you
asked the chief

   yes i was wondering why you didnt
grab some of those fellows hanging up
there didnt you know they was worth
a thousand bucks apiece

  the chief looked towrard his horse which
was now stripping vthe leaves from its sec-
ond shrub  i dont believe in double-
crossing he said

   hm-m said the deputy  that seems
to me like pretty close figurin i think id
rather be in jim smiths shoes i under-
stand he used to belong to terrys gang
but now hes got four grand cold just for
pointin out the old mine where they hung
out

  the eyes of the chief narrowed his re-
ply embraced the whole family of slippery
smith

   i take it you dont care much for jim
smith

  a buzzard with its dusty ragged wings
and ugly red head alighted a short distance
off and gaped evilly at the tree  he beat
me on a horse trade once said the chief
from what ive seen of slippery smith
the only thing he ever did straight was
shootin

   you got to admit though hes fond
of horses hed be crazy about your pinto
there

  yes said terry  i suppose hyenas
have their good points too he rose and
walked sidewise toward his horse the
deputy gathered his reins

   you might meet jim if youre goin
toward the cross roads i just saw him at
the blacksmiths when i left las palmas

   ill try not to let it spoil my evening
terry mounted and walked his horse
alongside the buckboard

   well so long hope i see you some
time at reds

   thanks answered terry  but i been
located at trinidad lately if youre ever
over that way look me up

  the deputy awakened his drooping horse
and after watching him until he was out
of range terry galloped off in the opposite
direction

ii

  as he approached the cross road from
las palmas terry cursed himself the tenth


argosy-allstory weekly

time for a fool a point of pride with the
chief was an ability to sense the presence of
all minions of the law by instinct and to
have given himself away to such an in-
nocuous appearing old wreck was particu-
larly disagreeable by nature however a
fair man who always offered a victim his
life in exchange for his purse he was dis-
posed to believe in the fairness of heaven
so silently offered thanks for the road run-
ner and flash of nickel he further con-
soled himself with the thought that he
might be able to pay off an old debt the
chief was scrupulous in these matters

  it was unfortunate though to be discov-
ered at this particular time he looked
toward trinidad with its ill-proportioned
old freight car colored houses then he
considered the endless row of telegraph
poles which lined the road and the fila-
ments which connected them sparkling in
the bright sunshine terry had an engage-
ment that night in trinidad and not only
as he said did the girl have brains she was
constructed like a mail car and had a
mouth more enticing than the lock on an
express box reaching the four corners he
waited patiently for his creditor to appear

  soon trotting toward the four corners
from las palmas he saw a bay horse with
a rider who as he approached had some-
thing unpleasantly familiar about the car-
riage of his body when he came closer
terry noticed that the gait of the horse
slackened and observed a broad black felt
hat tilted forward over its owners face one
who did not know the man might have
thought that this was to shade his eyes but
terry knew that it was because the eyes of
slippery smith had a shiftiness that would
not bear looking at

  finally his horse was drawn to a walk
and two other eyes stared at one another
from the hip of each man a hairs pres-
sure on either gun would have discharged it
and the men estimated each other like two
bull terriers until at last the chief looked
up half smiling

   i figure he said  there isnt much
sense to us both dying at the same time-
what do you say we put up the artillery

  the eyes of smith narrowed as he peered
past the horizon of his hat brim  i was

just thinkin the same way he answered
 but i had a feeling our relations wasnt
very friendly these days

  the pressure on the triggers lightened
 you mean for squealing on the gang i
believe in being sensible about that the
way i look at it that was a good job for
both of us you get the reward i get five
times the loot

   its sure a pleasure to talk to a man
who sees things so clear answered smith
the guns were retired to their holsters
 of course i knew youd get away or i
never would have done it

   i want to thank you for that said the
chief

   dont mention it at all i just natur-
ally have a profound respect for men of
ability on the other hand i figure fools
are fair game

   sure answered the chief  and if
ever there was a bunch of bums those guys
were it it took more than half my time
keeping them out of trouble

  at this slippery smith relaxed  its
rather astonishin he said  how many
ideas we got in common did you ever
think of goin into some legitimate busi-
ness

   i never had much experience along that
line said terry  law sort of cramps
me

   youd soon get onto it all you got to
do is keep your eyes open people are just
dyin to trade gold pieces for plugged
nickels

   i dont know im getting kind of old
to learn a new trade i aint as versatile
as you are the chief again regarded the
wires and long line of poles as the pinto
strained at his bit his legs and body tense
as though made of sprung steel

   it looks to me like you got pretty good
taste in horse flesh thats a good business
another thing i noticed about people is
they seem to favor bad horses to good ones
you can make a good livin just by pleasin
them

  terry touched a spur to the pintos
flank it wheeled and then edged quiver-
ing alongside the bay  i suppose thats
true he said  but all the fine points miss
me if a horse has got endurance and a
an engagement in trinidad



lair amount of spirit thats all i know
enough to ask for

  jim smiths shifty eyes examined the
pinto from muzzle to fetlocks then reached
over and stroked its nose  maybe then
we could arrange a little private business
i got a weakness for pintos

   i got no objections said the chief
 color dont carry much weight with me
smith rolled a cigarette and lighting it in-
haled a deep puff  i tell you what ill
do his words and the smoke came out
together  business has been pretty pros-
perous with me lately ill give you the bay
for him and fifty bucks to boot

   that sounds like fifty to the good to
me said terry  i know you wouldnt
ride anything that wasnt at least passable
the men swung to the ground and loosed
the cinches on the belly bands having
changed saddles they remounted and the
chief extended his hand slippery smith
took it limply  dont happen to be ridin
toward trinidad do you

   no im headin for santa ynez to-
night i might see you there to-morrow
though if youre goin to be around

   sure i generally play a little pool after
lunch it pays the board and i sort of
enjoy it for a relaxation

   all right ill look you up they
crossed the road together and then smith
turned the pinto toward trinidad  oh
and say called terry  im expectin an
important telegram in trinidad this evenin
in case you dont see me to-morrow you
might forward it to me

   glad to and if i was you id seri-
ously consider going into business its
more profitable in the long run and you get
away from all the nervous strain in your
line you never know whats liable to hap-
pen

   its worth thinkin about all right
said the chief

iii

  at the top of a low hill a short distance
along the road to santa ynez terry stopped
and watched slippery smith as he galloped
toward trinidad behind him the setting
sun streaked the horizon with vermilion and

red and cast a green veil over the blue of
the sky the mountains slowly pulled dark
purple quilts over the rose blankets which
still covered their heads the windows of
the town turned to great topazes and its
crude outlines softened

  the bandit though was more interested
in the little grove of trees which adorned
the outskirts of trinidad he thought he
detected a stirring of life there it might
have been some stray cattle seeking shelter
for the night but as slippery smith ap-
proached terry had a feeling that this was
not the cause cattle are not so careful to
conceal themselves nor does their presence
make leaves tremble or boughs bend
down

  he watched the long easy strides of the
pinto as it entered the shadow of the grove
he admired the seat of jim smith in the
saddle and regretted for a moment that so
able a man should have such an inadequate
sense of honor then he saw a dozen gray
puffs like moths against the green back-
ground the pinto leaped to one side and
then dashed frightenedly into the grove as
the sharp rifle reports reached the santa
ynez road slippery smith threw up his
arms and fell in a crumpled heap

iv

  that evening while the buckboard
driver was on his way to trinidad and
the local deputies were making explanations
to the coroner terry circled the town and
entered by the road from elco before the
gate of a small white house he whistled and
a moment later a girl ran out and threw her
arms around the chief

  as they walked along the dark street she
clung to him like a starved puppy he put
his arm around her and looked down smil-
ing  been worried

  coaxing eyes greeted his smile  will
you promise me something terry

   maybe what is it

   give up train robbing-for me

   well maybe-for you said the chief
 i like to know where i stand you never
can tell whats going to happen in busi-
ness

  as conley came out of the deep
sleep into which he had fallen after
stopping oherns fist with his chin this
syllable sibilant and rather soft and sooth-
ing at first came to his ears

  considering the matter afterward he dis-
tinctly remembered that the sound was to
begin with distant soothing impersonal
he had been reclining against the ropes in
his corner of the ring when his eyes had
opened and then his ears his eyes as-
sured him that about the spacious hall of
the pastime athletic club were moving a
great many bodies not the constellations of
stars which he had seen at the instant he
interrupted the flight of that missile which
had felt so surprisingly like a horseshoe im-
bedded in a boxing glove but rather bodies
which moved with deliberation and grace
and between whom and him there seemed
to be not the slightest ill will these bodies
he realized considering the matter later

constituted the crowd trying to get out of
the pastimes lone entrance in time to catch
last cars home it was from the crowd that
had come the syllable so sibilant and inof-
fensive at first

  then out of that mass of bodies so court-
ly and courteous as he remembered them
at the beginning there had popped a face
and from between the lips of that face dis-
torted by wrath or mirth he could not tell
which there had issued

   you cheese 

  there was no mistaking hazy as con-
ley was and as inclined to float indefinitely
in the ether he realized that the stranger
had likened him to a cheese and not be-
cause of admiration there then appeared
other similar faces one two three a score
or more all distorted offensively and all
referring to the same dairy product

  nothing other than this experience could
so quickly have brought him to his senses
not even the bucket of cold water with

his natural truculence absent only when

 because ohern the lucky stiff happened

were could permanently squelch pat con-
ley he looked them in the eye and even
began to frame his lips on a few polysyll-
ables of his own steadily was he improv-
ing as martin burke trying to get him per-
pendicular could vouch for until among
that departing throng he saw the face of
liola mcdermott

  sweet-faced liola his girl was being
borne off in a group of his intimates among
the pastime youths and ladies evidently
they despaired of his arising before morn-
ing liola kept her soft dark eyes on him
and then-he could have sworn to it -
liolas mouth shaped itself to say

   you big cheese 

  at that pat conley relapsed his head
again dropped forward on his chest so
that manager martin cried somewhat im-
patiently into his ear

   come on pat get off your back will
you theyll be turnin the lights out on
us yet

  ignoring this plea conley heard burke
call for help to little tom thorpe a for-
mer admirer not yet out the door

   give us a hand here with pat tom
said the manager  ohern sure nicked
him this time hes wabbly yet and his
legs no good at all us two will have to
slide him along to the showers

  as burke and the still faithful tom
hooked conley under the arms and dragged
him on his heels off the scene of his mis-
fortune he himself was more active men-
tally than physically he pondered he
considered the obnoxious mention of cheese
why at the moment of his ill luck was
cheese referred to what resemblance was
there between him in his downfall and a
cheese

  a possible answer to that suddenly struck
him cold

  did they think the resemblance one of
color could they believe that he was
touched with sickly saffron hateful orange
--with yellow

  in the home of patrick conley some eve-
nings after the collision the recent event
was considered in great detail here con-
ley sr father of pat conferred with man-
ager martin burke

   tis a strange thing to me martin
ventured mr conley thoughtfully over his
pipe  that pat has always sich bad luck
wid this ohern tis the third time they
have met wid the gloves on every time
pat has done very well until the last roun
and thin it is each time that ohern does
manage to paste him for a home run

   its psychology mr conley asserted
martin

  mr conley shook his head

   it may be so he said at last  but
im thinkin pat has none of that

   its psychology insisted burke  you
know mr conley im a salesman durin
the day when im not helpin pat become
amacher champ well it takes psychology
to sell goods and it takes psychology to
win fights

   how does it work inquired mr con-
ley

  martin cleared his throat

  its like this he explained  ohern
and pat and i went to grammar school to-
gether now ohems drivin a milk
wagon pats learnin the steam fitters
trade and im sellin its a long ways from
now to when we were kids together but
when we were kids ohern could lick us
all with his fists and we cant forget it
so that though pat can lick better men
than ohern with the gloves when its
ohern hes in front of hes no better than
a ham

   a cheese

   exactly

   so that pat will always be bate by this
disease as sure as if he had the smallpox
commented mr conley dolefully

 he will unless we use psychology too


argosy-allstory weekly

   how kin we do it

  here martin smoothed back his black
hair and straightened the green tie beneath
his plump and rosy chin

   ive been thinkin of that mr con-
ley he admitted  thats where every
fighter whether hes a professional or an
amacher needs a manager the fighter
uses his fists and the manager that what
lies under his hat next month there comes
the fights for the amacher championships
and its up to me to find some way for pat
to bump off this gazoop ohern

  a thoughtful silence ensued broken at
last by conley sr saying

   tis strange that in this country whin
a mans not doin well people should spake
of cheese what is their objection to it
there is no food in the wur-rld a greater
blessin im thinkin exceptin pertaters
another silence followed this time to be
ended by the managers speaking

   i do not understand mr conley why
it is that a man should object to being called
a cheese but he does as you know so
does pat theres nothing in the world he
wouldnt rather be called its worrying
him the smack he got from ohern was
all over in a few minutes but the wallops
he gets from being called a cheese last
after the fight some of the boys were a
little sore ohern belongs to the john l
sullivan club as you know mr conley
and besides that the boys had bet their
money on pat who they think is the better
man pat heard some of em mentionin
cheese after the fight and hes come to
thinkin they call him nothin else now
hes got so bad he thinks liola mcdermott
calls him by the same name behind his
back now you know liola wouldnt call
any one a name-and least of all pat its
psychology workin on pat

   its too bad too bad commented mr
conley mournfully

   im not so sure of that said martin
 im thinkin it may be the savin of pat
the more he hears of cheese maybe the
better hell fight when he thinks every-
body is callin him behind his back roque-
fort or swiss or camembert or pimento or
gorgonzola or maybe limburger hell put
up a terrible battle to stop it

    tis true that pat never cared much for
furriners admitted mr conley

   im figurin on that said martin
 thats psychology mr conley and its
something a manager dont want to forget

  but the senior conley was dubious

   we had fights and many of thim in
ould ireland whin i was a boy said he
 but never once do i remimber hearin
of this disease

   tut tut mr conley rejoined man-
ager burke airily  but begging your par-
don theres many a thing we have in this
country and these times they were com-
pletely ignorant of in the olden days

iii

  a week before the bouts for the amateur
championships there was a dinner at the
conley home to which sat down with the
family miss liola mcdermott and man-
ager martin burke never did mrs con-
ley go to greater expense and care in pre-
paring a meal and as far as the food itself
was concerned never was she more success-
ful but despite her efforts a consider-
able shadow hung over the table

  the giving of the dinner with its two
guests was due chiefly to mr conley sr
for pat the oldest of the conley offspring
was gloomy since the night with ohem
pat had been a changed man pugnacious he
had always been from the cradle up but
despite the somewhat grim and solemn char-
acter of a natural fighting man he had for-
merly had his softer moments

  he would unbend on occasions with those
friends who questioned not his ability to
overcome with the gloves any amateur per-
former his own weight most of all was he
accustomed to unbend with the soft and
pleasing liola mcdermott but now since
ohern had met him on the chin all this
was changed he glowered at former
friends and passed them by he would
neither call on liola mcdermott nor listen
to her pleas over the telephone

    pats feelin bad conley sr had said
to manager burke in arranging for the din-
ner some days beforehand  so does poor
liola well bring thim together as ive
told you and wid the help of a good feed
only cheese



well have thim make up and get pat rid
of this tur-rible disease 

  but burke though he accepted the invi-
tation showed no great enthusiasm

   this psychology works two ways he
explained  sometimes it kills but some-
times it cures

  mr conley sighed

   tis all very strange to me he ad-
mitted  i never knew a disease to work
but one way

  the meal began with soup of that body
and flavor for which mrs conleys soup
was famous there followed beefsteak
thick and tender accompanied by a retinue
of vegetables and side dishes that would
have delighted any stomach yet the meal
dragged

  pat ate but he did not talk his jaws
moved but not in conversation poor liola
had been seated beside him but she re-
ceived no more attention from him than did
manager burke his parents or his four
younger brothers and sisters they might
talk among themselves as they did to some
extent at mr conleys nudging and wink-
ing but pat remained glum sour indif-
ferent to all but the victuals on his plate

  once mr conley urged upon miss mc-
dermott a second helping of creamed po-
tatoes one of mrs conleys most famous
dishes

   dont stint yerself wid these pertaters
liola advised conley sr  pat likes thim
this way too so it would be well im
thinkin if you would learn from mrs con-
ley how to cook thim

  at mr conleys wink liola blushed
glanced somewhat hopefully toward pat
and was at the sight ot that unresponsive
and adamant young gentleman cast into
complete dejection

  at the end came apple pie and coffee
liola helped mrs conley clear off the
preceding course and bring on the last one
and all the while with projected under-lip
pat fixedly observed the exact center of the
table cloth or the wall just above the head
of manager burke who sat opposite be-
fore each diner the two ladies serving set
a piece of pie at each right hand they
placed a cup of coffee the last thing to
be served mrs conley left to liola

  innocently liola carried in her right hand
a fork and in her left a plate upon which
lay a dozen small and appetizing looking
cubes innocently she went first to pat
and with the fork placed one of the cubes
beside pats pie

  there wras on the way to pats mouth
his first bite of pie but this never reached
its destination with some clatter it was
returned to the plate when pat noted what
liola had placed there

   why pat whats the matter cried
liola as he pushed his chair away from
the table

   whats the matter repeated conley
jr rising and in his anger reverting some-
what to the brogue of his ancestors  do
ye think i dont see what yeve got speared
on the end of that fork

   why pat its only-

   only cheese yere tryin to insult me
yere tryin to remind me of the night i
had the bad luck with ohern i heard
ye call me a big cheese and yeve been
callin me that ever since-every one of
ye im through with ye-all of ye im
goin 

  with that conley jr marched from the
table out of the door of the house and
dowm the street

  the pie was forgotten even by the
youngest of the conleys and mrs conley
and liola had grown somewhat pale

   shall i go after him asked mr con-
ley at last

  manager burke remained calm as a man-
ager always should

   i wouldnt follow him he said  this
may be the best thing tor him when he sees
ohern again and as for you liola you
neednt worry when he tips over ohern
next week itll be you he thinks of first

   theres one thing certain remarked
mr conley  and that is he dont like
ohern

   yes agreed manager burke very
slowly and thoughtfully  but whats more
he dont like cheese

iv

  the bouts for the amateur boxing cham-
pionships were in progress the largest


argosy-allstory weekly

building of the city was packed with spec-
tators and had it been twice as large it
could not have accommodated those per-
sons who now kicked their heels on the
sidewalks and street unable to get within
no athletic club of the town but was rep-
resented in the audience and every pastime
and every john l sullivan alive and well
this day was on hand for the john ls
looked to ohern to repeat while the pas-
times looked for him to do nothing of the
kind

  among the pastimes themselves there
was not altogether lacking criticism of those
mental processes of conley which for three
successive times had permitted ohern to
soak him on the chin though hearing them
argue with the john l sullivans it would
have appeared that they believed the proc-
ess reversed and that by some strange turn
of luck conleys chin had hurled itself upon
oherns fist

  the conley-hern bout was the last on
the program this was by general agree-
ment it being admitted on all hands that
the two young gentlemen were the class of
the amateurs of the town a spirited fight
was expected and this in spite of the last
three conflicts each so unexpectedly ended
by a sudden propulsion of oherns fist-
or of conleys chin according to how one
viewed it

  all other bouts being concluded the
crowd awaited the final one manager
burke first appeared in the ring carefully
inspecting ropes posts floor being deter-
mined to eliminate any intervention of the
supernatural in favor of the lucky mr
ohem

  manager burke was unusually serious
he was very anxious for pat conley to win
and upon his own responsibility he was
calling in the aid of psychology

  the two young battlers entered the ring
the referee brought them together and ex-
plained that they were to go four rounds
to a decision-unless the affair happened to
be decided before then the two shook
hands and as they stood facing each other
the crowd noted that ohern was a dark
youth and conley a red one and that
ohern looked very confident and conley
very grim

  round one from the first there was
plenty of action this being an amateur
bout and not a professional fists flew
conleys red head bobbed about as blows
landed on it but no more than did his op-
ponents the thump of gloves sounded
like the beating of carpets across the
ring the men rushed and back again and
if the red chased the black one instant
the operation was reversed the next the
crowd yelled the referee panted from his
exertions manager burke for once forgot
himself and chewed his nails never were
two fighters more intent upon their business
than were conley and ohern when the
bell rang for time

  there was a minute for recuperation be-
tween rounds both men breathed some-
what faster but otherwise neither seemed
in immediate need of repairs it had been
an even round and excepting pastimes and
john ls all spectators were agreed to that
to be safe the seconds worked on the
young gentlemens legs and the managers
assailed their ears conley sat glowering at
his opponent and if there appeared any
advantage to either man at this time it
was in that ohern looked so cocksure con-
cerning the future

  manager burke noted the look and
weighed its effect ten seconds before
time was up he winked at tom thorpe sit-
ting near the ringside at which that indi-
vidual muttered low yet clear the mono-
syllable

   cheese

  conley made a start in the direction of
thorpe

  forget it yelled burke take it
out on ohern

  round two immediately the fighters
clashed in the middle of the ring the
blows fell faster than before their sound
was now a tattoo on a drum no carpet was
ever beaten so thoroughly in the hail of
fists oherns nose suffered it bled and
the wonder was that no nose had bled be-
fore but because of this there was no
slowing up of the combatants they seemed
composed of iron and rubber

  near the end of the round ohem did
land the hardest blow of the battle on con-
leys ribs and conley immediately retal-
only cheese



iated with its twin brother to the side of
oherns head these two final mastodonic
thumps resounded throughout the building
like cannon shots concluding the musketry
of lesser blows preceding

  the round had been conleys but
ohern retained his confidence and man-
ager burke was wary again ten seconds
before time was up in the intermission be-
tween rounds the manager appealed to
thorpe his aid at the ringside and the
latter acted

  conley saw presented before him an ob-
ject in shape cylindrical in color that of
jaundice he recognized it to be a small
cheese but before he could leap out of the
ring toward thorpe burke repeated

   forget it win this fight first

  round three if the opponents moved
more slowly now they were the more in
deadly earnest fewer hits were recorded
but each one as it landed was heard by the
crowd without the building and steadily
pat conley seemed to be forging ahead he
hit harder he was less shaken when he was
hit

  it wyas near the middle of the round when
conley got in his famous one two blow
a right to the body followed by a left to
the jaw ohern tried to retain his con-
fident smile but his ribs burned and his
head hummed here was conleys oppor-
tunity it seemed every pastime advised
him of it while the assembled sons of sul-
livan warned ohern to bewtare

  ohern dropped into a crouch and
brought up his arms to protect his chin so
that there was little left for conley to shoot
at but the top of a cranium covered by
black hair and considerably harder than
the average this bobbing black mark
conley pursued drove it into a corner
twice from which it escaped each time by
diving and bobbing up again in the middle
of the ring behind the pursuer

  the round was nearly over and had been
overwhelmingly in favor of conley but
here the unexpected happened one of
oherns fists separated itself from the
ohern cranium which it had been care-
fully guarding and hit the onrushing con-
ley cleanly on the chin

  conley went down and had not the bell

marking the end of the round rung just
then the fight would have been over the
bell gave him a minute to recover before
round four and his seconds dragged him
into his corner to make the best of it
ohern opposite was also shaky and the
cunning manager martin saw that the out-
come of the battle now depended upon
which man was in best shape at the begin-
ning of the final round

  furiously burke and his assistant worked
on conley cold water was applied legs
and arms were rubbed towels were swung
at the end of thirty seconds conleys eyes
were still glassy in desperation burke put
smelling salts under conleys nose trying to
clear the muddled head fifteen seconds
remained and conley was no better

  burke reached into his pocket he drew
forth something wrapped in paper he un-
wrapped it and clapped the contents to
conleys nose

  five seconds remained and conleys eyes
widened and he tried to catch his breath

   limburger he finally gasped

  thats it limburger cheese hissed
burke  and thats what youll be the
rest of your life if you dont win this fight 

  burke had applied the incentive at exact-
ly the right instant had not the bell for
round four rung just then it is doubtful if
burke could have kept conley in his corner
another moment

  round four conley rushed toward his
opponent ohern was courageous but in
his minute of recuperation he had been sub-
jected only to the ordinary methods of the
prize ring a lemon-colored specter drove
conley on to fight and his eyes ears and
nose were full of it ohern kept him busy
yet not so busy but that he was conscious
of his yellow peril

  it worked upon his imagination he saw
himself passing through the years to come
dogged and tortured by it he knew what
people would call him that they would
hold their noses at the mention of his name
the thought put springs in his legs and
power in his fists he was a cyclone an
avalanche a ton of brick he was an
earthquake ohern was no longer a match
for him john l sullivan would not have
been crushing down oherns defense

conley caught his opponent on the jaw and
knocked him down-and out

v

  at the hall of the pastime athletic club
there gathered the members and their ladies
to do honor to champion patrick conley
the occasion was joyful the company gayly
stepped the fox trot waltz and one-step to
the strains of a cheerful orchestra and
among the dancers no couple received the
attention that did pat conley and miss
liola mcdermott later refreshments
would be served but just before that there
would be a presentation

  at one end of a hall upon a raised plat-
form rested the object which in the name
of admirers was to be presented to the
champion draped in the club colors this
object defied all efforts to guess its nature
on the platform with it stood mr tom
thorpe prepared to resist any attempt of
the too inquisitive and manager burke
cruised in the neighborhood

  at midnight dancing ceased and all gath-
ered about the platform upon which stood
tom thorpe and manager burke

   ladies and gents said burke  as
you know were all here to-night to do
honor to mr pat conley the champ of the
amachers now i dont want to take up
your time talkin because i know you want
to get a little somethin to eat and then
some more dancin before you quit to-night
so ill just conclude by saying that this ob-
ject here beside me is a little present from
some of the members of this club to the
champ and mr tom thorpe and i were

the

asked to present it mr thorpe do your
duty

  from the object tom thorpe promptly
withdrew the drapery-and then promptly
stepped off the platform

  the object appeared of circular base it
was three feet high and therefore in shape
like the section of a great column or a
mighty smokestack or a roundhouse its
color as it gleamed under the lights of the
hall was that of a full moon there wras
no mistaking it for anything else than a
tremendous cheese

  for an instant-just an instant-there
was a dull glow in conleys eyes and a bit
of worry in liolas

  but here martin burke showed the quick
thinking that made him supreme among
amateur managers as pat was among the
boxers stepping up to the monolith burke
smote it resoundingly with the flat of his
hand and cried

   its all right pat its american
cheese 

  the champion grinned the crowd ap-
plauded and it was champion conley
who with a great carving knife cut slices
from the cheese which were handed out to
the gathering by manager burke to be
eaten with other refreshments of the eve-
ning

  the senior mr conley who was pres-
ent partook of the refreshments com-
menting upon his son and his sons man-
ager who moved about so efficiently on the
platform before him mr conley said

   ah hes a grand young man is mar-
tin burke and tis the furriner cheeses
that pat never liked
