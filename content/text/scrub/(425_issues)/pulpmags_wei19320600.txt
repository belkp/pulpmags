there is much diversity of opinion among you the readers as to whether we
should continue to print serials in our weird story reprint department we
asked you in the eyrie of last months weird tales whether you wanted us
to offer dracula and other weird novels to you after frankenstein is concluded the
consensus so far is that we should not print dracula because so many of our readers
have already read this famous vampire novel by bram stoker but the preponderance
of letters received from you approves of our reprinting frankenstein the question
is still open and we will follow your wishes in this matter

     leonard geoghagan of london england expresses the prevailing view in a
letter to the eyrie the wolf-leader by alexandre dumas was a thrilling and fas-
cinating story he writes and weird tales deserves my heartiest thanks for re-
printing it but dracula is another matter for most lovers of weird fiction are al-
ready acquainted with that novel i say if you can offer us any more weird novels
such as the wolf-leader which we can not obtain at the book stores then by all
means print them as weird story reprints but thumbs down on dracula and others
of that ilk for we have already read them

     sophia mundt of savannah georgia writes to the eyrie i am in favor of
more serials in each issue and longer stories the weirder the stories are the bet-
ter i like them i like ghost stories and stories of vampires and werewolves best of all
if you publish serials for your reprint department writes jack darrow of chi-
cago pick out those not so well known and those that are out of print dracula and
frankenstein can be obtained in any book store

     the same view is expressed by f d arden of detroit who writes it was
with dismay that i read in the april eyrie of your intention of using frankenstein
and dracula as reprints in serial form the only weak link in weird tales has been
the reprints for one thing one serial is sufficient in an issue if you reprint serials
you will be carrying two continued stories and as was the case with the wolf-leader
when the regular feature serial concludes and another begins three serials will be in
one issue too many serials my suggestion is that instead of reprinting stories writ-
ten in the nineteenth century use only those taken from back numbers of weird
tales

     a letter from lester anderson of hayward california says if you must
have long serials stoker wrote other novels besides dracula and those novels are

 birch trees have talked to me on many a night
 they whispered ghostly tales in words of white
 and syllabled with light

 their leaves have sighed
 of how men died
 by quick swords
 glistening
 in moonlight where the spring
 trickled in mire
 that turned to liquid fire

 and when their flesh was dust

 their stark bones gleaming in
 moon-textures wan and thin

 would rise and thrust
 their flashing blades into
 each other-sulfur-blue
 those swords were seen
 darting between
 their ribs-worm-eaten clean-

 till blood like moonbeams dripped
 to the ground where they skipped
 fighting and grinning

 feinting and spinning

 until the dawn
 glimmered-and they were
 gone

 they told of how birds
   came

 as thick as clouds at sunset bringing buds
 of crimson in their beaks till all the woods
 were a glory of flame

 and the creeks would essay
 to flow uphill their spray-

 a tangle of light on the breeze-

 spiraling over the trees

 oh i have seen
 tall birch trees lean
 along the moonlight dwelling
 on memories and telling
 them to the night
 in words of white

evils pool

by greye la spina

a thrilling novel of an evil pool in an abandoned quarry-an

  eery werewolf story

  	id willingly sell my soul to the
              devil  

k h here aint going to be no wed-
 din said the taxi-driver his
thick brows scowling upon ma-
son hardy

  no wedding youre crazy said the
prospective best man and laughed easily

  yeah

  mr baker would have gotten word
to me if that were the case hardy as-
serted his keen eyes upon the drivers
dour melancholy visage

  yeah

  hardy lost patience listen my good
fellow if youve anything to impart be
kind enough to get it over without delay
the wedding is set for two oclock today
and its now noon

  the taxi-driver drooped heavily in his
seat mister kin there be a weddin
without a bride he asked this was in-
deed a pointed query

  a wedding without a bride echoed
the other puzzled

  says you

  what on earth do you mean hardy
snapped

  i mean that miss selene arkwright
left town about six weeks ago

  the hell she did

  hells got more to do with it than you
might think mister if you aint heard
from mr baker fer the last coupla months
youve got a nice earful cornin to you
me  i lost my little kid jacky the
same way said the taxi-drivers harsh


voice and was suddenly tremulous and
tender

  mason hardy stripped off his rucksack
and tossed it into the cab he mounted
the front seat with the driver

  step on it he ordered briskly and
give me a line on tilings as we go along

  my kid was only five years old began
the driver brokenly slipping the clutch
into gear an he was playin around with
a bunch of other kids on the edge of bau-
manns woods one afternoon about a
month ago an the other kids said later
that a tall thin ugly-lookin man came
out of the woods and promised any of
them a bag of candy if theyd go along
with him an my kid was so little   
he went

  well prompted hardy impatiently
yet with an undertone of sympathy

  he aint never come back mister
the chief of police sent out a coupla men
and we hunted and hunted but all we
found was little jackys cap lyin at the
foot of a tree near the old quarry the
chief questioned lem schwartz  we
was sure he was the man the kids was
tellin about    but lem said the kid
mustve fell into the pool and got
drownded

  sorry old chap but what has this
to do with miss arkwright

  well mister perhaps she fell into the
pool an maybe it put a spell or somethin
on her so she cant leave baumanns any
more

  had it not been for the mans loss of
his little boy hardy would have given
the devils pool

 

way to derisive laughter but the taxi
mans face distorted with grief restrained
him from giving voice to his amusement
at the absurd theory

  well have to look into this he said
sympathetically what do you figure is
wrong with the pool

  thats queer too mister said the
taxi-driver old elis granddaughter
had a bad fall about a year ago an aint
been able to walk sence old eli sets
store by that little gal the way i did by
my jacky folks say he bust out cryin
one day down at the post-office an said
hed willinly sell his soul to the devil if
he could only give his little janie the
things she wanted an they do say it
werent long after that they was a bossy
hired man out on elis place an if lem
schwartz aint close to bein a devil i miss

my say-so he concluded with a grunt
of disgust

  interesting commented younghardy
but hardly conclusive

  that aint all continued the driver
punctuating his remarks with nervous
movements of his foot on the accelerator
that sent the taxi forward in spasmodic
jerks there aint been no heavy rains
about these parts for morn a year an jet
that hole in the quarry is all filled up   
with water i suppose even if none of us
thats seen it likes the queer looks of it
acts as if it was alive muttered the taxi
man half under his breath

  probably a spring offered the young-
er man

  spring nothin snorted the driver
with the utmost contempt for such an easy
solution of his puzzle that quarry pool
i

weird tales

wasnt there the day before lem schwartz
was first seen on old elis farm and the
day after he was there the pool was
there his tone said plainly now
dont think you can get around that

hardy thought it best not to dispute
the miraculous appearance of the
pool that had synchronized with the com-
ing of the devilish lem he remained
silent until the cab drew up before an un-
pretentious bungalow prettily set in an
attractively landscaped plot

  here yare mister an if theres a
weddin ill drive you free of charge
scoffed the driver accepting his fare and
tip with a brief nod of thanks no
weddin without a bride an youll find
miss arkwright cant get away from that
pool he prophesied in a low fierce
voice it aint got no bottom that
pool  we dragged it  an i be-
lieve it goes straight down to hell an
if it does im the man thatll be sendin
that devil at baumanns back to where he
belongs one of these here days

  he threw in his clutch stepped on the
gas and his cab departed rattling down
the village street

  hardy looked after the cab with puz-
zled face when he turned to walk up
the gravelled path to the bungalow he
was disturbed to see his old college friend
dashing out of the front door and down
to meet him in that hasty oncoming he
read something of ill omen

  mason you didnt get my letters
cried out the bridegroom in a kind of wild
abandon to the nervous excitement all too
clearly pervading him

  i didnt stop home at all old man
deprecated mason he did not elucidate
thinking it unnecessary earl baker knew
that he spent weeks at a time hiking in
out-of-the-way places for antiques rarely
getting in touch with home or office dur-
ing his absences

  i am almost out of my head mason
groaned earl baker seizing his friends
arm with frenzied grasp come into the
house ive so much to tell you and i
dont know where to begin he choked

  hardy slung his knapsack over one
shoulder and hurriedly went up the path
he was shocked and perturbed at the
evidences of nervous strain shown by his
ordinarily poised friend apparently
there had been fragments of truth in the
taxi mans strange innuendoes

  once inside the house he flung the
knapsack to one side and pushed his
friend down into a big chair seating him-
self opposite

  control yourself earl he command-
ed sharply why man your nerves
must be in ruinous shape for you to let
yourself go the way youre doing

  earl baker jerked out a short wretched
sound that may have been meant for de-
risive laughter but that fell harsh and
jangling upon the ear

  do you think its so easy for a man to
lose his bride without her offering the
slightest reason for jilting him

  selene has jilted you cried hardy in-
credulously

  well it amounts to that almost
moaned the deserted bridegroom

  for the love of heaven get this story
out of your system earl exploded ma-
son hardy the taxi-driver nearly drove
me frantic with wild yarns about devilish
hired men and mysterious pools and a
drowned child and selenes disappearance
pull yourself together man and tell me
what its all about do you get married
today or dont you

  i dont admitted earl wretchedly
a couple of months ago selene went
down to eli baumanns farm to teach
janie kindergarten work and after shed
made two or three visits there she just
didnt come back

  just stayed on you mean she re-
the devil s pool



fused to come back here that she isnt
being detained forcibly

  thats what i mean

  its incredible old man selene loved
you she-she couldnt just stay away like
that without a good reason

  there is a reason but she wont tell
me what it is so i asked father paul to
see her

  father paul is still here is he good
old man    when did he see her
he went this morning im expecting
him back any minute

  hardy drew the curtain aside and
stared down the street against the light
of the blazing afternoon sun as yet
there was no sign of the plump gray
horse that took father paul about the
country on parochial visits he shook his
head and let the curtain drop into place
earl sighed heavily lips quivering ma-
sons alert blue eyes slipped past that thin
ascetic face for he disliked to confront
the trouble he read only too easily upon it

you dont suppose the mysterious at-
traction on the baumann farm has got-
ten its clutches into father paul do you
earl shook his head decidedly oh
no he asseverated

  but if it got hold of selene why not
father paul argued mason not illogi-
cally

  earl pushed back his untouched lunch
i believe he knows too much for them
mason theyre afraid of him

  they queried the other significantly
they  or it i really dont think i
quite know what i do mean old man
this business about selene has just broken
me up everything was fine until she
went down there at old elis request to
give janie kindergarten instruction from
then on its been    well inferno he
ended bitter sharpness pointing his words
hark i thought i heard hoofs

  mason lifted the curtain again hes
coming sorry old chap but hes alone

     	the dead man on his feet
             staring  

      od-r ejaculated earl baker clasping
vt and unclasping his nervous hands
and throwing an impassioned look up-
ward for nearly two months shes been
down on that impoverished farm telling
me to keep away from her and forget
her why

  its a dam queer situation earl i must
admit hello father paul and mason
turned to greet the newcomer who had let
himself into the house with the freedom
of a welcome intimate

  the priest was short sturdily built
slightly florid from his round wide face
beamed small but pleasant blue eyes of
the understanding kind that can twinkle
impartially upon saint or sinner he
stamped in heavily pulled out a chair and
sank into it puffing

  this july heat is phenomenal he
gasped as soon as he could catch his
breath sufficiently to speak pour me a
glass of water my boy im that perish-
ing with thirst i can hardly think

  earl baker pouring the requested
water spoke with downcast eyes as if he
feared to meet the others gaze

 selene-

  over the priests round face a troubled
expression deepened

  is she    well

  not exactly well    but neither is
she ill appended father paul cryptically

  earls finely ascetic face darkened he
struck the table with his clenched fist a
blow that set the dishes a-dance

  i cant stand this sort of thing much
longer he said in a soft restrained voice
addressing himself to no one in particular
it is incomprehensible she loved me
t

weird tales

and promised to marry me yet she goes
down and stays there without a word of
explanation and only tells me coldly to
forget her

  the kindly blue eyes of father paul
narrowed with thought if she bids you
forget her my son she must have suffi-
cient reason for she was a good girl
why do you put it in the past tense
earl snapped i ask you why should
my betrothed leave her work and the man
whom she had promised to marry and
settle down to spend her life among com-
plete strangers on a wretched backwoods
farm where there is quite nothing to offer
attraction to a young and beautiful girl
its inexplicable i tell you by any process
of logical reasoning

  perhaps it might help matters to look
at the situation from some other than a
logical standpoint suggested father
paul gently you know that my opin-
ion is-

  i can not give credence to wild super-
stitions exclaimed earl impatiently
what can a drowned child have to do
with my selene

  father paul sighed heavily it might
have much to do with her but i pray god
it has not    yet

  earl stared at him a moment then ut-
tered a wretched laugh with ironical
intonation he said to mason father
paul believes that some ancient evil entity
has been drawn into manifestation on old
elis farm and that my future wife has
somehow been snared in his net the
bare idea of selenes being involved in
anything that isnt splendid and fine is an
insult cried the lover angrily

  mason hardy held up one hand to
quiet his disturbed friend

  well earl its possible even if not
probable arent you always saying that
there are spiritual laws available for those
human beings who come into knowledge

of them to make life easier richer why
couldnt an undesirable individual get
hold of the workings of those same laws
applying them for purely selfish ends

  absurd old eli is the most harmless
of antiquated farmers wrapped up in his
orphaned granddaughter janie whos a
cripple besides those two theres only
their hired man

  lem schwartz is about the most evil
individual ive encountered in all my years
of ministration interrupted the priest
his wide face paling as he looked from one
man to the other hes so evil that i felt
the disturbing spirit of him in his very
atmosphere hes tall and gaunt and of
saturnine aspect theres something so
repellent about him that i fail to find
words for adequate explanation mused
father paul that man is  i dis-
like to say it    thoroughly bad im
convinced of it i dont know how i can
be so positive but i am

  what influence could that country
boor have upon a girl like selene

  father paul disregarded the younger
mans contemptuous query and went on
thinking aloud from the way old eli
acted this morning i rather think hed be
glad to get out of whatever mischief hes
managed to get into i dont understand
yet just what it is for while he is terrified
by lem schwartz he is also resentful and
bitter against him its an odd situation
is it possible that selenes feelings
have been acted upon by janies pathetic
condition inquired mason thoughtfully

  for me pronounced father paul
with decision janie is the key to the
whole situation

  janie almost snorted earl baker
with an exasperated look at the old priest
who bore his scrutiny with tranquil poise

  what could that fourteen-year-old
girl have to do with the situation fa-
the devil s pool



ther inquired mason he was frankly
curious

  well my son it is difficult to put
my feelings into words janie isnt stupid
but she isnt very  what id call bright
she has moments of peculiar insight that
are positively uncanny and then again
she is just a very childish ingenuous little
girl her grandfather is whole-heartedly
devoted to her yes i feel assured that
in janie we shall find the key to the situa-
tion

   earl baker crumpled the tablecloth un-
der one hand that kept opening and shut-
ting nervously upon it all this is un-
bearable we keep talking talking spec-
ulating speculating    and selene stays
in that miserable place held by some mys-
terious attraction which has allured her to
the extent of making her withdraw her
promise of marriage

father paul again disregarding the
young mans outburst commented ir-
relevantly brow furrowed eli has an-
other guest by the way a young jewish
fellow named harry epstein he was
around town during the week of the coun-
ty fair drove a little canvas-topped ford
truck with an old piano on it and sang
popular songs to his own accompani-
ment sold sheet music

   do you mean to tell me that that fel-
lows being held there too asked earl
his ascetic face all at once drawn into a
sneer this is too much he groaned
and dropped his distorted face into his
twitching hands

  epstein warned me off said father
paul a reminiscent smile drawing wrin-
kles into the corners of his kindly blue
eyes said he hoped to leave there
bringing miss arkwright in the course of
a couple of months and old eli at
whom he kept looking strangely as he

said it gave a terrible moaning cry and
rushed off to hide himself somewhere

  i cant get my soul quieted cried the
tortured lover wildly they wont let
me go onto the baumann place now ma-
son

  listen old man whats to prevent
my scouting about a bit and trying to find
out what this mess is anyway offered
hardy his keen blue eyes alight with eag-
er speculation bet you i can bring se-
lene away he looked across the table
and up at the mantelpiece where stood a
large photograph in solitary importance
the portrait of a grave-faced beautiful
girl where did that schwartz fellow
hail from father paul

  nobody seems to know he appeared
one day on the baumann place shortly
after old eli had been heard to make a
statement about selling his soul to the
devil for janies sake the fellow has as
evil a face as i have ever sen and the
good man crossed himself rapidly at the
memory of it

  what do you think of my chances of
getting in and finding out how matters
stand

  you may get in there and you may be
able to get a line on what the whole thing
means unless you are drawn into it your-
self

  and suppose i am contemptuously
why can not i g word then to you
people so that youll be able to come
down to the rescue

  that might help us greatly my son

  strange that selene wont tell me what
its all about complained the deserted
bridegroom if you can do what you say
mason i shall never be able to repay
you his eyes were eloquent

  hardy laughed

  its the peace of my soul too i shall
never be able to go on with my y work
here if evil is to be allowed to triumph


weird tales

over good as it seems so far to have
done finished earl despondently

  how big is that schwartz fellow big-
ger than i asked mason of the priest
squaring his broad tweed-clad shoulders
with the shyly conscious air of a man who
does not have to be told that he is in the
pink of condition

  you wont have to fight him the way
youre thinking retorted the priest at
least i dont think so but youll have to
make up your mind not to be afraid of
anything that might happen the fact
that a thing does happen mr hardy
brings it within the jurisdiction of the
laws of natural phenomena

  mason caught a certain significance of
tone and said with a flash of keen blue
eyes i dont think im afraid of any-
thing   regular

  its not the regular thing that makes
the blood run chill my son replied the
priest its the irregularity of a thing
that sometimes makes it seem terrible
the dead man lying at rest in his coffin
isnt terrifying its the dead man on his
feet staring at you through the half-light
of a dim room that makes your hair stand
on end

  there wont be any dead men walk-
ing on the baumann farm the younger
man asserted skeptically so i shall have
nothing to fear

  there is the destruction which walk-
eth at noonday suggested the priest
softly

  mason met the old eyes squarely as
long as it is noonday i can see it and
keep out of its way and as the full moon
is due in two days even the nights will
be bright for a while yet he laughed
again his easy confident laugh

  the light of the full moon does not
bring security my son it has its own
peculiar perils murmured father paul
oddly

  all this mysterious chatter gets us no-
where snapped earl baker his nerves
obviously at the breaking-point

  buck up earl ill go there tomorrow
morning and im a go-getter you know
well have your sweetheart back or know
the reason why

  knowing the reason why might not
be a consolation my son murmured an
ironical voice as father paul tugged
down the vest that immediately wrinkled
back on his plump body

  ive an idea mason offered earl
baker eagerly suppose you go down
and cant get word to us if youre de-
tained why not pretend youre a violin-
ist on vacation

  cant play a note old man scoffed
mason and why

  that means nothing in this case ill
give you my violin theyll surely ask
you to play then if they do and wont
let you come back pretend to be tempera-
mental and tell them youve got my vio-
lin by mistake and have them take it
back for exchange

  sorry but i dont see-

  cant you give me a chance if that
violin is sent back here instead of your
coming yourself well understand that
youre being detained

  i get you in the nature of an sos 
  exactly

  not so bad earl commended hardy
father paul turned where he stood in
the doorway on his way out

  your friend is loaning you his violin
mr hardy im going to give you some-
thing too something that ought to be
useful and you can have it for your own
all your life his voice was dark with
import dont forget that evil can not
utterly triumph as long as there is the
slightest desire or effort to hold on to
good
the devil s pool



  his heavy tread went down the hall-
way like the portentous footfall of fate

	for gods sake get away from here
            while you can

his hiking knapsack strapped on his
back and earls violin-case in his
hand mason got through the boundary
fence that separated the baumann farm
from the state highway disregarding the
many large warnings against trespass that
were nailed every few yards mason did
not wish to let his presence be known
until late afternoon for when the shad-
ows lengthened a lost hiker might be
expected to ask some direction to town or
even a nights shelter moreover he was
in hopes that selene arkwright might by
some happy chance stroll in the woods
in which case he could have a few words
with her alone

   his wrist-watch said it was a little after
one oclock he had plenty of time to
follow up trails in the baumann woods
and with this in mind and a keen grate-
fulness for the thick shade of the shelter-
ing trees the july sun was unbearably
hot he took a slightly worn path that he
figured would lead him into the center of
the woods by half-past two he had suc-
cumbed to the stifling humidity of the
super-heated air and was looking about
for a favorable spot under a tree where
he could safely take a siesta

   from time to time the pathway led past
great granite ledges and all at once an
agreeable sight met the wayfarers eyes
one of these ledges had been quarried
out deeply almost the entire center had
been cut away leaving a deep hollow
some twenty feet across in this great
artificial bath of granite sparkled as if
with some innate life of its own such
clear and glittering water as hardy had
rarely seen usually forest pools are dank
stagnant full of decaying unpleasant-

nesses but this water attracted by its ap-
pearance of inviting coolness the spark-
ling ripples almost called their message
of refreshment what hardy did not
notice was that there was not a breath of a
breeze to stir the surface of that ever-in-
motion pool 

  to a man melting in july heat the
temptation was insuperable hardy made
a quick survey of the near-by woods find-
ing no opening in the infrequently used
trail that might point out a possibility of
embarrassing interruption promptly the
knapsack tumbled atthe foot of a tree
and near it the violin-case was laid the
khaki outing shirt flew over masons head
and he sat down on the mossy ground to
remove his shoes busied with the laces
he did not notice the approach of a man
who stopped directly in front of him
until the newcomer spoke in a sharply in-
cisive tone with significant tenseness

  stop said this man and with one
foot pushed away masons busy fingers
that were engaged in untying shoe-laces

  young hardy jerked his head upward
with a startled exclamation then got
quickly to his feet eyeing the newcomer
curiously

  youre trespassing didnt you see
the signs asked the man with a gesture
toward the very tree under which mason
had laid the violin and knapsack as he
spoke his eyes shot agitated glances over
his shoulder in what mason surmised
might be the direction of the baumann
farmhouse

  whats your trouble countered ma-
son lightly this place yours

  the other man jerked an impatient
head never mind whose place it is
what im telling you is to get off it as
quickly as you can make it if you value
your life and your sanity

  i think you must be harry epstein
observed mason acutely
 

weird tales

  the dark hebraic face scowled how
did you know

   father paul

  hmm well im epstein what of
it listen whoever you may be get
away from here while the goings good
understand and thank your god-

  he broke off abruptly as a sharp
whistle cut the air imperatively then he
added hastily in a half-whisper i
mustnt be seen talking to you but for
gods sake get away from here while you
can

  with that he sped up the forest trail
and disappeared

mason hardy deliberated for a mo-
ment he looked at his outing shirt
and one shoe lying on the moss then he
laughed shortly got off the other shoe
and in a moment had stripped and was
ready for his attractive plunge into the
inviting forest pool

  the quarrymen had cut the rock on
that side into the semblance of a rude
flight of wide high steps he descended
until only his head could have been
glimpsed from the woodland trail as he
dipped one foot into the water which was
delightfully exhilaratingly cool his eyes
fell upon his wrist-watch which he had
forgotten to remove he sprang up the
steps leaving a damp trail on the granite
under the foot that had tested the waters
temperature suddenly he stood stock-
still fumbling at the strap of the watch

  sitting cross-legged on the ground like
some ugly eastern god was a man who
must have been extraordinarily tall when
he stood upright for there seemed to be
an abnormal length of limb tucked under
him earl bakers violin-case lay open on
his lap and he was in the act of picking
at the strings with his long wiry fingers
just as mason came up out of the pool
the impudence of the newcomer struck

mason momentarily dumb but in a mo-
ment he had recovered his usual poise

  hey what do you think youre
doing my man put that violin down
his wet foot tracking moist blots on the
granite mason neared the man who
lifted his face sufficiently to inspect that
damp trail with a kind of sneering satis-
faction

  i really dont understand why you
should object to my looking at property
that belongs to you said he pointedly
leisurely closing the violin-case and put-
ting it down with composure you seem
to have been making use of other peoples
property yourself

  mason stopped short as the speaker
rose attaining his full height that of a
man of unusually gaunt and meager pro-
portions for what must have been six feet
four inches one look at that dark and
saturnine face was sufficient to apprise the
adventurer that he was encountering lem
schwartz for only to lem could have be-
longed those piercing black eyes that low-
ered evilly under bushy overhanging eye-
brows that met in a straight line over the
hooked nose only lem could have smiled
with such a wide spread of snarling thin
lips that the impression between them of
those sharp and glistening white teeth
was as of a fierce and implacable wild
beast restrained momentarily but mo-
mentarily only

  sorry deprecated mason somewhat
abashed at this inapropos meeting with
lem schwartz which was not at all of his
planning but the heat was so oppres-
sive and the pool so inviting-

  lem schwartz bent his terrible smile
upon the granite from which the july
heat had already begun to evaporate the
younger mans moist trail he permitted
a gurgling laugh to escape him a laugh
that subtly conveyed malevolence

   swimming in this pool is trespassing
my fine young man youll have to go

                         w t-
the devils pool



along with me to see what the owner
thinks about it

   taken at a disadvantage although get-
ting into the baumann house on one ex-
cuse or another had been his primary in-
tention the trespasser did not speak for
a moment and schwartz misunderstood
his silence for he leaned down and
picked up violin-case and knapsack with
a conclusive air

  if you dont choose to dress come
along as you are invited he with an
ugly grin but its just possible you may
prefer to dress theres a nice young lady
up at the farmhouse

   mason bit his lip in the difficult at-
tempt to keep his temper he had not
planned to make his appearance under
escort like a captured criminal however
there was nothing to do but appear to fall
in with the saturnine lems scarcely con-
cealed commands mason motioned an-
grily for the hired man to put down the
violin and knapsack he then dressed
hurriedly and presently strapped the latter
article to his shoulders and would have

picked up the violin as well but-

   id better take charge of this young
stranger murmured lem significantly
too hot to chase anybody through the
woods today he grunted suppose you
enjoyed your stolen swim he inquired
suddenly and again that snarling laugh
rent his thin lips across gleaming teeth
horridly

figuring that his intentions if not the
actual facts had made him a tres-
passer mason shrugged his shoulders in
acquiescence and followed his guide down
the trail until the woods opened into fine
pasture land across from which stood a
great two-family stone farmhouse it was
built of granite undoubtedly taken from
the quarry that now offered such delights
to a swimmer from the chimney on one
side of the house clouds of heavy smoke
w t-

hung the other half of the house had
drawn shades and the chimney belched no
sign of cooking preparations

  sitting on a long decrepit-looking
bench on the rear porch was the round-
shouldered form of a man who straight-
ened his dejectedly hanging head as lem
and mason approached this was old eli
mason figured and looked with secret
interest upon that mysterious old farmer
who was playing host to two such differ-
ent individuals as selene arkwright and
harry epstein the old man was gray
and wizened of countenance straggling
white hair hung in confusion on either
side of his meek brown eyes that stared
out under the shabby straw hat his once-
black trousers and vest were white at the
seams and shiny green from long wear
and exposure to weather

  brought you a fiddler this time
called lem schwartz loudly as he ap-
proached janiell like that wont she
you cant reproach me with forgetting
my side of a bargain eli

  the old man staggered uncertainly to
his feet the meek brown eyes staring
upon the youthful figure behind lem
one hand lifted waved them back the
other covered a trembling old mouth
from which issued a pitiful wailing cry
which he seemed struggling to smother
his eyes shifting to lems hard face in
what appeared mingled resentment and
fear

  no no no he exclaimed quaver-
ingly i-i dont want any more people
here i-i havent room for them i-i
cant afford any more

  dont be alarmed mr baumann
mason hardy reassured the old man i
have no intention of remaining just hap-
pened to be strolling in your woods and
took the liberty of stopping for a swim in
your inviting pool when your man-

  father in heaven the pool you-
you swam in the pool


weird tales

  lem interrupted he had a nice cool
swim and i brought him here for safe-
keeping until day after tomorrow he
finished in significant tone and with a
sardonic grin the old mans face went
white tomorrow night is the full of
the moon you know

  sorry i trespassed mason began to
apologize if you will permit me to do
so ill gladly pay whatever you feel i
should and then you can direct me on my
way

  no   youve got to stay    now
quavered the old man brown eyes wide
mouth loose-lipped and trembling sorry
 but i cant let you go now    until

 until-

  until after the full of the moon fin-
ished lem schwartz evil black eyes hard
with ominous menace and then you
may see fit to remain here mr fiddler
and play for janie

  lem might have received a sharp re-
tort had not masons attention been di-
verted by the stirring of a womans gar-
ments at the open door appeared a girl
of twenty-two or three a girl whom he
recognized from the photograph on earl
bakers mantel although the eyes that had
been tranquil in the portrait were now
wide and startled the firm lips tremulous
as if on the verge of crying out   the
plainly dressed unbobbed black hair the
dark gray eyes were those of selene
arkwright

  as lem spoke she pressed both hands
convulsively against her bosom her gray
eyes turned with shrinking pain and hor-
ror upon the newcomer when she spoke
it was as if the words pressed out without
her volition from her overflowing soul

  oh you poor unhappy man you
have been in the quarry pool

  not seeing fit to make detailed ex-
planations at that moment in the pres-
ence of so many witnesses mason hardy
nodded

  harry called selene without turn-
ing

  a man appeared from the dim room
behind her and stood looking over her
shoulder it was the man who had
warned mason back in the woods and he
was now looking at the newcomer with
a kind of cold fury

  idiot he said accusingly that one
word but it expressed volumes of emo-
tion

  lem looked from one man to the other
a sardonic smile distorting his dark vis-
age you two have met before he
stated rather than asked did you at-
tempt to warn him mr epstein his
mocking assumption of respectfulness
could have deceived no one rather un-
wise on your part wasnt it you should
have welcomed him instead for the larger
the company grows the more will dear
mr baumann feel his moral responsi-
bility   

  old eli with a shrill cry of agony
pressed gnarled hands to his temples
brushing off the wide straw hat with an
unheeding gesture of desperation

  devil you devil he stammered
wildly i wont i wont do it you
shant force me to do it ill put up a sign
at the pool to warn people-

  lem silenced him with a wide unpleas-
ant smile that drew the thin lips tightly
back against the pointed white teeth he
did not speak a single word but old elis
hands dropped to his sides and the old
man turned abruptly around pushed
precipitately past selene arkwright and
disappeared into the house

  for a moment the hired man stood re-
garding the girl who clung white-faced
and trembling to the door-frame then
his glittering black eyes turned slowly
until the whites gleamed at the corners
to rest with malicious satisfaction upon
harry epsteins furrowed brow last of
all those hard orbs shining with reptilian
the devil s pool



coldness shifted to mason hardys wary
puzzled countenance

    leave our fiddling friend in your
custody mr epstein until after the full
of the moon said he and a horrid
chuckling choked him into further silent
merriment

     	tonight watch from your
             window 

harry epstein watching lems de-
parture lifted one clenched fist and
shook it with impotent menace at the
gaunt mans back muttering something of
dark malediction under his breath

  selene touched his arm nervously
dont please harry arent things bad
enough as they are without swearing

   the young jew turned sullenly but with
gentle deference and went into the room
beckoning mason to follow

  for tonight the old man will prob-
ably give you a room this side of the
house opined harry epstein as they
went inside

  at these apparently innocent words
selene gave a soft little exclamation of
distress her eyes and the young jews
met held then turned away in embar-
rassment avoiding masons puzzled gaze
mason made a wild guess

   until after the full of the moon he
murmured ironically and his keen blue
eyes flashed from selenes face to harrys
for the two had swayed together as if by
common impulse and were regarding him
with a kind of incredulity

  then you know the music-peddler
accused resentfully you came here on
purpose i didnt have to warn you against
the pool why did you go into it then
sharply

  mason hesitated however much he
might distrust the other man a complete
stranger yet harry had tried to warn him
against something once that afternoon

and it was evident that selene trusted the
young jew

   earl sent me said mason finally to
selene

  you came from him she whispered
you dared come to this accursed place
risking so much for earls sake tears
stood in her fine eyes and she had to
choke back the sob that rose in her throat
i recognized you almost at once mason
hardy from earls old class photograph

   say hardy if you knew all about the
affair why the dickens did you make a
bee-line for the pool and jump into it
especially after id warned you to keep
out

  mason laughed his easy laugh you
may think you told me something but
you didnt get that far besides i wasnt
really in the pool at all i just stepped in
and out again when he appeared he
jerked his head in the direction lem had
gone to designate the object of his re-
mark

   selenes gray eyes lifted you didnt
immerse yourself in the pool she whis-
pered with an eagerness oddly anxious
for such a simple query

  just tried the temperature with one
foot and then found id forgotten to take
off my wrist-watch so i went out and
there was that chap lem sitting with my
violin    hes no regular hired man
epstein the language he employs-

  whatever he is mr violinist hes
got the drop on all of us here jerked
out harry unwillingly selene and

i- he hesitated with a quick glance

at the girl

  go on harry she directed him
we can not consider conventions under
these conditions of stress she explained
to mason

  i was just going to say that mason
here will naturally eat with old baumann
tonight but tomorrow night pointedly
he will probably be with us


weird tales

 hmmm after the full of the moon
commented mason dryly and was once
again astonished at the girls little choked
outcry

  what do you know how much do
you know why do you keep on repeat-
ing that

  my dear selene i dont know a
thing confessed mason but all ive
heard since i came here has seemed to
hinge upon the full of the moon can
you tell me why yourself

  selene exhaled slowly i thought per-
haps you knew about things here and
could help us to get away she whispered
her eyes turned to an inner door through
which old eli could now be seen putter-
ing over a cooking-stove

  if you want to leave here declared
mason smiling say the word it is just
a matter of leaving as i see it

  she shook her head with a hopeless air
impossible you dont understand the
real situation its not just a matter of
walking away its far more complicated
than that listen mason    she low-
ered her voice to a cautious undertone
we must remain here until we learn
just what old mr baumann has to do to
save us from lems clutches oh i
darent tell you more but tonight   
watch from your window she whispered
fearfully

  selene harrys voice was sharp he
laid one finger against his lips warningly

  but mason is earls friend she mur-
mured tensely i owe him some expla-
nation dont i after hes risked coming
here to help us and perhaps after to-
morrow night she faltered hell be
condemned to stay here too

  the young jew turned to mason his
face strained with anxiety

  if only you hadnt stepped into the
pool he deprecated but perhaps it
wont mean so much you werent fully

immersed i hope itll turn out that way
because then youll be free to go back and
tell father paul whatever youve seen
down here hes a wise old bird if he
cant help us were sure done for fin-
ished the music peddler in his low guard-
ed voice

  but how did selene get into the
pool curiously inquired mason glanc-
ing cautiously toward the inner door

  the girl herself replied janie asked
me to bring her some wild columbine
blossoms from the woods lem offered
to show me where they were and when
we were on the verge of the pool he
pushed me into the water she shud-
dered her gray eyes closing for a mo-
ment as if to shut out the very memory
of the scene

  completely immersed get me same
here epstein said

  but harry jumped in to save me se-
lene murmured quickly with a grateful
glance at the young jew

  any decent man would have done the
same that wasnt anything selene

  what earl owes you he can never re-
pay the girl replied controlling her
trembling voice with difficulty

  nonsense sh-sh-sh here comes eli

ujpper is ready for the violinist
said the old man from just without
the door its-its getting dark he
added in a tense tone with a shade of
something fearful in his implication

  selene sighed audibly come harry
its time for us to go dont ask ques-
tions mason please she stepped close
to him and put her lips against his ear
dont let them know you werent com-
pletely immersed in the pool she
breathed warningly and left him to fol-
low harry across the next room to a door
that communicated with the apparently
untenanted side of the house
the devils pool



  as she approached this door swung
open selene stopped short so that harry
narrowly escaped collision with her
shrinking form mason hardy straining
to see beyond the two into the darkness
of the room beyond became aware of two
redly glittering points that seemed to re-
flect the pale light of the kerosene lamp
upon the kitchen supper table like eyes
were those points evil eyes that gloated
vindictively

   its getting dark said old eli again
he seemed to be shrinking in abject hor-
ror from that opening door the sun
has set go why are you standing here
go go

  his voice his words pushed against
the reluctant two selene arkwright did
not hesitate then but moved resignedly
into the enveloping darkness of that other
room behind her trod harry epstein
the door closed upon them old eli in
a kind of relief mingled with apprehen-
sion sprang across the room with aston-
ishing agility for so old a man and
turned the key in the lock hastily trying
the door with care to be sure it was se-
curely fastened then he turned to his
sole remaining guest

  vegetable soup he offered prosai-
cally hope you like it    janie
his voice raised slightly as he went to the
foot of the staircase is the soup all
right

  from the upper floor a girlish voice
floated down gayly

  awful good gramper got some
more crackers for janie gramper

   find a seat mister and help yourself
   grampers coming janie

  two places had been set at the supper
table there was some kind of dark-
colored jam a hunk of cheese a pot of
passable tea as mason discovered pour-
ing himself a steaming cupful plenty of
rye bread and the vegetable soup as a

main dish the soup was good as janie
had said mason made a fairly good meal
in silence

   old eli ate little except his plateful of
soup his conversation if it could be
called such was monosyllabic elicited by
questions directed at him in such a way
that he could hardly have avoided a reply
without discourtesy

  that the child upstairs was listening
eagerly to every word became apparent
when she occasionally called down to the
men and finally asked mason if he
wouldnt play for her supper being over
and nothing ahead for the evening but
bed he could hardly refuse so he opened
the violin-case and took out the instru-
ment with awkward and amateurish care
old eli watching in uninterested dejec-
tion

  this isnt my violin exclaimed
hardy with as much excitement as he
could manage to muster ive left my
strad at my friends house and taken his
violin by mistake

  that shouldnt keep you from play-
ing said old eli with a suspicious look
from under his meek brows

  mason shrugged his shoulders in as
nearly a temperamental manner as he
could achieve what use a common
violin never cried he tragically chok-
ing back his impulse to laughter

  old eli narrowly watched the restora-
tion of the violin to its case ill have
lem take it back tomorrow and get yours
he offered slowly

  oh please do gramper mr fiddler
i want so to hear you play

  all at once mason straightened up
from the violin-case and stood in a listen-
ing attitude whats that he asked
bruskly

  the-the dogs replied old eli in
patent uneasiness time you went to
your room mister that way and he in-


weird tales

dicated the stairs leading to the upper
floor

  dogs echoed mason brow fur-
rowed i havent seen any on the place
so far

  old eli avoided the keen blue orbs of
the younger man as if he feared lest some
secret be surprized in his own brown eyes
that now sought the floor the noises in
the next house increased so that they
could be heard plainly snarling growls
snapping of teeth

  some dogs commented hardy as
he turned reluctantly to go upstairs

   	little piles of gnawed white
              bones  

the room to which mason had been
assigned was separated only by a thin
painted-board partition from the hall and
the next room which was janies mason
could hear every word of the old man and
the child as eli gathered up janies tray
also in spite of the fact that the wall be-
tween this little whitewashed room and
the next house was of heavy granite the
young man continued to hear that heavy
scratching whining snarling dogs so
old eli had said

  he unpacked his knapsack stopping
occasionally to listen to that scratching
and clicking as of heavily nailed beasts
scampering about the snarling and then
a pitiful whining began to set his nerves
on edge if eli kept dogs he evidently
kept them loose in the house next door
the house into which an hour past mason
had seen selene and harry disappearing
he wondered how the girl could sleep
through those noises and no longer won-
dered at her sleep-heavy eyes

  he exchanged his hiking-shoes for
rubber-soled sneakers and laid out his au-
tomatic pistol and an electric flashlight
then he drew a chair to the window and
settled down listening occasionally lean

ing out over the unscreened sill to gaze
upon the moonlight-flooded beauty of the
night

  the murmuring of voices from janies
room had ceased silence reigned oppres-
sively once he thought he heard the tip-
toeing of some one across the hall to his
door he would have spoken but flash-
ing intuition bade him remain silent let
old eli think him asleep

  the combined heat and an overpower-
ing drowsiness that made him speculate
sleepily if anything could have been put
into his food had about put him off
guard when the creaking of rusty hinges
came faintly to him from below he was
wide awake in an instant and bolt up-
right listening intently then he leaned
recklessly over the sill and found he
could see a door on the other side of the
house a door opening into the back yard
from which one could step in a few paces
directly into the woods the door was
opening slowly upon the yawning dark-
ness of the other houses interior

  from that opening a long gaunt gray
beast slunk keeping in the shadow of the
house as if to escape observation as it
went belly to the grass stretching itself
across the green in long strides its head
turned upward toward the watchers win-
dow a double row of terrible teeth
flashed as it emerged from the shadow
and two fiery eyes glinted redly in the
moonlight as if they reflected a fire

  dog the young man asked himself
in astonishment never that is a huge
wolf

  his head whirled with impossible sur-
mises he sat back out of the moonlights
spreading radiance and thought hard and
fast he had seen a girl and a man going
into that other house and he inferred that
the saturnine hired man also slept on that
side of the building now he had watched
a great gray wolf creep stealthily out to
the devil s pool



disappear into the near-by woods a low
whine from without    he peered cau-
tiously across the sill two other beasts
sprang bounding over the patch of grass
and streaked into the woods

  mason picked up his automatic and
tucked it into a hip pocket he took up
the electric torch unbolted his door and
tried it to his relief it opened quietly
he closed it cautiously and tiptoed to a
door at the head of the stairs which he
had noticed when he had come up to bed
it led to the adjoining house it was pro-
vided with a huge bolt in addition to the
key that stood in its lock although the
possibilities in what he might be walking
into made the hair prickle on his scalp
he unfastened that door and went into the
darkness drawing it closed behind him

  for a moment he stood motionless list-
ening hardly daring to draw a full breath
in the gloom and strange chill of that
other house reigned a stillness oppressive
ominous he drew out the automatic and
from his left hand the space about him
flooded with light

  he stood in an upper hallway similar
to old elis half of the house giving
upon it were three wide-open doors hesi-
tating at his presumption for he had ev-
ery logical reason to believe that selene
and harry were occupying two of these
rooms and lem the third he stepped to
the open doorway of one room after an-
other cautiously illuminating each as he
did so astonishing    chilling   
emptiness alone met his gaze

  at the threshold of the last room he
paused his straight nose wrinkling dis-
tastefully the odor that came from it
was fetid as if some forest creature had
been denning there for weeks with win-
dows never opened to air it this room
had no dresser no chairs nothing but a
ragged mattress on the floor upon which
was heaped a tumbled mass of soiled-

unspeakably soiled-blankets and bed-
ding at sight of which hardy turned
away feeling sickish so disgusting was the
incredible mess

  as he started down the stairs a long-
drawn-out ululation struck his eardrums
with the hammering pulsation of some-
thing more than sound carrying as it
were a psychic message of terrible im-
port a duet of answering howls fol-
lowed cold shivers raced up and down
the young mans spinal column although
he realized fully that the sounds came
from the distant woods it was the full
cry of a wolf-pack in sight of its prey
and the rooms that should have been
occupied by selene and harry and that
mysterious and terrible being known as
lem schwartz were    empty   

as mason shuddering at his own
 imaginings moved down the stairs
toward what should be the kitchen of the
house he sensed the odor of decomposing
animal matter the stench of wild beasts
bodies in a closed unaired place grew
overpowering sickening it was even
worse than lems room upstairs and at
thought of that mason felt his stomach
heave with ghastly threats of nausea step
by step he moved down the staircase the
torch turned off so as not to apprise any
one below if indeed anybody waited in
ambush there of his coming but upon
reaching the lower step he flashed the
light quickly about

  the kitchen was empty but the door
from it into the back room was open and
egyptian darkness gloomed ahead he
sprang across the kitchen automatic in
readiness and illuminated the parlor it
also was empty empty  as he
looked about his nostrils contracted dis-
gustedly against the fetid smell of decay
and his eyes went roving in search of the
cause


weird tales

  the floor was of bare boards there
were no chairs or other furniture in either
of the two rooms but here and there on
the bare boards were-things-that ma-
on turned the light on shuddering as he
looked there were black stains here and
here    there were bits of decaying
furry skin and there were little piles
of gnawed white bones    and almost
at his feet as he stood lay a crumpled bit
of material  he leaned down and
turned it over good god there had
been the taxi-drivers missing child   
and that material was  a childs
stained torn little rompers   

  mason groaned aloud involuntarily
then he became keenly aware of what
the pervading odor conveyed it was the
unforgettable stench of wild beast ken-
nels in the public zoos it was unbear-
able sickening disgusting nausea got
the better of him he went back through
the kitchen avoiding with inward shrink-
ing those dark stains on the wide boards
and leaped up the staircase with the dis-
agreeable feeling that some one behind
him would presently lay a chilling hand
on his shoulder or pull at his ankles
just as he opened the communicating
door he caught the sound of padding feet
and clicking nails upon the flagstone ter-
race outside the back of the house

  hastily he locked and bolted the door
and then fastened himself into his own
room he sprang across it to the window
yes the wolf-pack was returning from
the chase with its quarry a huge ground-
hog hung limply from the extended
drooling jaws of a gaunt gray wolf and
the brown beast had a small rabbit be-
tween its glistening white teeth behind
those two shrank a glossy little black
wolf which all at once stood still and
lifted its head toward masons window

  the young mans gaze met those lam-
bent eyes a curious stirring of surging

pity in his heart the black wolf stood
for a moment only  then it slunk into the
other house tail dragging as if in shame
mason received a distinct impression of
the animals humiliation

  the door of the other house was still
open drifting up to his window came
sounds of snarling tearing crunching
whining he listened nervous chills send-
ing their shuddering impulses through
him the three wolves were devouring
their prey but where then were selene
harry and the mysterious saturnine lem
   while those three wolves held high
carnival over their prey

  not until dawn had touched the tree
tops with pale prophetic fingers did ma-
son hardy sink back onto his bed into
troubled sleep and throughout the dreams
that haunted him there stood always three
empty rooms that should have been hu-
manly tenanted

	that fast retreating form owned no
       following shadow  

from his uneasy slumbers mason was
awakened by scratching and thumping
at his door-panels for a moment he stood
half dazed where he had sprung from
bed still haunted by the nightmares of the
preceding night his impression was that
some savage beast had leaped against his
door from without

  whos there he demanded sharply
his nerves on edge

  schwartz replied a harsh voice

  what dyou want

  your friend baker says hell bring
your own violin tomorrow he wanted to
come today but i put him off tonights
the full of the moon fiddler a snarl-
ing laugh and lems retreating footsteps
as light as if he walked upon padded
paws   

  through the partition janies voice
please mr fiddler come in before you
the devils pool



go downstairs ive never seen a truly
violin-player gramper says you must
play in regular concerts im just crazy to
hear you mr fiddler

  masons curiosity to see this strange
child who father paul had believed
held the key to the mystery at the bau-
mann place urged him to dress hastily
he donned a light outing shirt and a
tweed jacket that covered the bulge on his
hip occasioned by the automatic which
he decided he would not leave in the room
to be appropriated either by old eli or
the saturnine lem

  as he opened his door old baumann
was coming up with a tray at sight of
mason the ancient drew back with a curi-
ous intaking of breath and an avoidance
of the younger mans gaze

  this is janies breakfast he said
hastily

  mason laughed i had no idea you
would bring my breakfast to me he
said shortly i can go down for it my-
self and im hungry i can tell you your
vegetable soup was good but it doesnt
seem to stick to a fellows ribs very much
mr baumann

  youll have to see lem about your
breakfast hastily said old eli still avoid-
ing his guests eyes

  see lem what for

  youre not supposed to eat today
stated the old farmer briefly and strange-
ly after a long pause

  i presume for the usual reason was
masons sarcastic observation the full
of the moon tonight

  eli baumann involuntarily went back-
ward down two steps and leaned against
the wall staring the tray shook in his
trembling old hands

  who what are you he whis-
pered meek brown eyes wide with awful
apprehension

  is that anything to you asked the

young man coolly following up his seem-
ing advantage

  why did you come here oh god of
heaven what have i done what will
become of my little janie

  the tray would have gone crashing
down the stairs had not mason sprung
forward to save it old eli pushed him
off with frantic hands gnarled by toil
and curled now into the semblance of
claws mason looked speculatively at him
for a long moment then turned and car-
ried the tray to janies door at his tap
she called for him to enter

  whats the matter with gramper
was the first thing the little girl asked as
mason set the tray on a small table beside
the bed and bent his keen blue eyes upon
the child sitting there against plumped-
up pillows

  nothing janie hes just nervous
shrugged hardy surveying with appre-
ciation the pretty picture the child made

  light brown curls hung over her shoul-
ders lying on the gay patchwork quilt like
some french dolls marvellous locks her
brown eyes green-glinted appraised the
visitor canny to a degree that mason had
not expected from father pauls hesita-
ting half-derogatory description this
child was no dolt shy or reserved she
might be but not stupid

  warm color flowed over janies pale
cheeks at the admiration that her visitor
permitted to appear on his face in his
pleasure at the little girls fragile beauty
she blossomed under it like a sun-kissed
rosebud

  i like you mr fiddler she said with
naive frankness you have kind eyes
she finished contemplatively

  now i call that nice of you smiled
mason and gave his easy laugh

  janie dimpled i wish i could walk
around the way everybody else does she
said all at once tearing into little bits a
z

iweird tales

piece of toast and pushing the scraps
about her plate with one finger

  cant you walk janie mason asked
pityingly

  she shook her head i fell on the
rocks out in the woods a year ago i was
running after a rabbit that had gotten out
of its hutch but gramper thinks maybe
some day i can walk again he rubs my
feet and legs every morning and every
night so they wont wither up the doc-
tor told him to

  she lifted a scrap of toast pushed it
between even little teeth and munched
slowly id love to give you some of my
breakfast but if he found it out lem
would be furious and he does make such
scenes miss selene and mr harry dont
eat with us any more they eat with lem
on the other side of the house i suppose
you will too lem says it wont cost
gramper a cent to feed anybody who stays
here to teach me things

  cold shivers were running up and
down masons backbone

  gramper was worried at first he
kept telling lem he couldnt afford a lot
of people here eating and eating our
farm isnt so very big and gramper is old
and cant do much with it lem said
gramper was just to leave it to him lems
awful smart but j just dont like him
myself

  janie paused then added in a lower
tone sometimes i wish gramperd send
him away only gramper says he cant
afford to and she sighed he says if
he sent lem away i couldnt have miss
selene to show me how to weave paper
mats nor mr harry to play his piano and
sing his funny songs to me

mason was listening with more than
ordinary interest to the little girls
outspoken thoughts somewhere here he
hoped to find a clue to the mystery that
dung thickly about everything on the

baumann farm apart from that mys-
tery janie was refreshingly naive and
perhaps the most untouched and natural
human being in that house of weird hap-
penings

  mr harry is funny isnt he but
hes very nice to me sometimes he pats
my head as if i were a ve-e-ry little girl
she smiled mischievously and pulls one
of my curls mr fiddler she leaned
toward him and whispered its a secret
mind but when i grow up im going to
marry him he doesnt know yet she
dimpled an impish look flashing across
her face gramper says mr harry is a
natural-born farmer gramper thinks mr
harry ought to buy a farm instead of
going around singing his funny songs
hark whats that

  the agitated steps of a man who
tramps carelessly because he is not think-
ing how or where he treads    the loud
voice of a man who has gotten past car-
ing whether or not his words are diplo-
matic or his intonation ingratiating   

  baumann where are you oh
skulking behind the curtain just what
might be expected of the dirty old sneak
you are come out come out i tell
you

  a squeak as of a cornered rat scuf-
fling of feet sharp sound of a chair
striking the board floor as it is over-
turned dull thud of some heavy body
pushed hard against the partition and
then harry epsteins voice loud and
furious

  you let that poor girl come under
lems curse and never lifted a finger
when you could have taken it off in a
moment you dirty dutch dog yes lem
told me  i dont care about myself
but youre going right now tmhe quarry
pool and im going with you to see that
you go in by the eternal god

  the low penetrating whine of old
the devils pool



eli   let me go i tell you it wont
do you any good to drag me down there
it wouldnt be of my own free will it
has to be my own free will    stop-
stop-youre-choking-me

  janie the faint color gone from her
cheeks stiffened and made a convulsive
movement as if she would have tried to
get to the floor and onto her feet she
fell back and began to sob softly

  i cant oh i cant mr fiddler
please help gramper mr harry mustnt
talk that way to poor gramper

  hardy went down the stairs two steps
at a time arriving in the kitchen to see
harrys hands loosening their grip on the
old mans wizened throat harrys horri-
fied eyes staring at that ashen visage

  what have you done you idiot

  killed him gasped harry and
leaned horrified over the limp body that
had slipped supinely to the floor and now
lay motionless

  indeed asked a voice smoothly
silkily amusedly how very careless of
you

  mason looked up without interrupt-
ing the long shaft of sunlight that fell
through the open door stood lem
schwartz his glistening teeth bared in a
snarling smile so venomously vindictive
so maliciously triumphant that mason
could not help the low exclamation of
horror and repulsion that forced itself to
his stiff lips

  lem seemed trying vainly to bring his
cruel mouth into a less triumphant ex-
pression but at last he broke into a low
snarling chuckle stretching his head for-
ward until the lean long neck poked out
like a vultures over its prey

  dont flatter yourself lem its too
early in the game snapped hardy sharp-
ly the old mans very much alive   

harry lift his feet and ill get hold of his
shoulders so    well get him up
onto his bed

  lem wheeled and strode away from
the doorway mason with a backward
glance over his shoulder gave a low in-
credulous whistle he realized now that
lem had stood in the pathway of the sun-
shine but a moment since and had thrown
no shadow and now although the july day
was blazingly bright and long shadows
stretched from barn and fences and trees
the fast-retreating form of lem schwartz
owned no following shadow   

there was no time to ponder over
this for old eli had to be gotten up
the stairs and his heavy form inert as it
was proved no easy burden for the two
men as it was near her door the little
girl called frantically bring him in here
please mr harry put him on my bed
oh gramper gramper

  harrys face had not yet lost its ghast-
ly pallor from the shock he had received
in that moment when he had thought
himself a murderer as the blood flowed
back into elis wrinkled face and elis
withered eyelids twitched with returning
consciousness the young hebrew turned
his dark melancholy eyes upon the mus-
cular hands that had so nearly committed
a crime at the behest of his aroused anger

  god of israel i thank thee he
breathed softly his eyes closed for the
moment of his involuntary prayer

  leave gramper with me snorted
janie hes all right now and ive got
a lot to say to him hes been getting into
mischief with me tied up here said the
little girl quaintly not able to keep an
eye on him

  smiling now the two young men left
old baumann to his granddaughters gen-
tle ministrations and went down into the
 

weird tales

kitchen janies cooing voice drifted after
them softly

  im hungry announced hardy look-
ing about him to see if there had been any
breakfast preparations

  harry looked troubled and flung a
quick glance in the direction of the barn

  where are things hardy continued

  hesitating for a moment harry ep-
stein finally opened a cupboard and with
obvious reluctance fished out a loaf of
bread and the remains of the supper
cheese he found milk sugar and cold
coffee then he sat down opposite mason
and watched the other man start in with
hearty appetite

  id give a whole lot if i could eat
those things the way you do harry
burst out all at once with strange wist-
fulness

  mason stared frankly curious

  and you mustnt tell any one that i
gave you food this morning went on the
peddler nervously lem would-

  as if the mention of his name had
been a conjuration the gaunt form of the
hired man strode in at the kitchen door
he strode across the room and snatched
the half-eaten cheese sandwich out of


masons fingers flinging it from the door-
way where it was immediately seized upon
by a pleased hen with loud cackles of
surprize and appreciation

  tonight is the full of the moon

  but im hungry objected mason re-
sentfully

  the glass of coffee went into the sink
with a crash dark and threatening was
the mien lem schwartz turned upon the
indignant young man

  save your appetite for tonight for
you shall eat  i promise you    such
food as you have never tasted before

but until tonight nothing must pass
your lips

  hardys first impulse was to pick up
the plate from the oilcloth-covered table
and fling it at the speakers head his
next was the opportune recollection of his
errand to that place of mystery he
stood watchful silent quiescent regard-
ing lem with speculative blue eyes that
nevertheless smoldered

  you epstein shall remember your
stupidity and disobedience tonight men-
aced lem with venomous emphasis and
a long hard look from his glittering
blade eyes tonight you shall eat what
you and that other foolish one refused to
eat a few weeks ago  

  harry epstein caught at the edge of the
table with hands that showed white about
the knuckles

  no he choked god of my fathers
no not that his eyes were on those
of his tormenter as if he pleaded with
one who he knew beforehand was ob-
durate and relentless

  lem snarled his great nose wrinkled
like an angry dogs

  quite that said he with cool in-
solence and she shall eat of it also to
punish you for your rebellion

  not that poor girl have pity do
what you will with me but spare
selene begged harry and flung out his
hands in oriental abandon as he pleaded

  lem regarded him sneeringly well
he conceded well see how well you
keep your watch over this fiddler until
after tonight he must make his initiate
fasting he ordered and then was gone
from the doorway

  harry epstein staggered over to a
chair sank into it and buried his face in
his hands behind that inadequate shelter
he sobbed like a heart-broken and terri-
fied child his agony shook mason hardy
with apprehension of he knew not what
the devils pool

i

      	that devils baptism in the
               pool   

ragging minutes passed mason
arose and put one hand on the sob-
bing mans shoulder until harry had
finally managed to control himself the
young peddler wiped his eyes shame-
facedly

   sorry to have made such a fool of
myself but its thinking of selene and
poor janie thats upsetting me that lit-
tle kidll be the next one dragged into
this accursed business im afraid
masons lips set hard before he spoke
ive lost all patience harry waiting to
find out what this is about whats the
hold that rotten bluffer out there has over
you people why am i to go without
food today

   you must be desperately hungry to-
night whispered harry after tonight
if the curse has fallen upon you    youll
eat    what lem and selene and i have
been eating he muttered thickly

   absurd grunted hardy skeptically
 im going to make a fresh sandwich
 he announced determinedly

   harry caught at his sleeve detaining
  him in a kind of desperation

   if you eat a single mouthful while
youre in my charge lem will know it
somehow dont ask me why i some-
times think hes the devil in person and
if he finds out he will force selene to
eat    god of israel it is too much i
can not tell you the horror of it

   he collapsed again into a little moan-
 ing heap his shoulders heaving con-
 vulsively mason caught at him and
 shook him with a disgusted vigor

   dont be a simpleton you can lead
a horse to water but you cant make it
drink harry lem cant force selene to
eat what she doesnt relish

  you dont understand moaned
harry

  then help me to understand
impossible you would never believe
me if i told you

  mason snorted impatiently what
for instance is this food that is so highly
repugnant to you that the bare thought of
eating it sends you into near hysterics

  i tell you i dare not tell you the
whole situation is incredible half the
time i dont believe it myself it is like a
terrible nightmare but-havent you
seen how thin selene is

  mason thought of the full-faced girl
whom he had seen pictured in his friends
house it was undeniable that selenes
face had become very thin why when
he considered it she was almost hollow-
cheeked   

  shes not eating regular food because
of the curse of that hell-water in the
woods explained harry incoherently
raw flesh  of animals we catch in
the woods  at night is all she can
digest    now

  mason was exasperated and showed it
do you take me for an absolute idiot
epstein expecting me to swallow such
wretched insinuation entire even as
he spoke doubts assailed him he re-
membered the glossy little black wolf
which had looked up pitifully at his win-
dow the preceding night as if it had ex-
pected to see him looking down upon it
my god he exploded am i mad
or are you

  i wish i knew harry said wearily
the horrible side of this situation is that
lem is trying to force selene and me yet
deeper into his devils clutches by making
us eat    oh god he gulped shud-
dering violently and went silent his eyes
avoiding the other mans penetrating gaze

  mason acceded grimly you hunt
rabbits and ground-hogs at night in the
woods and eat their raw flesh ugh
well let that pass for the moment what


weird tales

i wish to learn is why are you and selene
under the evil domination of such a crea-
ture as lem schwartz

  thats just what i cant tell you   
now mason youll know all tonight
sighed harry without being told one
thing only i ask you if you have any
real pity for selene arkwright you will
fast until tonight if you let food pass
your lips today lem schwartz will force
selene to eat    that    which will
damn her soul for ever harry epstein
declared with a terrible and ominous
gravity after tonight you will be at
liberty to do what you please within
limits he added hastily

   i dont like it at all mason conceded
his head on one side as he listened sub-
consciously to the murmur of voices from
janies room i think ill have a talk
with selene

  dont flatter yourself that shell tell
you more than i have said the peddler
sharply shes trying to make herself
believe that shes the victim of bad
dreams nightmares of terrible and in-
credible vividness he shuddered

  lowering his voice cautiously mason
inquired where were you and selene
and lem last night

  the young jew paled as he stared back
at the other man

  you-you did look from the window
then as she told you what-what did
you see he jerked out tensely

  i saw three wolves returning from the
chase epstein and there was nobody in

that other house because i-

  you dared go there groaned harry
then    you know

  i know that im a victim of the same
kind of nightmare you seem to be afflict-
ed with replied mason grimly

   did you    did you find remains   
of half-devoured-

  mason looked queerly at the young
jews eager pleading yet anxious face

  dont you know yourself he asked
pointedly in reply

  we never go downstairs there in day-
time harry explained if we have to
go to our rooms we go through that
upper door in the upper hall and   
and the odor he cried out in a wild but
guarded voice makes me afraid-

  the other side of this house was
empty last night mason pronounced
with finality i dont know yet just
what evil and incredibly horrible things
are going on in this accursed spot but
downstairs i found and his nostrils con-
tracted with disgust decaying bits of
furry skin and bloody dried flesh and
half-gnawed bones of animals   

  then it isnt a dream its true ex-
claimed the peddler and jumped to his
feet in such nervous agitation that mason
grasped his arms and shook him forcibly
to constrain him into some semblance of
self-control then its true that dam-
nable devils baptism in the quarry

pool- his voice died away into silence

as his eyes darted this way and that to
avoid masons keen glance

  go on epstein now i must know
the rest he ordered grimly

  the peddler shook his head his eyes
were wild

  tonight is the full of the moon if
you have fallen under the curse youll
know the worst tonight if you havent
you can leave here tomorrow unless lem
manages to give you that devils baptism
of his somehow

mason changed tactics abruptly
from what you said to old bau-
mann a short time past i infer that he
knows how to remove the spell or what-
ever it is that holds you here
the devil s pool

  harry nodded sullenly yes but he
wont stir to remove it

  why not

  would you if you had to give up
your life voluntarily knowing that the
devil would get your soul when you
died was the astonishing reply

  masons stare was incredulous you
people sure have been well hypnotized
he asserted

  harry laughed hardly and how
about you who found three empty rooms
and saw three wolves returning from the
chase with their prey

  lem or old eli must have put it over
me too mason admitted with reluc-
tance but from now on i shall be on
my guard to maintain mental and spirit-
ual supremacy despite his attempt to
make his voice and words assured there
was no convincing quality there and he
knew it

janies voice broke the ensuing silence
gramper is what mr harry says true
janie janie i did it for you dont
ask me more moaned the broken voice
of old eli

  can you un-hypnotize them by jump-
ing into the quarry pool demanded the
little girls voice with sharp persistence
is miss selene staying here because shes
hypnotized and not because she loves to
teach me things her voice in turn
broke pitifully

  janie janie the old mans cry
was monotonously the same

  lem schwartz is mixed up in this
isnt he gramper thats why youre so
afraid of him declared the child with a
flash of that uncanny insight which father
paul had divined and if you went into
the quarry pool miss selene could go
away oh i want her to stay suddenly
sobbed janie childishly shes so sweet
to me i just love miss selene

  janie dont cry grampers little

girl miss selene shant go while you
want her here lem promised me that

when i gave him my word- he

broke off abruptly

  when you promised him what
gramper demanded the little girl
cleverly seizing upon those pregnant
words what did you promise him
youd better tell me ill find out any-
way if you dont ill ask lem myself
she threatened

  oh no janie you mustnt ask lem
anything wailed old eli in abject ter-
ror hes not fit to be near you

  why not gramper we dont need
him around here anyway im going to
ask harry to be our hired man janie
announced with serenity hed be lots
better than that scowling old lem so
you can send lem to me and ill tell him
he can go

  he wont go janie he    dont
you see i cant tell him to go ive prom-
ised him he can stay until- and here

the old mans voice broke off in a wild
and moaning incoherent outburst which
he evidently tried to smother among
janies quilts

  the childs uncanny intuition played
her true youve told him he can stay
until you bathe in the pool havent you
gramper well then it seems to me
youll have to do it

  god in heaven janie no you dont
understand what that would mean lem
would take my soul if i did that id be
for ever damned into hell

  gramper i just dont believe any
such silliness declared the childs clear
voice contemptuously youve let your-
self get all excited over that ugly lem
schwartz as if he were the devil in per-
son he doesnt do any work youve
told me that yourself he just goes
prowling around the woods trying to find


weird tales

trespassers he hardly ever helps you
with the farm work

  now harry would be another kind
of hired man his hands are so strong
gramper and his heart is so kind and
he loves farm work hes told me so
himself she added in a lower tone
singular sweetness in her accents it was
as if she were smiling happily to herself

  janie its no use your talking i
cant send lem away if i tell him to go
i must give up my life and soul to him
in exchange for those others    cant
you understand

  i understand that that is what you
think gramper but i dont believe it for
a minute myself the little girl retorted
what id like to know is why did you
let lem think you so silly

   i did it for you janie for you   
gramper for me what good
would your silliness do me

  father paul had been right thought
mason straining his ears so as not to miss
a word of that pregnant conversation
janie was indeed the key to the whole
situation

  janie i wanted you to be amused
and have company while you were lying
here helpless and i hadnt money to pay
anybody i couldnt even feed them even
if they stayed here for nothing the farm
hardly pays just to keep us two im too
old to work it

  so you let lem live here and hypno-
tize people so that theyd stay with me
demanded janie what gramper who
wants people that have to stay with
them in janies voice was more than a
hint of mortified tears  thought miss
selene wanted to stay and harry   
oh how could you have been so silly
dont cry grampers little girl
gramper cant bear to have you cry
begged old eli voice quavering

  lem must go away gramper said
the child imperatively

  janie i cant send him

  there was a long silence

  harrys eyes lifted to masons flashing
blue orbs and in that dark gaze mason
fancied he read thoughts too closely al-
lied to violence he shook his head at
harry imposing further silence with up-
lifted warning finger

  we wont talk about it any more just
now gramper janie went on in a tran-
quil voice but with an elaborate casual-
ness that stirred mason oddly i think
i want to be alone now i have a lot of
thinking to do

  a moment later old elis dragging
footsteps sounded in the upper hallway
mason seized the young jews sleeve and
jerked him out of the lower room and
into the front yard

	dare use that name again and see
      whatll happen to you   

tve got to find selene harry

  a to tell her her dreams arent night-
mares but horrid realities demurred
harry in bitter reproach shes still try-
ing to deceive herself

  the other man scowled thoughtfully
h-m-m seems theres nothing to do
then but wait for tonight and the full of
the moon

  if these hideous nightmares are real-
ities mason will you get father paul to
come down after you return asked
harry after a moments painful silence
hes the only one who can help us i
have a strong feeling that he understands
something of what has been going on
here he warned me when he was down
a couple of days ago against letting lem
force me into    into joining that   
devils orgy

  so you confided in father paul who
came and went and you dont see fit to

                     w t-
the devils pool



tell me who am here to take my chances
with you

  but you see    he    knew he
   asked me   where the missing
child was whispered harry head hang-
ing dejectedly

  no impossible    horrible  
sick horror seized upon mason as he re-
membered father pauls words and
the missing child father paul had said
with such a strange intonation

  dont look at me like that exclaimed
the young jew wildly i had nothing to
do with it neither had selene it was
lem who brought the child here god of
my fathers was it a dream he tried to
make us join him in his horrid feasting
but selene refused he    bit her on the
shoulder oh it is true it is no dream
   janie bandaged that shoulder the
morning after he added in a sick whis-
per

  man man get hold of yourself ad-
monished hardy sternly he was ghast-
ly sick with nausea and loathing for
harrys words had brought back vividly
the fetid stench of those downstairs rooms
in the other house as well as the bits of
decaying flesh and the half-gnawed bones
then he cried out in protest

  that devil actually brought a live
child here and    and devoured it
why that isnt possible its absolutely
incredible

  then it was harrys turn to quiet him
dont let lem hear you you dont
know yet what hes capable of if he were
to realize that you came here purposely
to spy upon him  oh for pitys sake
dont cry out so loudly-
mason controlled himself with a mighty
effort im going in there tomorrow
he said brow contracted teeth set grim-
ly im going to dean up all that mess
  and    bury those bones somewhere
   and put a mark over    over the
wt-

grave a child that devil    a
child

  you see how mere words have moved
you harry murmured despondently
yet selene and i have been constrained
night after night by we know not whftt
fearful force from without ourselves to
go into the forest with that    that devil
   and hunt wild creatures to satisfy
our hunger we are still    calm but
a tremor in his voice belied the bravery of
his words if you intend to get through
this night and keep your sanity and help
selene youll have to puf everything out
of your mind now or youll go mad the
way ive thought more than once that i
would he finished and groaned

doomed thus to fasting and inactiv-
ity there was nothing for it but to
let the hours slip past stretched under
the black walnut tree that shaded the
front of the baumann farmhouse the two
men lay in silence on the grass watching
the hot july suns progress across the sky
and its final decline into the west

  tomorrow mason cogitated earl
baker and father paul would arrive de-
manding to see him in person tomor-
row he himself would know how success-
ful had been lems incredible powers
over himself dream and reality seemed
so confusingly close to each other that
mason almost welcomed the moment
when the red sun disappeared behind the
hilltop leaving a rosy glow in the sky
and lem schwartz strode down from the
barn a hideous and sardonic grin distort-
ing his lean countenance as he beckoned
the two men with claw-like finger

  hush say nothing it would only
make it worse for us all whispered
harry in agitated warning

  mason stretched cramped limbs and
followed lem into the baumann kitchen
where the hired man stood at the foot of


weird tales

the stairs the handle of the communi-
cating door in one hand the red sky was
reflected luridly in those deep-set eyes
that peered ominously from beneath their
shaggy brows his gaze went significantly
to harry

   selene called harry as if in obedi-
ence to some esoteric message were
waiting

  coming answered the girls voice
from above janie let go my skirt dear
i have to be going

  i dont want you to go replied
janies determined voice why should
you run away in the middle of this lovely
story it leaves me all alone just gram-
per and he cant read the way you do
let go my dress janie let go dear
you dont understand i have to go
there was an exasperated exclamation
selene came to the head of the stairs
pausing to tuck a breadth of skirt under
her blouse where janies disrespectful and
demanding little hands had ripped it
apart

  the sun has set hurry why are
you waiting urged old elis trembling
importunate voice in agitation

  masons face showed irritation as he
looked at the old farmer whose bent form
wavered as he leaned against the oilcloth-
covered table set now for one    selene
drew in a long quivering breath and
came slowly down the stairs

  the sun has gone down god in
heaven   

   with a snarl as of a savage beast lem
wheeled upon the old man his nose
seemed longer and larger than ever to
mason it was as if the bushy eyebrows
had straggled down the high cheek-bones
hairily like a thicket from behind which
those garnet-gleaming eyes glared fierce-
ly the hand that the hired man lifted to
hurry selene through the door into the
other house looked gray and shaggy in the

fast-fading light the fingers seemed
pointed together like a great nailed paw

  dare to use that name again said
a thick voice darkly

  im coming dont touch me lemj
im coming i tell you cried out the girl
in an outburst of terror she shrank from
that hateful contact her lips tightening
unpleasantly over her teeth so that her
whole aspect altered subtly

  mason took one of her limp hands in
his and followed hariy into the next
house in the tiny hallway he hesitated
until harrys hand urged him up the
stairs

  you can share my room said the
peddler in a low tone

  lem had lingered in the doorway
below mason strained his ears to hear
whatever was passing between the hired
man and old baumann

  dare use that name again lem
was snarling viciously and see whatll
happen to you    and yours pointedly

  janie oh janie what have i done
what have i done

  the only response was a bestial growl
so startling in character that mason gen-
tly assisting selene up the dark staircase
stopped short in astonishment the door
slammed old elis key could be heard
hastily securing him from unexpected in-
vasion from their side of the house
harrys hand reached down and pulled
at mason urgently

  be quick

  selene had apparently regained her
poise arrived at the upper hallway she
ran into her room with a hurried good-
night and her door closed the bolt
slipped into place rustily

  this way directed harry with an
apprehensive glance over his shoulder
hurry lem warned me never to linger
at this hour between dusk and dark its
   dangerous he pushed mason
the devils pool



ahead of him into the room closed the
door and shut the bolt his finger went
to his lips in warning

  there came a sound of padding foot-
steps on the staircase then a low whine
a scratching at selenes door then
those clicking nails    padding paws   
went down the stairs again

  ill go to his room now whispered
harry in a cautious undertone bolt this
door when i go out no dont detain
me i have no time now to explain even
if this is only a dream therell be plenty
of light soon from the moon harry
offered vaguely

  he unbolted the door slipped out
quietly and pulled it to behind him

mason pushed in the bolt he was
glad the flashlight was in his pocket
for it might perhaps serve him now
although the moonlight gave unmistak-
able signs of shortly flooding the room
with its pallid light as this light became
stronger and brighter there came odd
rustlings and scratchings and soft winn-
ings from the rooms on either side of
him he held his breath he could have
sworn that selene had cautiously drawn
the bolt of her door this was more than
his curiosity could stand he opened his
own with painstaking care quietly lifting
the latch of the door until he could look
out through a narrow crack into the
upper hallway

  through selenes open door the moon-
light fell in a broad swath and in the
midst of that uncanny brilliance cowered
a glossy black creature that slunk belly
to the board floor toward the staircase
at the top of the flight it hesitated as if
reluctant turning its pointed head back-
ward over furry shoulders in his as-
tonishment for he thought he recognized
the black wolf of the preceding night
mason let his door slip from his hands

it flew open outlining him as he stood
against the flooding moonshine

  the glowing eyes of the black wolf
fell upon him it gave utterance to a low
pitiful whining cry almost in the same
moment another door opened and a
large brown wolf bounded out stopping
short at sight of mason in the doorway
the fur bristled on its body it growled
but stood stock-still glaring at youdg
hardy with its redly scintillating eyes

  it seemed to mason that hours passed
while he stood there motionless daring
to make no slightest movement lest it
might precipitate an attack from one or
the other of the two wolves from the
kitchen below came a call a long-drawn-
out importunate whine as if that sound
had broken the spell holding all three
creatures like statues the black wolf fled
down into the darkness followed closely
by the bristling brown beast

 mason sprang across the hall and
glanced into selenes room it was empty
no occupant was in lems room either
mason was back in a flash to harrys
room bolting the door he sprang to the
window breathing hard as he told him-
self that it was all a too-vivid dream

  as they had done on the previous
night the three wolves emerged and trot-
ted toward the woods the long gaunt
gray    the big brown    and the slim
black one as they sped across the moon-
lit landscape the black one deliberately
paused under the window and looked up
at mason again then it too disappeared
into the forest shades the wolf-packs
raucous cry rose on the still night air

  	the mirror reflected a thing that
        did not lie before it 

a strange and disturbing sensation
diverted masons attention to him-
self all at once his mind was drawn
absolutely away for the moment from


weird tales

those savage ominous howls from the
woods with unpleasant suddenness he
realized that his left foot and leg were
prickling painfully as if they had gone
to sleep a vigorous stamp to restore
circulation moved him to a cry of amaze-
ment and dismay for when he stamped
the tan oxford at the extremity of his left
leg flew from the foot and across the
room striking the opposite wall and
dropping behind harrys tumbled bed

  also mason completely lost his bal-
ance went heavily on the floor on his
back as he instinctively flung his head
forward to save it from the severe blow
it must otherwise have sustained he
beheld a strange an incredible sight his
right foot was neatly clad in silk sock and
well-polished tan oxford but the sock on
the left foot was wrinkled slipping the
oxford had already flown through the air
as he went down the limp sock followed
the shoe

  mason hardy lay on the floor a full
sixty seconds before he dared raise him-
self to a sitting posture and hitch into
full moonlight for another look at what
he felt he simply could not have seen
because it was altogether too incredible
he closed his eyes blinked them rapidly
once or twice then opened them directly
upon that prickting left foot and leg
the blue eyes widened amazedly then for
what he saw only too plainly was the
slim hairy leg of an animal with a well-
padded nailed paw at the extremity

  he closed his eyes with a snap opened
them again fixed them incredulously
upon that impossible sight then he
touched one finger gingerly to that strange
appendage it was rough and hairy
sight and touch concurred in their mes-
sages to his bewildered horrified con-
sciousness

  with some difficulty he got to his feet
for this strange leg bent under him dis-

agreeably in the wrong direction he
could hardly straighten it enough to stand
upright the old priest had been right
quite right evil incarnate was rampant
on the baumann farm and mason
hardy in his friendly endeavor to be of
service to his old college chum had come
into direct contact with that destruction
that walked at noonday as father paul
had hinted so broadly

  meantime the pallid moon had climbed
the sky louder nearer came the cry of
the weird wolf-pack altering strangely
and subtly in tone a rushing of padded
feet  a whimpering wail mason
went leaping in awkward bounds to the
window that last cry had come from no
wild beast it had sounded like a fright-
ened child at the thought his blood
ran cold horror clutched him his body
pimpled pricklingly with goose-flesh

  scratching    whining    snarl-
ing    growls    below

  in masons mind now stood out like
letters of flame those final words of
father paul evil can not utterly tri-
umph as long as there is the slightest
effort to hold on to good

  the young man took the automatic
from his pocket unbolted the door and
stumbled uncertainly across the upper
hall metamorphosed foot and leg hinder-
ing him dangerously down the stairs
holding to the stair rails going sidewise
to keep from falling    god how ter-
rible to be handicapped at such a moment
by that wolf-like limb   

the door in the tiny hall below was
open into the kitchen mason peered
cautiously around the corner from which
he could see through into the parlor at
what his eyes beheld he could with diffi-
culty restrain his lips from the cry that
pushed impetuously to them he was
looking directly upon the cowering form
of the black wolf trembling there upon
the devil s pool



the board floor beyond the beast stood
the great pier-glass and in that glass
   the mirror showed no wolf the
mirror reflected a thing that did not seem
to lie before it what the wide blue eyes
of young hardy beheld was the white
crouching body of a girl half concealed
by streaming black hair as she trembled
there in a spasm of obvious revulsion and
fear

  almost paralyzed at the weird paradox
of what lay before the mirror and what
the glass reflected mason found himself
incapable for the time being of any
movement he could only stand staring
and listening

  another beast farther back in the room
snarled the nailed paws came clicking
across the boards and presently into his
field of vision slouched the brown wolf
head pushed down against its own furry
breast as if to hide its eyes another
ferocious growl and the gaunt gray beast
bounded across snapping viciously at the
brown the brown animal recoiled snarl-
ing lips back from bared teeth and all
the time the little black wolf kept up a
continuous pitiful whining as it cowered
against the floor while in the mirror was
reflected that shuddering quivering white
body   

  for a moment the gray wolf glared
upon the other two drawn lips tight
against glistening slavering teeth then
it bounded back when it returned it
held something white between those
pointed fangs    something that wailed
weakly impotently pitifully

  mason hardy could not check the
gasping cry that now surged upward
from his throat the spell of horror that
had until this moment held him petrified
broke he made a clumsy leap into the
middle of the kitchen another that car-
ried him staggering into the parlor

  with a smothered snarl of mingled sur-

prize and fury the gaunt gray wolf
leaped backward dropping its screaming
burden mason caught up the infant and
began an awkward retreat the grays
threatening jaws opened as that gaunt
beast slunk menacingly after him a
crisis seemed imminent then the brown
wolf sprang crouching in the grays way
its tail switching from side to side a long
snarl threatening the other beast

  mason directed his automatic at the
glowing garnet orbs of the gray and
backed away until he had reached the
staircase he would have drawn the
door to when a sudden rush  a
whining pitiful cry    gave him pause
the little black wolf had crept swiftly
after him and was crouching abjectly at
his feet looking up with almost human
intelligence in its dog-like piteous eyes

  mason hardy remembered the paradox
of the mirror he backed up one step
permitting the black wolf to pass him on
the stairs and pulled the door to he
was just in time he had one whirling
dizzy glimpse of the other two beasts en-
gaged in frightful struggle as the brown
disputed the grays advance they flung
themselves together upon the closed door
which rattled perilously as if the latch
would spring open any minute mason
would have bolted it but bolt there was
none so up the stairs he stumbled in
haste

he hammered on the communicating
door while against it leaned whin-
ing fearfully the little black wolf eyes
rolling whitely in the darkness the
young mans heart beat irregularly with
pity and apprehension as he listened to
the hellhounds uproar below also the
child in his arms continued to scream
lustily at any minute the fight would be
decided and the staircase invaded he
struck the door imperatively with the butt


weird tales

of his automatic and shouted for ad-
mittance

  scuffling and exclamations on the
other side    the old mans voice
raised shrilly no janie no janies
voice hard with some passionate emo-
tion    the key turned briskly the
door opened mason almost fell into the
other house the salvaged infant shrieking
in his arms in good time the door be-
low swung wide and clicking feet
scrambled up the stairs the young man
flung his weight against the door push-
ing the bolt and then turning the key

  it was only when safety was assured
that he became aware of the miracle
barefooted clad only in her little white
night-robe janie stood her eyes wide
with incredulous amazement at her own
feat she was balancing on her long-
unused limbs with the airy fluttering of
an uneasy butterfly but there was no un-
certainty in the starry light of her eyes
despite the expression of questioning
fear on her childish face

   her eyes fell in astonishment upon the
black wolfish form cowering at masons
feet with a startled exclamation she
turned back toward her room paused
and cried out again sharply in the mir-
ror opposite her open door janie had
seen what mason -also saw as the child
cried out   the shuddering white form
of selene arkwright shielded solely by
long black hair janie on her little un-
steady white feet was into the rcom and
out again dragging a quilt after her
with a tenderness beyond her years she
laid this covering about the wolfish form
cowering on the floor

  come with me dear miss selene
cried she and tugged at the glossy black
head of the beast fearlessly oh what-
ever have you wicked men been doing
to miss selene she stood in the door-
way of her room supporting her slender

body against the door-frame all of
you are devils

  old eli stood staring stupidly jaw
dropped one shaking finger wagged at
the infant still shrieking lustily in ma-
sons arms

  give that baby to me this instant
commanded janie imperatively oh
gramper i dont exactly understand what
lems been trying to do here but hes
going to leave tomorrow she announced
with definiteness now that i can walk
i know how to drive him away she
added mysteriously as she slipped back
into her room

  the door closed upon her and the
black wolf but her flashing backward
glance carried strange import to masons
now keenly awakened intuition

  janie janie wept the old man
piteously outstretched hands groping
after that retreating figure that had been
so triumphant in its yet uneasy carriage
so dominated by the childs strange spirit

  tomorrow theres going to be a show-
down declared hardy staring down at
his strangely altered limb cold fury
stirred him whatever youve been up
to old man your deviltrys going to
stop

  old eli whimpered weakly he was
bent over listening now to the wicked
snarls on the other side of that upper
door his body shook as if with an at-
tack of ague nothing    ive done
nothing he protested whining

  look at this leg of mine snapped
hardy dont tell me you havent some
idea of how it got this way i have my
suspicions old man tomorrow youll
walk the plank into that pool and get an
all-over bath understand

  no oh no shrieked old eli cow-
ering in abject fear his head going down
into his shaking hands oh god no
masons laugh was hard and bitter
the devils pool



  youre going in ill see to it myself
theres something hellish about that pool
and if the rest of us are infected youre
going to get your dose too

  a long moan that quavered off into
silence old eli went down on the floor
in a trembling abject heap janies door
opened

  what are you doing to gramper let
him alone i tell you i know all about
it i made him tell me i can make it
come right    poor gramper dont be
afraid she murmured tenderly like a
young mother to her fearful child jan-
ieu make it all right

  the childs eyes flung at mason hardy
the menace that might lie in the shining
orbs of a tigress protecting her young
as she looked proudly at him across that
crouched quaking fear-stricken old man
you let him alone you hear
mason laughed he turned his back
on the child and approached the com-
municating door now safely bolted and
locked but against which leaped heavy
bodies with snarls and growls he struck
it with the butt of his automatic

  keep away or ill shoot through the
wood he shouted if you are what i
suspect youll understand i give you
sixty seconds to get away from here
the snarls ceased presently he heard
the clicking of nailed claws as the beasts
retired downstairs a soft whining
sounded from the landing a moment
later intuition told him that the brown
wolf had returned and was begging for
entry but he dared not open the door to
it whatever it might be other than
wolf it must fend for itself that one night

  	it was the sacred wafer  

the young man spent the remainder
of the night alone in the kitchen for
janie soon prevailed upon her grand-
father to go to bed the light of a kero-

sene lamp made the room cheery and
mason spent those wee small hours put-
ting together the pieces of the puzzle to
which he now felt he held a key but
daylight was to bring upon him much
which he had not calculated with day-
break the communicating downstairs door
was flung open and harry epstein fol-
lowed closely by the saturnine lem ugly
eyes filled with unholy lights came run-
ning into the baumann kitchen

  lem advanced upon the young man
great hairy fists clenching and unclench-
ing his glowing eyes fixed the young
mans resentful gaze with malevolent
confidence and power

  you would mix up in my business
eh snarled lem shoving his furious
countenance up against that of mason
hardy well since youve asked for
what youre going to get well have it
over with at once i dont want any non-
sense on this farm from now on

  the look he shot at old eli who had
come tottering down the stairs sent die
old man shrinking back against the wall
uplifted hands shaking as if to hold off
some horrid specter

  its certainly time something was
done agreed mason endeavoring with
difficulty to maintain an icy calm this
morning you are going to pack up and
get off this place for good

  lem flung his head back uttering as
he did so a loud grating laugh

  im leaving eh well youll have to
make me go then and you wouldnt
care to have a fight and a fuss with a
woman in the house little fiddler would
you ill fight you poor fool but not
here

  harry epstein was shouting dont
go out into the woods mason dont go
into the woods keep away from the
pool

  shut your mouth ground out lem


weird tales

with a slow turn of his furious eyes upon
the young hebrew that was somehow
more terrible more menacing than a
quicker movement would have been for
it betrayed lems complete confidence in
his own supremacy come along since
you must let me batter you before i give
you your baptism in the pool

  he shot out of the house door and
was off into the woods without glancing
behind him it was as if he knew well
that he would be followed

  dont go mason dont let him en-
tice you near the pool again begged
harry trying to hold the other man by
the sleeve

  hardy thrust those fingers away gently
but firmly

  my dear fellow you cant dissuade
me why that fellows sheer devil do
you think i could go away in safety be-
fore having a whack at him im a pretty
fair boxer i may have a good chance to
give him his just deserts

  harry nodded his eyes were humid
he stood back resignedly

  if i cant get the better of him ill
throw myself into the pool exclaimed
hardy kindling better that than to be
tossed in by him and ive about figured
it out that a voluntary sacrifice will break
the spell for you others

  he flung out of the house hardly real-
izing that the hindering metamorphosis
of the preceding night had disappeared
harry followed more slowly

as the young jew ran lightly down
 the path to the woods he heard
hoof-beats he stopped to look back a
horse and buggy were coming along the
lane the horse was plump and gray
and apparently not at all pleased at feel-
ing the unaccustomed whip now flicking
its sides for it gave occasional little re-
sentful jumps as it half trotted half

balkily walked along harry turned back
he knew father pauls outfit as he ap-
proached he recognized also the pale
harassed face of earl baker

  where are they called the priest
anxiously as harry came within speak-
ing distance

  lem and mason have gone into the
woods to fight it out harry explained

  holy mother ejaculated the priest
piously and gave the astonished gray
horse such a stroke as that plump hide
had never experienced before the beast
jumped and set off at a clumsy gallop
harry ran after the buggy caught at the
back and managed to hang on as the
vehicle bumped and bounced over the
ruts of the country lane

  as they passed the baumann house
two figures emerged but harry did not
see them he was by far too seriously
occupied retaining his hold on that jounc-
ing vehicle nor did he see a taxi that
came slowly down the lane behind

  at the verge of the quarry pool father
paul reined up the gray nag and sprang
out horse-whip in hand righteous in-
dignation burning in his usually kindly
eyes he walked toward the two strug-
gling figures by now engaged in a dead-
ly clinch swinging and swaying as each
in turn strove to throw the other into the
strange waters that sparkled and surged
and leaped up at the rocky verge where
they were fighting

  behind the good priest came earl
baker frantic with the apprehensions
that had been making such inroads upon
him

  hold him mason ill be with you
in a moment earl was shouting wildly

  father paul found no opportunity to
use his horse-whip so interlaced were
those tense figures that hardly seemed to
move strained as they were each against
the other
the devils pool

  and so it was harry only who glimpsed
the slender white form that sprang
straight out through the air plunging
into the pool despite selene arkwrights
frantic attempts to prevent janies un-
expected action it was harry who again
came to the rescue of a woman and flung
himself into the gurgling waters swim-
ming frantically in the direction of that
little poignant face that had gone under
come floating up and disappeared once
more

  father paul whirling at harrys out-
cry and the ensuing splash as the young
jews body struck the pools sparkling
waters reached into a fold of his clothes
and brought out a folded napkin with
his left hand he scattered the contents
of the napkin onto the surface of the
pool while his right hand made the sign
of the cross over the greedy lapping rip-
ples

  the moving waters broke into a foam-
ing fury that for a moment flashed over
the two heads now appearing together
old eli had reached the scene his wild
cry of utter despair brought a vindictive
and scornful smile to the face of lem
schwartz who now flung off his oppo-
nent easily for masons attention had
been diverted by the things happening
so swiftly about the pool as the waters
subsided harry swam vigorously with
one arm drawing the pale little janie
to safety willing hands aided her to
land lem gleaming orbs rolling from
one to the other of the assembled com-
pany had begun to draw his dark satur-
nine face into a heavy scowl apparently
things were not entirely to his liking

  go father paul ordered bruskly
pointing into the depths of the forest
with imperative gesture and facing the
malevolent grin of lem with intrepid
courage

  too late father if i go now these

others are bound to go with me sneered
lem

  that isnt true shrilled janie ex-
citedly i jumped into the water to save
them all you cant touch them now
lem

   in beast-like fashion he snarled at her
then laughed horridly

  i cant touch them now janie my
dear thanks to you but you have put
yourself in their place of your own free
will he made a quick step toward her

  harry epstein white and fearfully
afraid but dauntless stood in his way
one finger on janie and ill pull your
eyes out you devil he ground out
janie shrank against her defender for a
moment then drew herself away and
went trembling to meet the grinning
lem who held out his arms to her with
mock invitation of welcome

   no janie no cried harry

  yes harry i must it is what has
saved you and miss selene i belong
to him now instead of all of you

   lem shouted a berserker burst of tri-
umph he put out one ugly hairy hand
janie shrank shuddering she closed her
eyes

  then father pauls horse-whip cut
down sharply upon that dark and evil
hand and lems scream of astonishment
and pain followed upon its whistling
errand

  you can not touch that dear child
asserted father paul with calm confi-
dence

  indeed youll see how she shall
suffer for this lem began darkly men-
acing

father pauls calm gaze left lems
face and shifted to the pool lem
also looked something like dismay and
incredulity passed across his lowering

visage


weird tales

  it was the sacred wafer said father
paul quietly the water is itself again
the spell was broken while those two
were in the water

  harry ran forward and pulled janies
drooping form into his arms his ex-
clamation was one of incredulous joy

  then janie is all right and selene
and i god of my fathers how good
thou art

  lem schwartz turned grinding his
teeth audibly and gave vent to an ugly
laugh his fists were clenched with im-
potent fury as he slouched along the side
of the pool

  a loud hoarse voice hailed him as he
slunk off

  wait a minute feller you aint get-
tin off as easy as you might be thinkin
cried the taxi-driver coming around the
side of the pool at a run wheres my
little jacky huh

  lems shoulders shook with sardonic
merriment his dark face distorted with
a convulsion of malevolent triumph

  youll find his clothes back at elis
farm he shouted the wolves ate
him and he suddenly gave vent to
howling laughter flinging his head back
like a wild beast about to call his mates
to the kill

  the unshaven face of the driver was
so dark that father pauls heart trembled
at sight of it stop think what youre
doing cried the good man hastily fore-
seeing the next action of jackys grief-
infuriated father

  yeah ive done my thinkin a piece
past father what im goin to do now
is actin and with that he launched him-
self upon lems back and by sheer weight
of his surprize attack staggered the sinis-
ter being so that he lost his balance com-
pletely

  back to hell with you you devil
where you belong shouted the taxi-
driver recovering himself just in time
to avoid going over the edge of the rock
into the pool which now with a mighty
splash received the dark form of lem
schwartz

  father paul had held up one hand to
delay the involuntary movement of mason
hardy no my son this matter is in
other hands than ours that man-

  he was interrupted by lems body
striking the pool a sudden thick and
noisome cloud of stinking smoke arose
from the water    obscured the vision
momentarily    cleared

  -that man if man he was con-
tinued father paul serenely is better
left to his own devices if he were an
illusion of the deceived senses-

  why theres nothing there cried
hardy astonished he was bending over
the water and the clear limpidity of the
pool now showed every detail of its
rocky bottom distinctly nowhere could
be seen the leering face of that strange
entity that had called itself lem schwartz

  it was the sacred wafer my children
said father paul softly the powers of
evil could not combat the forces for good
that lie behind that blessed symbol the
destruction that walketh at noonday
need no longer be feared

  in earls arms stood selene her face
hidden against his shoulder janie very
happy leaned on harrys solicitously sup-
porting arms one of her hands was in
elis the old man was crying across
these passed the good priests glance
very tenderly his eyes met masons the
two men smiled understanding at each
other

   gods in his heaven alls right with
the world quoted father paul and
nodded contentedly

jlack invocation

by paul ernst

the story of a frightful elemental evoked by the chanting of an

  old latin formula

my telephone rang one night
about a month ago and on the
wire was bryce woodward

  have you time for some psychic in-
vestigating this evening he asked me

  more mediums i countered on
several occasions i have gone out with
bryce to visit psychic mediums whose
powers were confined to tricks with mir-
rors hollow tables and sound amplifiers

 no said bryce this is something
 different another experiment with in-
 vocation want to indulge

 i suppose so i said

 all right ill be over in half an
 hour to get you ill explain then

 in less than the designated half-hour
 he was at my door his dark eyes shining
 with a light half of eagerness and half
 of amusement

                                       


weird tales

  a word here concerning bryce wood-
ward a young man with an inherited
income he has entertained himself since
leaving college with studies of things
psychic supernatural and abnormal
rather he has entertained himself by ex-
posing alleged demonstrations of those
things as fakes and i interested from
a professional viewpoint inasmuch as i
am a beginning medico with a patholog-
ical bent have often gone with him for
the rest bryce is tall and very dark
with a sparsely bearded but virile-looking
face in which under heavy eyebrows that
have a sort of satanic slant are set deep
dark eyes a good fellow though in-
clined to be a bit mysterious and secretive

  were going back to sixth century
rome he began his explanation while
i was getting my hat and locking up my
combination office and living-apartment
you know that old parchment work on
demonology i picked up in paris two years
ago

  i nodded the fragment that instructs
students in black magic on how to call
up devils and things yes i remember
it

  well were going to work with that
said bryce

  i recalled one whole evening we had
spent-with that-in pronouncing sol-
emnly aloud certain mystic words in latin
guaranteeing to call weird and marvelous
beings from their haunts in the outer-
world no weird or marvelous beings
had replied

  tonight will be different said bryce
when i reminded him of our failure

we left my apartment and started
walking north with our destina-
tion as yet unnamed by him from time
to time i stole side glances at him i had
never been able to figure out what were
his real beliefs in things supernatural

he seemed always to be sure he would
be disappointed in his search for psychic
proofs yet he seemed oddly enough al-
ways to be hoping he would find them
this time

  you remember the theory i put forth
that evening we worked with the bit of
parchment he asked at length

  i had forgotten it so he proceeded to
remind me

  it was my idea that certain definite
sounds in precise series might set up vi-
brations-key vibrations so to speak-
which would act upon substances ordinar-
ily invisible and intangible to us in such
a way as to make them both tangible and
visible-cause them to leave their own
dimension whatever it may be and in-
vade ours

  just what is them i asked

  he shrugged who knows dark
monsters ghosts the beings we know as
angels-anything might respond but all
answering mind you only to a certain
sequence of definitely uttered syllables-
like the electric device that opens a door
in response to the ordered vibrations of
a certain password to which it has been
timed

  but we tried once to invoke the spirits
by definitely uttering the syllables of that
old latin phrase in the parchment and
got nowhere

  theres a possible reason for our fail-
ure we didnt know how to pronounce
the latin correctly no man alive knows
how at least i thought that till yester-
day    his voice trailed off into si-
lence

  oh and now youve found some
one who can speak latin as it was spokea
two thousand years ago

  ive found a man who claims to be
able to hes a janitors assistant at the
larchmont hotel he added
black invocation



  i had no answer for this it looked
as though our present evening was to be
as fruitless as any that had gone before
but having started i decided to see the
thing through

  i met the man-an italian from north
of milan-in an old book store yester-
day afternoon we got to talking and
as it was his afternoon off i asked him
up to my place i showed him the old
parchment sheet with the black magic in-
cantation on it and he was intensely in-
terested it was then that he claimed to
be able to speak latin with its original
natural inflection

  how did he explain that ability i
asked skeptically

  he didnt explain it he simply as-
serted it then he asked if he could take
the parchment back to his basement room
with him he confessed to being inter-
ested in spirit-lore said that this looked
like a genuine treasure and wanted to
examine it more closely i let him bor-
row it this afternoon he called up and
urgently begged me to come and get it
again-he couldnt get away from his
duties long enough to deliver it in per-
son i thought there was a good deal of
nervousness in his voice as though he
was afraid of something

  well i said after we had walked
half a block in silence

  well-dont you see here we have
a supposedly authentic magic phrase that
will make fabulous things materialize
from the other-world or the fifth or
sixth dimension whatever you choose to
call it also here we have a man who
says he can pronounce the phrase correct-
ly-phonetically just as some old necro-
mancer wrote it down-setting up the an-
cient sound-vibration-series that we in our
fumbling mispronunciation of a dead
language were unable to attain all we

have to do now is tie the two together
get the man to speak the phrase in the
precise way that will register on that de-
vice which will open the psychic door
between worlds it might be interesting

   at this point we reached the larchmont
hotel a huge but modestly middle class
resident-hotel building on the fringe of
chicagos gold coast

  bryce walked down a flight of con-
crete stairs and rang a bell the door
before us was promptly opened and we
entered to confront a man who was evi-
dently the one bryce had mentioned

i confess to a slight shock at his ap-
pearance to begin he didnt look
like the type of fellow one would expect
to see in a job that called for physical
strength he was slight of body with
hands that were tapering and artistic
under their coat of grime his hair was
snow-white though he couldnt have been
more than forty-five and his brow and
eyes were those of an intelligent man
with a studious turn of mind his eyes
incidentally were not the liquid brown
usually attributed to italys sons but were
blue-gray as are the eyes of so many ital-
ians born at the foot of the alps and
in those blue-gray eyes-more responsi-
ble for the little shock id felt at sight of
him than was his physical appearance-
were haunting melancholies like the
shadows of far-off fears

  bryce named him as mr abracelli
when he introduced us the man bowed
acknowledgment of the introduction
will you come to my rooms for a mo-
ment he invited us with a polished
manner and an english accent that told
of an excellent education

  we followed him down a corridor
lined with slatted store-rooms and came
to the apartment furnished him by the
hotel


weird tales

  i got a second slight shock when we
stepped inside

  the apartment consisted of a large
living-room a small sleeping-alcove and
a plainly unused kitchenette this living-
room was furnished like a charlatan sor-
cerers studio there was a small crystal
ball in a corner uncovered as though
abracelli had been peering into it when
we rang his bell there was a pile of
aromatic herbs on a scarred end-table a
skull hung by a wire beside the door of
the kitchenette the walls were draped
with black cotton cloth so arranged that
the small windows could be covered if it
was desired to shut out all light a pestle
and mortar of the sort used by pharma-
cists was on another end-table with a
residue in the mortar of some grayish
powder

  i amuse myself sometimes by mild
experiments said abracelli with a de-
precating wave around at his unusual
possessions that was all the explanation
he offered

  he opened a cheap battered trunk and
got out a thick discolored parchment
sheet which i recognized as the one bryce
and i had vainly pored over on the eve-
ning i have mentioned he handled the
thing in a most peculiar way as though
it were so hot that it scorched his fingers
and yet clutching it tightly as if he were
afraid it would explode if he dropped it

  what do you think of it asked
bryce with a deference that showed me
he conceived himself to be speaking to
an expert in parchment antiquities is
it genuine

  abracelli nodded his snow-white head
it is undoubtedly genuine he said
and if it were mine i would throw it
into the furnace

  then you think the incantation
would work

   i peered closely at abracelli curious to
see how much of superstition as i my-
self have always labelled all these things
could find a place in his obviously keen
intellect i saw a quick nervous spasm
contort his face

  i am sure it would work he said
quietly

  have you tried it demanded bryce
dio no there are things in life it
is best to let alone

  would you repeat the incantation for
us

  not for anything on earth signor
said abracelli in a tone of finality

  bryce looked disappointed i had
hoped you would place your remarkable
knowledge of latin at our disposal he
said ill pay you well

no payment could be high enough
but what exactly do you fear de-
manded bryce what sort of creature
or shade do you expect to answer the
invocation

  abracelli shook his head i dont
know something-sufficiently terrible
i will not pronounce it

  then said bryce we will pro-
nounce it ourselves you must teach us
the correct pronunciation

  this too abracelli refused and there
followed a verbal conflict that left me
more and more perplexed bryce plead-
ed with abracelli browbeat him almost
threatened him abracelli stubbornly re-
fused either to repeat the incantation
himself or to teach bryce to enunciate it
in living latin and i as onlooker
didnt know whether to laugh or to be-
come annoyed and leave the superior
behavior of this curious janitors as-
sistant had strongly predisposed me to-
ward him and his almost peasantish fear
-for fear pure and simple had begun
to show on his face-of an absurd latin
black invocation



phrase on a tattered parchment sheet now
disappointed and disgusted me

  i was at the point of suggesting to
bryce that we end the farce and leave
when abracelli surrendered

  very well he said with a sigh i
shall teach you how to say it as the man
who penned it would have said it the
result be on your head i will not stay in
the room while you pronounce the in-
vocation

  i thought i detected an inconsistency
here and promptly jumped on it

  how can you teach us the pronunci-
ation i asked without yourself re-
peating the incantation and calling up-
whatever it is that may respond

  i shall teach you word by word said
abracelli with a quiet dignity that made
me feel for an instant like a boor the
invocation if it is like others i have
known is only effective when intoned as
a whole in a regular syllable-by-syllable
manner

  that sounds like my vibration the-
ory said bryce quickly to me our
other-world neighbors are not summoned
by the wording of the incantation but by
the peculiar combination of sound waves
caused by a particular combination of
vowels and consonants

  i have never heard it explained that
way remarked abracelli with thought-
ful frown but it may be as you say
come-i will teach you how the living
romans spoke their language

i have tried since to remember exactly
the shadings of inflection given the
latin tongue by this man who rightly
or fraudulently claimed to know the
language of living rome but i cant i
can only offer an approximate descrip-
tion there is a vague memory that the
speech as a whole was almost as guttural

as arabic that the us were pronounced
after the french manner of saying mon-
sieur that the bs were enunciated as if
there were an almost audible g before
each and that the vs seemed to have a
hint of w after them thus vwee

  first to give us an idea of how it
went abracelli read all that was de-
cipherable of the fragmentary foreword
   whoso shall utter the formula in a
loud clear tone sound by sound with
equal emphasis on each shall call from
the hidden world about us dread deni-
zens  i must -say that while his
latin sounded like no latin ever heard in
a modern classroom it did sound oddly
authoritative

  from here he passed to the invocation
itself but there he balked for a mo-
ment

  i implore you he began with pro-
found distress showing in his blue-gray
eyes

  you have promised was bryces in-
flexible answer so syllable by syllable
with palpable care to say no two of the
mystic words in proper sequence abra-
celli gave us a model enunciation of the
phrase that was supposed to be a sort of
vibratory bridge between our world and
others and bryce repeated each word
after him till he had his palate reason-
ably adjusted to the unfamiliar sounds

  you can now say it correctly enough
said abracelli but-are you really
going to risk it

  i am replied bryce for several
years ive earnestly sought after proof
that there is some foundation of fact for
the old fables about spirits and ghosts
and demons to date ive got nowhere
but i would still do anything no matter
how ridiculous it seemed on the face of
it if i thought it offered a remote chance
of affording me that proof


weird tales

  this is not a remote chance said
abracelii it is a certainty if you will
excuse me i will go to the boiler room
while you conduct your mad experiment

  and go he did closing the door firmly
behind him i turned to bryce and
laughed the more i thought about how
genuinely frightened at the invocation
the italian had seemed to be the harder
i laughed

  bryce didnt join me and at length i
sobered enough to notice in his dark eyes
a curiously dubious look

  good heavens bryce i exclaimed
you dont mean to tell me you think
anything supernatural or weird will
actually answer to the calling of that
latin formula

  the vibration theory sounds rather
plausible he said lighting a cigarette
and that was all i could get out of him

bryce stepped to the door and locked
it then we fooked around the room
to see if for some unknown reason
abracelli had secreted devices to fool us
the man was admittedly a dabbler in oc-
cult things and no other class of hu-
mans will go to such elaborate lengths to
try to trick others into their own fan-
tastic beliefs we found nothing suspi-
cious-looking however so we prepared
to perform our simple experiment

  we took the thick old parchment sheet
and laid it on the round table that oc-
cupied the center of the room over this
was a shaded light which poured a circle
of illumination on the table top and left
the rest of the room in comparative dim-
ness bryce drew up a chair and i drew
up another but before he started to read
the ancient invocation he hesitated

  youre quite sure you want to go
through with this he asked me solemnly

  of course i replied impatiently

then if you really believe that some
supernatural thing will appear in answer
to that silly invocation-youre alone in
your belief

  bryce shrugged i suppose youre
right in your skepticism he said slowly
 suppose tonight as usual we shall dis-
cover nothing more exciting than hyp-
notic effects or hidden wires

  we gazed at each other an instant over
the ancient sheet of parchment-seated
in that curiously furnished room that was
actually in the bowels of a great modern
building but which figuratively might
well have been the tapestry-draped cav-
ern of some old-time wizard then
bryce began to read the ancient invoca-
tion

  i felt a curious prickling of the skin
as his voice rolled out the gutturally
sonorous syllables in the manner abra-
celli had taught him the queer power
of certain sounds over us the latin
mass-for example how that stirs and
thrills one though one may be utterly
ignorant of the meaning of the separate
words it is the stateliness of the thing
not its meaning that causes every nerve
to thrill in response

  just so did the reading of this old in-
cantation with the pronunciation abra-
celli claimed was that of the mystic
roman who wrote it make the nerve-
ends seem to flutter and twitch in sym-
pathy there was just one difference
while this had all the rolling stateliness
of the mass there were buried in it subtle
shades of obscenity and terror it sound-
ed not unlike it had been designed to be
read in some gloomy huge cathedral
erected not to god but blasphemously to
the devil i daresay though that this
was all imagination on my part

   come from the reaches of the
outer dark and the shades of the other
life to my presence 

                    w t-
black invocation



   syllable by syllable beat by beat like
a beginning pianist playing an exercise
to the tick of a metronome bryce read
up to here at this point he stopped and
stared intently toward a chair in a corner
only dimly lit by the shaded lamp

   i followed his gaze-and a startled ex-
clamation came from my lips

  the chair at which we were staring
with wide incredulous eyes was a pro-
saic easy-chair with a faded tapestry cov-
ering that was drawn up slantwise to the
comer of the room leaving a v-shaped
space behind it it wasnt at the chair we
were gazing though but at something
that dangled down its back

  the something was a huge black paw
not unlike the paw of a bear except that
it had almost human seeming thick fin-
gers tipped with curving talons it was
the paw of a beast with the definite
fingers-and-thumb configuration of some-
thing near-human the whole-paw and
claw-like fingers and thick wrist which
disappeared over the back of the chair
away from us-was covered with mat-
ted coarse black hair

   do you see it too bryce whispered

  i nodded while my scalp felt as
though each separate hair was rising like
the hackles of a frightened dog

   the claw-like bestial hand contracted
slightly ill swear i heard its talons
scratch against the fabric of the tapestry
covering then it was withdrawn slowly
from sight over the back of the chair

  together with muscles tensed for
action we leaped for that chair and
whirled it away from the wall

  there was nothing behind it

  we looked at each other and at the
same second each of us had the same
thought

  abracelli was acting when he pre-
tended to be so frightened i said

    w t-

hypnotism but hes pretty good to in-
duce such a clear picture in both our
minds from a distance

   bryce nodded but he frowned a little
as though not quite convinced

  hypnotism probably he said
well--lets get on with it and see what
new tricks our friend can furnish to mys-
tify us with

we went back to the table and sat
down bryce cleared his throat
this time he declared ill finish it
and he began again to read the invoca-
tion

     come from the reaches of the
outer dark  

  the measured syllables struck at the
brain like the rhythmic beat of a tom-
tom again i felt that odd prickling sen-
sation all over my body

     and the shades of the other
life   

  as further testimony to the power of
what i was still sure was abracellis
hypnotic ability i thought i detected a
faint odor in the room now that hadnt
been there a moment ago a musty ani-
malish smell like that which pervade a
zoo but it was a mere ghost of an odor
nothing definite enough to describe ac-
curately

      to my presence here in the world
of men i command you

  there the reading was done the
supposedly dread invocation had been
hurled as a challenge

  bryce looked up from the parchment
his eyes followed mine to the chair-back
where we had seen or had been hyp-
notized into imagining we had seen the
hairy black paw

  it wasnt there now it had not re-
appeared either in our minds eye or in
actuality we stared around the room


weird tales

nothing we listened intently noth-
ing

  i drew a deep breath in spite of the
assurance of common sense and logic
that nothing could be in that room that
the mumbling of a few syllables in a
dead language could not possibly cause
other presences to materialize i was un-
utterably relieved to find that we really
were alone just as we had been before
the uttering of the invocation

  for a few seconds longer we sat in
silence then bryce sighed and lit a
cigarette

  once more we draw blank he mur-
mured sending a blue doud of smoke to
curl in the beam of light cast by the
lamp and lose itself in the dimness be-
yond i suppose we might as well go
home-good god

  on the table between us had suddenly
appeared the paw it was resting on the
table top palm down as solid-seeming
as the wood itself

  in every detail we could see it the
coarse black hair of a slightly reddish
cast near the roots-the thick nails or
talons curving from the blunt finger-
ends-the folds of grayish money-like
skin at the hairy knuckles

  at the same instant i felt a hot fetid
breath on the back of my neck felt my
chair creak forward as though a heavy
weight had pressed against its back felt
hairy fingers fleetingly touch my shoulder

  for the first time i felt fear numbing
sickening fear this could not-could
not be hypnotically induced illusion i
shouted aloud and leaped from my chair
to stand trembling staring at the space
behind it

  i saw nothing nothing i looked at
the table the paw had disappeared
again

  steady said bryce his own lips
were white steady he stopped

abruptly and his eyes following mine
saw what i was seeing

  just outside the range of clearest light
across the table from us coiled the
thickest wisps of smoke from bryces
cigarette in the still air of the room
these had not been much dissipated but
now they were suddenly being agitated
as though something were moving
through them at the same time some
of the thicker further coils were blotted
from sight to reappear again as if a
body moved before them but our eyes
could still see-nothing

  the agitation of the smoke wisps per-
sisted in a sort of airy trail behind some-
thing that moved around the table and
toward us involuntarily bryce threw up
his hands in a gesture of defense

  the burning ash of his cigarette was
abruptly scattered in a shower of sparks
as though something had struck violently
against it there was an odor of scorched
hair and the air was rent by an ear-
splitting howl

  the black hairy paw again material-
ized before us but this time it was not
still it was clenching and unclenching
clutching savagely toward us and now
slowly as though a cloud of mist were
whirling together more and more tightly
to pack into a definite shape we saw-
the body the paw was attached to

  just a glimpse our horrified eyes had
of a gigantic hairy black shape some-
thing like a man something like a go-
rilla just a glimpse we had of flaming
eyes that were those of neither man nor
beast just a glimpse of a nightmare fig-
ure about to leap

  then as we cowered back the thing
howled once more with fury the electric
lamp was dashed from the table with un-
imaginable violence-and we were in
darkness with the creature

  i felt talons rake across my cheek a
black invocation



great hand closed around my throat and
i was hurled clear across the room i
heard bryce cry out in mortal terror
heard a bedlam of bestial snarling and
howling -and felt a weight on my chest
that i was sure must crush it in then i
lost consciousness

icame to my senses how much later i
do not know to find that my shoul-
ders were being roughly shaken in-
stinctively i raised my hands to protect
myself but when i opened my eyes i
saw-not the hairy terror but bryce
white and trembling bending over me

  i thought you were dead were his
first words my god what a narrow
escape

  where is the-the thing i asked
weakly gazing around the room the
place was in fearful disorder with chairs
knocked about and the table tipped over
and the black cloth ripped from the walls
in a dozen spots but there was no sign
anywhere of the awful hairy paw or of
its even more awful owner

  it has disappeared back to whatever
place it came from said bryce

  i sat up and dabbed at the deep
scratches on my cheek and as con-
sciousness returned more completely to
me reason followed close behind-and
at the things reason intimated i began
to wonder and then to feel very very
sheepish

  i looked speculatively at bryce

  done in i said tricked to a turn
the prize fools of the universe

  bryce stared what do you mean by
that he asked at length

  i mean that we must bow to signor
abracelli he has handled us like chil-
dren we must certainly congratulate
him when he returns from his boiler
room retreat

  bryces heavy eyebrows went up you

think there can be a doubt as to what we

saw

  unfortunately theres no doubt
whatever it must have all been trans-
mitted bodily from abraoellis mind to

ours

  and what we felt demanded
bryce

  was-simply each other in our ex-
citement one of us knocked the lamp
over and in the darkness we fought each
other like a couple of frightened cats
the thing that struck the sparks from
my cigarette

  you knocked your cigarette against
the edge of the table as you raised your
hands yes-a fine pair of fools we
proved ourselves to be

  bryce smiled grimly all these
tilings you claim are quite possible even
plausible but dont patronize our fool-
ishness too much old boy for i have
proof which will satisfy even you that
the thing we saw was no hypnotic illu-
sion it was real enough-here in this
room called into being by the latin in-
cantation

  he raised his right hand i observed
for the first time that he had been keeping
it tightly clenched

  i dont know just when in the strug-
gle i accumulated these souvenirs but
i regained consciousness to find them
safely clutched in my hands they tell
the whole story i think youre still
skeptical youre still unable to believe
what you saw with your own eyes and felt
with your own flesh then-look

  he unclenched his fingers and as i
looked at what he held i felt an abrupt
return of some of the cold horror that
had gripped me before

  in the palm of his hand were several
coarse crinkly black hairs slightly red-
dish at the roots-to which still adhered
flakes of grayish monkey-like skin

ra tale of dark powers unloosed by one who could not bear to see his sweet-
heart consigned to the grave

if i had not counted john thraves
my best friend i should in all like-
lihood never have gone up the mas-
sachusetts coast on that unpleasant and
foreboding journey climaxed by that un-
forgettable visit to the lonely house be-
yond gloucester a strange silence
broken now and then by vague incoher-
ent letters had been the determining fac-
tor in my visit and as i sit here now
writing this i can not help but feel how
much more at ease i would be had i
chosen to disregard this silence how
much better indeed if i had forgotten
my friend altogether but now alas it
is impossible for me ever to forget john
thraves

our acquaintance had begun at col-

a continual source of admiration to me
and i could fully understand his love
for this strangely fascinating woman she
who might have been such a woman as
rossetti would have painted-tall and
slender her features of that fine classic
mold so idealized at the end of the last
century with the pallid olive quality in
complexion and the same smoldering
auburn hair that belonged to the harmony
that was hers i have an unforgettable
picture of her alone in a box at the opera
wrapped in a green velvet cloak her
oddly disquieting face
and auburn hair stand-
ing out serenely in the
glittering of the dia-
mond horseshoe

lege a common interest in architecture
serving to draw us closer and closer to-
gether as the years of our college training
went by the acquaintance ripened into
a friendship that continued for some time
after we were graduated indeed it was
interrupted only by thraves deep love
for dorothea keane a love so profound
so absorbing that it enslaved thraves a
man whose iron will at college had been

     

  it was this woman who drew to her
john thraves body and soul in august
of the same year he met her they were
engaged and in september i saw the last
of thraves and dorothea keane when
my firm sent me to vienna to study i
was still in europe when terrible tragedy
struck at my friend sending him from
new york city to virtual isolation at the
old thraves estate on the massachusetts
coast they were to have been married
at christmas a week before dorothea
contracted a severe cold which speedily
developed into pneumonia resulting in
her death two days before the date set
for the wedding

  her death shattered john thraves life
and his vainly hopeful letters did not de-
ceive me the tragedy was consummated
in a ghastly fashion when the keane fam-

ily vault was opened one night and the
body of the lovely dorothea removed in
its casket though this terrible thing hap-
pened only two days after her burial it
was over a month later before i had
learned of it and only then did i know
the reason for the inexplicable silence on
the part of my friend how great this
added shock must have been to him was
indicated to me by the fact that not once

                                    


weird tales

in subsequent letters did he so much as
hint of it

  from the time that john thraves had
retired to the lonely estate on the hook
beyond gloucester the letters i had from
him were filled with a deep melancholy
and were often extremely brief tense
paradoxical notes all during the follow-
ing spring and summer his letters strange
long epistles became more and more in-
coherent and rambling more often than
not he would start his letters with terse
sentences about the unruly weather that
swept the massachusetts coast then sud-
denly in the middle of a paragraph he
would write incomprehensible nonsense
about life after death or some kindred
subject one paragraph which he started
as customary with a sentence about the
weather contained no less than thirty dif-
ferent subjects ranging all the way from
black magic to certain mystic rites per-
formed in the african impi country

  his references to black magic more
constant than any other reference puz-
zled and disturbed me most the im-
pressions his letters gave varied fully as
much as his subject matter at one time
i had the impression that he was him-
self practising black magic at another
time that he was writing a book on the
subject and at stih another time he wrote
in such shuddering terms of black magic
that i thought for an instant that his mind
had been unsettled

  in september of the following year i
returned to new york fully expecting
that before many weeks were up i should
get an invitation to join my old friend on
the thraves estate but none came the
same incoherent letters continued to reach
me breaking into long periods of silence
until at last i decided that i would seek
him out whether he so desired or not
my first impulse to announce my arrival
i discarded at the last moment a vague

belief that he might try to prevent ot dis-
courage my coming occurring to trouble
me

ileft new york one morning in no-
vember and came into boston at about
six that night it was raining and the
mists were crowding into the city from
the sea i was glad to leave mist-haunted
boston behind me even though the two-
hour ride to gloucester promised me lit-
tle change in scene on the way the
downpour increased the heavy rain so
drenching the panes of my coach that i
could not see an inch out into the autumn
evening i reflected upon how inauspi-
cious a moment i had chosen to visit my
old friend but in the same thought saw
that i should certainly not be turned away
into a night like this should my visit
prove as unwelcome as my ever increasing
forebodings suggested to me

  the station at gloucester was deserted
when my train drew in i stepped down
to the platform and looked about me
the night was dark now and not far
away the sea was dashing itself against
the rocks of the coast the rain still came
down heavily and i pulled my raincoat
closer around me a single light on the
platform showed only a dim haze through
the rain some one finally came along
the platform toward me and i recognized
him for a cab-driver whom thraves and
i had used in our college days his ap-
pearance served only to bring back mem-
ories which time had thrust far into the
past

  where to sir he asked

  he did not recognize me i put down
my bag to the thraves place i said

  you dont want to be goin over there
tonight sir

  yes of course why not

  well he drawled its a bit far on
an unholy night like this
in the left wing



  nonsense i snapped its just
around the end of the hook isnt it

  yes sir but-

  not more than two miles is it

  no sir but-

  well then i said sharply

   tis a bad night sir he started
again but i cut him short

  take me there i said

  he grumbled something but picked up
my bag we started for his car which
became visible now at the end of the
platform i stepped into the back and
pulled the door shut behind me the
driver tossed my bags into the front and
climbed in after them he started up the
engine but before he left the platform
he turned around to me and called as if
in afterthought i cant be takin you
further than the gate sir the road dont
go no further

  very well

  i remembered the thraves estate and
the rides there from gloucester when
we were yet at college john thraves and
i had come up occasionally for a week-
end gloucester on a sunny day is a
charming city with the blue sky above
and the blue sea below disturbed only
by the slightest roll on its surface rip-
pling the reflections of the clouds in
the harbor in the morning can be seen
the thousand masts of the fishing fleet
moving out through the dawn mists and
at sunset moving back in crowding the
bay and in the air always is the strong
salty odor of the sea

  but tonight it was not like that there
was nothing to be seen through the rain
and blackness save only an occasional
glimmer moving in the distance the light
of a vessel in the harbor perhaps we
were out of gloucester before i had seen
more than the dim half-disclosed outlines
of a dozen scattered buildings by the
way the wind blew the rain against the

car i knew that we were moving along
the hook with the ocean on two sides of
us there was nothing out there but
black space and an occasional faint light
and once or twice the raucous voice of
a foghorn far out on the bay

  we came to a stop abruptly and the
driver turned around with here you be
sir seventy-five cents please sir

i paid him and found myself deposited
with my bag on the sandy road be-
fore the gate that marked the edge of
the thraves estate it was a good ten
minutes walk from the gate to the house
i knew and a not too pleasant walk
through what was almost a wood of pines
as black as the night itself i started out
unhesitatingly through the grilled gate
and up the stone path under the trees
the rain still came down and the wind
swept in from the sea bending and sway-
ing the creaking trees the steady pound-
ing of the surf sounding rhythmically
against the rocky point of the hook came
to my ears as from a great distance i
looked ahead of me and thought i saw a
light where the dark mass of the house
loomed but it was faint and dim and it
seemed to waver so that i could not be
sure if it were a real light or an illusion
but as i came closer i saw that it was
indeed a light a light from the lower
windows of the left wing but even close
i saw it dim and faint as if it were the
light of candles burning in the room be-
hind drawn curtains not a definite light
at all but more a blur where the windows
were drawn curtains veiling the house
from the bleak night

  i was now at the very edge of the pine
grove that surrounded the house and i
stood in the shelter of the great gaunt
trunk of the one tree that reared itself
near the door looking at this rambling
old new england country home with its


weird tales

low roofs and many gables feeling an
incomprehensible sense of fear of danger
almost a sensation which seemed to sug-
gest abrupt unexplained flight to me
the wind and the rain the sighing and
creaking of the pines the distant melan-
choly pounding of the sea the old wood-
en house with its single gray light -these
details gave me a feeling of stark and
impenetrable gloom a feeling so strong
that for a moment i hesitated to pierce
the solitude of my old friend thraves
but my hesitation lasted only a moment
and it was gone it was not as easy to
shake off the somber gloominess which
enshrouded me

  unhesitating i approached the door
put my hand ofl the great iron knocker
lifted it and let it drop there came to
my ears the sharp sound made by iron
striking iron and immediately after muf-
fled reverberations within the house
sounded extraordinarily loud in a sudden
lull in the wind then the sound died
and there was again only the rain the
wind and the constant sea

  once more i lifted the knocker and let
it fall and again i heard the sound of
iron and the magnified sounds from
within the house still there was no sign
that my knock had been heard

  i turned and looked back into the pine
grove at the dim line i knew to be the
path by which i had come should i
start the long walk back to gloucester
and await the coming day to find my
friend but that was a good half-hours
walk in the rain and already i was
chilled to the bone wet and shivering
the pine trees sobbed in the wind and in
a sudden gust the rain came beating
down into my upturned face

  i turned to the shadowed doer once
more determined to try the knocker yet
again i had just lifted my hand when
the door was pulled silently back and a

man stood there holding aloft a gutter-
ing candle

  who is it asked a gruff voice which
i recognized at once as that of fenton
the caretaker at least i thought thraves
is not alone in this dismal house

  its mr suthard park suthard i
replied do you remember me fenton

  a sound like a startled gasp came from
fenton he raised the candle above his
head and stepped aside come in come
in mr suthard he said almost eagerly

  i put down my bag in the hall and
turned to him is your master here i
asked

  he nodded his white head slowly
yes hes here then he held the can-
dle close to my face and peered at me
over his spectacles a smile broke into
his wrinkled face a face which my in-
stinct told me had not smiled for many
months well well mr suthard it is
he said still smiling crookedly im
glad

  he led the way slowly down the ball
mumbling more to himself than to me
 glad youve come when you came
up with the young master you were al-
ways one to be laughing and joking and
carrying on as young folk should per-
haps now mr thraves    perhaps you
can make him laugh again

  i said nothing wrong is there fen-
ton

  he stopped and looked at me specu-
latively then he shook his head would
i say wrong i wonder he murmured
hes not been the same sir he went
on a bit queer sir it was after that
young lady-

  i nodded cutting him off with a word
could i see him tonight i asked

  fenton hesitated hes in the left
wing sir and im not allowed in there
ill try to call him though he does not
like to be disturbed but then he does
in the left wing



spend most of his time in there and i
can do no more than try sir

fenton shook his head mumbling to
himself he led the way through
open doors into what had been the draw-
ing-room the candle light betrayed the
strange state of neglect into which the
once grand old room had fallen as i
crossed the threshold the broken end of
a gossamer thread caught my face the
absence of electricity struck me suddenly
i had expected fenton to switch on the
lights as we entered the room but he had
not done so

  dont you have any lights i asked

  fenton shook his head no sir they
were blown out in a storm about a month
ago and mr thraves wont have them
repaired

  wont have them repaired i ex-
claimed

  i keep telling him fenton said
then he shrugged his shoulders but
he wont have anything done wont
have any one here prying about he says
its not any longer for me to say sir

  fenton busied himself now with my
bag took my hat and coat and then lit
some wood that lay in the open fireplace
in a few moments the slowjy creeping
flames had grown into a blae but the
added light from the flames made the
old drawing-room only more gloomy for
it showed still more clearly the heavy
dust that lay thickly on all the furniture
the walls the rugs and the unbroken
spider webs that were spun across the
windows and in the darkened comers of
the room

  fenton pulled a chair up to the fire-
place brushed it off with his handker-
chief and offered it to me i sat down
rubbing my hands together trying to stop
my chattering teeth

  ill try to get mr thraves for you
now sir he said

  i nodded he walked out into the
hall and then i heard a door close be-
hind him shortly after i heard his voice
calling john thraves it was as he had
said-he was not allowed in the left
wing and was forced to tall his master
from the old-fashioned double doors
leading into the wing

  i leaned toward the already dying
flames for almost a half-hour i sat
there the silence of the house growing
on me more steadily each moment fen-
tons voice had long ceased calling but
he had not returned and i did not know
whether he had been able to gain john
thraves attention until i heard a door
open suddenly and the sound of slip-
pered feet coming slowly along the hall
i turned expectantly toward the door of
the room

it is impossible to describe adequately
the appearance of my friend as he
stood in that doorway his face lit by the
last dancing light of the dying fire im-
possible to convey fully the shock i felt
at sight of him i had left him not much
over a year ago as i had always known
him erect dark-haired his face healthily
tanned his eyes bright his lips firm the
figure i now beheld was everything that
the john thraves i had known was not
he was clad in a long black robe that
swept the floor it was open at the throat
and its scarlet lining served only to height-
en the grayness of his face his pallid
ghostly cheeks his gleaming feverish
eyes his colorless lips drooping loosely
and revoltingly his hair was long and
unkempt and there was a stubble on his
chin sufficiently thick to be called a beard
a mustache too had grown his thin
shoulders and his back were bent for-
ward giving him the posture of an old
man burdened with years i felt his
burning eyes sweep me from head to foot
the smile with which i had awaited him


weird tales

died on my lips i could not speak he
came toward me slowly walking like an
old man shuffling along dragging his
slippered feet after him

  then he spoke his low-pitched voice
was the tense voice of a man ill of some
incurable disease you have come he
said

   i smiled trying to shake off the strange
premonitory feeling that had come over
me how are you john i asked ris-
ing he was looking at me vaguely un-
seeingly dispassionately i finally de-
cided i had to come to know how you
were

  he smiled a little then raised a thin
hand and brushed back the long hair
from his forehead i am glad he said
simply only i dont know where to put
you weve got nothing in order here

my studies- his voice trailed off

into nothingness and he looked abstract-
edly around him his hand straying to his
neck where the open robe revealed his
dead-white skin then he turned abrupt-
ly calling fenton fenton

  fenton appeared out of the hall it
was as if he had been waiting yes sir
he said you called sir

  is there a room in order for mr
suthard

  fenton hesitated then he said any
of the upper rooms in the left wing can
be made ready in a few minutes sir

  thraves passed his thin hands through
his hair his eyes were undecided only
in the left wing he asked irritably

  fenton nodded yes sir

  very well take the bag up build a
fire and lay out the linen but mind you
go up the front way and leave us a light
here

  yes sir murmured fenton he lit
a taper and stood it on the mantel then
he bent to take my bag and shot a guarded
look at me his expression said you

see how he has changed then he went
out of the room and i heard him going
slowly up the stairs at the end of the hall

  thraves turned to me a year now
he said abruptly

  i nodded over i said looking at
him i began to wish i hadnt come

  he peered at me intently for a moment
then his eyes shifted and he looked at the
last glowing embers in the fireplace i
have been ill he said making a vague
gesture with his hands then he sat
down and we spoke briefly of my
european year at odd moments there
were gleams of our old intimacy yet never
was our conversation free from the feel-
ing of a wall between us often thraves
face betrayed a preoccupation which was
not natural to him then suddenly he
interrupted himself in the middle of a
sentence just as he had done so often in
his letters and said did i write to you
of black magic did i write you of my
work

  i said you did say something about
black magic but i have forgotten what
it was

  he nodded quickly an interesting
study black magic he would have
gone on but something interrupted him
he sat bolt upright all his faculties strain-
ing to listen a sharp exclamation checked
on his lips is there something he
asked do you hear anything did you
hear-

  i had heard a shuffling noise during
a lull in the storm but had assumed it to
be fenton no i said i heard noth-
ing-

  he was reassured at once then he
went on where he had broken off long
ago i was interested in black magic there
were old books i came upon an inter-
esting theory about life after death and
it is believed by some to be still in prac-
tical use
in the left wing



  i thought he is rambling i said i
remember you wrote me of it

  he looked slightly puzzled did i
i cant remember he looked at me a
little askance but you dont believe in
black magic do you suthard

  i shook my head no i dont

  he clasped his hands and looked at
me you know he went on there is
a theory about the animation of dead
bodies-embalmed bodies that is but
lord god there is no soul his eyes as
he said this were so tragic that i felt for
a moment that john thraves had gone
utterly mad

  i got to my feet feigning a yawn id
like to get to bed if you dont mind old
man i said

  the words had hardly left my lips
when fenton entered the room again i
had the uncomfortable impression that
he had been waiting in the hall

thraves led the way up the stairs to
my room we went into the cham-
ber he still leading with the candle which
he placed on the bureau others were
burning in brackets on the walls so that
the room was quite light

  i threw open the casement window
despite the wind and rain for there was
a musty odor of age in the room that
stifled and revolted me thraves did not
seem to mind for he went over and
leaned out then he sank listlessly into
a chair with his back to the window

  if you hear anything in the night
suthard dont be alarmed he said and
dont prowl about please because that
disturbs me very much sometimes i walk
in my sleep if i should see any one then
the shock might be too much for me my
heart is very bad

  sympathetic words sprang quickly to
my lips but he halted them with a curt
gesture im sorry i murmured

  thraves got up and went slowly to the
door i didnt want to tell you he
said but i dare not take a risk at the
door he turned to me you dont be-
lieve in black magic do you suthard
he asked as if he had forgotten asking
me before

  i shook my head

  i didnt ask you before did i he
said suddenly and before i could answer
continued no no of course not he
closed the door behind him

  my astonishment knew no bounds
certainly something had occurred in the
interval since dorothea keanes death to
unsettle john thraves mind when
finally i had managed to subdue my agi-
tation i looked about the room it was
panelled with a dark wood and the ceil-
ing was low the casement was in a
gable the floor of which was raised above
the level of the floor of the room i
went to the window and looked out the
rain had abated somewhat though the
wind was still strong there was the
dark sea and the white foam of the waves
as they broke boomingly on the shore
was visible from where i stood once
more i felt the heavy atmosphere of this
place bearing me down and again the
haggard appearance of john thraves sud-
denly remembered depressed me further
there was something evil here some-
thing brooding in the air about the house
and john i felt knew and recognized
it for what it was

  i moved away from the window and
went to the door i pulled the door open
slowly held my candle high and peered
into the long shadowy hall it was an
action with no motive and i would have
withdrawn into my room in an instant
had not a small white object on the floor
of the hall slightly down and across from
my door attracted my attention with
pardonable curiosity i stepped swiftly


weird tales

forward and picked it up taking it with
me into my room what i held in my
hand brought all my senses instantly
alert and at the same moment perplexed
and astonished me it was a womans
silk stocking and it had been worn only
once and that recently

  i do not remember my chaotic thoughts
clearly but i do remember that one
stood out above them all was the cause
of thraves strangeness a woman of
whose existence i had not the slightest
hint fenton would know i thought and
i moved at once to summon him but
i paused with my hand on the bell rope
even while i thought that the clang of the
bell might disturb thraves i saw that
the rope had been cut a foot from the
floor

  as i stood there the stocking still held
in my hand the sound of slow-moving
footsteps came to my ears i listened
carefully they seemed to come from be-
low from the hall on the first floor of
the left wing but fenton had told me
that no one was allowed in the left wing
-perhaps it was thraves still moving
about yes as i remembered it now
thraves old room had been in the left
wing at the end of the hall the foot-
steps came in all likelihood from him

  i retired to the great oak bed at last
and was just in the realm of semi-con-
sciousness which precedes sleep when a
new sound smote upon my ears disturb-
ing the rhythmic pounding of the sea in
the distance it was the sound of even
chanting and what it suggested was so
utterly remote from my surroundings
that i raised myself on my elbow to lis-
ten it was indeed the sound of low
chanting coming faint as if from a great
distance yet i felt that it came from be-
low perhaps from the cellars below the
old house i had little time for specula-
tion however for the rhythm of the

chanting the even beating of the waves
outside and the weariness which crept
over me lulled me to sleep to a sleep
which was broken by vague unnamable
dreams of horror and dread which
brought me relief only at its end when
i woke in the dawn of a new day to find
the gray rain still falling the wind still
blowing through the dark pines on the
shore

in the day thraves tensity of expres-
sion and preoccupation were notice-
ably lessened and at odd moments he
was even somewhat garrulous though
garrulity fitted him ill in the morning
we walked out to the point that stretched
like a finger into the sea and from there
looked across the bay to the ship-filled
harbor the rain still blew down in
sheets whipping across the face of the
sea but that morning it was invigorating
to stand under its force and i lifted my
face to its cool rush in a vain attempt to
clear my mind of the vague doubts and
questions that clouded it john wished to
go back to the house and indeed i saw
that he was in no physical condition to
withstand a storm of such vehemence
reluctantly i went back to the dark neg-
lected house

  later that morning i mentioned to
john the walking i had heard below me
during the night but he waved it aside
no no park surely not i went di-
rectly to bed

  i said im sure i heard footsteps and
some one i think singing

  he started but recovered almost at
once you must have been dreaming
he replied i remember that i got a
book to read myself to sleep with he
added but there was certainly no other
sound he looked at me sharply watch-
ing my expression i said nothing though
i could hardly contain myself i had
wanted to ask about the womans stock-
in the left wing



ing i had found but i was glad now that
i had asked first about the sounds from
below but i meant to ask fenton if i
could find him

  i did see him twice but only once to
speak to and then i had time only for
a brief question tell me fenton is
there a woman in this house somewhere
his face remained impassive but he
said i am never allowed in the left
wing sir

  he was gone again before i realized
that he had not answered my question
that he had indeed deliberately hedged
i did not attempt to follow him to pur-
sue my inquiry further because thraves
was making an attempt to keep me with
him

  as the day wore on it became steadily
more apparent to me that i was not a
welcome guest that my presence was dis-
tinctly not desired at dinner that night
thraves after some preliminary remarks
about the persistence of the wet weather
turned suddenly to me and said ive
put a book in your room with some
marked passages that i want you to read
park

  i said i was about to ask you for
something to read tonight

  he lapsed into silence and shortly
after i excused myself pleading weari-
ness he demurred a little but finally
assented to my going he was obviously
glad that i was going to bed

as i left the dining-room the first
l distant rumblings of an approach-
ing thunderstorm echoed across the bay
i found the book on the counterpane of
my bed i took it up and found that it
was a very old book in latin a glance at
a few lines told me instantly that it was
a book on black magic i leafed through
it hoping to find the passages thraves
had said he had marked

  the first of these passages was nothing

more than a rambling discourse on the
actuality of black magic and numerous
contemporary cases of sorcery were cited
to bolster up the writers thesis the
second concerned a florentine case of
body-snatching and was vaguely suggest-
ive of magical rites the fact that this
was marked convinced me of an idea i
had long before accepted-the loss of
dorothea keanes body had upset my old
friends mind rather than her actual
death

  i put the book aside for a moment to
get up and close the window through
which great gusts of rain were blowing
for the storm had reached the hook and
thunderous crashes now sounded and re-
sounded the waves too were booming
against the coast with ever growing ve-
hemence and the vivid flashes of light-
ning reflected on the walls of my room
despite the light from many candles

  it was when i returned to my book
after this brief pause that i came upon the
third and longest of the passages marked
i found myself at once interested and
read as eagerly as my none too thorough
knowledge of latin allowed me to at
best it was laborious reading the body
does not die when the soul departs the
passage read and it is given to such as
we are to preserve ourselves if we desire
by magical means others too can be
preserved by us but this is dangerous
for it is then our living energy that ani-
mates the dead for animation can be
brought about but the soul is gone for
ever remember this and be not too
urgent in matters such as these a body
must not be a week old and yet it should

be-- here came a group of words

which my limited knowledge could not
enable me to translate i read on beyond
there are in the aether other souls evil
souls which may take possession of the
animate bodies and drain the life from


weird tales

those near the task is fraught with ut-
most terror and danger   

  for some time as i read there grew
upon me the feeling that some subtle
change had come over the room i looked
up and sensed it immediately there
was an odor of burning incense an un-
mistakable odor which seemed to drift
toward me from under the door to the
hall

  i rose silently and opened the door
the scent in the hall was considerably
stronger as i stood there in the partly
opened doorway there came intermittent-
ly to my ears above the noise of the storm
outside the same chanting which i had
heard the night before and again the
sound of shuffling footsteps in the hall
below and then-another sound-a
weird gibbering noise in a voice that was
not john thraves it rose in a long un-
canny wail and died again a shrill petu-
lant cry like the scream of a marmoset
i stood frozen for just as certainly as
that cry did not come from john thraves
it came from the throat of a woman

  i withdrew abruptly into my room for
a moment i stood in perplexity then i put
my candle down and went again into the
dark hall i crept quietly toward the back
stairs from the floor below up which the
heavy scent of the incense came on the
stairs the sounds from below were louder
more clearly defined i hesitated remem-
bering suddenly that thraves had said
to fenton on the night of my arrival
mind you go up the front way and
recalling that i had been kept carefully
away from the lower floor of the left
wing

  then i went forward again creeping
slowly along the shadowy hall below
came gradually into sight from the door
of thraves room there came a wavering
shifting light like the light of many can-
dles and as i stood there looking down-

ward i heard once more that weird gib-
bering scream breaking into the sound
of thraves voice which was chanting
clearly in latin i moved forward toward
the half-open door

  though the chanting was clear now i
could not always distinguish the words
uttered by john thraves deep voice tense
with passion and meaning at intervals
i heard low murmurings sudden petu-
lant cries in what was unquestionably a
womans voice then abruptly there came
a shrill cry and a sound as of some heavy
object falling and again the chanting
coming as if in great sobs

   i bent stealthily forward to look into
the room and in that instant two things
happened-the elements singled out that
accursed house striking it with a bolt of
lightning and a sheet of flame shot into
the room into which i was looking-and
one instant before this happened i saw
into that room

how i got out of the house i do not
know i have a vague recollection
of staggering down the long passage in
the left wing calling wildly to john
thraves and coming to myself at last
outside with the rain beating down upon
me fenton at my side the house before
me a great holocaust of flame john
thraves was nowhere to be seen and
fenton was running to and fro calling
in a quavering voice to his master

  i have tried since then to look back
upon the whole affair dispassionately but
i can not do it i have tried to forget the
terrible evidence so unwittingly chron-
icled in the newspapers a few days after
telling of the discovery of charred bones
from two bodies in the ruins of the old
thraves house two bodies one of which
was undeniably a womans i am happy
because of one thing-those ghastly
books those ancient volumes on black
magic were destroyed in the holocaust
in the left wing

l

  it is i think the terrible memory of
what i saw in that room that will not let
me rest the memory that haunts me day
and night it is doubly horrible this
memory in the light of what had gone
before that sight into john thraves ac-
cursed room i remember always more
sharply thraves wild letters his vague
and incoherent allusions to black magic
and death after life and that damnable
chapter on the animation of the dead in
that old book he had put into my room
the fear-haunted face of john thraves
his gaunt wasted body his sad eyes his
pathetic mouth he in that long black
scarlet-lined robe-this memory of him
obsesses me always suggesting so strong-
ly a terrible line in the book now forever

lost there are in the aether other souls
evil souls which may take possession of
the animate bodies and drain the life
from those near

  but that is the least if it were only
that and not that other memory for as
i looked into that incense-clouded room
i saw john thraves prostrate on the floor
his lips mumbling the low chanting i had
heard prostrate before a living breathing
creature a hellish form draped in green
limned against the black walls its auburn
hair flaming in the candlelight an ac-
cursed living thing from the furthermost
reaches of most evil cosmos a creature
with the form and face of the lovely
dorothea keane

his thing i wish

             by alfred i tooke

         this thing i wish when death shall come for me

          i would be buried neath a spreading tree

         i would not have my body coffin-bound

          in simple shroud let it be lightly wound

          and cradled gently for its last long sleep

         where twining roots a kindly vigil keep

         perchance the body that was mine shall be

          in time a part of that far-spreading tree

          where birds to sing or build their nests will come

         and bees amidst the nodding flowers will hum

         where summer zephyrs sweetly whispering low

         at play amongst the leaves will come and go

         where lowing cattle wandering up the glade

         will pause a moment in the welcome shade

         this thing alone i ask when life is spent

          cradle me so and i shall be content

 iren of the snakes

by arlton eadie

a multitude of creeping things came out of the dark forest in a wave of hideous
gliding death-a thrill-tale of india

c ttive for ever o protector of the
 j poor salaam o favored of al-
lah art thou not ray father and
my mother

  one does not need to be long in com-
mand of a gurkha battalion occupying
a frontier fort before discovering that
when a himalayan hillman starts address-
ing you in this strain he intends to ask
you to do him a favor knowing that in
the absence of the assistant commissioner
i was expected by the powers that be to
act as judge law-giver policeman and
general adviser to all and sundry i re-
signed myself to the inevitable and sum-
moned the gurkha havildar to act as
interpreter this man ramzan mar by
name possessed the gift of tongues in no
small degree there was not a hill-dialect
throughout the whole of hindu-koh of
which he did not have at least a working
knowledge he possessed another gift
which in a native is even more rare and
precious-that of brevity he ruthlessly
divested the narrative of all those endless
repetitions and flowers of speech so dear
to the native heart and presented me with
the gist as follows

  the man was a messenger from a tiny
village situated among the foot-hills
about six miles to the east and had come
before the sahibs face to solicit aid in
putting a stop to the depredations of
some denizen of the surrounding jungles

  i can assure you that i grew interested
when ramzans translation reached this
point one of the compensations of
being quartered amid the somewhat

     

desolate mountains which form the north-
ern bulwarks of hindustan is that they
contain hunting-grounds which may be
classed among the finest in the world
ibex burrel gazelles chamois and ante-
lopes abound nor are the more formid-
able ferae naturae lacking with patience
-and luck-one might get a shot at a
leopard or prowling tiger and i at once
surmised that it was some such animal
that was causing the trouble but it
turned out i was wrong

  it is not a tiger sahib ramzan
translated after the man had replied to
my question he says it is a gigantic
python

  a python-a man-eating python
i cried in amazement my interest now
at fever-heat many were the stories i
had heard of the terrible power possessed
by these huge reptiles which although
lacking the poison-fangs common to the
majority of indian snakes are neverthe-
less as much dreaded as any viper or
cobra they rely upon their immense
power of muscular contraction to over-
come their prey encircling the victim in
their deadly folds and crushing it to a
pulp before swallowing it whole but i
had certainly never heard of an instance
where one had deliberately attacked a
village and i made no secret of the fact
that i was somewhat skeptical

  when ramzan translated my doubts
to the man they evoked a perfect torrent
of protestations accompanied by abun-
dant excited gestures

                    w t-
the siren of the snakes



  whats he getting annoyed about
i inquired

  he says it is no ordinary snake
fdhib the gurkha answered it is
a fiend-a devil-a beast of satan-into
which the spirit of some long-dead witch
has entered nobody in the village is
safe from it at first it attacked only
the goats and sheep but now it lies in
wait among the terraced rice-fields and
springs upon the women as they work

it enters the very huts it-

   w t-

  that will do i interrupted as i
rose to my feet and made my way toward
the quarters occupied by my second in
command

  gordon meldreuth was in years but
litde more than a boy having been
drafted to the regiment when he passed
out of sandhurst a couple of years pre-
viously he was a handsome likable
young fellow and having many tastes in
common we had got on remarkably well
together he was as keen oo big-gae


weird tales

hunting as i was myself and his face lit
up with pleasure when i explained the
situation to him

  of course i shall be only too pleased
to come with you sir he cried his eyes
roaming round the trophies of the chase
with which his room was decorated from
the leopardskin beneath his feet to the
magnificent markhor horns above the
mantelpiece i should like to add a
sizable python to the list of my con-
quests

  returning to the orderly-room i was
able to send the messenger away happy
with the assurance that on the morrow
the two english sahibs would allah will-
ing effectually rid his village of the terror
which beset it

ramzan mar accompanied us when
 we rode down the winding road
from the fort at daybreak the following
morning starting thus early in order to
get the business over before the heat of
the day began

  the nepalese mountaineers from
whom the gurkha regiments are recruit-
ed bear the well-deserved reputation of
being as good shikarees as they are sol-
diers-which is saying a good deal for
their abilities in the hunting line-and
ramzan was no exception to the rule he
was a grave taciturn man short in stat-
ure as are all his race and his squat
brown features would have undoubtedly
failed to win any but a consolation prize
at a beauty show but he was a perfect
cragsman an excellent stalker and an
adept in woodcraft generally being as
active and wary as a wildcat on our
arrival at the village he at once set about
commandeering the services of all the
able-bodied inhabitants to assist as beaters
in the chase

  one of the villagers who had been out
early gathering wild honey had seen the

python lying in a deep nullah or gorge
with high precipitous banks partly
clothed in long nurkal-gtass so our
forces were at once marshaled for the
drive in the manner which ramzan
thought best while the small army of
beaters was proceeding to the head of
the nullah meldreuth and i set off on
foot to take up a position on a rocky
promontory at the farther end overlook-
ing a spot where the python would have
to pass scarcely had we arrived there
when there broke out a hideous chorus
of whoops yells and whistles as the beat-
ers dashed into the other end of the
gorge like a pack of fox-hounds i well
knew however that this ostentatious dis-
play of zeal resulted more from the pre-
vailing idea that the greater row each
man made the less chance there would
be of the python coming near him than
from any eagerness in the pursuit

  nearer and nearer came the din until
it sounded but a hundred yards or so
from where we crouched with ready
rifles then it became apparent that
ramzans woodcraft was not at fault
the reed-like nurkal-grass round the edge
of the little rocky clearing below was
gently parted and through it emerged
the flat wicked-looking head of the
python

  hold thy fire sahib whispered
ramzan who had appeared as silently
as a ghost behind us wait till he is
well out in the open

  i nodded my head to show that i heard
his advice and my finger took the first
pressure on the trigger as the reptile
began to emerge it was in no hurry
however in spite of the uproar behind it
an age seemed to pass before the entire
length of its body became visible but
when it was fully revealed i could not
help a slight gasp of astonishment es-
caping me
the siren of the snakes



  never in the whole course of my
indian experience had i even so much as
heard tell of such a gigantic creature
the girth of the largest part of its body
must have been at least three feet and its
length at least thirty by those who
frave only seen a python in a cage at the
zoological societys gardens or a stuffed
specimen in a museum it may perhaps
be thought that the mosaic-like markings
of brilliant orange brown and blade
would render it a conspicuous enough
object but actually the very reverse is
the case as the creature wound its sinu-
ous way among the small boulders and
dumps of sun-dried grass it harmonized
admirably with the color of its surround-
ings those seemingly conspicuous black
stripes so nearly resembled the shadows
cast by the stones and grass-stems that
had the python remained motionless it
would have been extremely difficult to
detect its presence

  but i had little time in which to ad-
mire this example of natures protective
coloring the python was now in the
center of the little dearing-it seemed
almost impossible to miss j took careful
aim along the sights and gently squeezed
the final pressure on my trigger at the
same moment gordon meldreuth fired

  that python seemed to bear a charmed
life i saw the flash of my explosive bul-
let as it impinged on the rocks a few
inches from the creatures head mel-
dreuth was using solid but the sharp
thud of bis bullet on the stones instead
of the unmistakable dull plop which it
makes on striking flesh told the same
tale of an inglorious miss

  ne luggai missed him whispered
ramzan in a tone of bitter disappoint-
ment then-quick sahib shoot again
before he is out of sight

  oace more our rifles spoke but by
this time the now thoroughly alarmed

reptile had so changed its position that
the sun was shining directly into our
eyes making accurate sighting difficult
whether it was due to this fact or to the
feelings of exasperation at our first bun-
gling i know not the only thing i am
certain of is that so far as injuring the
python was concerned we might have
been merely pelting him with pebbles
fortunately for the chase however his
progress was now over fairly open
ground so that we could catch an occa-
sional glimpse of his body as it wowd
in and out amid the boulders he seemed
to be making directly toward a spot on
the left bank of the nullah where the
sheer limestone diff rose in a kind of
natural dome at the base of which-in
spite of our efforts to head him off-he
at length disappeared

  shah ash bravo cried ramzan
pointing to the numerous well-defined
tracks among the beaten grass showing
the trails were frequently used we
have him now sahib this is his lair

  as usual the shikaree wasted but little
time in words drawing his kookerie-
that heavy curved knife which is a
characteristic part of the gurkhas equip-
ment and which they are in the habit
of using as much for domestic as for
fighting purposes-he at once set to work
hacking away the undergrowth around
the place where the python had gone to
earth presently he paused in his tajk
and beckoned me to approach

one glance was suffident to show me
that the place where the python had
taken ref uge was no natural fissure in the
rock the entrance was an arched door-
way richly decorated with native sculp-
tures the weather-worn appearance of
which seemed to indicate an extreme an-
tiquity immediately above the lintel was
a large statue whidb at first giance i


weird tales

thought was supposed to represent a mer-
maid closer inspection however con-
vinced me that i was looking upon an
idol of a hindoo goddess naga-kanya
the snake princess who half snake half
woman is still worshipped by thousands
of devotees

  why this must be one of those old
cave-temples dedicated to the snake-god-
dess of which i have heard so much
cried gordon meldreuth adding with a
laugh well mister python has certainly
sought sanctuary in an appropriate spot

  i noticed ramzans eyes narrow sud-
denly at the words as befits a true son
of the prophet he was accustomed to
profess a supreme contempt for every
brand of superstition not orthodox to
his own faith although later on i had
cause to suspect that he was not so in-
different to the gods of the hindoos as he
affected to be but the villagers them-
selves made no secret of their feelings
they hung back gathering into knots
and talking eagerly in low awed tones
occasionally casting terrified glances at
the statue over the cave-door it was
clear that the fact of the python seeking
refuge in the temple of naga-kanya
presented itself as no mere coincidence to
their superstitious minds

  by this time the brushwood was
entirely cleared away from the entrance
and ramzan sheathed his kookerie and
looked inquiringly at me

  now i do not mind admitting that
had i been alone i should have given up
the hunt there and then for the prospect
of seeking the python in its lair sent a
tingling sensation down my spine merely
to think of it but i knew that the eyes
of the whole crowd were upon me watch-
ing for the least sign of funk in the
english sahib there was nothing for it
therefore but to unsling my rifle and
make toward the cave with such outward

appearance of determination as i could

assume

   the interior of the place was lit by a
dim half-light which filtered through a
creeper-grown aperture high up in one of
the walls pausing a few seconds to
allow my eyes to grow accustomed to the
semi-obscurity i advanced step by step
my rifle held ready in my hands search-
ing the shadows on either side for some
sign of the python i breathed more freely
when i had arrived opposite the gap
through which the light entered for here
one could at least see the surrounding
objects with tolerable distinctness and
here to my unbounded surprize i per-
ceived evidence that at some period or
other the cavern must have been occupied
by a human being a kind of rude couch
of skins stood in one corner together
with a few earthenware vessels of primi-
tive manufacture

   i had however but little time in which
to take in the full significance of these
details for at that moment i became
aware of two small points of light shin-
ing amid the inky blackness of the farther
end of the cavern they were the eyes
of the python intently watching my every
movement

for perhaps a full minute i stood
stock-still gazing at those two specks
of greenish fire then-it may have been
my imagination or merely the natural
effect of the straining of my own eyes in
the darkness but it seemed as if those
bright watching eyes were getting larger
-nearer-that the python was silently
writhing its way toward me as i stood

  who has not heard of the hypnotic
effect of a snakes direct gaze many
were the accounts i had heard of that
strange uncanny power-heard and dis-
believed-but at that moment i was on
the point of receiving positive and practi-
the siren of the snakes



cal proof of the matter i felt a sense
of mental numbness stealing over me
all danger seemed to be forgotten in a
dreamy speculation as to what would
happen next all power of making effort
seemed to be paralyzed it appeared
that there was no other course open to
me but to wait there silent motionless
for the inevitable

  then some flicker of my fast-expiring
consciousness warned me of the peril
in which i stood-that unless i roused
myself and threw off the fatal lethargy
i was lost blindly mechanically-al-
most i may say unconsciously-i raised
my rifle and let drive with both barrels

   fortunately the distance which separated
us was so short that a miss was impos-
sible the two points of fire were ex-
tinguished as though they had been
snuffed out by an invisible hand and the
next instant the cave was filled with the
violent contortions of the reptiles coils
in their last death-throes

  scarcely had the smoke from the dou-
ble discharge cleared away when i saw
another pair of eyes gleaming from the
opposite corner heavens had i pen-
etrated into a perfect nest of pythons

  even as the thought crossed my mind
i was conscious of something brushing
across my cheek whether it was some
large moth or dark-loving bat disturbed
by the noise of my shots i did not pause
to consider without even waiting to
reload my rfle i turned tail and-well
let us call it retreated with all speed
two of them cried gordon mel-
dreuth when i had explained what had
happened

  i nodded i have accounted for one
and the other is coming out now
listen he interrupted

  a slight vague noise was approaching
toward the mouth of the cavern and
something appeared indistinctly in the

gloom in a flash meldreuth had thrown
his rifle to his shoulder

  hold cried ramzan mar suddenly
knocking up his weapon so that it ex-
ploded harmlessly in the air that is
no python sahib

  the shikarees quick sense of hearing
had not deceived him a second later
to our unbounded amazement there ad-
vanced into the sunlight a young girl
slight graceful and well-formed

  so unexpected was her appearance that
for a space in which one might count a
hundred nobody moved or spoke we
stood-the beaters ramzan meldreuth
and myself-like men suddenly frozen
into stone staring at the girl as she slow-
ly advanced toward us

  she was not a native-or if she were
she belonged to a caste with which i was
unacquainted her skin was as light as
any europeans and her features framed
in masses of waving black hair flowing
loose on her shoulders were of an almost
classical regularity in their flawless
perfection they resembled more the ideal
sculptures of ancient greece than a crea-
ture of flesh and blood her tall supple
form was draped in the folds of a strange
iridescent garment formed i subsequent-
ly noted out of the semi-transparent cast
skins of snakes and over her rounded
bosom there fell a long necklace com-
posed of the threaded teeth of the same
reptile

  as we stood there amazed and won-
dering there came a yell of terror from
the beaters and with one accord they
took to their heels shouting out some
unintelligible gibberish as they disap-
peared in the jungle

  what are the fools shouting about
meldreuth asked impatiently addressing
ramzan mar  v

  they say that this maiden is naga
kanya the goddess of the snakes-she


weird tales

who crushes the life out of mortal men
with her embrace or poisons them with
her kiss o sahib the gurkha answered
although the man endeavored to infuse
into his reply some of his customary con-
tempt i could see by the expression on
his usually impassive face that his mind
was not entirely at ease

  but gordon meldreuth only laughed
aloud

  the fools fear that she will crush
them in her embrace do they he cried
his eyes fixed on the graceful figure be-
fore him then he laughed again well
one might die a far less pleasant death
than that

  they were words spoken light-heart-
edly and in jest words which were prob-
ably forgotten by him almost as soon as
they had left his lips but they were
words which in the light of after-events
were destined to remain inscribed on my
mind with letters of fire like a warning
written by the prophetic finger of fate

ight-an indian night

  not the windless stifling night
of the plains which seems but a brief
spell of heat-laden darkness between two
baking days but a night amid the upper
slopes of the himalayas where the wind
cooled oyer miles of glaciers fills the
lungs with its icyexhilarating breath

  the moon had just topped the crests of
the distant crags rising along the ridge
of eternal snow and was lighting up such
a sublimely grand prospect of fell forest
and flood as could hardly be surpassed
the world over our fori was set on a
broad jutting spur of rock commanding
the pass below on either side the
mountains rose in rugged precipices
rocky amphitheaters and gigantic but-
tresses toward the naked peaks which
stood out in grand yet awful magnificence
against the silvery sky glaciers lay in
the hollows between some of the higher

spur while broad fields of virgin sow
filled the head of the main valley to the
right so near that the wind drifted the
spray across the angles of the narrow
winding path leading up to the gate of
the fort there fell from above a foaming
torrent which roaring sullenly below
filled the valley with its deep never-
ending resonance farther down the
steep mountainsides were dark with vast
tracks of somber-hued deodar forests rent
here and there by long lines of uprooted
and splintered trees masses or earth-
soiled snow and debris marking the course
of avalanches which had swept from the
towering heights above

  such was the prospect spread out before
me as i leaned over the stone parapet of
the fort smoking and musing over the
events of the day we had returned to
the fort about nightfall the mysterious
girl accompanying us i had been de-
sirous of leaving her at the village in the
foot-hills but when we called there on
our way back the inhabitants resolutely
refused to allow her to enter finally
backing up their refusal with volleys of
stones and curses

  take the snake-witch from our doors

o	sahib they had shouted are we
weary of our lives that we should give
shelter to naga-kanya the daughter of
death and destruction take her hence

o	sahib or we will surely slay her

  after that there was no alternative but
to lodge her in the foist until i could have
her sent under escort down the rotaag
pass to sultanpur where she would be
in safe and kindly hands at the mission-
home

  who was this girl where did she
come from by what train of extraor-
dinary circumstances had she been enabled
to enter unharmed into that python-
haunted temple of the snake-goddess
meldreuth and i had discussed these
the siren of the snakes



questions over dinner without arriving at
any satisfactory solution nor could the
gurkha sergeant ramzan mar enlighten
us he had questioned her in every one
of the hill dialects without eliciting the
least sign of understanding as to the
language which she herself spoke ram-
zan emphatically called upon allah and
the prophet to witness that he had never
before heard it spoken one word she
had repeated many times vasantasena
at the same time pointing to herself this
we assumed was her name for when we
uttered the strange sibilant syllables she
would nod and smile as though pleased
at the same time i noted that her smiles
were sunniest when it was the young and
handsome gordon meldreuth who spoke
her name she seemed to attach herself
to him as a matter of course for such a
grizzled old veteran as myself she had
scarcely a second glance

a quick step on the concrete flagging
of the courtyard roused me from my
revery it was gordon meldreuth as
he came toward me carrying his topee
in his hand as though to let the cool night
breeze play on his uncovered head the
moonlight fell full upon his face maybe
the cold white rays deceived my eyes but
it seemed to me as if his features were as
colorless as marble and that his usually
bright eyes were dull and troubled

  ive warned the men who are to form
the escort tomorrow sir he reported
when do they parade

  at daybreak i answered we
at least owe it to the girl to get her as
soon as possible to a place where she will
be well looked after by sympathetic per-
sons of her own sex then it may be
discovered who she is and where she
comes from

  yes meldreuth said after a long
pause perhaps it will be best poor
vasantasena

  i half turned and under pretense of
knocking the ash from my cigar flashed
a quick look into the young officers face
there had been such a wealth of wistful
tenderness in his voice as he uttered the
sibilant accents of her strange name-a
name which somehow vaguely suggested
the hissing of a snake-that the suspicion
which had been forming in my mind for
the past few hours now flashed into sud-
den certainty my impressionable young
subaltern had fallen in love with this
jungle girl

  yes i repeated this time in a tone
of grim conviction it certainly is best
that she should leave here

  if he noticed the irony of my utterance
he gave no sign for awhile he remained
silently gazing at the distant moonlit
peaks then he passed his hand wearily
across his forehead and laughed un-
steadily

  im not subject to nerves sir as you
know-he spoke with that constrained
awkwardness of a man imparting a con-
fidence of which he is half ashamed-
but tonight i have an unaccountable
foreboding of coming calamity if we
were on the verge of a big push i could
understand the feeling but all is quiet
on the frontier-yet death seems to hover
in the very air

  i was now staring at the man in genu-
ine astonishment had i not seen him
dozens of times under heavy fire and had
i not known him for one of the coolest
officers under my command i should have
thought he was suffering from funk-
which was absurd yet here he was
talking about forebodings like any
nervous schoolgirl he must have guessed
what was passing in my mind for

  i know it sounds like so much abso-
lute rot sir he said with a laughing
shrug but the feeling is there all the
same i wouldnt have spoken of it only


weird tales

weve been something more to each other
than niece messroom acquaintances and-
if anything should happen to me-i want
you to look after-again his voice grew
softer as he uttered the name-yasan-
tasena

   of course ill do my best for the girl
i rejoined somewhat impatiently but
what is likely to happen to you the hill

tribes are quiet what danger-

  hullo whats up with the sentry
meldreuth broke in suddenly with the
words as he pointed to the gurkha on
guard the man had come to a halt at
the farther angle of the parapet and
although he had not challenged was look-
ing intently at something directly below
in a moment we had hurried to his side
what is it sentry i asked

the man straightened up came to the
slope and saluted before he an-
swered

  a snake sahib there-on the path
below and there is another-and
another by allah every snake in the
mountains hath come at the call of that
accursed witch-girl

  extraordinary as the assertion sounded
it certainly seemed as if it were true the
rays of the full moon lit up the landscape
below until it appeared like a model
carved in shimmering silver by its
light almost as clear as day we beheld a
terrifying sight from the dark forests of
deodar-cedar from the boulders lining
the zigzag path to the fort from the
thickets of grass and reeds bordering the
rushing stream - from every scrap of
cover it seemed-there emerged an ever-
increasing multitude of creeping things

  huge pythons hooded cobras slender
whip-snakes deadly puff-adders-every
poisonous and loathsome thing that crawls
was there-all forming one wave of
hideous gliding death-all converging to

the path which led up to the fort in which
we stood

  guard    turn out bugler sound
fall in

  meldreuth rapped out the orders smart-
ly there was no hint of nervousness
about him now in spite of his recent talk
about premonitions here in the face of
actual danger he was ice-cool

  machine-gunners-to your emplace-
ments    rifles line the parapet
bombers make ready    point-blank
range-independent firing take your
own time men and let em have it hot
rapid    load

  for one brief second there sounded the
faint metallic clicking as the cartridge-
clips were pressed into the magazines
and the breech-bolts thrust home the
next instant the peaceful stillness of the
valley gave place to a pandemonium of
hell the fort had only two small guns
belonging to a mule battery but what we
lacked in artillery was amply made up
for in small arms and bombs the quick
rattle of the rifles the sustained whirring
of the machine-guns the sharp bark of
the little nine-pounders the dull thudding
explosions of the mills bombs-all com-
bined to make up a devils harmony diffi-
cult indeed to surpass

  such was the mass of reptiles wedged
in the gorge below that every shot must
have told but their numbers seemed
endless as fast as one rank of the mass
was blown into writhing fragments
another advanced to take its place the
little white path was now blade with the
reptiles living and dead but in spite of
the appalling hail of lead showered upon
it that nightmare host crept nearer and
ever nearer to the gate of the fort

  steady men keep cool and fire low
gunners concentrate on the head of the
column

  and so the conflict went on and a more
the siren of the snakes



fierce or fantastic one was never waged on
this planet-and probably never will be
sahib-meldreuth sahib

  so engrossed had i been in the scene
before me that i had all this time scarcely
given a thought to the girl vasantasena
but as these words fell on my ear uttered
in a soft whisper the memory of the
strange circumstances under which we had
found her rushed back to my mind i
remembered the superstitious awe in
which the natives held her-her dress of
pythons skins-her home in the den-
and the horde of snakes which now beset
us small wonder was it that my brain
was in a confused whirl as i turned round
at the sound of her voice speaking for
the first time intelligible words

the jungle girl was standing immedi-
ately in the rear of the firing-line
her hair was unloosened flowing about
her breast and shoulders and showing up
their gleaming whiteness against its raven
hue her eyes were shining with excite-
ment her lips parted in a smile-it
seemed of triumph her lissom form was
swaying undulating like some graceful
palm shaken in the wind-or like some
serpent about to strike   

  meldreuth sahib again she uttered
his name and yet again meldreuth

   i saw the boy turn and for a space look
into her deep compelling eyes standing
like a man fascinated-entranced then
he took a step forward and caught the
swaying figure in his arms

  there is no danger- he began

but his voice died away and a look of
wonder came into his face for her slen-
der white arms had enfolded themselves
about his neck her lithe body pressed
close to his nearer and nearer came the
two faces-the boys flushed half puz-
zled the girls pale coldly triumphant-
her eyes never for an instant quitting

his-until at last their lips were pressed
together in a lingering passionate kiss

  fbismallah the snakes are at the
gate

  the frenzied shout from the parapet
caused me to turn my eyes it was true
about the one slender barrier which stood
between the teeming horde and ourselves
there was piled a mass of reptiles-i heard
the timbers creak and groan beneath their
weight bombs were useless now-they
would only serve to blow in our own de-
fenses i shouted the order for the rifles
to take up their position on the towers
flanking the gate and began to lead the
way but i had not taken a couple of
strides before a terrible cry coming from
behind caused me to stop dead

  gordon meldreuth was still on the
same spot where i had last seen him but
instead of being in the embrace of vasan-
tasena he was now struggling in the coils
of an immense python

  heaven alone knows by what means it
had gained access to the fort nor was
there time even to consider such a mat-
ter with the rapidity of a whirling whip-
lash the rest of the creatures body
wrapped itself round his legs throwing
him to the ground

  even in the brief second that i stood
fumbling with the flap of my revolver-
holster i saw the terrible coils contract
and heard the sound-such as i never
wish to hear again-as the bone-crushing
pressure was exerted

   revolver in hand i dashed forward

  but ramzan mar was readier than i
he appeared as if by magic by the side of
the pair in that devils embrace and
raised his rifle until it almost touched the
reptiles head then came a sudden flash
of fire-a sharp report-and the hideous
head disappeared-blown into space by
the near discharge

  snatching a kookerie from the belt of


weird tales

the nearest man i assisted ramzan in
hacking asunder the still palpitating coils
of the python until at last we had poor
meldreuth free but one glance into his
face was enough to tell me that he was
doomed

  for a few seconds i stood half dazed
looking down at the pitiful wreck of what
a few minutes before had been a man full
of life and the desire to live then a
sudden thought came to me

  where is vasantasena i asked of
ramzan

  there o sahib the man answered
pointing with his reddened blade to the
faintly moving fragments of the python

  there i repeated aghast as the sin-
ister import of his words came home to
me there are you mad havildar

  ramzan shrugged grimly

  at least she is not within the fort
sahib he declared

  you talk like a child-not a man i
cried roughly trying to fight down the
ghastly conviction which was taking hold
of my mind if the girl is not here she

must have contrived to lower herself over
the wall of the fort and so escape

  the grim old shikaree did not answer
at once instead he stooped slowly and
raised from the ground some tattered
fragments of snakeskin such as composed
the dress of vasantasena stooping
again he disentangled a string of blood-
stained objects-the necklace which she
was accustomed to wear-and held it
aloft

  the snake-girl changed back into her
natural form even as she held the captain-
sahib in her arms he asserted solemnly
of a truth sahib she was indeed-naga-
kanya the queen of all the snakes that
is why they attacked the fort her sub-
jects came at her command-and at her
death they depart look sahib

  the gurkha pointed over the parapet
as he spoke

  not a living creature remained in the
pass below but at the farther end of the
gorge toward the foot-hills and jungles of
the plains a dark undulating mass was
slowly fading out of sight

rairieaters

by frank belknap long jr

a shuddery tale about the dead men who sat in the boat and a weird horror

  from four-dimensional space

stephen williamson anthro-
pologist and archeologist stood at
the rail of the morning star and
watched the dim gray shape of the
long boat shed its hazy indistinctness as
the sun penetrated the fog and threw
ruddy curlicues athwart the gleaming
gunwales from where williamson was
standing the occupants of the boat were

distinctly visible they sat immobile in
grotesque attitudes and when william-
son hailed them they made no response
williamson craned forward over the rail
studying them intently out of bloodshot
eyes then suddenly his body went
tense and a cold horror descended upon
him he turned abruptly cupping his
hands and shouted out a frantic warning
the braust-eaters

i

they came for thomas last night but they
not take all of him he is sifting
before mg as i write

   vt  ii

csy ivj

to the first mate who was standing rather
nonchalantly amidships with his hands
thrust deep into his trousers pocket
keep away from her ease her off

for gods sake-

  whats that the mate strode to
the rail and glanced anxiously over the
side but from where he was standing
the boat was not visible he was obliged
to repeat his query to williamson who
occupied for the moment the position
of ships guardian below in his cabin
the captain was raving impotently his
brain unhinged by liquor and fever
what did you say steve

  i said-stay clear of her

  why

   cholera i think anyhow its awful
a death-trap keep clear of her

  in a moment the mate was by stephens
side staring with horror at the boat and

its contents it was drifting aimlessly ip
a long swell its rudder askew and trail-
ing sea-moss its oarlocks sodden with
caked salt and a darker more disturbing
ingredient that looked from a distance
like caked blood the mate gripped wil-
liamsons arm theyve been dead for
weeks   he muttered hoarsely  every man
of em theyre nothin more than skel-
etons he spat to conceal his emotion
every man of em god steve-

  look there williamson had raised
his arm and was pointing excitedly at the
tallest of the seven skeletons

  the mate grew dizzy with horror a
choking gurgling sound issued from his
throat and his hand tightened on his
companions acm till the latter cried out
in shrill pjrotest steady jim then
after a pause it was cannibalism noth-
ing else but i can understand it jim if
i

weird tales

the poor devils were insane crazed-

  but his head the mate protested hys-
terically they couldnt eat that why
did they cut off his head

  the headless man sat bolt upright in
the boat he was clothed in stained gray
trousers of woolen texture and a coarse
seamans shirt of alternating black and
white stripes open to the waist his feet
were bare and sun-scorched one arm
severed at the wrist dangled forlornly
from beside the oarlocks rising and fall-
ing with the slow oily swell the other
was outstretched as though it had been
endeavoring at the instant of death to
ward off the attack of something malign
and unspeakable on several parts of the
hairy exposed chest were dark and omi-
nous stains the muscles of the torso
stood out so rigidly in the half-light that
they were discernible at a distance of
fifty feet

  but despite his mutilations and imper-
fections the headless man was easily the
most commanding figure in the boat the
other occupants were pitiable in the ex-
treme they sprawled against the gun-
wales in attitudes of abject despair-mere
husks of flabby skin over protruding
bones with skull-like faces and rigid im-
mobile arms the sea had had its way
with them they were not merely dead
they were beginning slowly to blacken
and shrivel and putrefy

  it isnt cholera said stephen grimly

  the mate nodded youre right i
guess his voice sounded hollow and
unfamiliar even to his own ears the
strangeness of its timbre appalled him
he glanced almost hysterically at his
companion how he wondered could
the man remain so cool he had hitherto
been so emotional so easily upset yet
now somehow the scientist in him was
rising to the occasion was astonishing
the mate by his assurance and poise

  we may as well lower a boat said

stephen decisively i want to know
precisely what happened its utterly
ghastly but ive got to know

thirty minutes later a decidedly ill
scientist crossed the deck of the
morning star in a strangely indirect fash-
ion crossed the deck in a semi-daze and
gripped the rail till his knuckles showed
white for a moment he stood watching
a portuguese man-of-war scudding over
the oily sea his gaze remaining riveted
on the weirdly beautiful polyp till it dis-
appeared in the purple haze fringing the
horizon then abruptly he wheeled and
met the inquisitorial scrutiny of the mate
well

  i told harris to put-sew sheets on
the bodies said stephen in a cold and
lifeless voice the least we can do is
give them a decent burial

  the mate shivered i hope we can
get it over with soon a crew of dead
men dont suit my fancy if the captain
should see em-in his condition you
know it wouldnt be pleasant i told
simpson to keep watch on the old man
im more concerned about the crew
said stephen slowly theyve been whis-
pering and muttering ever since we
brought the bodies aboard frightened
blue i guess i dont know as i blame
them if they could see this diary-
stephen tapped his pocket significantly-
they might-run amuck to tell you
the truth jim its got me frightened i
dont know what to think

  the mate moistened his lips with the
tip of his tongue its crazy gibberish
steve he muttered they went through
hell apparently and its my guess this
fellow henderson cracked up under the
strain bein an officer and a gentleman
-well any one could see he was only a
frightened kid i dont think i ever saw
a mans face so drawn and despairful-
lookin
the brain-eaters



  stephen removed a weather-stained
memorandum book from his pocket and
began nervously to finger the pages
there are things here jim he said
that you cant argue away descriptions
details im convinced those men en-
countered something appalling no
thirst-crazed lunatic could have been so
devilishly inhumanly logical hender-
son remained courageously cool-headed
to the very last this entry shows what
stuff the kid was made of

  stephen had opened the book and as
the mate stared silently down into the
almost motionless sea he began slowly
to read

hey want our brains last night
one of them got in touch with me
it laid its cool face against my forehead
and spoke to me i could understand
everything it said a terrible death
awaits us if we do not obey them implic-
itly they want thomas we are to
make no attempt to thwart or resist them
when they come for him

  later-they came for thomas last
night they did not take all of him he
is sitting before me now i can see his
broad shoulders and back as i write they
are limned very terribly against the glare
of the sunset and they obtrude with a
terrible vividness his presence is a per-
petual horror but we dare not throw him
overboard they would not approve

  i am perfectly sane the horror has
not dulled in any way my perception of
the visible realities about me i know
that i am adrift in the pacific fifty miles
perhaps off the coast of salvador and
that i am compelled to endure the pres-
ence of a headless corpse and five cow-
ardly fools who gibber and moan like
baboons merely because they lack guts
and havent sufficient water my own
stoicism bewilders and amazes me why
is it that my hand does not tremble as i

write that i can remain so observant so
calm it may be that i have lost all capac-
ity to suffer we have passed into a
strange world-an alien and utterly in-
comprehensible world which makes the
fears and agonies of common life seem
curiously impersonal and remote

  we have abandoned all hope of a
possible rescue nothing can save us
from them it is amazing how complete-
ly i have resigned myself to the inevita-
ble three days ago we were as confident
as the devil why we actually jested
when the mary obrien went down red
taylor called it a natty dive she went
down bow first it was an enormously
impressive spectacle the water about
her was a white maelstrom for fully five
minutes

    its only a few miles to the coast i
told them and weve enough water to
last a fortnight well row in relays

  they are aquat and slimy with long
gelatinous arms and hideous bat-like
faces but i have reason to suspect they
can change their form at will for hours
our ears were assailed by a horrible mad-
dening droning and then-we saw them
we saw them glistening in the moon-
light all about us the sea was carpeted
with their luminous malignant faces
there was nothing we could do we
were helpless-stunned

  they are not animals they are in-
dued with a cold unearthly intelligence
we have drifted into strange waters
our compass revolves so maddeningly
that it is useless as a guide i have a
theory - incredible fantastic - which
would account for all that has occurred
but i dare not confide it to the others
they would not understand they are
convinced even now that the things are
fantastic fishes they do not know that
i have communicated with them they
did not see me last night when i left the
boat and went with them into the abyss


weird tales

they were deceived by die presence of
my physical body which remained with
them in the boat they did not suspect
that i had descended into the dark cold
abyss

  they were strangely reticent they
merely confided to me that they wanted
thomas brain they feed it seems on
human brains and of all our brains
thomas is the most finely organized it
is compact imaginative sensitive he is
a semi-illiterate a b s but his brain
is first-rate what interests them primar-
ily is not so much the culture or cultiva-
tion which a brain has acquired but sim-
ply its naked intelligence they experi-
ence strange vivid new emotions and
sensations when they feed on unspoiled
human brains but they do not really
eat our brains rather they suck absorb
diem they wrap themselves tightly
about human heads and suck out the con-
tents of the cranium through the eyes
and nostrils

  they do not always carry away the
heads which they desire to use in this
fashion occasionally they merely ex-
tract the brain while the victim is asleep
in such cases the poor wretch is certain
to awake a raving maniac sightless-
and a maniac the other way is more
merciful i am glad that they severed
thomas head and took it away the
presence of his body is a horror and a
madness-but it is reassuring to know
that he has ceased to suffer the men
are showing the effects of the torture
brett has been whimpering pitifully for
hours and lang is as helpless as an in-
fant they want to throw thomas body
into the sea but i wont give my consent

  they live at the bottom of the sea
and are not a part of our familiar world
they inhabit another dimension by
some ghastly and inexplicable mischance
we have passed into another dimension
of space we have passed into an exten-

sion of the three-dimensional world the
existence of these creatures confirms the
wildest speculations of theosophists and
mystics who have persistently maintained
that man is not the only intelligent in-
habitant of the globe-that there are
other worlds impinging on ours above
the familiar seas of the world are imposed
other invisible seas inhabited by strange
and hideous shapes utterly unlike any-
thing with which we are familiar there
is not one pacific ocean merely occupy-
ing the same space in another dimension
are invisible pacifics inhabited by strange
shapes with hidden maleyolent powers
we have unaccountably sailed into one
of these invisible worlds we have
passed from the coast of salvador to die
seacoast of an alien world

  it is a very terrible world its deni-
zens are more malignant than vampires
they raven on the brains of lost travellers
from the three-dimensional pacific

  i had fallen asleep from sheer ex-
haustion when they came for me and
compelled me to follow them down
through die blue depths to their strange
blue-litten city on the seas floor

  my body remained in the boat but
my brain was with them at the bottom
of the sea they can separate the brain
temporarily from the body without any
physical sundering they were careful
to explain to me why i should not share
the fate of thomas they need me i
have been enjoined to guard thomas
body-to keep the others from throwing
it into the sea

  another ship has passed into this
strange and hideous world on it there
is a brain which they covet-an extraor-
dinary brain-the brain of a scientist and
poet they desire to absorb it and they
desire to absorb it while it is aflame with
curiosity and maddened by fright when
they can absorb a highly evolved brain
that is keyed up to a pitch of wild ex-
the brain-eaters



citement they experience the most intense
ecstasy and rapture so peculiarly are
they constituted that they are capable of
deriving the most piercing pleasure from
highly evolved highly inflamed cerebral
tissue in our world rare or alien mani-
festations of energy like radium cosmic
rays and things of that kind react most
violently on terrestrial organisms and it
is very conceivable that in this other
world animal tissue-especially such
highly evolved tissue as one finds in
human brains-reacts with a similar in-
tensity upon the alien body-substances of
these creatures

  the scientist-the man who is com-
ing-has a brain which excites them im-
measurably they are determined to
frighten and inflame it and they think
that if its possessor encounters thomas
sitting upright in the boat headless and
ghastly it will become a rare delicacy
and afford them the most exquisite rap-
ture they have asked me to help them
and i dare not refuse but i can at least
record what i know and suspect in this
book and if he is not a blind fool he will
strive to escape

   i fear though that he is lost-hope-
lessly and irremediably lost

  like us he has in some mysterious
way passed into another world the ship
which bears him has been drawn-sucked
into some great vacuum or vent in three-
dimensional space and is now in an ut-
terly alien world a black and abysmal
world nothing on earth can save him
his naked intelligence perhaps-but
nothing on earth the brain-eaters will
not spare him

  they will fasten upon his skull and
drain it dry his eyes will be drawn from
their sockets and his brain will melt and
dissolve like tallow in the sun their
moist dark mouths-

   am very ill the ocean about me

is carpeted with leering malignant faces
the others see them too brett is cring-
ing and whining and foaming at the
mouth like an epileptic and adams has
collapsed against the gunwale blood
is trickling from his nose and his eyes
are drawn inward his face is a mask-
a corpse-mask there is nothing we can
do or say we sit lifelessly by the oars
and stare at thomas ghastly body which
has become a mockery a menace i have
resigned all hope-

williamson closed the book and
glanced anxiously at the man be-
side him wouldnt you say jim that
there was something behind it

  jim looked exceedingly ill i dont
know its all so very queer-uncanny
if theres any truth in it its your brain
theyre after

  williamson nodded ill tell you
what im going to do jim im going
to sleep on deck tonight ill bring up
my cot and sleep here ill feel safer
somehow on deck

  the mate lowered his head id do
that he said simply

  it was after midnight when william-
son awoke and sat up the moonlight
lay in bright luminous stripes on his cot
and the wet planks of the deck the
lifeboats stood out boldly in the silver
light and from where he lay three huge
water-barrels and a great pile of tarred
rope were plainly visible at first wil-
liamson saw only these dim familiar
shapes the water-barrels the rope the
lifeboats swaying reassuringly in the
wind then slowly he became aware
of something dark and cumbersome
something opaque that obscured his vis-
ion and concealed a portion of the second
barrel something that made a pie-shaped
dent in the pile of cordage he rubbed
his eyes slowly at first then violently


weird tales

hysterically a dark shape was clinging
to the heavy netting above his bed

  for a moment he stared at it in stark
bewilderment then a great horror came
upon him and he shrank back against
the pillows it was clinging to the netting
and moving backward and forward like
a great slow-moving beetle it was a
moving blot concealing the stars-a fetid
dark blot against the spectral moon

  nausea welled up within him he
started to rise and then suddenly grew
sick with terror incalculable the strength
ebbed from his limbs and his mind re-
fused to function he lay supine upon
the coarse sheets too stricken to move or
cry out the thing was slowly changing
its shape it was assuming a more defi-
nite contour was waxing more malignant
and agile stephens eyes followed it
helplessly as it moved up and down the
netting ifcwas acquiring sight it was
acquiring the loathsome capacity to re-
turn his atare two luminous spots
glowed malevolently down at him from
its crawling bulk

  it was globular and wet from its
dark sac-like body dependedeight squirm-
ing tentacles or were they limbs it was
impossible to be certain they were so
maddeningly weaving and indistinct at
one moment swelling in girth and then
becoming so incredibly wire-like that they
seemed to merge with the mesh of the
netting which sustained them but that
the arms ended in thin claw-like hands
he did not for a moment doubt the
hands were too constantly visible too
patently sinister they fumbled with the
netting as though seeking to draw it
apart

  he managed somehow to rise upon
his elbows to extend invitingly his ex-
posed throat it was not death he feared
it was the torture the suspense he could
no longer bear to look into the horrors

eyes he had endured with agonized
fortitude the sight of its drooling hat-
like mouth and the odor of putrefaction
the sea-stench which surged from it and
even the fetid flesbless hands with their
long luminous fingers had not incited
him to complete surrender but its eyes
held a threat which could not be evaded
or endured he did not want them to
come any closer if the hands broke
through and the eyes came closer-

  it was better to surrender unreservedly
to the hands so he raised himself on
his elbow and bared his throat it was 
full minute before he perceived that he
had been mistaken and that the hands
were not seeking his throat

  they were busily engaged in recover-
ing from the wet deck a large round ob-
ject of disturbingly familiar appearance
the thing had evidently been compelled
to lay this object down for a moment in
order to facilitate its ascent to the netting
above williamsons bed and it was now
intent on recovering its gruesome trophy
slowly deliberately it raised the object
in its terribly thin arms caressing and
fondling it holding it very close for a
moment to its moist and bulbous mouth
and in that same instant a hideous dron-
ing that was like the thrum of huge
engines in some vast and reverberant
power-plant smote menacingly on wil-
liamsons ear it was not the droning
however which drove williamson shriek-
ing from the bed and across the deck in
a straight dash toward the rail it was
something much more unendurable than
any sound on earth

  it was the sight of a face blue-cheeked
and tortured with matted red beard and
white pupilless eyes-a face distraught
yet immobile-a face that grimaced and
glowered and yet remained strangely
alarmingly impassive-the face of a dead
man the face of a corpse there were
dark stains above the temples and the

                    w t-
the brain-eaters



matted hair and beard were clotted with
blood the head was neckless-unat-
tached it seemed to float upon the air
in reality however it was being held
very firmly in the terribly thin arms of
something that wanted williamsons
brain that wanted to do to williamson
what it had done to the object it was so
proudly exhibiting it was displaying the
object unashamedly to williamson be-
cause it wanted to terrify him-to appall
and terrify him utterly it wanted to
drive williamson mad with fright so
that it could fasten on his inflamed brain
and drain it dry

the mate standing unsteadily upon
the bridge was alive to william-
sons peril he had watched the scientist
awake from a troubled sleep and had
seen the dark shape moving backward
and forward above the latters head he
had also observed with an actual physical
retching the round dark object on the
deck before the horror had reclaimed it
he was an imaginative man and his
brain at that moment was as agitated
as the one which the horror coveted but
a mighty wave of fury against the thing
that had come up from the sea blotted
the fright from his mind the barrel
of the rifle in his hand glowed like a long
blue taper in the moonlight slowly
with an almost hysterical deliberation he
raised the weapon to his shoulder and
took aim

  the horror screeched twice shrilly as
the bullet plowed through its dark body
it fell from the netting twisted itself into
a ball and rolled diagonally toward the
scuppers as it passed over the deck it
left a thin blue trail of phosphorescent
slime on the wet planks williamson
turned from the rail against which he
had been clinging and raised a stricken
face toward the bridge its no use
w t-

he shrieked too many of them all
about the ship im going

  he started to climb upon the rail and
then suddenly his foot slipped and he
went down with a thud when he raised
himself again to a sitting posture he was
holding something dark and round be-
tween his hands and gibbering insanely
no top to it no top at all he
screamed the brain-pans gone all
sucked dry-nothing inside oh my
god

  two strong hands descended upon the
mates shoulders and abruptly ruthlessly
he was pushed aside a tall form in wet
glistening slicker took his place upon the
bridge the mates eyes widened bewil-
deringly captain sayers he muttered

captain sayers-

  but the captain ignored him he was
shouting out commands at the top of his
bursting lungs put every stitch on her
he shouted jump lively there

  part of the crew had emerged from the
hatches and were running rapidly back-
ward and forward in response to the cap-
tains orders after a moment he turned
to the gasping mate well get out of
this do as i say and well get out of
this i know whats happened were
in the wrong dimension i was in it once
before-years ago nothing to fear-if
youll do as i say i know how to steer
her five tacks to the right a twist to
the left and well be out of it i know
ive been in touch with them for years
im psychic

  mad groaned the mate stark
raving mad

  the captain had left the mates side
and was running frantically toward the
wheel keep them at it he shouted
over his shoulder tell them to square
away cant put too much sail on her
cant put too much-do you hear

  the mate nodded worth tryin he
muttered to himself follow him im-


weird tales

plicitly nothin to lose hes in touch
with em maybe crazy people are
psychic they know things we dont
he raised his voice for gods sake
men be quick do as the captain says
its our only chance

  there ensued a race with destruction
the great ship hove to and trembled
ominously every sail on her taut with
the breeze while from the ocean there
arose a screeching and a droning such as
no sane man could endure with fortitude
the mate felt his reason tottering even
as the reason of the captain had departed
even as the mind of poor williamson
had succumbed-poor williamson who
squatted hopelessly on the deck his right
hand supporting a horror of horrors and
his face a distorted mask in the spectral
light

  but eventually they won through the
ship under the captains guidance veered
strangely on the dark waters it veered
about and rose on a mountainous swell
and even as the captain shouted orders
into the attentive ear of the frightened
helmsman the droning and screeching di-
minished in volume one by one the
hideous luminous faces faded from the
luminous seas the wind went down and
the ship floated serenely on a three-
dimensional ocean

four hours later the sun came up over
the coastal hills and flooded the ocean
with a saffron light williamson serene
and at peace stood silently by the rail and
gazed with gratitude at the prone form
of captain sayers the captain lay asleep
on the bed which the scientist had va-
cated on the previous night under cir-
cumstances which the mate could not bear
to recall but williamson was the cour-
ageous one now he dared to recall them
he gripped the mates arm and smiled
wanly

  im glad you decided to obey the cap-

tain he said nothing else could have
saved us it was an heroic decision the
captain knew i am convinced men whom
the world calls insane-sick people luna-
tics-are often en rapport with the invisi-
ble the hidden the fourth dimension is
an open book to them they see things
which are hidden from us and the cap-
tain knew

  the mate nodded im glad that they
didnt take your brain old fellow its too
valuable an instrument aside -he added
with an ironic smile-aside from friend-
ship im glad you can go on with your
work now you can get all that dope on
the mayas you missed last trip

  ill not write about the mayas said
stephen decisively ive much more im-
portant information to convey my next
book will deal with-with them

  the mate scowled no one will be-
lieve you

  perhaps not but im determined to
put that horror on paper some one some-
where may read it and understand
the mate shook his head youll
lose caste your scientific friends will
gibe and jeer at you

  stephens face set in grim lines let
them jeer he muttered the knowl-
edge that im in the right will sustain
me he drew himself up god but
it was a great experience it nearly did
for me but i know now that the world
isnt the pretty little affair weve always
thought it out beyond are whetters of
cosmic appetites ive a cosmic appetite
jim i like to venture and explore per-
haps some day theyll get my brain but

in the meantime-

  the mate smiled sympathetically i
can guess how it is he said there aint
any sailor this side of the horn wouldnt
understand youre always hankerin for
what lies just around the comer

  or on the dark side of the moon

her mother her family physician doctor
samuel trowbridge and trowbridges ec-
centric associate the french physician-de-
tective doctor jules de grandin the

little frenchman discovered traces of a
yellow powder which he explained to
trowbridge was bulda-gwai the little
death used by the natives of the french
congo to produce temporary paralysis
alice he declared had been abducted
while the wedding party was rendered
unconscious by bulala-gwai

appearance was connected with a girdle
of tanned human skin that alice had
worn the girl told him that the belt
was known as the luck of the humes
and had been in the family a long time

  he found a concealed document in the
family bible written by alices ancestor
david hume and relating how he had
been sold as a slave to the devil-worship-
ping yezidees had rescued the daughter
of their chief from becoming the bride
of satan had married her and later
brought her to america

  despite a sentence in the old manu-
script warning humes descendants that
an attempt might some time be made to
bring home one of the daughters of
his line alices mother refused to admit
any connection between the yezidees leg-
end and her daughters disappearance
but that very night mrs hume was found
murdered by a strangling-cord in her own
boudoir

  de grandin joined by inspector ren-
ouard of the french secret service and
baron ingraham known as hiji of
the british secret service raid the devil-
worshippers during a performance of the
infamous black mass rescue alice hume
kill one of the priests of the cult and
capture another 

	reunion

iooking very charming and demure in
j a suit of jules de grandins lavender
pajamas and his violet-sik dressing-gown
alice hume lay upon the chaise-lounge
in the bedroom toying with a grapefruit
and poached egg if youd send for
mother please she told us id feel so
much better you see-her voice shook
slightly and a look of horror flickered in
her eyes-you see there are some things
i want to tell her-some advice id like to
get-before you let john see me and-
why whats the matter she put the

breakfast tray upon the tabouret and
looked at us in quick concern mother
-theres nothing wrong is there shes

not ill oh-

  my child de grandin answered soft-
ly your dear mother never will again be
ill you shall see her certainly but not
until gods great tomorrow dawns she

  not-not dead the word was
formed rather than spoken by the girls
pale lips

  the little frenchman nodded slowly
  when how

  the night you-you went away ma
pauvre it was murder

  murder slowly unbelievingly she
repeated but that cant be whod
want to murder my poor mother

  de grandins voice was level almost
toneless the same unconscionable
knaves who stole you from the marriage
altar he returned they either feared
she knew too much of family history-
knew something of the origin of david
hume-or else they wished all earthly
ties you had with home and kindred to
be severed at any rate they killed her
they did it subtly in such manner that
it was thought suicide but it was mur-
der none the less

  o-oh the girls faint moan was
pitiful hopeless then im all alone
all all alone-ive no one in the world

  you have your fiance the good young
monsieur jean the frenchman told her
softly you also have friend trow-
bridge as good and staunch a friend as
ever was then there is jules de grandin
we shall not fail you in your need my
small one

  for a moment she regarded us dis-
tractedly then suddenly put forth her
hands one to jules de grandin one to
me oh good kind friends she whis-
the devils bride



pered please help me if you can god
knows i am in need of help if ever
woman was for im as foul a murderess
as ever suffered death i was accessory to
those little childrens murders-i was-
oh-what was it that the lepers used to
cry unclean oh god i am unclean
unclean-not fit to breathe the air with
decent men not fit to marry john how
could  bring children into the world i
who have been accessory to the murder of
those little innocents she clenched
her little hands to fists and beat them on
her breast her tear-filled eyes turned up-
ward as though petitioning pardon for
unpardonable sin unclean unclean
she wailed her breath came slowly like
that of a dumb animal which resents the
senseless persistency of pain

  what is it that you say a murder-
ess-you de grandin shot back short-
ty-

  yes- i lay there on their altar
while they brought those little boys and
cut their-oh i didnt want to do it i
didnt want them to be killed but i lay
there just the same and let them do it-
i never raised a finger to prevent it

  de grandin took a deep breath you
are mistaken mademoiselle he answered
softly you were in a drugged condi-
tion the victim of a vicious oriental
drug in that all-helpless state one sees
visions unpleasant visions like the fig-
ments of a naughty dream there were
no little boys no murders were commit-
ted while you lay thus upon the devils
altar it was a seeming an illusion
staged for the edification of those wicked
men and women who made their prayer
to satan in the olden days when such
things were they sacrificed small boys
upon the altar of the devil but this is
now even those who are far gone in sin
would halt at such abominations they
were but waxen simulacra mute sense-

less reproductions of small boys and
though they went through all the horrid
rite of murder they let no blood they did
perform no killings no certainly not
jules de grandin physician soldier and
policeman was lying like the gallant
gentleman he was and lying most con-
vincingly

  but i heard their screams-i heard
them call for help then strangle in their
blood the girl protested

  all an illusion ma chere the little
frenchman answered it was a veritri-
loquial trick at the conclusion of the
ceremony the good trowbridge and i
would have sworn we heard a terrible
thick voice conversing with the priest upon
the altar that also was a jugglers trick
intended to impress the congregation
non ma chere your conscience need not
trouble you at all you are no accessory to
a murder as to the rest it was no fault
of yours you were their prisoner and the
helpless slave of wicked drugs what you
did was done with the body not the soul
there is no reason why you should not
wed i tell you

  she looked at him with tear-dimmed
eyes though she had mastered her first
excess of emotion her slender fingers
clasped and unclasped nervously and she
returned his steady gaze with something
of the vague half-believing apprehension
of a child youre sure she asked

  sure he echoed to be sure i am
sure mademoiselle remember if you
please i am jules de grandin i do not
make mistakes

  come calm yourself monsieur jean
will be here at any moment then-

  he broke off closing his eyes and
standing in complete silence then he put
his fingers to his pursed lips and from
them plucked a kiss and tossed it upward
toward the ceiling mon dieu he mur-

mured rapturously la passion delicieuse
is it not magnificent

alice alice beloved- young

adavissons voice faltered as he
rushed into the room and took the girl into
his arms when they told me that theyd
found you at last i could hardly believe-
i knew they were doing everything

but-- again his speech halted for

very pressure of emotion

  oh my dear alice took his face be-
tween her palms and looked into his wor-
shipping eyes my dear youve come to

me again but- she turned from

him and fresh hot tears lay upon her
lashes

  no buts mademoiselle de grandin
almost shouted remember what i said
take love when he comes to you my little
friends oh do not make excuses to turn
him out of doors-hell waits for those
who do so there is no obstacle to your
union believe me when i say so take
my advice and have the good cure come
here this very day i beg you

  both davisson and alice looked at him
amazed for he was fairly shaking with
emotion he waved a hand impatiently
do not look so make no account of
doubts or fears or feelings of unworthi-
ness he almost raged behold me if
you please an empty shell a soulless shad-
ow of a man a being with no aim in life
no home nor fireside to bid him welcome
when he has returned from duty is that
the way to live mille fois non i shall
say not but---

  i let love pass me by my friends and
have regretted it but once and that once
all my aimless empty life ecoutez-noi
in the springtime of our youth we met
sweet heloise and i beside the river
loire i was a student at the sorbonne
my military service yet to come she-
ther dieu she was an angel out of para-
dise

  beside the silver stream we played to-
gether we lay beneath the poplar trees
we rowed upon the river we waded bare-
foot in the shallows yes and when we
finished wading she plucked cherries red
ripe cherries from the trees and twined
their stems about her toes and gave me
her white feet to kiss i ate the cherries
from her feet and kissed her toes one kiss
for every cherry one cherry for each kiss
and when we said bonne nuit-mon
dieu to kiss and cling and shudder in
such ecstasy once more

  alas my several times great grand-
sire he whose honored name i bore had
cut and hacked his way through raging
paris on the night of august  in 
-how long his bones have turned to
ashes in the family tomb-while her an-
cestors had worn the white brassard and
cross crying messe ou mort a has les
huguenots 

  he paused a moment and raised his
shoulders in a shrug of resignation it
might not be he ended sadly her
father would have none of me my fam-
ily forbade the thought of marriage i
might have joined her in her faith but i
was filled with scientific nonsense which
derided old beliefs she might have left
the teachings of her forebears and accept-
ed my ideas but twenty generations of be-
lief weigh heavily upon the shoulders of
a single fragile girl to save my soul she
forfeited all claim upon my body if she
might not have me for husband shed have
no mortal man so she professed religion
she joined the silent carmelites the car-
melites who never speak except in prayer
and the last fond word i had from her
was that she would pray ceaselessly for
my salvation

  helas those little feet so much adored
-how many weary steps of needless pen-
ance have they taken since that day so
long ago how fruitless life has been to
the devils bride



me since my own stubbornness closed the
door on happiness oh do not wait my
friends take the love the good god
gives and hold it tight against your hearts
--it will not come a second time

  come friend trowbridge he com-
manded me let use leave them in their
happiness what have we who clasped
loves hand in ours long years ago and
saw the purple shadow of his smile grow
black with dull futility to do with them
nothing pardieu come let us take a
drink

  we poured the ruby brandy into wide-
mouthed goblets for de grandin liked to
scent its rich bouquet before he drank i
studied him covertly as he raised his
glass somehow the confession he had
made seemed strangely pitiful id known
him for five years nearly always gay al-
ways nonchalant boastfully self-confident
quick brave and reckless ever a favorite
with women always studiously gallant
but ever holding himself aloof though
more than one fair charmer had deliber-
ately paid court to him at last i under-
stood-or thought i did jules de gran-
din was rather too complex to admit of
easy understanding

  to you my friend he pledged me
to you and friendship and brave deeds
of adventure and last of all to death the
last sweet friend who flings the door back
from our prison for-

  the clamoring telephone cut short his
toast

voice announced as i picked up the instru-
ment will you and doctor de grandin

that evening alice suffered from se-
vere headaches and shortly afterward
with sharp abdominal pains though a
careful examination disclosed neither en-
larged tonsils nor any evidence of me-
chanical stoppage the sensation of a ball
rising in her throat plagued her almost
ceaselessly when she attempted to cross
the room her knees buckled under her as
though they had been the boneless joints
of a rag-doll


weird tales

  jules de grandin pursed his lips shook
his head and tweaked the needle-ends of
his mustache disconsolately uhysterie
he murmured it might have been fore-
seen the emotional and moral shock the
poor one has been through is enough to
shatter any nerves helas i fear the wed-
ding may not be so soon friend trow-
bridge the experience of marriage is a
trying one to any woman-the readjust-
ment of her mode of life the blending of
her personality with anothers-it is a
strain no she is in no condition to
essay it

  amazingly he brightened his small
eyes gleaming as with sudden inspiration
parbleu i have it he exclaimed she
monsieur jean and you vion vieux shall
take a trip i would suggest the riviera
were it not that i desire isolation for you
all until-no matter your practise is
not so pressing that it can not be assumed
by your estimable colleague doctor
phillips and mademoiselle alice will
most certainly improve more quickly if
you accompany her as personal physician
you will go say that you will my
friend a very great much depends on it

  reluctantly i consented and for six
weeks alice john davisson and i toured
the caribbean saw devastated martinique
the birthplace of the empress josephine
drank haitian coffee fresh from the plan-
tation investigated the sights and sounds
and most especially the smells of pana-
ma and colon finally passed some time at
the jockey club and sloppy joes in ha-
bana it was a well and sun-tanned alice
who debarked with us and caught the
noon train out of hoboken

  arrangements for the wedding were
perfected while we cruised beneath the
southern cross the old hume house
would be done over and serve the bride
and groom for home and in view of al-
ices bereavement the formal ceremony

had been canceled a simple service in the
chapel of st chrysostoms being substi-
tuted pending the nuptials alice took
up residence at the hotel carteret declar-
ing that she could not think of lodging
at my house warm as was my invitation

a ll has been finished de grandin
-l told me jubilantly as he renouard
and ingraham accompanied me from the
station the justice of new jersey of
which you speak so proudly she has more
than justified herself oh yes

  eh i demanded

  renouard and ingraham chuckled

  they gave it to him the englishman
explained

  in the throat-the neck i should re-
mark renouard supplied wrestling
bravely with the idiom

  the party will be held tomorrow
night de grandin finished

  who-what-whatever are you fel-
lows saying i queried what party
dye mean and-

  grigor bazarov de grandin an-
swered with another laugh the youthful-
bodied one with the aged evil face the
wicked one who celebrated the black
mass he is to die tomorrow night yes
parbleu he dies for murder

 but-

   patience mon vieux and i shall tell
you all you do recall how we-mon-
sieur hiji renouard and i-did appre-
hend him on the night we rescued ma-
demoiselle alice of course very well

  you know how we conspired that he
should be tried for a murder which he did
not perpetrate because we could not
charge him with his many other crimes
very good so it was

  when we had packed you off with
monsieur jean and his so charming fian-
cee your testimony could not serve toi
save him no we had the game all isi

ourselves and how nobly we did swear
his life away mordieu when they heard
how artistically we committed perjury i
damn think ananias and sapphira hung
their heads and curled up like two an-
chovies for very jealousy the jury al-
most wept when we described his shame-
ful crime it took them only twenty
minutes to decide his fate and so to-
morrow night he gives his life in expi-
ation for those little boys he sacrificed
upon the devils altar and for the dread-
ful death he brought upon poor abigail

  me i am clever my friend i have
drawn upon the wires of political influ-
ence and we shall all have seats within
the death house when he goes to meet the
lightning-bolt of jersey justice yes cer-
tainly of course

  you mean were to witness the execu-
tion

  mais oui et puis did i not swear he
should pay through the nose when he
slew that little helpless lad upon the dev-
ils altar but certainly and now by
damn he shall learn that jules de gran-
din does not swear untruly-unless he
wishes to unquestionably

deftly like men accustomed to their
task the state policemen patted all
our pockets the pistols my companions
wore were passed unquestioned for only
cameras were taboo within the execution
chamber

  all right you can go in the ser-
geant told us when the troopers had com-
pleted their examination and we filed
down a dimly lighted corridor behind the
prison guard

  the death room was as bright as any
clinics surgery immaculate white tile re-
flecting brilliant incandescent bulbs hard
rays behind a barricade of white-enam-
eled wood on benches which reminded me
of pews sat several young men whose

journalistic calling was engraved indel-
ibly upon their faces and despite their
efforts to appear at ease it took no second
glance to see their nerves were taut to
the snapping-point for even seasoned
journalists react to death-and here was
death stark and grim as anything to be
found in dissecting-rooms

  the chair a heavy piece of oaken
furniture stood near the farther wall
raised one low step above the tiled floor
of the chamber a brilliant light suspend-
ed from the ceiling just above it casting
its pitiless spotlight upon the center of
the tragic stage the warden and a doc-
tor stethoscope swung round his neck as
though it were a badge of office stood
near the chair conversing in low tones
the lank cadaverous electrician whose
duty was to send the lethal current
through the condemned mans body
stood in a tiny alcove like a doorless tel-
ephone booth slightly behind and to the
left of the chair a screen obscured a
doorway leading from the room but as
we took our seats in front i caught a fleet-
ing glimpse of a white-enameled wheeled
bier a white sheet lying neatly folded on
it beyond i knew the surgeon and the
autopsy table were in readiness when the
prison doctor had announced his verdict

  the big young englishman went pale
beneath his tropic tan as he surveyed the
place renouards square jaw set suddenly
beneath his bristling square-cut beard de
grandins small bright eyes roved quickly
round the room taking stock of the few
articles of furniture then involuntarily
his hand flew upward to tease the tightly
waxed hairs of his mustache to a sharper
point these three veterans of police
routine all more than once participants in
executions were fidgeting beneath the
strain of waiting as for me-if i came
through without the aid of smelling-salts
i felt i should be lucky

  a light tap sounded on the varnished


weird tales

door communicating with the death cells
a soft half-timid sort of tap it was such
as that a person unaccustomed to commer-
cial life might give before attempting to
enter an office

  the tap was not repeated silently on
well-oiled hinges the door swung back
and a quartet halted on the threshold to
right and left were prison guards between
them stood the red priest arrayed in open
shirt and loose black trousers list slip-
pers on his feet as he came to a halt i
saw that the right leg of the trousers had
been slit up to the knee and flapped gro-
tesquely round his ankle the guards be-
side him held his elbows lightly and
another guard brought up the rear

  pale calm erect the condemned man
betrayed no agitation save by a sudden
violent quivering of the eyelids this per-
haps being due to the sudden flood of
light in which he found himself his
great sad eyes roved quickly round the
room not timorously but curiously
finally coming to rest upon de grandin
then for an instant a flash showed in
them a lambent flash which died as quick-
ly as it came

  quickly the short march to the chair
began abreast of us the prisoner
wrenched from his escorts cleared the
space between de grandin and himself
in one long leap bent forward and spat
into the little frenchmans face

  without a word or cry of protest the
prison guards leaped on him pinioned
his elbows to his sides and rushed him at
a staggering run across the short space to
the chair

  de grandin drew a linen kerchief from
his cuff and calmly wiped the spittle from
his cheek eh bien he murmured it
seems the snake can spit though justice
has withdrawn his fangs nest-ce-pas

  the prison warders knew their work
straps were buckled round the prisoners

wrists his ankles waist a leather hel-
met like a football players was clamped
upon his head almost totally obscuring
his pale deep-wrinkled face

  there was no clergyman attending
grigor bazarov was faithful to his com-
pact with the devil even unto death his
pale lips moved god is folly and cow-
ardice god is tyranny and misery god
is evil to me then lucifer he mur-
mured in a singsong chant

  the prison doctor stood before the
chair notebook in hand pencil poised
the prisoner was breathing quickly his
shoulders fluttering with forced respira-
tion a deep inhaling gulp a quick
exhaling gasp-the shoulders slanted for-
ward

  so did the doctors pencil as though he
wrote the thin-faced executioner his
quiet eyes upon the doctors hands
reached upward there was a crunching
of levers a sudden whir a whine and the
criminals body started forward lurching
upward as though he sought to rise and
burst from the restraining straps as much
as we could see of his pale face grew
crimson like the face of one who holds
his breath too long the bony claw-like
hands were taut upon the chair arms like
those of a patient in the dentists chair
when the drill bites deeply

  a long eternal moment of this pos-
ture then the sound of grating metal as
the switches were withdrawn and the
straining body in the chair sank limply
back as though in muscular reaction to
fatigue

  once more the doctors pencil tilted for-
ward again the whirring whine again the
body started up tense strained all but
bursting through the broad strong straps
which bound it to the chair the right
hand writhed and turned thumb and fore-
finger meeting tip to tip as though to
the devils bride



take a pinch of snuff then absolute flac-
cidity as the current was shut off

  the prison doctor put his book aside
and stepped up to the chair for some-
thing like a minute the main tube of his
questing stethoscope explored the red-
dened chest exposed as he put back the
prisoners open shirt then

  i pronounce this man dead

  mon dieu exclaimed renouard
for gods sake ingraham muttered
thickly

  i remained silent as the white-garbed
orderlies took the limp form from the
chair wrapped it quickly in a sheet and
trundled it away on the wheeled bier to
the waiting autopsy table

  i say suggested ingraham shakily
suppose he aint quite dead it didnt

seem to me-

  liens he will be thoroughly defunct
when the surgeons work is done de
grandin told him calmly it was most
interesting was it not

  his small eyes hardened as he saw the
sick look on our faces ah bah you have
the sympathy for him he asked almost
accusingly for why were they not
more merciful to him than he was to those
helpless little boys he killed those little
boys whose throats he slit-or that poor
woman whom he crucified i damn think
yes

  	the wolf-master

iens my friends i damn think
there is devilment afoot de gran-
din told us as we were indulging in a final
cup of coffee in the breakfast room some
mornings later

  but no renouard expostulated

   but yes his confrere insisted

  read it my friend he commanded
passing a folded copy of the journal
across the table to me to ingraham
and renouard he ordered listen lis-

beasts  karmany estate break  cages and pur-
sue intruder-animals disappearance a mystery

  i read aloud at his request

  early this morning keepers at the private zoo
maintained by winthrop karmany well known re-
tired wall street operator at his palatial estate
near raritan were aroused by a disturbance among
the animals karmany is said to have the finest as
well as what is probably the largest collection of
siberian white wolves in captivity and it was
among these beasts the disturbance occurred

  john noles  and edgar black  care-
takers on the karmany estate hastily left their
quarters to ascertain the cause of the noise which
they heard coming from the wolves dens about
 am rumming through the dark to the dens
they were in time to see what they took to be a
man enveloped in a long hark cloak running at
great speed toward the brick v-all surrounding the
animals enclosure they also noticed several
wolves in hot pursuit of the intruder both de-
clare that though the wolves had been howling
and baying noisily a few minutes before they ran
without so much as a growl as they pursued the
mysterious visitor

  arriving at the den the men were amazed to
find the cage doors swinging open their heavy
locks evidently forced with a crowbar and all but
three of the savage animals at large

  the strange intruder with the wolves in close
pursuit was seen by noles and black to vault the
surrounding wall but all had disappeared in the
darkness when the keepers reached the barrier
citizens in the vicinity of the karmany estate are
warned to be on the lookout for the beasts for
though they had been in confinement several years
and consequently have lost much of their native
savagery it is feared that unless they are speedily
recaptured or voluntarily find their way back to
their dens they may revert to their original ferocity
when they become hungry livestock may suffer
from their depredations and if they keep together
and hunt in a pack even human beings are in dan-
ger for all the beasts are unusually large and would
make dangerous antagonists

  this morning at daylight a posse of farmers
headed by members of the state constabulary was
combing the woods and fields in search of the
missing animals but though every spot where
wolves might be likely to congregate was visited
no trace of them was found no one can be found
who admits seeing any sign of the runaway wolvesr
nor have any losses of domestic animals been re-
ported to the authorities

  the manner in which the wolf pack seems to
have vanished completely as well as the identity
of the man in black seen by the two keepers and
the reason which may have actuated him in visit-
ing the karmany menagerie are puzzling both the
keepers and authorities it has been intimated that
the breaking of the cages may have been the vagary
of a disordered mind certain insane persons have
an almost uncontrollable aversion to the sight of
caged animals and it is suggested an escaped luna-
tic may have blundered into the karmany zoo as
he fled from confinement if this is so it is quite


weird tales

possible that seeing the confined beasts he was
suddenly seized with an insane desire to liberate
them and consequently forced the locks of their
cages the released animals seem to have been
ungrateful however for both noles and black de-
clare the mysterious man was obviously running
for his life while the wolves pursued him in silent
and ferocious determination however since no
trace of the body has been found nor any report
of a man badly mauled by wolves made in the
locality it is supposed the unidentified man man-
aged to escape meanwhile the whereabouts of
the wolf pack is causing much concern about the
countryside

   karmany is at present occupying his southern
place at winter haven fla and all attempts to
reach him have been unsuccessful at the time this
issue goes to press

  hm its possible i murmured as i
put the paper down

  absolutely ingraham agreed

  of course certainly renouard con-
curred

  undoubtlessly de grandin nodded
then abruptly

  what is

 why-er-a lunatic might have
done it i returned cases of zo-
ophilia---

  and of zoofiddlesticks the little
frenchman interrupted this was no
insanatics vagary my friends this busi-
ness was well planned beforehand though
why it should be so we can not say
still-

t dont care  he is at breakfast ive

  a got to see him a hysterically shrill
voice came stridently from the hallway
and john davisson strode into the
breakfast room pushing the protesting
nora mcginnis from his path doctor
de grandin-doctor trowbridge-shes
gone he sobbed as he half fell across the
threshold

  mon dieu so soon de grandin
cried how was it mon pauvre

  davisson stared glassy-eyed from one of
us to the other his face working spasmod-
ically his hands clenched till it seemed
the bones must surely crush

  he stole her-he and his damned

wolves

  wolves i say barked ingraham

  grand dieu-wolves renouard ex-
claimed

  a-a-ah-wolves i begin to see the
outlines of the scheme de grandin an-
swered calmly i might have feared as
much

  begin at the beginning if you please
monsieur and tell us everything that hap-
pened do not leave out an incident
however trivial it may seem in cases such
as this there are no trifles begin com-
mence we listen

  young davisson exhaled a deep half-
sobbing breath and turned his pale face
from de grandin to renouard then back
again

  we-alice and i-went riding this
morning as we always do he answered
the horses were brought round at half-
past six and we rode out the albemarle
pike toward boonesburg we must have
gone about ten miles when we turned off
the highway into a dirt road its easier
on the horses and the riders too you
know

  wed ridden on a mile or so through
quite a grove of pines when it began to
snow and the wind rose so sharply it cut
through our jackets as if they had been
summer-weight id just turned round to
lead the way to town when i heard alice
scream shed ridden fifty feet or so
ahead of me so she was that much behind
when we turned

  i wheeled my horse around and there
converging on her from both sides of the
road were half a dozen great white
wolves

   i couldnt believe my eyes at first the
brutes were larger than any id ever seen
and though they didnt growl or make the
slightest sound i could see their awful
purpose in their gleaming eyes and flash
the devils bride



ing fangs they hemmed my poor girl
in on every side and as i turned to ride
to her they gathered closer crouching
till their bellies almost touched the
ground and seemed to stop abruptly
frozen waiting for some signal from the
leader of the pack

  i drove the spurs into my mare and
laid the whip on her with all my might
but she balked and shied and reared and
all my urging couldnt force her on a
foot

  then apparently from nowhere two
more white beasts came charging through
the woods and leaped at my mounts
head the poor brute gave a screaming
whinny and bolted

  i tugged at the bridle and sawed at
her mouth but i might have been a baby
for all effect my efforts had twice i
tried to roll out of the saddle but she
was fairly flying and try as i would i
didnt seem able to disengage myself
wed reached the pike and traveled half
a mile or so toward town before i finally
brought her to a halt

  then i turned back but at the en-
trance to the lane she balked again and
nothing i could do would make her leave
the highway i dismounted and hurried
down the lane on foot but it was snowing
pretty hard by then and i couldnt even
be sure when id reached the place where
alice was attacked at any rate i
couldnt find a trace of her or of her
horse

  he paused a moment breathlessly and
de grandin prompted softly and this
he to whom you referred when you first
came in monsieur

  grigor bazarov the young man an-
swered and his features quivered in a
nervous tic i recognized him instantly

  as i rushed down that lane at break-
neck speed on my ungovernable horse i
saw-distinctly gentlemen-a human fig-

ure standing back among the pines it
was grigor bazarov and he stood between
the trees waving his hands like a conduc-
tor leading an orchestra without a spo-
ken syllable he was directing that pack of
wolves he set them after alice and or-
dered them to stop when theyd surround-
ed her he set them on me and made
them leap at my horses head without
actually fleshing their teeth in her and
without attempting to drag me from the
saddle-which they could easily have
done then when hed worked his plan
and made my mare bdt he called them
back into the woods it was alice he was
after and he took her as easily as a shep-
herd cuts a wether from the flock with
trained sheep-dogs

  how is this de grandin questioned
sharply you say it was grigor bazarov
how could you tell you never saw
him

  no but ive heard you tell of him
and alice had described him too i rec-
ognized those great sad eyes of his and
his mummy-wrinkled face i tell you--

  but bazarov is dead i interrupted
we saw him die last week-all of us
they electrocuted him in the penitentiary
at trenton and-

  and while he was all safely lodged in
jail he broke into this house and all but
made away with mademoiselle alice da
grandin cut in sharply you saw hint
with your own two eyes my trowbridge
so did renouard and monsieur hiji
again while still in jail he murdered the
poor hornsby and all but killed the good
costello the evidence is undisputed
and-

  i know but hes dead now i in-
sisted

  there is a way to tell de granditf
answered come let us go

  go where

  to the cemetery of course i would


weird tales

look in the grave of this one who can be
in jail and in your house at the same time
and kill a gendarme in the street while
safely under lock and key come we
waste our time my friends

  we drove to the county court house
and de grandin was closeted with re-
corder glassford in his chambers a few
minutes tres bon he told us as he re-
appeared i have the order for the ex-
humation let us make haste

the early morning snow had stopped
but a thin veneer of leaden clouds
obscured the sky and the winter sun
shone through them with a pale half-
hearted glow as we wheeled along the
highway toward the graveyard only
people of the poorer class buried their
dead in willow hills only funeral direc-
tors of the less exclusive sort sold lots or
grave-space there bazarovs unmarked
grave was in the least expensive section of
the poverty-stricken burying-ground one
short step higher than the potters field

  the superintendent and two overalled
workmen waited at the graveside for de
grandin had telephoned the cemetery
office as soon as he obtained the order for
the exhumation glancing perfunctorily at
the little frenchmans papers the superin-
tendent nodded to the polish laborers
git goin he commanded tersely an
make it snappy

   it was dismal work watching them heave
lumps of frosty clay from the grave the
earth was frozen almost stony-hard and
the picks struck on it with a hard metallic
sound at length however the dull
reverberant thud of steel on wood warned
us that the task was drawing to a close
a pair of strong web straps were lowered
made fast to the rough box enclosing the
casket and at a word from the superin-
tendent the men strained at the thongs
dragging their weird burden to the sur-

face a pair of pick-handles were laid
across the open grave and the rough box
rested on them callously as one who
does such duties every day the superin-
tendent wrenched the box-lid off and the
laborers laid it by the grave inside lay
the casket a cheap affair of chestnut cov-
ered with shoddy broadcloth the tinny
imitation-silver nameplate on its lid al-
ready showing a dull brown-blue discol-
oration

  snapi the fastenings which secured
the casket lid were thrown back the super-
intendent lifted the panel and tossed it to
the frozen ground

  head resting on the sateen rayon pil-
low hands folded on his breast grigor
bazarov lay before us and gave us stare
for stare the mortuarian who attended
him had lacked the skill or inclination to
do a thorough job and despite the intense
cold of the weather putrefaction had made
progress the dead mans mouth was
slightly open a quarter-inch or so of
purple blood-gorged tongue protruding
from his lips as though in low derision
the lids were partly raised from his great
eyes and though these had the sightless
glaze of death it seemed to me some
subtle mockery lay in them

   i shuddered at the sight despite myself
but i could not forbear the gibe well
is he dead i asked de grandin

  comme un mouton he answered in
nowise disconcerted

   restore him to his bed if you will be
so good monsieur he added to the su-
perintendent and should you care to

smoke-- a flash of green showed

momentarily as a treasury note changed
hands and the cemetery overseer grinned

  thanks he acknowledged next
time you want to look at one of em dont
forget were always willing to oblige

  yes he is dead the frenchman mur-
mured thoughtfully as we walked slowly
the devils bride



teward the cemetery gate dead like a

herring yet-

  dead or not john davisson broke
in and his words were syncopated by the
chattering of his teeth dead or not sir
the man we just saw in that coffin was the
man i saw beside the lane this morning
no one could fail to recognize that face

	white horror

eres a special delivery letter for
misther davisson come whilst yez
wuz out sor nora mcginnis announced
as we entered the house will ye be
afther havin th tur-rkey or th roast fer
dinner tonight an shall i make th salad
wid tomatoes or asparagus

  turkey by all means he is a noble
bird de grandin answered for me and
tomatoes with the salad if you please ma
petite

  the big irishwoman favored him with
an affectionate smile as she retired kitch-
enward and young davisson slit the en-
velope of the missive she had handed him

  for a moment he perused it with wide-
set unbelieving eyes then handed it to
me his features quivering once again
with nervous tic

john darling

   when you get this i shall be on my way to ful-
fil the destiny prepared for me from the beginning
of the world do not seek to follow me nor think
of me save as you might think kindly of one who
died for  am dead to you i have forever given
up all thought of marriage to you or any man and
i release you from your engagement your ring
will be delivered to you and that you may some
day put it on the finger of a girl who can return
the love you give is the hope of

alice

    cant- wont believe she means it
the young man cried why alice and i
have known each other since we were
little kids weve been in love since she

first put her hair up and--

  tiens my friend de grandin inter-
rupted as he gazed at the message have
you by chance spent some time out in the
country

  eh answered davisson amazed at
the irrelevant question

  your hearing is quite excellent i
think will you not answer me

  why-er-yes of course ive been in
the country-i spent practically all my
summers on a farm when i was a lad
but-

  tres bon the little frenchman
laughed consider did not you see
the wicked bazarov urge on his wolves
to take possession of your sweetheart but
certainly and did he not forbear to
harm you being satisfied to drive you
from the scene while he kidnapped ma-
demoiselle alice of course and could
he not easily have had his wolf-pack drag
you from your horse and slay you you
have said as much yourself very well
then recall your rural recollections if you
will

  you have observed the farmer as he
takes his cattle to the butcher does he
take the trouble to place his cow in lead-
ing strings by no means he puts the
little so weak calf all destined to be veal
upon the table in a little while into a
wagon and drives away to market and
she the poor distracted mother-beast she
trots along behind asking nothing but to
keep her little baby-calf in sight lead
her parbleu ropes of iron could not
drag her from behind the tumbril in
which her offspring rides to execution
is it not likely so in this case also i damn
think yes

   this never-to-be-sufficiently-anathema-
tized stealer of women holds poor ma-
demoiselle alice in his clutch he spares
her fiance perhaps he spares him only as
the cruel playful pussy-cat forbears to
kill the mouse outright at any rate he
spares him for why pardieu because
by leaving monsieur jean free he still al-
lows poor mademoiselle alice one little
tiny ray of hope with such vile subtlety


weird tales

as only his base wickedness can plan he
holds her back from black despair and
suicide that he may force her to his will
by threats against the man she loves
sucre nom dun artichaut i shall say yes
certainly of course

  you mean-hell make her go with
him-leave me-by threats against my
life young davisson faltered

  precisement mon vieux he has no
need to drug her now with scopolamin
apomophia he holds her in a stronger
thrall yes it is entirely likely

  he folded the girls note between his
slim white hands regarding it idly for a
moment then excitedly

  tell me monsieur jean did ma-
demoiselle alice by any chance know
something of telegraphy

  eh why yes when we were kids
we had a craze for it-had wires strung
between our houses with senders and re-
ceivers at each end and used to rouse each
other at all sorts of hours to tap a mes-
sage-

   hourra the evil one is circumvented
regardez-vous

  holding the letter to the study desk-
lamp he tapped its bottom margin with
his finger invisible except against the
light a series of light scratches as though
from a pin-poinf or dry pen showed on
the paper

  t        i    i     i 

  you can read him he asked anxious-
ly me i understand the international

but this is in american morse and-

  of course i can young davisson
broke in  jones mill it says good
lord why didnt i think of that

  ah and this mill of monsieur

jones-

  is an old ruin several miles from
boonesburg no ones occupied it since
i can remember but it cant be more than

three miles from the place where we met

the wolves and-

  eh bien if that be so why do we sit
here like five sculptured figures on the
arc de triomphe come let us go at
once my friends trowbridge renouard
friend hiji and you friend jean pre-
pare yourselves for service in the cold
me i shall telephone the good costello
for the necessary implements

  oui-da messieurs les loups i think
that we shall give you the party of sur-
prize-we shall feed you that which will
make your bellies ache most villainously

it was something like a half-hour later
when the police car halted at the door
its kind o irreglar sor sergeant cos-
tello announced as he lugged several heavy
satchels up the steps with the aid of two
patrolmen but i got permission fer th
loan seems like you got a good stand-in
down to headquarters

  the valises opened he drew forth three
submachine guns each with an extra
drum of cartridges and two riot guns
weapons similar to the automatic shot-
gun but heavier in construction and firing
shells loaded with much heavier shot

  you and friend jean will use the
shotguns friend trowbridge  de gran-
din told me renouard ingraham and
i will handle the quick-firers come pre-
pare yourselves at once heavy clothing
but no long coats we shall need leg-room
before the evening ends

  i	fished a set of ancient hunting-togs
out of my wardrobe-thick trousers of
stout corduroy a pair of high lace boots
a heavy sweater and suede jerkin finally
a leather cap with folds that buckled un-
derneath the chin a few minutes search
unearthed another set for davison and
we joined the others in the hallway de
grandin was resplendent in a leather avia-
tion suit renouard had slipped three
sweaters on above his waistcoat and bound

                    w t- 
the devils bride



the bottoms of his trousers tight about his
ankles with stout linen twine ingraham
was arrayed in a suit of corduroys which
had seen much better days though not
recently

   are we prepared de grandin asked
tres bon let us go

   the bitter cold of the afternoon had
given way to slightly warmer weather but
before we had traversed half a mile the
big full yellow moon was totally ob-
scured by douds and shortly afterward
the air was filled with flying snowflakes
and tiny cutting grains of hail which rat-
tled on the windshield and stung like
whips when they blew into our faces

   about three-quarters of a mile from the
old mill i had to stop my motor for the
road was heavy with new-fallen snow and
several ancient trees had blown across the
trail making further progress impossible

   eh b ten it must be on foot from now
on it seems de grandin murmured as he
clambered from the car very well one
consents when one must let us go
there is no time to lose

the road wound on growing narrow-
er and more uneven with each step
thick ranks of waving black-boughed
pines marched right to the border of the
trail on either side and through their
swaying limbs the storm-wind soughed
eerily while the very air seemed colder
with a sharper harder chill and the wan
and ghastly light which sometimes shines
on moonless snow-filled winter nights
seemed filled with creeping shifting
phantom-shapes which stalked us as a
wolf-pack stalks a stag

   morbleu i do not like this place me
renouard declared it has an evil smell
i think so too mon vieux de gran-
din answered three times already i
have all but fired at nothing my nerves
are not so steady as i thought

  oh keep your tails up ingraham
     w t-

comforted its creepy as a scottish fu-
neral here but i dont see anything-

  ha do you say it then look yonder
if you will and tell me what it is you do
not see my friend de grandin inter-
rupted

  loping silently across the snow them-
selves a mere shade darker than the fleecy
covering of the ground came a pack of
great white wolves green-yellow eyes
a-glint with savagery red tongues lolling
from their mouths as they drew nearer
through the pines then suddenly deployed
like soldiers at command and their cor-
don formed sank to the snow and sat
there motionless

  cher dieu renouard said softly
it is the pack of beasts which made away
with mademoiselle alice and-

  a movement stirred within the pack
a brute rose from its haunches took a
tentative step forward then sank down
again belly to the snow and lay there
panting its glaring eyes fixed hungrily
upon us

  and as the leader moved so moved the
pack a score of wolves were three feet
nearer us for every member of the deadly
circle had advanced in concert with the
leader

  i	stole a quick glance at de grandin
his little round blue eyes were glaring
fiercely as those of any of the wolves be-
neath his little blond mustache his lips
were drawn back savagely showing his
small white even teeth in a snarl of hate
and fury

  another rippling movement in the
wolf-pack and now the silence crashed
and from the circle there went up such
pandemonium of hellish howls as i had
never heard not even in the worst of
nightmares i had a momentary vision of
red mouths and gleaming teeth and shag-
gy gray-white fur advancing toward me
in a whirlwind rush then


weird tales

  give fire de grandin shouted

  and now the wolf-packs savage battle-
cry was drowned out by another roar as
de grandin ingraham and renouard
back touching back turned loose the ven-
om of their submachine guns young
davisson and i too opened fire with our
shotguns not taking aim but pumping
the mechanisms frenziedly and firing
point-blank into the faces of the charging
wolves

  how long the battle lasted i have no
idea but i remember that at last i felt de
grandins hand upon my arm and heard
him shouting in my ear cease firing
friend trowbridge there is no longer
anything to shoot parbleu if wolves
have souls i damn think hell is full with
them tonight

	the crimson clue

he turned abruptly to renouard
allez au feu mort brave he cried
pour la patrie

  we charged across the intervening
patch of snow-filled clearing and more
than once de grandin or renouard or in-
graham paused in his stride to spray the
windows of the tumbledown old house
with a stream of lead but not a shot re-
plied nor was there any sign of life as we
approached the doorless doorway

  easy on ingraham counseled they
may be lyin doggo waitin for a

chance-

  but no de grandin interrupted
had that been so they surely would not
have missed the chance to shoot us to
death a moment ago-we were a perfectly
defined target against the snow and they
had the advantage of cover still a milli-
gram of caution is worth a double quin-
tal of remorse so let us step warily

  renouard and i will take the lead
friend trowbridge you and friend jean
walk behind us and flash your search-

  lights forward and well above our heads
that way if we are ambushed they will
shoot high and give us opportunity to re-
turn their fire friend hiji do you bring
up the rear and keep your eyes upon the
ground which we have traversed should
you see aught which looks suspicious
shoot first and make investigation after-
ward i do not wish that we should die
tonight

  accordingly in this close formation
we searched the old house from its musty
cellar to its drafty attic but nowhere was
there any hint of life or recent occupancy
until as we forced back the sagging door
which barred the entrance to the old grain-
bins we noted the faint half-tangible
aroma of narcisse noir

  alice john davisson exclaimed
shes been here-i recognize the scent

  um de grandin murmured thought-
fully advance your light a trifle nearer
if you please friend trowbridge

  i	played the flashlight on the age-
bleached casing of the door there fresh
against the woods flat surface were three
small pits arranged triangularly a sec-
ond group of holes similarly spaced
were in the hand-hewn planking of the
door exactly opposite those which scarred
the jamb

  screw-holes de grandin commented
and on the outer side you were cor-
rect friend jean your nose and heart
spoke truly this place has been the pris-
on of your love-here are the marks
where they made fast the lock and hasp
to hold her prisoner-but helas the bird
is flown the cage deserted

  painstakingly as a paleographer might
scan a palimpsest he searched the little
wood-walled cubicle flashing his search-
lights darting ray on each square inch of
aged planking ah-ha he asked of no
one in particular as the flashlight struck
into a corner revealing several tiny
smears of scarlet on the floor
the devils bride



  morbleu blood renouard ex-
claimed can it be that-

  de grandin threw himself full length
upon the floor his little round blue eyes
a scant three inches from the row of crim-
son stains blood non he answered
as he finished his examination it is the
mark of pomade pour les levres and un-
less i do mistake-

  you mean lipstick i interrupted

what in the world-

  zut he cut me short you speak
too much my friend to davisson
see here friend jean is not some sys-
tem of design in this is it not-

  of course it is the young man an-
swered sharply its another telegraphic
message like the one she sent us in the
letter cant you see dash dash dot
dash dot dot dot dot dash dash

dot- he read the code through

quickly

  de grandin looked at him with up-
raised brows exactement he nodded

and that means-

  m-a-c-a-n-d-r-e-w-s s-i-e- davis-
son spelled the message out then paused
shook his head in puzzlement and once
again essayed the task

  i cant get any sense from it he fin-
ally confessed thats what it spells no

doubt of it but what the devil-

  i say old chap go over it once more
asked ingraham i may be blotto
but-

  crash the thunderous detonation
shook the floor beneath us and a heavy
beam came hurtling from the ceiling fol-
lowed by a cataract of splintered planks
and rubble

  crash a second fulmination smashed
the wooden wall upon our right and a
mass of shattered brick and timber poured
into the room

  bombes dair renouard cried wild-
ly down-down my friends it is the
only way to- his warning ended in

a choking grunt as a third explosion ripped
the cover off our hiding-place and a
blinding pompom of live flame flashed in

our eyes

  i felt myself hurled bodily against the
farther wall felt the crushing impact as
i struck the mortised planks and then i
felt no more

rowbridge my friend my good
brave comrade do you survive
have you been killed to death mordieu
say that you live my old one i heard de
grandins voice calling from immeasur-
able distance and slowly realized he held
my head upon his shoulder while with
frantic hands he rubbed snow on my brow

  oh im all right i guess i answered
weakly then sank again in comforting
oblivion

  when next i struggled back to con-
sciousness i found myself on my own
surgery table de grandin busy with a
phial of smelling-salts a glass of aromatic
spirit on the table and a half-filled tum-
bler of cognac next to it thanks be to
god you are yourself once more he ex-
claimed fervently handed me the water
and ammonia and drained the brandy
glass himself pardieu my friend i
thought that we should surely lose you
he continued as he helped me to a chair

  you had a close squeak no doubt of
it ingraham agreed

  what happened i demanded weakly

  de grandin fairly ground his teeth in
rage they made a foolishness of us
he told me while we were busy with
their sacre wolves they must have been
escaping and the thunder of our guns
drowned out the whirring of their motors
then when we were all safe and helpless
in the house they circled back and
dropped the hand grenades upon us
luckily for us they had no aerial torpe-
does or we should now be practising


weird tales

upon the harp as it is- he raised

his shoulders in a shrug

  b-but you mean they had a plane
i asked amazed

  ha i shall say as much he answered
nor did they stop to say a by-your-leave
when they obtained it this very night
an hour or so before we journeyed to that
thirty-thousand-times-accursed mill of
monsieur jones two men descended sud-
denly upon the hangars at new bristol
a splendid new amphibian lay in the bay
all ready to be drawn into her shed the
people at the airport are much surprized
to see her suddenly take flight but-avi-
ators are all crazy else they would remain
on land and who shall say what form
their latest madness takes it was some
little time before the truth was learned
then it was too late

  stretched cold upon the runway of
the hangar they found the pilot and his
mechanician both were shot dead yet
not a shot was heard the miscreants had
used silencers upon their guns no doubt

   tiens at any rate they had not stopped
at murder and they had made off with the
plane had landed it upon the frozen mill-
pond then sailed away almost-but not
quite thank god-leaving us as dead as
we had left their guardian wolves

  helas and we shall never overtake
them renouard said mournfully it is
too obvious they chose the amphibian
plane that they might put to sea and be
picked up by some ship which waited
and where they may be gone we can not
say there is no way of telling for-

  hold hard old thing i think perhaps
there is the englishman broke in
when trowbridge toppled over it
knocked the thought out of my head but
ive an idea we may trace em ill pop
off to the cable office and send a little
tracer out we ought to get some solid
information by tomorrow

we were still at breakfast the next
morning when the young man from
the cable office came mr in-gra-ham
here he asked

  dont say it like that young feller me
lad its ingraham-in as in inside and
graham as in biscuit you know re-
turned the englishman with a grin as he
held out his hand for the message

  hastily he read it to himself then aloud
to us

   no strangers seeking access to the bush through
here but french report a hundred turned back from
konakri stop unprecedented number of arrivals at
monrovia stop investigation under way

                         symmes

                                     supt

  tres bon de grandin nodded now
if you will have the goodness to trans-
late- he paused with brows raised

interrogatively

  nothin simpler old thing the eng-
lishman responded you see it was like
this

   way up in the back country of sierra
leone so near the boundary line of
french guinea that the french think its
british territory and the british think its
french an old goop named macandrews
got permission to go diggin some twenty
years ago he was a dour old scotsman
mad as a dingo dog they say but a first-
rate archeologist there were some old
roman ruins near the border and this
johnny had the idea hed turn up some-
thing never in the books if he kept at it
long enough so he built a pukka camp
and settled down to clear the jungle off
but fever beat his schedule and they
planted the old cove in one of his own
trenches

  that ended old macs diggin but his
camps still there i passed it less than
five years ago and stopped there over-
night the natives say the old mans
ghost hangs around the place and shun it
like the plague-havent even stolen any-
thing
the devils bride



  ah de - grandin murmured
and-

  oh quite old dear a big and
thats what got the massive intellect to
workin dont you know theres a big
natural clearin near macandrews and a
pretty fair-sized river the place is so
far inland nobody ever goes there unless
he has to and news-white mans news
i mean-is blessed slow gettin to the
coast could anything be sweeter for our
russian friends jamboree

  irak is under british rule today and
any nonsense in that neighborhood would
bring the police sniffin round the
frenchmen in arabia dont stand much
foolishness so any convocation of the
devil-worshippers is vetoed in advance
so far as that localitys concerned but
what about macandrews they could
plant and harvest the finest crop of merry
young hell you ever saw out there and no
one be the wiser but theyve got to get
there thats the blighted difficulty me
lad look here-

  he drew a pencil and notebook from
his pocket and blocked out a rough map
heres sierra leone heres french
guinea heres liberia get it our
people in freetown have to be con-
vinced theres some good reason why be-
fore theyll pass a stranger to the bush
country so do the french but liberia
-any man black white yellow or mixed
who lands there with real money in his
hand can get unlimited concessions to go
hunting in the back country and no ques-
tions asked

  there you are old bean when da-
visson decoded that message on the floor
last night it hit me like a brick the gal
had told us where she was in the letter
now she takes a chance well go to jones
mill and starts to write a message on the
floor theyve talked before her and she
takes her lipstick and starts to write her

destination down-macandrews sierra
leone-but only gets macandrews and
the first three letters of sierra down
when they come for her and she has to
stop thats the way ive figured it-its
great to have a brain like mine

  now if theyve really picked macan-
drews old camp for their party therell
be a gatherin of the clans out there and
the visitors will have to come overland
or enter through freetown one of the
french ports or liberia thats reasonin
old top

  so i cabled freetown to see if any
ones been tryin to bootleg himself
through the lines or if thered been much
sudden immigration through the french
ports you have the answer all these
coves will have to do is strike cross-coun-
try through the bush and-

  and we shall apprehend them ren-
ouard exclaimed delightedly

  right-o dear sir and fellow police-
man the englishman returned im

mornin and-

by hugh b cave

the story of an eldritch horror that leaped out of the
black night

iet me convince you first that the
young man who came to my medi-
cal offices that night was not the
type of man who gives way without
reason to abject fear

  yet when i stepped into my outer
office and saw him slumped on the divan
i knew that he was in the throes of mor-
tal terror his face was ghastly white
made hideous by the mop of jet hair that
crawled into his eyes he raised his head
sluggishly and glared at me like a
trapped animal

  i nodded quietly to the girl who stood
beside him she stepped past me into
the inner office and i drew the door shut
silently

  i had known this girl for years for
that matter all london knew her as a
charming lovely member of the upper
set a sportswoman and a distinguished
lady of one of englands famous old
families she was lady sybil ravenal

  tonight half an hour ago she had
telephoned me seeking permission to
bring a patient-a patient very dear to
her-to my suite now she stood before
me her hand resting on my arm and
said suddenly

  youve got to help him doctor
briggs he-he is going mad

  suppose you tell me i suggested
softly what he is afraid of

  i cant doctor there is the family
name to consider he-he is sir edward
ramsey

  i started that name too was well
known to me and to the rest of london

     

sir edward ramsey the favorite play-
boy of the upper strata noted sportsman
adventurer i could not believe that such
a man would be sitting in my offices
dragged into the depths of fear

you must tell me the cause i said
kindly otherwise i can do nothing
the girls lips tightened defiantly
when a man comes to you with a
broken leg she said you dont ask him
where he got it please

  a fractured leg is a physical malady
his is mental

  but he comes to you in the same ca-
pacity doctor you must help him

  i can only give you the usual advice
i shrugged since you refuse to divulge
the cause of his terror i can only sug-
gest that he get away from it

  i could see from the obvious twist of
her mouth that she was keenly dis-
appointed she would have argued with
me perhaps pleaded with me had not
the door opened suddenly behind her

  i say opened in reality it was flung
back savagely young ramsey stood on
the threshold reeling glowering at me
out of smoldering eyes i did not know
then what made him intrude at that mo-
ment i thought foolishly that he was
afraid of being left alone in the dimly
lighted outer office

  he staggered forward blindly grop-
ing toward me

  the thing he cried his voice was
high-pitched and nasal by god its
following me its-its-
the ghoul gallery



in the space where that gleaming skeleton had
hung before a mad thing leered out at me

 w 
wlc

  i stared at him in bewilderment
there was no sound in my rooms at that
moment-no sound at all except the half-
inaudible humming of a machine in the
adjoining suite-an electro-therapeutic
machine used by my associate in the
treatment of leucocythemia and similar
afflictions

  yet the boys hands clawed at the
sleeve of my coat he flung himself
against me muttering a jargon of words

that had no seeming intelligence and
then very suddenly his twitching face
became fixed staring glaring at some-
thing beyond me with a strangled sob
of abject horror he stumbled back

i was beside him in an instant holding
his quivering body upright as i
looked at him his eyes were wide open
and rimmed with white glued in mute
terror upon a small table which stood


weird tales

against the wall on the opposite side of
the room

  the table was an insignificant one
placed there merely for ornamental pur-
poses i had covered it with a black
cloth and lined it along the back with a
small rack of medical volumes in the
center of the black cloth facing into the
room i had set a human skull

  the thing was neither fantastic nor
horrible merely a very ordinary medical
head bleached white in the shadows
perhaps the eyeless sockets and grinning
mouth with its usual set of enameled
teeth were a bit unconventional but
certainly there was nothing to excite such
uncontrollable horror as gripped the man
in my arms

  his eyes were full of sheer madness
as he stared at it his lips had writhed
apart and were twitching spasmodically
he clung to me with all his strength
and at length wrenching his gaze from
the thing on the table he buried his head
in my arms and surrendered to the fear
which overwhelmed him

  be merciful briggs he moaned
for gods sake be merciful come with
me-stay with me for a day or two be-
fore i go utterly mad

  there was no alternative i could not
send a man away in such condition
neither could i keep him with me for
my quarters were not fitted with addi-
tional rooms for mad patients

  i forced him into a chair where he
could not see the deaths-head on the
table leaving him with the girl who
had brought him i hurriedly packed a
small overnight case and made ready for
an all-night siege of it when i re-
turned i found the boy slumped wearily
in the chair with his head in the girls
comforting arms

  come i said quietly

  he looked up at me his bloodshot
eyes struggled to drag me into focus

  you-you are coming with me
briggs he asked slowly

  i am

  he pushed himself heavily out of the
chair as he turned his hand groped for
mine he spoke with a great effort

  thanks briggs ill-try to get back
a little courage

that was my introduction to sir
edward ramsey the account of
our departure and of our subsequent ar-
rival at sir edwards huge town house
is of little importance during the en-
tire journey my two companions did not
utter a word the boy seemed to have
shrunk into himself to have fallen into
the lowest depths of fearful anticipation
the girl sat stiff rigid staring straight
ahead of her

  i remember one thing which struck me
as being more or less peculiar in view of
the boys social position no servant
opened the door to us for that matter
the boy made no attempt to summon one
by ringing the bell instead he groped
into his pockets for his own door-key and
fumbled nervously with the lock turn-
ing his head sideways he spoke to me
stiffly

  my mans-deaf briggs damned
nuisance but its the only reason he-
stays the others cleared out long ago

  the door swung open i followed sir
edward down the carpeted hall with the
girl beside me the boy was trembling
again glancing about him furtively i
was forced to take his arm and lead him
quietly into one of the massive rooms ad-
joining the corridor

  there he sank into a chair and stared
up at me hopelessly i realized that he
had not slept in many hours-that he was
on the verge of breakdown

  opening rny case i administered an
opiate to deaden his nerves although i
had little hope that it would have the
the ghoul gallery



desired effect the boys terror was too
acute too intense however the drug
quieted him he slept fitfully for the bet-
ter part of an hour long enough for
lady sybil to draw me aside motion me
to a chair and tell me her story

  she came directly to the point softly
and deliberately they were in love she
and ramsey they were betrothed six
weeks ago his love had changed to fear

   at first he fought against it she said
evenly then it took possession of him
-of his very soul he-he released me
from my promise

  why

  because of the curse that hangs over
his family

  and that is why you came to me
tonight

  i came doctor she said fervently
because it was a last hope i love him
i can not give him up he lives alone
here except for a single servant who is
deaf i have been with him every day
since this influence claimed him at
night of course i can not be at his side
-and it is the night-time he fears
and the cause of his fear i
prompted

  i-i can not tell you

   knew better than to demand an ex-
planation without a word i returned to
my patient he was not sleeping for
when i stood over him his eyes opened
and he stared at me wearily i drew a
chair close to him and bent forward

  i want you to tell me i said simply
the entire story only under those con-
ditions can i help you do you under-
stand

  that-is impossible

   its necessary

  -cant do it briggs

  in that case i shrugged getting to
my feet i shall take you away from
here at once

  no no briggs you-you cant

the thing will-follow me it trailed me

to your offices it-

  it was the girl who cut him short she
stepped closer and took his hands firmly
and looked straight at me

  he is under oath to say nothing
doctor she said evenly

  under oath to whom

  his father sir guy

  then of course i shall see sir guy at

  he is-dead

  i stood silent glancing from one to
the other suddenly jthe girl straightened
up and stood erect her eyes blazing

  but i am not under oath she cried
almost savagely i will tell you-

  by god no the boy groped up
his face livid

  i understood then the courage in
lady sybils heart slim lovely as she
was she turned on him fiercely forcing
him back into the chair

  i am going to tell him she said bit-
terly do you hear the oath does not
bind me i am going to tell doctor
briggs all i know it is the only way to
help you

  then without releasing him she
turned her head toward me

  this house doctor she said is
very old and full of musty rooms and
corridors it is made hideous by a terri-
fying sound that comes always at night
from the upper galleries the sound is
inexplicable it is a horrible note which
begins with an almost inaudible moan
like the humming of an electric motor
then it increases in volume to the pitch
of a singsong voice rising and falling
tremulously finally it becomes a
screaming wail like a human soul in utter
torment

  she waited for my questions i said
nothing the boy had ceased his squirm-
ing and sat like a dead man glaring at
me out of lifeless eyes


weird tales

  the galleries have been examined
many times lady sybil said quietly
nothing has ever been discovered to
provide an explanation four times in
the past year the upper recesses of the
house have been wired for electric lights
but the lights in that portion of the house
never work no one knows why

and that-that is all i murmured
i think that is all except-the his-
tory of the house of ramsey you will
find that in the library doctor i will
remain here with edward

   i hesitated i did not think it vital at
that moment to go rummaging through
the library in pursuit of ancient lore but
lady sybil looked quietly at me and said
in an even voice

  the library is at the end of the main
corridor doctor you will find the neces-
sary books in section twelve

i did not argue there was no denying
that cool methodical tone before i
left the room however i examined my
patient carefully to be sure that i was
justified in leaving him he had sunk
into complete apathy his eyes remained
wide open as if he feared to close them
but the opiate had produced an effect of
semi-torpor and i knew that he would
not soon become violent again thus i
turned away and paced silently to the
door

  by a singular coincidence the door
opened as i reached it on the threshold
i came face to face with the servant a
ferret-faced fellow with deep-set color-
less eyes who peered at me suspiciously
as i went past him into the corridor

  in this manner after prowling down
the dimly illuminated passage i came to
the library and sought the particular sec-
tion which the girl had suggested sec-
tion twelve proved to be not in the main
library but in a secluded recess leading
into the very farthest comer the walls

before me were lined with long shelves
of books symmetrically arranged an
ancient daw-footed desk stood in the cen-
ter and upon it a gargoyle reading-lamp
which i promptly turned on

  the alcove had obviously been unused
for some time a layer of dust hung over
it like a funeral shroud its musty vol-
umes were sealed with a film of dirt ex-
cept-and this is what led me forward
eagerly-for a certain shelf which lay al-
most directly beneath the lamp the
books on this particular shelf had been
recently removed and had been thrown
back carelessly

  i took one of the volumes to the desk
and bent over it it contained in some
detail a history of the house in which i
stood and a lengthy description of its
occupants since time immemorial allow
me to quote from it

  sir guy ramsey - evi-
dently the father of my patient eton
and cambridge here followed an ac-
count of an adventurous and courageous
life in the year  sir guy was
suddenly stricken with an inexplicable
fear of darkness despite all efforts to
discover the reason of his terror no cause
was revealed and sir guy refused to
divulge any in september of the same
year sir guy became utterly mad with
fear and spoke continually of a certain
specter which had taken possession of
him physidans were unable to effect a
cure and on the ninth day of the month
of september sir guy was found in the
upper galleries where he had to all ap-
pearances been strangled to death

  his own hands clutched his throat
but upon his hands were certain marks
and bruises which revealed the imprint of
another set of fingers in these imprints
the thumb of the unknown murderers
left hand was singularly missing no clue
has ever been discovered as to the identity
of the assailant
the ghoul gallery



  i closed the book slowly mechanical-
ly i opened a second of those significant
volumes which proved to be an account
of the life and death of another of sir
edwards forebears from the dates i
judged the gentleman to be sir edwards
grandfather-the father of the man whose
fate i had just learned his name pecul-
iarly was also sir edward

  on the twenty-seventh day of january
in the year  sir edward was sudden-
ly noticed to be prowling fearfully in the
upper galleries from that time on he
was observed to be very much in the throes
of acute terror but when accused of this
sir edward refused to confide the nature
of his fear on february first he was
found choked to death in the upper gal-
leries his own hands twisted into his
throat and the imprint of another set of
hands with the thumb of the left hand
missing still evident on his dead wrists

  the murderer was not discovered
for three years after sir edwards death
the galleries were closed and sealed after
a careful inspection by the police at the
end of that period they were again opened
by command of sir guy son of the de-
ceased

  and there was one other passage-a
paragraph or two describing the sudden
death of some distinguished lady far back
in the archives her name according to
the book before me was lady carolyn

  a woman the script said imbued
with the same fearless courage which
marked the men of her blood in the
final days of her life she lived alone in
the london house she left a single part-
ing message found after her death i
am becoming insane the specter has
ebbed my last bit of resistance madness
is after all a fitting death-much better
than eternal fear and horror

  this note was found on the morning
of july third  lady carolyn was
murdered strangled to death by unknown 

hands on the night the note was written
her unfortunate body was discovered in
the galleries her fingers still clutching
her dead throat and the marks of other
fingers with the thumb of the left hand
missing imprinted on the back of her
hands and wrists for three years fol-
lowing her death every effort was ex-
pended to locate the fiend who had so
brutally destroyed her the attempt was
without avail

  i make no effort to explain these quo-
tations they are significant in them-
selves as for the specter i could find
no further mention of it page after page
i turned hoping to discover some clue
which might lead to a solution i found
nothing

  i did however chance upon some-
thing of unusual interest in the oldest of
the heavy volumes it was an account of
a very ancient feud the names men-
tioned were those of sir godfrey ram-
sey the date was in the century before
the french revolution and sir richard
ravenal the account gave mention of
several brutal killings and disappearances
the majority of these executed by the
house of ravenal the cause of the feud
was not divulged

  the hatred between the two families
however had come to an end with the
death of sir richard ravenal who was
to quote the withered page before me
an artist of unusual genius in the year
previous to his death having formed a
truce with the house of ramsey he did
present to sir godfrey ramsey one or
two paintings of great value executed by
himself as a token of eternal friendship
these paintings have been carefully pre-
served

  i sought faithfully for an account of
the life of this same sir godfrey eventu-
ally i found it and read the following

  twelve years after the houses of
ramsey and ravenal had formed the pact


weird tales

of peace sir godfrey was suddenly strick-
en with an incomprehensible terror which
led to complete madness he did call
his son sir james to him and say the
following words a curse has descended
upon the house of ramsey it is a curse
of horror of torment it is intended to
make gibbering idiots of the men who
bear the honored name of ramsey for
this reason i command you to an oath of
silence the curse has taken possession
of me and i shall die when you are of
age you too will be stricken by the spec-
ter swear to me that you will not reveal
the nature of the curse lest your sons
and their sons after them live in mortal
fear

  this oath was written into parchment
and preserved on the second day fol-
lowing its execution sir godfrey was
found lying in the upper galleries  

i closed the last volume with the un-
comfortable feeling of having delved
into a maze of horror and death in the
upper reaches of the very house in which
i stood countless members of the house
of ramsey had been hurled into madness
and cruelly murdered even now the
man who occupied these whispering
rooms and huge empty corridors was be-
ing slowly forced under the same hellish
influence of insanity i understood now
his reason for silence he was bound by
a family oath which had been passed
down from father to son he could not
speak

  the influence of that mad room still
hung over me as i paced across the library
and returned to the room where sir ed-
ward and lady sybil awaited me

  the boy was sleeping as i entered
lady sybil came toward me quietly and
stood before me

  you-have found the books she
whispered

  yes

  then you know why he is bound to
silence doctor he is the last of the
ramseys i-am the last of-the raven-
als

  i stared at her i had not suspected
any connection between the names in
those ancient volumes and the name of
the girl before me peering into her feat-
ures now i felt suddenly as if i had been
plunged into an affair of death itself
she-the last of the ravenals

  he has never broken the oath she
murmured not even to me i have never
remained here at night-never seen the
specter but i have questioned the ser-
vants who fled from here and so i
know

  i turned to my patient he was sleep-
ing peacefully now and i thanked god
that the terror had temporarily left him
lady sybil said softly

  i shall stay here the night so long
as you are here doctor i can not leave
him now

  she walked quietly to the divan and
made it as comfortable as possible i did
not suggest that she go to one of the
sleeping-chambers on the floor above for
my part i could not consider waking my
patient i would have to sit by him
through the night and i knew that she
too preferred to be close to him at any
rate i hadnt the cruelty to suggest that
she remain alone in one of those shad-
owed deathly silent rooms on the upper
corridor through the long hours of sinis-
ter darkness that confronted us

  i think that she slept very soon after
she lay down when i bent over her a
moment later to drape a silken coverlet
over her lovely figure she did not stir

  i realized then that i was the only per-
son awake in this massive spectral house
i was alone with the unknown being that
patrolled the upper galleries i closed the
door of the room and bolted it very
quietly i returned to my chair and low-
the ghoul gallery



ered myself then i sat there staring
fearfully into the deepening shadows un-
til i dozed into a fitful slumber

if the specter of the house of ram-
sey crept out of its hidden lair that
night i did not know it when i awoke
a welcome sunlight was sliding across the
floor at my feet from the opposite win-
dow i was alone in the room sir ed-
ward and lady sybil had vanished

  i stood up it was difficult to believe
in this glow of warm sunlight that any-
thing unusual had occurred during the
night

  evidently nothing had the door
opened behind me and the ferret-faced
servant scuffling forward said evenly
breakfast is waiting sir

  i followed him to the dining-hall and
there found my two companions lady
sybil rose to greet me with a smile the
boy remained seated his face was ex-
tremely haggard and white he nodded
heavily

  thought wed let you sleep briggs
he said you earned it

  he did not refer again to the previous
night lady sybil too maintained a dis-
creet silence when the meal was over i
called her to me

  i shall stay here i said until i am
sure that his terror does not return i do
not feel justified in leaving the house at
the present time

  you wish me to do something doc-
tor

  i gave her a prescription in substance
the desired medicine was little more than
a tonic though it contained a slight por-
tion of morphine it would serve to keep
the boys nerves under control but i real-
ized even then that the cause of his fear
must be removed before any medicine
would benefit him

  lady sybil however promised to have

the prescription filled she had other
matters to attend to she said and would
probably return some time in the late
afternoon

  when she had gone i sought out once
again those significant volumes that i
had found the night before i studied
them for a very long time it must have
been well after two oclock when sir ed-
ward came into the library

  he slouched into a chair and remained
there without any display of animation
or life when i got quietly to my feet
and replaced the lastbook on the shelf
he looked at me without emotion

  where to briggs he said dully

  with your permission i replied i
should like to have a look at the galler-
ies

  he nodded i fancied that the slight-
est cloud of suspicion crossed his face
but he offered no objections

  i had difficulty in finding my way the
route which led to the upper levels was no
easy one to follow winding as it did
through a succession of peculiarly dark
and unlighted corridors eventually how-
ever i found myself at the bottom of a
circular staircase that coiled upward into
the gloom of the floor above i mounted
the steps slowly holding to the great
carved bannister for support and having
reached the second landing i followed
the twistings of the passage by keeping
as close to the wall as possible

  at the end of this circular passage a
curtained window revealed the street be-
low as i peered down and saw the pave-
ment far below me i could not repress
a shudder

  cautiously i continued along this cor-
ridor to the bottom of a second stair-
case once again with heavy steps i
groped upward

   and here at the top of the last incline
i found the upper galleries of the house


weird tales

of ramsey the room lay directly before
me its massive door standing half open
revealed a thread of light from some hid-
den source-a gleam which penetrated
like a livid groping hand into the black-
ness of the passage

  i entered timidly leaving the door open
behind me before me extended a room
of enormous size more like a huge ban-
quet chamber than an art alcove the
illumination was intense coming as it did
from a series of four broad windows set
in the farther wall-windows which were
uncurtained and designed to flood the
interior with light

  for the rest the floor was lined with a
smooth carpet of dull hue the walls on
opposite sides of me as i moved forward
were devoted entirely to framed paint-
ings the rear wall which contained the
only entrance-through which i had
come-was carefully covered with a soft
gray drape cut to outline the wooden
panels of the door

i had taken no more than a dozen steps
forward into this strange chamber
when i came to an abrupt halt before
me as i stood motionless lay evidence
that my patient had been here before me
-a silk kerchief embroidered in black
with his emblem i recognized it in-
stantly he had worn it on the previous
evening tucked in the breast pocket of
his jacket and now it lay here on the
carpet damnable in its significance as i
stared down at it so he had not slept
the night through he had come here-
come to this death room to keep some in-
fernal midnight tryst

  i dropped the thing into my pocket
having done this i turned to inspect the
magnificent works of art that surrounded
me and then almost immediately after
that first startling episode came a sec-
ond shock a thousand times greater than
the first

  the thing glared out at me with hor-
rible malice it hung before me leering
into my face i recoiled from it with a
sudden intake of breath

  it was a skeleton painted in dull values
of gray and white with a single blur of
jet-black background created by an artist
who possessed a fiendish cunning for hor-
rifying the human eye every revolting
effect of death was incorporated into that
ghastly countenance and yet in a med-
ical sense the thing was far from perfect

  even as i stared at it i discerned a
dozen very evident faults of construction
hideous it was but hideous only because
the artist had sacrificed accuracy in order
to make it so

  the eye-sockets executed in a fiendish
combination of gray pigments were hor-
ribly empty and staring-but they were
too close-set to be natural the frontal
bone a streak of livid white was terrible
in its effect-but far too broad the two
superior maxillary bones forming the
upper jaw and bounding the glaring va-
cant nasal cavity were hideously formed
-but were separated on the under sur-
face from the row of broken teeth in or-
der to lend that maddening grin to the
mouth

  there were other defects easily recog-
nizable they were less significant but
as a work of horror the skeleton before
me was faultless never have i been so
completely unnerved by something which
i knew could hold no power over me

  i went toward it with irresolute steps
determined to inspect it at close range and
then leave the room immediately the
singular glare of its dead features had
sapped all my curiosity i wanted to get
away from it

  the painting was very old only three
colors were evident-white gray and
that sepulchral black at the bottom of
the heavy gilt frame i found the name of
the artist-a name which choked on my
the ghoul gallery



lips as i cried it aloud that name faint
and almost illegible was ravenal

  ravenal in the year previous to his
death having formed a truce with the
house of ramsey he did present to sir
godfrey ramsey one or two paintings of
great value executed by himself  

  i left the room with an inexplicable
sense of fear fascination it might have
been for that hideous thing behind me
horror it might have been for the slow
realization that here-here in this fiend-
ish picture-lay the secret of innumera-
ble murders and a hellish curse of mad-
ness

there is little more to tell the con-
cluding event of my stay in the
house of ramsey was not long in forth-
coming

  the hour was already late when i re-
turned to the library on the lower floor
sir edward had not moved from his
position he greeted me with a nod and
the girl who had returned during my
tour of inspection came toward me to
give me the medicine i had ordered

  i forced the boy to take it then in
depressing silence we sat there the three
of us as the hour grew later and later
lady sybil and i made a feeble attempt
to play backgammon but the boys glassy
eyes haunted us the game was a mock-
ery

   when ten oclock came i rose and took
the boys arm

   a nights sleep i said sternly would
be one of your best medicines

   he glanced at me wearily as if it hurt
him to move

  you are turning in briggs

  tr 

     am

  he sank back into his chair with a
half-inaudible murmur i motioned quiet-
ly to lady sybil thinking that if she left

him he would be certain to come with us
rather than be left alone the girl had
already prepared a room for herself on
the upper floor

  but the boy did not move as i drew the
door shut he looked up suddenly and
spoke in a voice that was strangely harsh

  leave it open briggs ill-go to
bed in a while closed doors are ghastly
-just now

  in the corridor outside i said good-
night to lady sybil and climbed the stairs
to my room the room opened on an
unlighted passage-a narrow gloomy
tunnel that twisted from darkness into
darkness revealed only by the glow of
light from my own chamber

  the hands of my watch as i laid the
timepiece carefully upon the table stood
at thirty-two minutes after ten oclock
no sound stirred in the great house lady
sybil having climbed the stairs behind
me had gone to her room at the far end
of the corridor below stairs the serv-
ant of the penetrating eyes had evidently
retired

  it was perhaps fifteen minutes later
when i heard sir edwards step on the
stairs he climbed wearily inertly his
tread moved along the corridor i heard
the door of his chamber open and close
after that there was nothing but an omi-
nous depressing sinister silence

  i left my door open most men in my
position would i presume have closed
it and made haste to throw the bolt but
i found comfort such as it was in an
open exit i had no desire to be a rat in
a trap

  nervously i switched off the light and
sank wearily to the bed there i lay
facing the half-open door striving to get
rid of my thoughts and there i lay
when a long time later i was dimly con-
scious that the silence had dissolved into
sound


weird tales

it had no definite beginning no posi-
tive substance only in the acute still-
ness of the capacious structure would it
have been audible at all even then it was
no more than a dead hum like the drone
of muted smothered machinery

  it increased in volume for fully sixty
seconds perhaps longer i lay unmoving
as the sound became a throbbing waver-
ing reality i twisted about to stare at
the door as if i expected the vibrations
to filter into my room and take the form
of some ghastly supernatural being

  then i heard something more-the
distinct tread of human feet advancing
quietly along the passage outside and
i saw it-saw the hunched form of sir
edward ramsey creeping slowly along
the corridor visible for a moment only
he passed the open door of my chamber
an unearthly mask of sepulchral light
surrounded him-an obscure bluish vapor
that seemed to rise out of the floor at his
feet and hang about him like an ethereal
cloak a protean winding-sheet and i
shall never forget the fear-haunted glare
of the boys eyes as he moved through the
darkness

  he walked as though an inner force
guided him forward his hands hung
lifelessly at his sides his face was tense
and ghastly gray strained to an almost
diabolical degree of expectancy and
then passing out of my range of vision
he vanished

  i sprang from the bed and reached
the door in a stride there i stopped
with both hands clutching the door-frame
the sound of his footsteps had already
died but another form was coming si-
lently out of the darkness and moving
past me the form of lady sybil-fol-
lowing him

  i did not hesitate then i knew as
surely as if the walls themselves were
screeching it out to me that the boy was

going to those infernal galleries in the
upper recesses of the house and up
there would be that eternal fiend of mur-
der and madness-that unnamed horror
which had for centuries preyed on the
inhabitants of this ghastly dwelling

  groping into the passage behind those
two grim figures i fell into the mute
procession far above me that dirge of
hell had risen to a whimpering moan-
a human voice in torment-rising and
falling with my steps as i paced forward

  i saw the two figures before me now
-the boy still enveloped in that weird
mist the girl silhouetted behind him
his tread was the tread of a man who had
repeated this midnight journey many
times and knew every creaking board
every turn of the passage every twist of
the long winding stairways that led into
the upper gloom

  he paced on-and on behind him
crouched the girl shadowing him as a
jungle cat might shadow some unknown
half-dreaded quarry i saw that evil
shroud of unnatural light ascend the
stairs hovering about him-saw it grope
down the second labyrinth-saw it climb
again up up into the stygian murk the
girl crept after him and i trailed behind
with the utmost caution lest he should
turn and find me behind him

  only once-before the door of that
chamber of abhorrence at the very roof
of the house-did he hesitate then
swinging the heavy barrier open he en-
tered

  through that open doorway in trip-
led intensity came the voice of the house
of ramsey it beat upon me in waves-
a terrific summons whining hideously
rising and falling with infuriate vehe-
mence and i knew in that frantic mo-
ment why sir edward had not fled in
terror from this place of pestilence he
could not that spectral voice possessed

                    w t-
the ghoul gallery



a spell that would allow no man to leave
it was irresistible in its cunning

  i slunk forward the girl had already
crossed the threshold as i slipped
through the aperture i saw them directly
before me-lady sybil pressed flat against
the wall the boy surrounded by that
protean well of light standing motionless
with both hands uplifted

  the room was a pit of blackness ex-
cept for that bluish cone of light a chill
sensation took possession of me i knew
that we were not alone i felt a malig-
nant gloating presence invisible but sen-
tient all about me emanated that tenu-
ous thread of sound high-pitched now
and wailing in an almost articulate voice
human

  the boy crept forward he breathed
heavily his body quivered and trembled
like a thing disjointed i knew instinc-
tively what he wanted it was that grim
thing on the farther wall

  mechanically my eyes turned to stare
at it then overcome by what i saw i
fell back

   a wall of darkness faced me to right
to left above and below not a single
detail of its construction was visible-
except one there in the very space where
that gleaming skeleton had hung before
a mad thing leered out at me

  it was no dead rack of bones-not now
it was a face-a living twisted cruel
face set atop a writhing body even as
i watched a mist of phosphorescent light
bluish white began to emanate from it
the rack of bones became a glowing torso
taking on human form

  young ramsey stood glued to the floor
before it behind me i heard a stifled
sob come from the girls lips i could
not advance-could not move

  slowly the thing changed contour
slowly it twisted forward coiling its sin-
w t-

uous way out of the great gilt frame it
was a skeleton no longer it had become
an undead form indefinite in shape
swelling and contracting to grotesque
mockeries of human mold i saw a misty
outline of ancient clothing hanging from
its limbs-a garb that was hundreds of
years old in style and the face lifted
in terrible malice was the face of an
english nobleman

  it burned with a frightful glow vivid
and unnatural the living dead hands
writhed up-up to the things own throat
with evil suggestiveness

  and then as if from a great distance
a strangled screech split the silence of that
room of death the specters lips curled
apart revealing a double row of broken
teeth words came through them vi-
cious compelling words

  to strangle ones self is better than
to be mad for eternity do you hear
ramsey to strangle ones self-

  sir edward stumbled back away from
it i saw his hands jerk up to his throat
i saw that fiendish dead-alive creature
lunge toward him

  then a thin cry rose behind me
from lady sybils lips i was pushed
roughly aside sobbing wildly the girl
dashed past me and fell upon the great
gilt frame slashing at it with a knife-
like thing which she clutched in her hand
flat against it she raked the canvas into
ribbons clawing ripping at it in sheer
madness

  i think it was the sight of her over-
come by the horror of what we had seen
that made me move i swung about
lurched forward against the wall close
to that living monstrosity reeled sir ed-
ward his face was livid with insanity-
insanity brought on by the damned thing
that grappled with him his mouth was
twisted apart thick with blood and foam
his body twisted convulsively and his


weird tales

hands-his own hands-were clenched
in his throat

  that shapeless thing was all about him
hideously malformed it had no limits
no bounds it was a mold of bluish mist
with leering face and groping hands and
the hands-god i can never forget them
they were huge hairy black they were
twined about the boys wrists forcing
the boys fingers into his own throat
strangling him murdering him and
the thumb of the hairy left hand was
missing

  with a mighty jerk i wrenched those
fingers from their hold behind me the
girl was still hacking at the contents of
the huge frame tearing the canvas the
wailing shriek rose to a frenzy-shrilled
higher and higher

  then all at once the voice became a
sob-a sob of unspeakable anguish as the
girls knife struck home it gurgled into
silence the massive shape before me dis-
solved into a circular throbbing writhing
wraith of fog with only hands and face
visible the face lifted upward in agony
the hands clenched on themselves doubled
into knots before my eyes the thing be-
came a blurred outline and then-noth-
ing

  young ramsey slid to the floor on
hands and knees in a dead faint i
whirled about stufnbling to lady sybils
side

  neither of us noticed then that the
room was once more in utter darkness
we were intent upon only one thing
together we tore at that infernal paint-
ing dragging it out of its frame raking
it to shreds

  the frame fell with a crash hurtling
down upon us lady sybil reeled back
with a cry of fear i held her erect to-
gether we stood there staring-staring
into something empty and black and sin-
ister

presently i found courage enough
to grope for a match and strike it i
blundered forward only to stop as if an
outflung hand had suddenly thrust me
back while the match dropped from my
fingers i must have screamed

  but i was saturated with horror i was
immune to anything more grimly i
found a second match and with the yel-
low glare preceding me stepped into the
aperture revealed by the falling of the
picture

  the space was long thin hardly more
than three feet deep-a silent ancient
vault there lying at my feet extended
an oblong box black and forbidding
with closed cover a coffin

  i scratched another match and lifted
the cover slowly glowering up at me
made livid by the light of the match lay
a skeletonic form long dead crumbling
in decay

  i stared down at it for an eternity it
was repulsive even in death the skull
was a grinning mask the hands were
folded on the chest-and the thumb of
the left hand was missing

  beneath those hands lay something
else-a rectangular plate of tarnished
metal engraved with minute lettering i
picked it out with nervous fingers

  the legend was hardly visible i rubbed
the metal on the sleeve of my coat scrap-
ing away the film of dust but the en-
graving had been scored deep holding
the match close to it i made out the
words

  sir richard ravenal famous artist eternal
seeker into the secrets of the undead his body
placed here secretly by his son in accord with a
request made before his death the hatred between
ramsey and ravenal may never die

  mechanically i returned the inscription
to its resting-place the girl stood behind
me i stepped past her out of the vault
and paced across the gallery to where sir
the ghoul gallery



edward ramsey lay motionless on the
floor

  lifting him in my arms i turned to
the door

  come i said to the girl

  she followed me out of the room in
silence we descended the black staircase
to the lower levels there in the boys
chamber i lowered sir edward to the
bed and bringing my medicine kit from
my own room i worked over him until
he regained consciousness

  the boy stared up at me reaching out
to clutch my hand he was weak pathet-
ically weak but the haunted sheen of
terror was gone out of his eyes i moved
away allowing lady sybil to take my
place

  then i left them there-those two who
loved each other with a love that was
more intense than the most utter terror
of this gaunt house

  i	groped down the main staircase to
the servants level and roused the ferret-
faced deaf man together we climbed
to the galleries there we dragged forth
that grim coffin with its horrible contents

  later in die kitchen of that sinister
house we kindled a great fire into it
we cast the remains of the shattered pic-
ture into it we threw the oblong box

  and we stood there side by side with
die scarlet glare of the flames reflected
in our faces until the curse of the house
of ramsey had burned to a handful of
dead ashes

  vh weird of
  avoosl wuthoqquan

by clark ashton smith

a fantastic tale of two magnificent emeralds and how they returned to the
vampiric entity that owned them

a

 give give o magnanimous and
 liberal lord of the poor cried
 the beggar

 avoosl wuthoqquan the richest and
most avaricious money-lender in all com-
moriom and by that token in the whole
of hyperborea was startled from his
train of revery by the sharp eery cicada-
like voice he eyed the supplicant with
acidulous disfavor his meditations as
he walked homeward diat evening had
been splendidly replete with the shining
of costly metals with coins and ingots
and gold-work and argentry and the flam-

ing or sparkling of many-tinted gems in
rills and rivers and cascades all flowing
toward the coffers of avoosl wuthoq-
quan now the vision had flown and
this untimely and obstreperous voice was
imploring him for alms

  i have nothing for you his tones
were like the grating of a shut clasp

  only two pazoors o generous one
and i will prophesy

  avoosl wuthoqquan gave the beggar
a second glance he had never seen so
disreputable a specimen of the mendicant
class in all his wayfarings through com-


weird tales

moriom the man was preposterously
old and his mummy-brown skin wher-
ever visible was webbed with wrinkles
that were like the heavy weaving of some
giant jungle spider his rags were no less
than fabulous and the beard that hung
down and mingled with them was hoary
as the moss of a primeval juniper

  i do not require your prophecies

  one pazoor then

  no

  the eyes of the beggar became evil and
malignant in their hollow sockets like
the heads of two poisonous little pit-
vipers in their holes

  then o avoosl wuthoqquan he
hissed i will prophesy gratis harken
to your weird the godless and exceeding
love which you bear to all material things
and your lust therefor shall lead you on
a strange quest and bring you to a doom
whereof the stars and the sun will alike
be ignorant the hidden opulence of
earth shall allure you and ensnare you
and earth itself shall devour you at the
last

  begone said avoosl wuthoqquan
the weird is more than a trifle cryptic
in its earlier clauses and the final clause
is somewhat platitudinous i do not need
a beggar to tell me the common fate of
mortality



it was many moons later in that year
which became known to pre-glacial his-
torians as the year of the black tiger

  avoosl wudioqquan sat in a lower
chamber of his house which was also his
place of business the room was oblique-
ly shafted by the brief aerial gold of the
reddening sunset which fell through a
crystal window lighting a serpentine line
of irised sparks in the jewel-studded lamp
that hung from copper chains and touch-
ing to fiery life the tortuous threads of

silver and similor in the dark arrases
avoosl wuthoqquan seated in an umber
shadow beyond the lane of light peered
with an austere and ironic mien at his
client whose swarthy face and somber
mantle were gilded by the passing glory

  the man was a stranger possibly a
travelling merchant from outland realms
the usurer thought-or else an outlander
of more dubious occupation his narrow
slanting beryl-green eyes his bluish un-
kempt beard and the uncouth cut of his
sad raiment were sufficient proof of his
alienage in commoriom

  three hundred djals is a large sum
said the money-lender thoughtfully
moreover i do not know you what
security have you to offer

  the visitor produced from the bosom
of his garment a small bag of tigerskin
tied at the mouth with sinew and open-
ing the bag with a deft movement poured
on the table before avoosl wuthoqquan
two uncut emeralds of immense size and
flawless purity they flamed at the heart
with a cold and ice-green fire as they
caught the slanting sunset and a greedy
spark was kindled in the eyes of the
usurer but he spoke coolly and in-
differently

  it may be that i can loan you one
hundred and fifty djals emeralds are
hard to dispose of and if you should not
return to claim the gems and repay me
the money i might have reason to repent
my generosity but i will take the
hazard

  the loan i ask is a mere tithe of their
value protested the stranger give me
two hundred and fifty djals    there
are other money-lenders in commoriom
i am told

  two hundred djals is the most i can
offer it is true that the gems are not
without value but you may have stolen
them how am i to know it is not my
habit to ask indiscreet questions
the weird of avoosl wuthoqquan



  take them said the stranger hastily
he accepted the silver coins which avoosl
wuthoqquan counted out and offered no
further protest the usurer watched him
with a sardonic smile as he departed and
drew his own inferences he felt sure
that the jewels had been stolen but was
in no wise perturbed or disquieted by this
fact no matter whom they had belonged
to or what their history they would
form a welcome and valuable addition to
the coffers of avoosl wuthoqquan even
the smaller of the two emeralds would
have been absurdly cheap at three hun-
dred djals but the usurer felt no appre-
hension that the stranger would return to
claim them at any time    no the man
was plainly a thief and had been glad to
rid himself of the evidence of his guilt
as to the rightful ownership of the gems
-that was hardly a matter to arouse the
concern or the curiosity of the money-
lender they were his own property now
by virtue of the sum in silver which had
been tacitly regarded by himself and the
stranger as a price rather than a mere loan

  the sunset faded swiftly from the
room and a brown twilight began to dull
the metal broideries of the curtains and
the colored eyes of the gems avoosl
wuthoqquan lit the fretted lamp and
then opening a small brazen strong-box
he poured from it a flashing rill of
jewels on the table beside the emeralds
there were pale and ice-clear topazes
from mhu thulan and gorgeous crystals
of tourmalin from tscho vulpanomi
there were chill and furtive sapphires of
the north and arctic camelians like frozen
blood and diamonds that were hearted
with white stars red unblinking rubies
glared from the coruscating pile cha-
toyants shone like the eyes of tigers
garnets and alabraundins gave their som-
ber flames to the lamplight amid the rest-
less hues of opals also there were
other emeralds but none so large and

flawless as the two that he had acquired
that evening

avoosl wuthoqquan sorted out the
i gems in gleaming rows and circles
as he had done so many times before and
he set apart all the emeralds with his new
acquisitions at one end like captains lead-
ing a file he was well pleased with his
bargain well satisfied with overflowing
caskets he regarded the jewels with an
avaricious love a miserly complacence and
one might have thought that his eyes were
little beads of jasper set in his leathery
face as in the smoky parchment cover of
some olden book of doubtful magic
money and precious gems-these things
alone he thought were immutable and
non-volatile in a world of never-ceasing
change and fugacity

  his reflections at this point were in-
terrupted by a singular occurrence sud-
denly and without warning-for he had
not touched or disturbed them in any
manner-the two large emeralds started
to roll away from their companions on
the smooth level table of black ogga-
wood and before the startled money-
lender could put out his hand to stop
them they had vanished over the op-
posite edge and had fallen with a muffled
rattling on the carpeted floor

  such behavior was highly eccentric and
peculiar not to say unaccountable but
the usurer leapt to his feet with no other
thought save to retrieve the jewels he
rounded the table in time to see that they
had continued their mysterious rolling
and were slipping through the outer door
which the stranger in departing had left
slightly ajar this door gave on a court-
yard and the courtyard in turn opened
on the streets of commoriom

 avoosl wuthoqquan was deeply
alarmed but was concerned by the pros-
pect of losing the emeralds rather than
by the eeriness and mystery of their de-


weird tales

parture he gave chase with an agility of
which few would have believed him
capable and throwing open the door he
saw the fugitive emeralds gliding with
an uncanny smoothness and swiftness
across the rough irregular flags of the
courtyard the twilight was deepening
to a nocturnal blue but the jewels seemed
to wink derisively with a strange phos-
phoric luster as he followed them clear-
ly visible in the gloom they passed
through the unbarred gate that gave on
a principal avenue and disappeared

  it began to occur to avoosl wuthoq-
quan that the jewels were bewitched but
not even in the face of an unknown sor-
cery was he willing to relinquish anything
for which he had paid the munificent sum
of two hundred djals he gained the
open street with a running leap and
paused only to make sure of the direction
in which his emeralds had gone

  the dim avenue was almost entirely
deserted for the worthy citizens of com-
moriom at that hour were preoccupied
with the consumption of their evening
meal the jewels gaining momentum
and skimming the ground lightly in their
flight were speeding away on the left
toward the less reputable suburbs and the
wild luxuriant jungle beyond avoosl
wuthoqquan saw that he must redouble
his pursuit if he were to overtake them

  panting and wheezing valiantly with
the unfamiliar exertion he renewed the
chase but in spite of all his efforts the
jewels ran always at the same distance
before him with a maddening ease and
eery volitation tinkling musically at whiles
on the pavement the frantic and be-
wildered usurer was soon out of breath
and being compelled to slacken his speed
he feared to lose sight of the eloping
gems but strangely thereafterward they
ran with a slowness that corresponded to
his own maintaining ever the same
interval

  the money-lender grew desperate the
flight of the emeralds was leading him
into an outlying quarter of commoriom
where thieves and murderers and beggars
dwelt here he met a few passers all of
dubious character who stared in stupefac-
tion at the fleeing stones but made no
effort to stop them then the foul ten-
ements among which he ran became
smaller with wider spaces between and
soon there were only sparse huts where
furtive lights gleamed out in the full-
grown darkness beneath the lowering
frondage of high palms

  still plainly visible and shining with
a mocking phosphorescence the jewels
fled before him on the dark road it
seemed to him however that he was
gaining upon them a little his flabby
limbs and pursy body were faint with
fatigue and he was grievously winded
but he went on in renewed hope gasping
with eager avarice a full moon large
and amber-tinted rose beyond the jungle
and began to light his way

commoriom was far behind him
now and there were no more huts
on the lonely forest road nor any other
wayfarers he shivered a little-either
with fear or the chill night air but he
did not relax his pursuit he was clos-
ing in on the emeralds very gradually
but surely and he felt that he would re-
capture them soon so engrossed was he
in die weird chase with his eyes on the
ever-rolling gems that he failed to per-
ceive that he was no longer following an
open highway somehow somewhere
he had taken a narrow path that wound
among monstrous trees whose foliage
turned the moonlight to a mesh of quick-
silver with heavy fantastic raddlings of
ebony crouching in grotesque menace
like giant retiarii they seemed to close in
upon him from all sides but the money-
the weird of avoosl wuthoqquan



lender was oblivious of their shadowy
threats and heeded not the sinister
strangeness and solitude of the jungle
path nor the dank odors that lingered
beneath the trees like unseen pools

  nearer and nearer he came to the
fleeting gems till they ran and flickered
tantalizingly a little beyond his reach
and seemed to look back at him like two
greenish glowing eyes filled with allure-
ment and mockery then as he was about
to fling himself forward in a last and
supreme effort to secure them they van-
ished abruptly from view as if they had
been swallowed by the forest shadows
that lay like sable pythons athwart the
moonlit way

  bafhed and disconcerted avoosl wuth-
oqquan paused and peered in bewilder-
ment at the place where they had disap-
peared he saw that the path ended in
a cavern-mouth yawning blackly and si-
lently before him and leading to un-
known subterranean depths it was a
doubtful and suspicious-looking cavern
fanged with sharp stones and bearded
with queer grasses and avoosl wuthoq-
quan in his cooler moments would have
hesitated a long while before entering it
but just then he was capable of no other
impulse than the fervor of the chase and
the prompting of avarice

  the cavern that had swallowed his
emeralds in a fashion so nefarious was a
steep incline running swiftly down into
darkness it was low and narrow and
slippery with noisome oozings but the
money-lender was heartened as he went
on by a glimpse of the glowing jewels
which seemed to float beneath him in the
black air as if to illuminate his way the
incline led to a level winding passage in
which avoosl wuthoqquan began to over-
take his elusive property once more and
hope flared high in his panting bosom

  the emeralds were almost within
reach then with sleightful suddenness

they slipped from his ken beyond an
abrupt angle of the passage and follow-
ing them he paused in wonder as if
halted by an irresistible hand he was
half blinded for some moments by the
pale mysterious bluish light that poured
from the roof and walls of the huge cav-
ern into which he had emerged and he
was more than dazzled by the multi-tinted
splendor that flamed and glowed and
glistened and sparkled at his very feet

  he stood on a narrow ledge of stone
and the whole chamber before and be-
neath him almost to the level of this
ledge was filled with jewels even as a
granary is filled with grain it was as if
all the rubies opals beryls diamonds
amethysts emeralds chrysolites and sap-
phires of the world had been gathered to-
gether and poured into an immense pit
he thought that he saw his own emeralds
lying tranquilly and decorously in a near-
er mound of the undulant mass but there
were so many others of like size and
flawlessness that he could not be sure of
them

for awhile he could hardly believe
the ineffable vision then with a sin-
gle cry of ecstasy he leapt forward from
the ledge sinking almost to his knees in
the shifting and tinkling and billowing
gems in great double handfuls he lifted
the flaming and scintillating stones and
let them sift between his fingers slowly
and voluptuously to fall with a light
clash on the monstrous heap blinking
joyously he watched the royal lights and
colors run in spreading or narrowing rip-
ples he saw them burn like stedfast coals
and secret stars or leap out in blazing
eyes that seemed to catch fire from each
other

  in his most audacious dreams the us-
urer had never even suspected the exist-
ence of such riches he babbled aloud in
a rhapsody of delight as he played with


weird tales

the numberless gems and he failed to
perceive that he was sinking deeper with
every movement into the unfathomable
pit the jewels had risen above his knees
were engulfing his pudgy thighs before
his avaricious rapture was touched by any
thought of peril

  then startled by the realization that
he was sinking into his new-found wealth
as into some treacherous quicksand he
sought to extricate himself and return to
the safety of the ledge he floundered
helplessly for the moving gems gave way
beneath him and he made no progress
but went deeper still till the bright un-
stable heap had risen to his waist

  avoosl wuthoqquan began to feel a
frantic terror amid the intolerable irony
of his plight he cried out and as if in
answer there came a loud unctuous evil
chuckle from the cavern behind him
twisting his fat neck with painful effort
so that he could peer over his shoulder
he saw a most peculiar entity that was
couching on a sort of shelf above the
pit of jewels the entity was wholly and
outrageously unhuman and neither did it
resemble any species of animal or any
known god or demon of hyperborea its
aspect was not such as to lessen the alarm
and panic of the money-lender for it
was very large and pale and squat with i
toad-like face and a swollen squidgy
body and numerous cuttlefish limbs or
appendages it lay flat on the shelf with
its chinless head and long slit-like mouth
overhanging the pit and its cold lidless
eyes peering obliquely at avoosl wuth-
oqquan the usurer was not reassured
when it began to speak in a thick and
loathsome voice like the molten tallow
of corpses dripping from a wizards ket-
tle

  ho what have we here it said
by the black altar of tsathoggua tis a
fat money-lender wallowing in my jew-
els like a lost pig in a quagmire

  help me cried avooslwuthoqquan
see you not that i am sinking

  the entity gave its oleaginous chuckle
yes i see your predicament of course

   what are you doing here

  i came in search of my emeralds-two
fine and flawless stones for which i have
just paid the sum of two hundred djals
your emeralds said the entity i
fear that i must contradict you the jew-
els are mine they were stolen not long
ago from this cavern in which i have
been wont to gather and guard my sub-
terranean wealth for many ages the
thief was frightened away    when he
saw me    and i suffered him to go he
had taken only the two emeralds and i
knew that they would return to me-as
my jewels always return-whenever i
choose to call them the thief was lean
and bony and i did well to let him go
for now in his place there is a plump
and well-fed usurer

  avoosl wuthoqquan in his mounting
terror was barely able to comprehend the
words or to grasp their implications he
had sunk slowly but steadily into the
yielding pile and green yellow red and
violet gems were blinking gorgeously
about his bosom and sifting with a light
tinkle beneath his armpits

  help help he wailed i shall be
engulfed

  grinning sardonically and showing
the cloven tip of a fat white tongue the
singular entity slid from the shelf with
boneless ease and spreading its flat body
on the pool of gems into which it hardly
sank it slithered forward to a position
from which it could reach the frantic
usurer with its octopus-like members it
dragged him free with a single motion
of incredible celerity then without
pause or preamble or further comment
in a leisurely and methodical fashion it
began to devour him

by helen m reid

to and fro to and fro in the shadows swung the form of the dead
man-a five-minute story

thump-thump-thump

spasmodically above the wail-
ing of the wind and the dismal
battering of the rain against the windows
the ominous sound was repeated

  thump-thump-thump

   something was hitting against the side
of the house-something heavy hannah
rose uneasily and laid down her sewing
susan would be coming for the dress in
the morning but she could not keep her
mind on the stitches

   she thought resentfully of judy the
ingrate that was the thanks you got for
twenty years of slaving to be left alone
with nothing to listen to but the wind
and the rain and that hideous thumping

  for perhaps the twentieth time that
night she pulled the shade back from one
of the windows and stared out into the
darkness thump-thump the sound
was close now but beyond the window
was an abyss of blackness in which she
could see nothing shivering she sat
down once more in front of the grate
where a fire struggled fitfully against the
fury of the storm without and the semi-
darkness of the room within in its wav-
ering circle of light she sat erect and de-
fiant the flames outlining her sharp fea-
tures and thin knot of graying hair

   it wasnt because she was getting old
she told herself sternly a night like this
would get on anybodys nerves if nate

hadnt cleared out as he did- she

frowned impatiently

   whered they a been without me id
like to know she muttered and now
they dont care what becomes o me
neither one o them

  anyway thank goodness the thumping
had stopped but what was that some-
one knocking who on earth would be
venturing out in such a storm but the
knocking was repeated

  resolutely she threw the door open a
rush of rain and wind blurred her vision
for an instant and in that instant a man
pushed past her a tall man thin and
somewhat stooped with straggling gray
hair that hung dripping about his seamed
face for in spite of the roughness of the
night he wore no hat

  hannah turned to face him then
abruptly she slammed the door shut and
locked it

  so youve come back to the old
woman have you she confronted him
scornfully found out nobody else
would put up with you i suppose

  he made no reply but settled himself
in his favorite chair by the grate

  thats right she went on bitingly
make yourself comfortable how youve
got nerve to come back after walking out
on me like you did i dont know

  seems to me you told me to walk
out his words were pleasant but dis-
turbingly sarcastic she noticed that his
usual docility of manner was entirely
gone

  better get on some dry clothes she
snapped youll catch your death of
cold

   a faintly sarcastic smile was his only
reply he made no movement and for
once she was at a loss what to say she
felt baffled and confused

   you told me to go he repeated and
i went why do you blame me

                                     


weird tales

  she felt her face growing hot at the
quiet rebuff

  blame you she retorted i blame
you for being a shiftless good-for-noth-
ing fool thats what look at clem
hanks you dont find him dilly-dally-
ing his time away and whats the result
he makes more money in a day than
youll ever make in a month and if
theres anything more useless than a man
that cant make a decent living i dont
know what it is

  you convinced me of that

  something in his voice made her look
at him intently nate she said slowly
you know i dont mean things half as
bad as i say them if id a thought you
had spunk enough to get out id a never
told you to and thats gods truth

  she pointed to the sewing that lay
where she had left it if it wasnt for
the work susan hanks gives me to do i
dont know how id keep body and soul

together now youre back maybe-

  wont judy help

  she fidgeted under the gaze of his

steady eyes that girl- she

checked herself

  well

   she left after you did

  because-

                          m

  because she turned against her own
mother thats why didnt i do every-
thing for her with my own hands and
now she takes sides with you im sure
i dont know why

  maybe i was of some use he sug-
gested

  land knows im glad enough you
came back i dont know whats come
over me but what with you gone and
judy gone this place is like a tomb
thump-thump-thump there it
was again

  i wish youd see what that is she

said it gave me quite a turn when i
was alone but now youre here-

  the fire had burned low nates chair
seemed to have drawn back into the
shadows

  you wont mind will you she was
not in the habit of asking that question
but tonight seemed different

  thump-thump-thump

  nate

   a sudden flare from the dying fire il-
lumined the room nates chair was
empty

  nate nate she called wildly

  the wind shrieked around the house
in a paroxysm of fury the rain lashed
against the windows there was no other
answer

  thump-thump

  a cold trembling seized her she ran
to the window and threw it open thump
-thump the thing was almost close
enough for her to touch she reached out
her hand closed on a sodden sleeve a
mans arm she screamed the next in-
stant she had swayed and fallen

  when she opened her eyes she was
stretched out in bed with susan hanks
bending over her

  clem heard you scream and came and
got me to look after you she explained

  is he-dead

  susan looked away yes she said

  cant they do-something there
was a note of pleading in hannahs harsh
voice he was in here she said i
was talkin to him just before i found
him-out there

  susan left the room quickly hannah
heard her speaking to someone in a low
voice then the words of clems reply
came to her distinctly

  better send for judy he said she
is delirious nate was hanging from
those eaves all evening the doctor says
hes been dead for hours

 the story thus far

robert walton captain of a
ship seeking a passage through the
 arctic ocean saw a low carriage
fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass
over the ice field to the north in it sat
a being which had the shape of a man
but apparently of gigantic stature

  the next morning after the ice had
broken he rescued from an ice-floe
another man greatly emaciated only one
of his dogs remained alive for he had
been marooned for some time

  the man was victor frankenstein a
young scientist who related to captain
walton the incredible story of his life and
how he came to be on the ice-floe

  frankenstein had lived in geneva with
his father and his adopted sister eliza-
beth to whom he was betrothed his
father sent him to school at ingolstadt
with his chum henry clerval there he
progressed in his studies of natural sci-
ence to such a point that he learned to
create life

  without taking clerval into his secret
in a garret room of the house where he
lived he set about creating a monster

eight feet tall and human in appearance
taking his materials from graveyards
slaughter-houses and dissecting-rooms

chapter 

it was on a dreary night of november
that i beheld the accomplishment of

my toils with an anxiety that almost
amounted to agony i collected the instru-
ments of life around me that i might in-
fuse a spark of being into the lifeless
thing that lay at my feet it was already
one in the morning the rain pattered dis-
mally against the panes and my candle
was nearly burnt out when by the glim-
mer of the half-extinguished light i saw
the dull yellow eyes of the creature open
it breathed hard and a convulsive motion
agitated its limbs

   how can i describe my emotions at this
catastrophe or how delineate the wretch
whom with such infinite pains and care i
had endeavored to form his limbs were
in proportion and i had selected his fea-
tures as beautiful beautiful-great
god his yellow skin scarcely covered
the work of muscles and arteries beneath
his hair was of a lustrous black and flow-

ing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but
these luxuriances only formed a more hor-
rid contrast with his watery eyes that
seemed almost of the same color as the
dun white sockets in which they were set
his shrivelled complexion and straight
black lips

  the different accidents of life are not
so changeable as the feelings of human
nature i had worked hard for nearly two
years for the sole purpose of infusing life
into an inanimate body for this i had
deprived myself of rest and health i had
desired it with an ardor that far exceeded
moderation but now that i had finished
the beauty of the dream vanished and
breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart unable to endure the aspect of the
being i had created i rushed out of the
room and continued a long time travers-
ing my bedchamber unable to compose
my mind to sleep at length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult i had before en-
dured and i threw myself on the bed in
my clothes endeavoring to seek a few
moments of forgetfulness but it was in
vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed
by the wildest dreams i thought i saw
elizabeth in the bloom of health walk-
ing in the streets of ingolstadt delight-
ed and surprized i embraced her but as i
imprinted the first kiss on her lips they
became livid with the hue of death her
features appeared to change and i thought
that i held the corpse of my dead mother
in my arms a shroud enveloped her form
and i saw the grave-worms crawling in
the folds of the flannel

  i started from my sleep with horror a
cold dew covered my forehead my teeth
chattered and every limb became con-
vulsed when by the dim and yellow light
of the moon as it forced its way through
the window shutters i beheld the wretch
-the miserable monster whom i had cre-
ated he held up the curtain of the bed
and his eyes if eyes they may be called

were fixed on me his jaws opened and
he muttered some inarticulate sounds
while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he
might have spoken but i did not hear
one hand was stretched out seemingly to
detain me but i escaped and rushed
downstairs

  i took refuge in the courtyard belong-
ing to the house which i inhabited where
i remained during the rest of the night
walking up and down in the greatest agi-
tation listening attentively catching and
fearing each sound as if it were to an-
nounce the approach of the demoniacal
corpse to which i had so miserably given
life

  oh no mortal could support the hor-
ror of that countenance a mummy again
endued with animation could not be so
hideous as that wretch i had gazed on
him while unfinished he was ugly then
but when those muscles and joints were
rendered capable of motion it became a
thing such as even dante could not have
conceived

  i passed the night wretchedly some-
times my pulse beat so quickly and hardly
that i felt the palpitation of every artery
at others i nearly sank to the ground
through languor and extreme weakness
mingled with this horror i felt the bitter-
ness of disappointment dreams that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long
a space were now become a hell to me
and the change was so rapid the over-
throw so complete

  morning dismal and wet at length
dawned and discovered to my sleepless
and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt
its white steeple and clock which indi-
cated the sixth hour the porter opened
the gates of the court which had that
night been my asylum and i issued into
the streets pacing them with quick steps
as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom
i feared every turning of the street would
present to my view i did not dare return
frankenstein



to the apartment which i inhabited but
felt impelled to hurry on although
drenched by the rain which poured from
a black and comfortless sky

i continued walking in this manner
for some time endeavoring by bodily
exercise to ease the load that weighed
upon my mind i traversed the streets
without any clear conception of where i
was or what i was doing my heart pal-
pitated in the sickness of fear and i hur-
ried on with irregular steps not daring to
look about me

    like one who on a lonely road

    doth walk in fear and dread

    and having once turned round walks on

    and turns no more his head

    because he knows a frightful fiend
    doth close behind him tread

   continuing thus i came at length op-
posite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped
here i paused i knew not why but i
remained some minutes with my eyes
fixed on a coach that was coming toward
me from the other end of the street as
it drew nearer i observed that it was the
swiss diligence it stopped just where i
was standing and on the door being
opened i perceived henry clerval who
on seeing me instantly sprung out my
dear frankenstein exclaimed he how
glad i am to see you how fortunate that
you should be here at the very moment of
my alighting

   nothing could equal my delight on see-
ing clerval his presence brought back to
my thoughts my father elizabeth and all
those scenes of home so dear to my recol-
lection i grasped his hand and in a
moment forgot my horror and misfortune
i felt suddenly and for the first time dur-
ing many months calm and serene joy i
welcomed my friend therefore in the
most cordial manner and we walked
towards my college

   clerval continued talking for some time
about our mutual friends and his own
good fortune in being permitted to come
to ingolstadt you may easily believe
said he how great was the difficulty to
persuade my father that all necessary
knowledge was not comprised in the noble
art of bookkeeping and indeed i believe
i left him incredulous to the last for his
constant answer to my unwearied entreaties
was the same as that of the dutch school-
master in the vicar of wakefield i have
ten thousand florins a year without greek
i eat heartily without greek but his af-
fection for me at length overcame his dis-
like of learning and he has permitted me
to undertake a voyage of discovery to the
land of knowledge

   it gives me the greatest delight to see
you but tell me how you left my father
brothers and elizabeth

   very well and very happy only a little
uneasy that they hear from you so seldom
by the by i mean to lecture you a little
upon their account myself but my dear
frankenstein continued he stopping
short and gazing full in my face i did
not before remark how very ill you appear
so thin and pale you look as if you had
been watching for several nights

   you have guessed right i have lately
been so deeply engaged in one occupation
that i have not allowed myself sufficient
rest as you see but i hope i sincerely
hope that all these employments are now
at an end and that i am at length free
i trembled excessively i could not en-
dure to think of and far less to allude to
the occurrences of the preceding night
i walked with a quick pace and we soon
arrived at my college i then reflected
and the thought made me shiver that the
creature whom i had left in my apartment
might still be there alive and walking
about i dreaded to behold this monster
but i feared still more that henry should
see him entreating him therefore to

remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs i darted up towards my own room

  my hand was already on the lode of the
door before i recollected myself i then
paused and a cold shivering came over
me i threw the door forcibly open as
children are accustomed to do when they
expect a specter to stand in waiting for
them on the other side but nodiing ap-
peared i stepped fearfully in the apart-
ment was empty and my bedroom was
also freed from its hideous guest i could
hardly believe that so great a good fortune
could have befallen me but when i be-
came assured that my enemy had indeed
fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran
down to clerval

we ascended into my room and the
servant presently brought break-
fast but i was unable to contain myself
it was not joy only that possessed me i
felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensi-
tiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was
unable to remain for a single instant in
the same place i jumped over the chairs
clapped my hands and laughed aloud
clerval at first attributed my unusual
spirits to joy on his arrival but when he
observed me more attentively he saw a
wildness in my eyes for which he could
not account and my loud unrestrained
heartless laughter frightened and aston-
ished him

  my dear victor cried he what for
gods sake is the matter do not laugh
in that manner how ill you are what
is the cause of all this

  do not ask me cried i putting my
hands before my eyes for i thought i saw
the dreaded specter glide into the room
he can tell-oh save me save me i
imagined that the monster seized me i
struggled furiously and fell down in a fit

  poor clerval what must have been his
feelings a meeting which he antic-
ipated with such joy so strangely turned

to bitterness but i was not the witness
of his grief for i was lifeless and did not
recover my senses for a long long time

  this was the commencement of a nerv-
ous fever which confined me for several
months during all that time henry was
my only nurse i afterwards learned that
knowing my fathers advanced age and
unfitness for so long a journey and how
wretched my sickness would make eliza-
beth he spared them this grief by con-
cealing the extent of my disorder he
knew that i could not have a more kind
and attentive nurse than himself and
firm in the hope he felt of my recovery
he did not doubt that instead of doing
harm he performed the kindest action
that he could toward them

  but i was in reality very ill and surely
nothing but the unbounded and unremit-
ting attentions of my friend could have
restored me to life the form of the
monster on whom i had bestowed exist-
ence was for ever before my eyes and i
raved incessantly concerning him doubt-
less my words surprized henry he at first
believed them to be the wanderings of my
disturbed imagination but the pertinacity
with which i continually recurred to the
same subject persuaded him that my dis-
order indeed owed its origin to some un-
common and terrible event

  by very slow degrees and with frequent
relapses that alarmed and grieved my
friend i recovered i remember the first
time i became capable of observing out-
ward objects with any kind of pleasure i
perceived that the fallen leaves had dis-
appeared and that the young buds were
shooting forth from the trees that shaded
my window it was a divine spring and
the season contributed greatly to my con-
valescence i felt also sentiments of joy
and affection revive in my bosom my
gloom disappeared and in a short time i
became as cheerful as before i was at-
tacked by the fatal passion
frankenstein



  deafest gerval exclaimed i how
kind how very good you are to me this
whole winter instead of being spent in
study as you promised yourself has been
consumed in my sick room how shall i
ever repay you i feel the greatest re-
morse for the disappointment of which i
have been the occasion but you will for-
give me

   you will repay me entirely if you do
not discompose yourself but get well as
fast as you can and since you appear in
such good spirits i may speak to you on
one subject may i not

  i trembled one subject what could
it be could he allude to an object on
whom i dared not even think

  compose yourself said clerval who
observed my change of color i will not
mention it if it agitates you but your
father and cousin would be very happy if
they received a letter from you in your
own handwriting they hardly know how
ill you have been and are uneasy at your
long silence

  is that all my dear henry how
could you suppose that my first thoughts
would not fly towards those dear dear
friends whom i love and who are so de-
serving of my love

  if this is your present temper my
friend you will perhaps be glad to see a
letter that has been lying here some days
for you it is from your cousin i believe

chapter 

clerval then put the following letter
into my hands it was from my own
elizabeth

  my dearest cousin-you have been
ill very ill and even the constant letters
of dear kind henry are not sufficient to
reassure me on your account you are
forbidden to write-to hold a pen yet
one word from you dear victor is neces-
sary to calm our apprehensions for a

long time i have thought that each post
would bring this line and my persuasions
have restrained my uncle from undertak-
ing a journey to ingolstadt i have pre-
vented his encountering the inconven-
iences and perhaps dangers of so long a
journey yet how often have i regretted
not being able to perform it myself i
figure to myself that the task of attending
on your sick bed has devolved on some
mercenary old nurse who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them
with the care and affection of your poor
cousin yet that is over now clerval
writes that indeed you are getting better
i eagerly hope that you will confirm this
intelligence soon in your own hand-
writing

  get well-and return to us you will
find a happy cheerful home and friends
who love you dearly your fathers health
is vigorous and be asks but to see you-
but to be assured that you are well and
not a care will ever cloud his benevolent
countenance how pleased you would be
to remark the improvement of our ernest
he is now sixteen and full of activity and
spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss
and to enter into foreign service but we
can not part with him at least until his
elder brother returns to us my uncle is
not pleased with the idea of a military
career in a distant country but ernest
never had your powers of application he
looks upon study as an odious fetter his
time is spent in the open air climbing the
hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he
will become an idler unless we yield the
point and permit him to enter on the pro-
fession which he has selected

  little alteration except the growth of
our dear children has taken place since
you left us the blue lake and snow-
clad mountains they never change and
i think our placid home and our contented
hearts are regulated by the same immu-
table laws my trifling occupations take


weird tales

up my time and amuse me and i am re-
warded for any exertions by seeing none
but happy kind faces around me

  since you left us but one change has
taken place in our little household do
you remember on what occasion justine
moritz entered our family probably you
do not i will relate her history therefore
in a few words madame moritz her
mother was a widow with four children
of whom justine was the third this girl
had always been the favorite of her father
but through a strange perversity her
mother could not endure her and after
the death of monsieur moritz treated her
very ill my aunt observed this and
when justine was twelve years of age
prevailed on her mother to allow her to
live at our house the republican insti-
tutions of our country have produced
simpler and happier manners than those
which prevail in the great monarchies that
surround it hence there is less distinc-
tion between the several classes of its in-
habitants and the lower orders being
neither so poor nor so despised their
manners are more refined and moral a
servant in geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in france and england
justine thus received in our family learned
the duties of a servant a condition which
in our fortunate country does not include
the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the
dignity of a human being

  justine you may remember was a
great favorite of yours and i recollect you
once remarked that if you were in an ill-
humor one glance from justine could dis-
sipate it for the same reason that ariosto
gives concerning the beauty of angelica
-she looked so frank-hearted and happy
my aunt conceived a great attachment for
her by which she was induced to give her
an education superior to that which she
had at first intended this benefit was
fully repaid justine was the most grateful
little creature in the world i do not mean

that she made any professions i never
heard one pass her lips but you could see
by her eyes that she almost adored her
protectress although her disposition was
gay and in many respects inconsiderate
yet she paid the greatest attention to every
gesture of my aunt she thought her the
model of all excellence and endeavored
to imitate her phraseology and manners
so that even now she often reminds me
of her

  when my dearest aunt died every
one was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor justine who had at-
tended her during her illness with the
most anxious affection poor justine was
very ill but other trials were reserved for
her

  one by one her brothers and sister
died and her mother with the exception
of her neglected daughter was left child-
less the conscience of the woman was
troubled she began to think that the
deaths of her favorites was a judgment
from heaven to chastise her partiality she
was a roman catholic and i believe her
confessor confirmed the idea which she
had conceived accordingly a few
months after your departure for ingol-
stadt justine was called home by her re-
pentant mother poor girl she wept when
she quitted our house she was much al-
tered since the death of my aunt grief
had given softness and a winning mildness
to her manners which had before been
remarkable for vivacity nor was her
residence at her mothers house of a na-
ture to restore her gayety the poor
woman was very vacillating in her re-
pentance she sometimes begged justine
to forgive her unkindness but much of-
tener accused her of having caused the

approach of cold weather at the beginning
of this last winter justine has returned
to us and i assure you i love her tenderly
she is very clever and gentle and extreme-
ly pretty as i mentioned before her mien
and her expressions continually remind
me of my dear aunt

  i must say also a few words to you
my dear cousin of little darling william
i wish you could see him he is very tall
of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes
dark eyelashes and curling hair when
he smiles two little dimples appear on
each cheek which are rosy with health
he has already had one or two little
wives but louisa biron is his favorite a
pretty little girl of five years of age

  i have written myself into better spir-
its dear cousin but my anxiety returns
upon me as i conclude write dearest
victor-one line-one word will be a
blessing to us ten thousand thanks to
henry for his kindness his affection and
his many letters we are sincerely grateful
adieu my cousin take care of yourself
and i entreat you write

elizabeth lavenza

  geneva march th -

ear dear elizabeth i exclaimed
when i had read her letter i will
write instantly and relieve them from the
anxiety they must feel i wrote and this
exertion greatly fatigued me but my con-
valescence had commenced and proceeded
regularly in another fortnight i was
able to leave my chamber

  one of my first duties on my recovery
was to introduce clerval to the several
professors of the university in doing
this i underwent a kind of rough usage
ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained ever since the fatal night the
end of my labors and the beginning of
my misfortunes i had conceived a violent
antipathy even to the name of natural phi-
w t- 

losophy when i was otherwise quite
restored to health the sight of a chemical
instrument would renew all the agony of
my nervous symptoms

  henry saw this and had removed all
my apparatus from my view he had
also changed my apartment for he per-
ceived that i had acquired a dislike for the
room which had previously been my lab-
oratory but these cares of clerval were
made of no avail when i visited the pro-
fessors monsieur waldman inflicted tor-
ture when he praised with kindness and
warmth the astonishing progress i had
made in the sciences he soon perceived
that i disliked the subject but not guess-
ing the real cause he attributed my feel-
ings to modesty and changed the subject
from my improvement to the science
itself with a desire as i evidently saw of
drawing me out what could i do he
meant to please and he tormented me i
felt as if he had placed carefully one by
one in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me
to a slow and cruel death i writhed
under his words yet dared not exhibit the
pain i felt

  clerval whose eyes and feelings were
always quick in discerning the sensations
of others declined the subject alleging
in excuse his total ignorance and the con-
versation took a more general turn i
thanked my friend from my heart but i
did not speak i saw plainly that he was
surprized but he never attempted to draw
my secret from me and although i loved
him with a mixture of affection and rev-
erence that knew no bounds yet i could
never persuade myself to confide to him
that event which was so often present to
my recollection but which i feared the
detail to another would only impress more
deeply

  monsieur krempe was not equally do-
cile and in my condition at that time of
almost insupportable sensitiveness his


weird tales

harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more
pain than the benevolent approbation of
monsieur waldman damn the fel-
low cried he why monsieur clerval
i assure you he has outstript us all ay
stare if you please but it is nevertheless
true a youngster who but a few years
ago believed in cornelius agrippa as
firmly as in the gospel has now set him-
self at the head of the university and if
he is not soon pulled down we shall all
be out of countenance ay ay con-
tinued he observing my face expressive
of suffering monsieur frankenstein is
modest an excellent quality in a young
man young men should be diffident of
themselves you know monsieur clerval
i was myself when young but that wears
out in a very short time

  monsieur krempe had now commenced
an eulogy on himself which happily
turned the conversation from a subject
that was so annoying to me

  clerval had never sympathized in my
tastes for natural science and his literary
pursuits differed wholly from those which
had occupied me he came to the uni-
versity with the design of making himself
complete master of the oriental languages
as thus he should open a field for the plan
of life he had marked out for himself
resolved to pursue no inglorious career
he turned his eyestowards the east as af-
fording scope for his spirit of enterprise
the persian arabic and sanskrit lan-
guages engaged his attention and i was
easily induced to enter on the same studies

  summer passed away in these occupa-
tions and my return to geneva was fixed
for the latter end of autumn but being
delayed by several accidents winter and
snow arrived the roads were deemed im-
passable and my journey was retarded
until the ensuing spring i felt this delay
very bitterly for i longed to see my native
town and my beloved friends my return
had only been delayed so long from an

unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange
place before he had become acquainted
with any of its inhabitants the winter
however was spent cheerfully and al-
though the spring was uncommonly late
when it came its beauty compensated for
its dilatoriness

  the month of may had already com-
menced and i expected the letter daily
which was to fix the date of my departure
when henry proposed a pedestrian tour
in the environs of ingolstadt that i might
bid a personal farewell to the country i
had so long inhabited i acceded with
pleasure to this proposition i was fond of
exercise and clerval had always been my
favorite companion in the rambles of this
nature that i had taken among the scenes
of my native country

  we passed a fortnight in these peram-
bulations my health and spirits had long
been restored and they gained additional
strength from the salubrious air i
breathed the natural incidents of our
progress and the conversation of my
friend study had before secluded me
from the intercourse of my fellow-crea-
tures and rendered me unsocial but cler-
val called forth the better feelings of my
heart he again taught me to love the as-
pect of nature and the cheerful faces of
children excellent friend how sincerely
did you love me and endeavor to elevate
my mind until it was on a level with your
own a selfish pursuit had cramped and
narrowed me until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses i
became the same happy creature who a
few years ago loved and beloved by all
had no sorrow or care when happy in-
animate nature had the power of bestow-
ing on me the most delightful sensations
a serene sky and verdant fields filled me
with ecstasy the present season was in-
deed divine the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges while those of
summer were already in bud i was un-
frankenstein



disturbed by thoughts which during the
preceding year had pressed upon me not-
withstanding my endeavors to throw them
off with an invincible burden

  henry rejoiced in my gayety and sin-
cerely sympathized in my feelings he ex-
erted himself to amuse me while he
expressed the sensations that filled his
soul the resources of his mind on this
occasion were truly astonishing his con-
versation was full of imagination and
very often in imitation of the persian and
arabic writers he invented tales of won-
derful fancy and passion at other times
he repeated my favorite poems or drew
me out into arguments which he sup-
ported with great ingenuity

  we returned to our college on a sunday
afternoon the peasants were dancing and
every one we met appeared gay and happy
my own spirits were high and i bounded
along with feelings of unbridled joy and
hilarity

chapter 

on my return i found the following
letter from my father

  my dear victor-you have prob-
ably waited impatiently for a letter to fix
the date of your return to us and i was
at first tempted to write only a few lines
merely mentioning the day on which i
should expect you but that would be a
cruel kindness and i dare not do it what
would be your surprize my son when
you expected a happy and glad welcome
to behold on the contrary tears and
wretchedness and how victor can i
relate our misfortune absence can not
have rendered you callous to our joys and
griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my
long absent son i wish to prepare you
for the woful news but i know it is im-
possible even now your eye skims over
the page to seek the words which are to
convey to you the horrible tidings

  william is dead-that sweet child
whose smiles delighted and warmed my
heart who was so gentle yet so gay
victor he is murdered

  i will not attempt to console you but
will simply relate the circumstances of the
transaction

  last thursday may th i my
niece and your two brothers went to walk
in plainpalais the evening was warm
and serene and we prolonged our walk
farther than usual it was already dusk
before we thought of returning and then
we discovered that william and ernest
who had gone on befoje were not to be
found we accordingly rested on a seat
until diey should return presently ernest
came and inquired if we had seen his
brother he said that he had been playing
with him that william had run away to
hide himself and that he vainly sought
for him and afterwards waited for him a
long time but that he did not return

  this account rather alarmed us and
we continued to search for him until night
fell when elizabeth conjectured that he
might have returned to the house he
was not there we returned again with
torches for i could not rest when i
thought that my sweet boy had lost him-
self and was exposed to all the damps
and dews of night elizabeth also suffered
extreme anguish about five in the morn-
ing i discovered my lovely boy whom the
night before i had seen blooming and
active in health stretched on the grass
livid and motionless the print of the
murderers fingers was on his neck

  he was conveyed home and the an-
guish that was visible in my countenance
betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was
very earnest to see the corpse at first i
attempted to prevent her but she persist-
ed and entering the room where it lay
hastily examined the neck of the victim
and clasping her hands exclaimed o
god i have murdered my darling child


weird tales

  she fainted and was restored with ex-
treme difficulty when she again lived it
was only to weep and sigh she told me
that that same evening william had teased
her to let him wear a very valuable minia-
ture that she possessed of your mother
this picture is gone and was doubtless the
temptation which urged the murderer to
the deed we have no trace of him at
present although our exertions to discov-
er him are unremitted but they will not
restore my beloved william

  come dearest victor you alone can
console elizabeth she weeps continually
and accuses herself unjustly as the cause
of his death her words pierce my heart
we are all unhappy but will not that be
an additional motive for you my son to
return and be our comforter your dear
mother alas victor i now say thank
god she did not live to witness the cruel
miserable death of her youngest darling

  come victor not brooding thoughts
of vengeance against the assassin but with
feelings of peace and gentleness that wili
heal instead of festering the wounds of
our minds enter the house of mourning
my friend but with kindness and affection
for those who love you and not with
hatred for your enemies-your affection-
ate and afflicted father

alphonse frankenstein

  geneva may th -

  clerval who had watched my counte-
nance as i read this letter was surprized to
observe the despair that succeeded to the
joy i at first expressed on receiving news
from my friends i threw the letter on
the table and covered my face with my
hands

  my dear frankenstein exclaimed
henry when he perceived me weep with
bitterness are you always to be unhappy
my dear friend what has happened

  i motioned to him to take up the letter
while i walked up and down the room in

the extremest agitation tears also gushed
from the eyes of clerval as he read the
account of my misfortune

  i can offer you no consolation my
friend said he your disaster is irrepa-
rable what do you intend to do

  to go instantly to geneva come with
me henry to order the horses

it was completely dark when i arrived
in the environs of geneva the gates
of the town were already shut and i was
obliged to pass the night at secheron a
village at the distance of half a league
from the city the sky was serene and
as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit
the spot where my poor william had been
murdered

  as i could not pass through the town
i was obliged to cross the idee in a boat
to arrive at plainpalais during this short
voyage i saw the lightnings playing on the
summit of mont blanc in the most beau-
tiful figures the storm appeared to ap-
proach rapidly and on landing i ascend-
ed a low hill that i might observe its
progress it advanced the heavens were
clouded and i soon felt the rain coming
slowly in large drops but its violence
quickly increased

  i quitted my seat and walked on al-
though the darkness and storm increased
every minute and the thunder burst with
a terrific crash over my head it was
echoed from saleve the juras and the
alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning
dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake
making it appear like a vast sheet of fire
then for an instant everything seemed of
a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered
itself from the preceding flash

  while i watched the tempest so beau-
tiful yet terrific i wandered on with a
hasty step this noble war in the sky
elevated my spirits i clasped my hands
and exclaimed aloud william dear an-
gel this is thy funeral this thy dirge
frankenstein



as i said these words i perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind
a clump of trees near me i stood fixed
gazing intently i could not be mistaken
a flash of lightning illuminated the ob-
ject and discovered its shape plainly to
me its gigantic stature and the deform-
ity of its aspect more hideous than be-
longs to humanity instantly informed me
that it was the wretch the filthy demon
to whom i had given life what did he
there could he be i shuddered at the
conception the murderer of my brother
no sooner did that idea cross my imagi-
nation than i became convinced of its
truth my teeth chattered and i was forced
to lean against a tree for support

  the figure passed me quickly and i
lost it in the gloom nothing in human
shape could have destroyed that fair child
he was the murderer i could not doubt
it the mere presence of the idea was an
irresistible proof of the fact i thought
of pursuing the devil but it would have
been in vain for another flash discovered
him to me hanging among the rocks of
the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont
saleve a hill that bounds plainpalais on
the south he soon reached the summit
and disappeared

  i remained motionless the thunder
ceased but the rain still continued and
the scene was enveloped in an impen-
etrable darkness i revolved in my mind
the events which i had until now sought
to forget the whole train of my progress
towards the creation the appearance of
the work of my own hands alive at my
bedside its departure two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on
which he first received life and was this
his first crime alas i had turned loose
into the world a depraved wretch whose
delight was in carnage and misery had he
not murdered my brother

  no one can conceive the anguish i suf-
fered during the remainder of the night

which i spent cold and wet in the open
air but i did not feel the inconvenience
of the weather my imagination was busy
in scenes of evil and despair i considered
the being whom i had cast among man-
kind and endowed with the will and
power to effect purposes of horror such
as the deed which he had now done nearly
in the light of my own vampire my own
spirit let loose from the grave and forced
to destroy all that was dear to me

  day dawned and i directed my steps
towards the town the gates were open
and i hastened to my fathers house my
first thought was to discover what i knew
of the murderer and cause instant pur-
suit to be made but i paused when i
reflected on the story that i had to tell a
being whom i myself had formed and
endued with life had met me at midnight
among the precipices of an inaccessible
mountain i remembered also the nerv-
ous fever with which i had been seized
just at the time that i dated my creation
and which would give an air of delirium
to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable
i well knew that if any other communi-
cated such a relation to me i should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity
besides the strange nature of the animal
would elude all pursuit even if i were
so far credited as to persuade my relatives
to commence it and then of what use
would be the pursuit who could arrest
a creature capable of scaling the over-
hanging sides of mont saleve these re-
flections determined me and i resolved
to remain silent

it was about five in the morning when
i entered my fathers house i told the
servants not to disturb the family and
went into the library to attend their usual
hour of rising

  six years had elapsed passed as a dream
but for one indelible trace and i stood in
the same place where i had last embraced


weird tales

my father before my departure for ingol-
stadt beloved and venerable parent he
still remained to me i gazed on the pic-
ture of my mother which stood over the
mantelpiece it was an historical subject
painted at my fathers desire and repre-
sented caroline beaufort in an agony of
despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead
father her garb was rustic and her
cheek pale but there was an air of dignity
and beauty that hardly permitted the sen-
timent of pity below this picture was a
miniature of william and my tears
flowed when i looked upon it

  while i was thus engaged ernest en-
tered he had heard me arrive and hast-
ened to welcome me he expressed a sor-
rowful delight to see me welcome my
dearest victor said he ah i wish
you had come three months ago and then
you would have found us all joyous and
delighted you come to us now to share
a misery which nothing can alleviate yet
your presence will i hope revive our
father who seems sinking under his mis-
fortune and your persuasions will induce
poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tor-
menting self-accusations-poor william
he was our darling and our pride

  tears unrestrained fell from my
brothers eyes a sense of mortal agony
crept over my frame before i had only
imagined the wretchedness of my des-
olated home the reality came on me as a
new and a not less terrible disaster i
tried to calm ernest i inquired more
minutely concerning my father and her i
named my cousin

  she most of all said ernest requires
consolation she accused herself of having
caused the death of my brother and that
made her very wretched but since the
murderer has been discovered-

  the murderer discovered good god
how can that be who could attempt to
pursue him it is impossible one might
as well try to overtake the winds or con-

fine a mountain-stream with a straw i
saw him too he was free last night

  i do not know what you mean re-
plied my brother in accents of wonder
but to us the discovery we have made
completes our misery no one would
believe it at first and even now elizabeth
will not be convinced notwithstanding all
the evidence indeed who would credit
that justine moritz who was so amiable
and fond of all the family could sudden-
ly become capable of so frightful so
appalling a crime

  justine moritz poor poor girl is she
the accused but it is wrongfully every
one knows that no one believes it surely
ernest

  no one did at first but several circum-
stances came out that have almost forced
conviction upon us and her own behavior
has been so confused as to add to the
evidence of facts a weight that i fear
leaves no hope for doubt but she will
be tried today and you will then hear all

  he related that the morning on which
the murder of poor william had been dis-
covered justine had been taken ill and
confined to her bed for several days dur-
ing this interval one of the servants hap-
pening to examine the apparel she had
worn on the night of the murder had
discovered in her pocket the picture of
my mother which had been judged to be
the temptation of the murderer the
servant instantly showed it to one of the
others who without saying a word to
any of the family went to a magistrate
and upon their deposition justine was
apprehended on being charged with the
fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion
in a great measure by her extreme confu-
sion of manner

  this was a strange tale but it did not
shake my faith and i replied earnestly
you are all mistaken i know the mur-
derer justine poor good justine is in-
nocent
frankenstein



  at that instant my father entered i
saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his
countenance but he endeavored to wel-
come me cheerfully and after we had
exchanged our mournful greeting would
have introduced some other topic than
that of our disaster had not ernest ex-
claimed good god papa victor says
that he knows who was the murderer of
poor william

  we do also unfortunately replied
my father for indeed i had rather have
been for ever ignorant than have discov-
ered so much depravity and ingratitude in
one i valued so highly

  my dear father you are mistaken jus-
tine is innocent

  if she is god forbid that she should
suffer as guilty she is to be tried today
and i hope i sincerely hope that she will
be acquitted

  this speech calmed me i was firmly
convinced in my own mind that justine
and indeed every human being was guilt-
less of this murder i had no fear there-
fore that any circumstantial evidence
could be brought forward strong enough
to convict her my tale was not one to
announce publicly its astounding horror
would be looked upon as madness by the
vulgar did any one indeed exist except
me the creator who would believe unless
his senses convinced him in the existence
of the living monument of presumption
and rash ignorance which i had let loose
upon the world

  we were soon joined by elizabeth
time had altered her since i last beheld
her it had endowed her with loveliness
surpassing the beauty of her childish
years there was the same candor the
same vivacity but it was allied to an ex-
pression more full of sensibility and intel-
lect she welcomed me with the greatest
affection your arrival my dear cousin
said she fills me with hope you perhaps
will find some means to justify my poor

guiltless justine alas who is safe if she
be convicted of crime i rely on her inno-
cence as certainly as i do upon my own
our misfortune is doubly hard to us we
have not only lost that lovely darling boy
but this poor girl whom i sincerely love
is to be tom away by even a worse fate
if she is condemned i never shall know
joy more but she will not i am sure she
will not and then i shall be happy again
even after the sad death of my little wil-
liam

chapter 

we passed a few sad hours until
eleven oclock when the trial was
to commence my father and the rest of
the family being obliged to attend as wit-
nesses i accompanied them to the court

  during the whole of this wretched
mockery of justice i suffered living tor-
ture it was to be decided whether the
result of my curiosity and lawless devices
would cause the death of two of my fel-
low-beings one a smiling babe full of
innocence and joy the other far more
dreadfully murdered with every aggrava-
tion of infamy that could make the mur-
der memorable in horror justine also
was a girl of merit and possessed qual-
ities which promised to render her life
happy now all was to be obliterated in an
ignominious grave and i the cause a
thousand times rather would i have con-
fessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed
to justine but i was absent when it was
committed and such a declaration would
have been considered as the ravings of a
madman and would not have exculpated
her who suffered through me

  the appearance of justine was calm
she was dressed in mourning and her
countenance always engaging was ren-
dered by the solemnity of her feelings
exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared
confident in innocence and did not
tremble although gazed on and execrated


weird tales

by thousands for all the kindness which
her beauty might otherwise have excited
was obliterated in the minds of the spec-
tators by the imagination of the enormity
she was supposed to have committed she
was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evi-
dently constrained and as her confusion
had before been adduced as a proof of
her guilt she worked up her mind to
an appearance of courage when she
entered the court she threw her eyes
round it and quickly discovered where
we were seated a tear seemed to dim
her eye when she saw us but she quickly
recovered herself and a look of sorrow-
ful affection seemed to attest her utter
guiltlessness

  the trial began and after the advocate
against her had stated the charge several
witnesses were called several strange
facts combined against her which might
have staggered any one who had not such
proof of her innocence as i had she had
been out the whole of the night on which
the murder had been committed and to-
wards morning had been perceived by a
market-woman not far from the spot
where the body of the murdered child had
been afterwards found the woman
asked her what she did there but she
looked very strangely and only returned
a confused and unintelligible answer
she returned to the house about eight
oclock and when one inquired where she
had passed the night she replied that she
had been looking for the child and de-
manded earnestly if anything had been
heard concerning him when shown the
body she fell into violent hysterics and
kept her bed for several days the pic-
ture was then produced which the servant
had found in her pocket and when eliz-
abeth in a faltering voice proved that
it was the same which an hour before the
child had been missed she had placed
round his neck a murmur of horror and
indignation filled the court

  justine was called on for her defense
as the trial had proceeded her counte-
nance had altered surprize horror and
misery were strongly expressed some-
times she struggled with her tears but
when she was desired to plead she col-
lected her powers and spoke in an au-
dible although variable voice

  god knows she said how entirely
i am innocent but i do not pretend that
my protestations should acquit me i rest
my innocence on a plain and simple ex-
planation of the facts which have been
adduced against me and i hope the char-
acter i have always borne will incline my
judges to a favorable interpretation where
any circumstance appears doubtful or sus-
picious

  she then related that by the permission
of elizabeth she had passed the evening
of the night on which the murder had
been committed at the house of an aunt
at chene a village situated at about a
league from geneva on her return at
about nine oclock she met a man who
asked her if she had seen anything of die
child who was lost she was alarmed by
this account and passed several hours in
looking for him when the gates of ge-
neva were shut and she was forced to
remain several hours of the night in a barn
belonging to a cottage being unwilling to
call up the inhabitants to whom she was
well known most of the night she spent
here watching towards morning she be-
lieved that she slept for a few minutes
some steps disturbed her and she awoke
it was dawn and she quitted her asylum
that she might again endeavor to find my
brother if she had gone near the spot
where his body lay it was without her
knowledge that she had been bewil-
dered when questioned by the market-
woman was not surprizing since she had
passed a sleepless night and the fate of
poor william was yet uncertain coa-
frankenstein



earning the picture she could give no
account

  i know continued the unhappy vic-
tim how heavily and fatally this one cir-
cumstance weighs against me but i have
no power of explaining it and when i
have expressed my utter ignorance i am
only left to conjecture concerning the
probabilities by which it might have been
placed in my pocket but here also i am
checked i believe that i have no enemy
on earth and none surely would have
been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly
did the murderer place it there i know
of no opportunity afforded him for so
doing or if i had why should he have
stolen the jewel to part with it again so
soon

  i commit my cause to the justice of my
judges yet i see no room for hope i beg
permission to have a few witnesses ex-
amined concerning my character and if
their testimony shall not overweigh my
supposed guilt i must be condemned al-
though i would pledge my salvation on
my innocence

  several witnesses were called who had
known her for many years and they spoke
well of her but fear and hatred of the
crime of which they supposed her guilty
rendered them timorous and unwilling to
come forward

  my own agitation and anguish was ex-
treme during the whole trial i believed
in her innocence i knew it could the
demon who had i did not for a minute
doubt murdered my brother also in his
hellish sport have betrayed the innocent
to death and ignominy i could not
sustain the horror of my situation and
when i perceived that the popular voice
and the countenances of the judges had
already condemned my unhappy victim i
rushed out of court in agony the tor-
tures of the accused did not equal mine
she was sustained by innocence but the

fangs of remorse tore my bosom and
would not forego their hold

i passed a night of unmingled wretched-
ness in the morning i went to the
court my lips and throat were parched
i dared not ask the fatal question but i
was known and the officer guessed the
cause of my visit the ballots had been
thrown they were all black and justine
was condemned

  i can not pretend to describe what i
then felt i had before experienced sen-
sations of horror and i have endeavored
to bestow upon them adequate expres-
sions but words can not convey an idea
of the heart-sickening despair that i then
endured the person to whom i ad-
dressed myself added that justine had
already confessed her guilt that ev-
idence he observed was hardly required
in so glaring a case but i am glad of it
and indeed none of our judges like to
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial
evidence be it ever so decisive

  this was strange and unexpected intel-
ligence what could it mean had my
eyes deceived me and was i really as
mad as the whole world would believe me
to be if i disclosed the object of my sus-
picions i hastened to return home and
elizabeth eagerly demanded the result

   my cousin replied i it is decided as
you may have expected all judges had
rather that ten innocent should suffer
than that one guilty should escape but
she has confessed

  this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth
who had relied with firmness upon jus-
tines innocence alas said she how
shall i ever again believe in human good-
ness justine whom i loved and esteemed
as my sister how could she put on those
smiles of innocence only to betray her
mild eyes seemed incapable of any sever-
ity or guile and yet she has committed a
murder


weird tales

  soon after we heard that the poor vic-
tim had expressed a desire to see my
cousin my father wished her not to go
but said that he left it to her own judg-
ment and feelings to decide yes said
elizabeth i will go although she is
guilty and you victor shall accompany
me i can not go alone

   the idea of this visit was torture to me
yet i could not refuse

we entered the gloomy prison-
chamber and beheld justine sitting
on some straw at the farther end her
hands were manacled and her head rested
on her knees she rose on seeing us enter
and when we were left alone with her she
threw herself at the feet of elizabeth
weeping bitterly my cousin wept also

  oh justine said she why did you
rob me of my last consolation i relied on
your innocence and although i was then
very wretched i was not so miserable as i
am now

  and do you also believe that i am so
very very wicked do you also join
with my enemies to crush me to condemn
me as a murderer her voice was suf-
focated with sobs

  rise my poor girl said elizabeth
why do you kneel if you are innocent
i am not one of your enemies i believed
you guiltless notwithstanding every evi-
dence until i heard that you had yourself
declared your guilt that report you say
is false and be assured dear justine that
nothing can shake my confidence in you
for a moment but your own confession
i did confess but i confessed a lie i
confessed that i might obtain absolution
but now that falsehood lies heavier at my
heart than all my other sins the god of
heaven forgive me ever since i was con-
demned my confessor has besieged me
he threatened and menaced until i almost
began to think that i was the monster that
he said i was he threatened excommu-

nication and hellfire in my last moments
if i continued obdurate dear lady i had
none to support me all looked on me as a
wretch doomed to ignominy and perdi-
tion what could i do in an evil hour
i subscribed to a lie and now only am i
truly miserable

  she paused weeping and then con-
tinued-i thought with horror my sweet
lady that you should believe your jus-
tine whom your blessed aunt had so
highly honored and whom you loved
was a creature capable of a crime which
none but the devil himself could have
perpetrated dear william dearest bles-
sed child i soon shall see you again in
heaven where we shall all be happy and
that consoles me going as i am to suffer
ignominy and death

  oh justine forgive me for having
for one moment distrusted you why
did you confess but do not mourn dear
girl do not fear i will proclaim i will
prove your innocence i will melt the
stony hearts of your enemies by my tears
and prayers you shall not die-you
my playfellow my companion my sister
perish on the scaffold no no i never
could survive so horrible a misfortune
justine shook her head mournfully i
do not fear to die she said that pang
is past god raises my weakness and
gives me courage to endure the worst i
leave a sad and bitter world and if you
remember me and think of me as of one
unjustly condemned i am resigned to the
fate awaiting me learn from me dear
lady to submit in patience to the will of
heaven

during this conversation i had retired
to a corner of the prison-room where
i could conceal the horrid anguish that
possessed me despair who dared talk
of that the poor victim who on the
morrow was to pass the awful boundary

long out of print witness these characteristic titles jewel of seven stars lair of
the white worm lady of the shroud mystery of the sea was draculas guest
which you published in weird tales some years back a part of the book of that
same title if so could the rest be published instead of the original dracula drac-
ulas guest was written by stoker as part of his novel dracula but was omitted
from dracula because of the great length that novel had already reached it was
reprinted in weird tales in the issue of december -the editors

    writes w w green jr of washington kansas i was elated to see in
the april issue that you are going to publish frankenstein i have been thinking
ever since that famous talkie was released that if weird tales would print that
story it would be just about right and i dont think very many readers would kick
if you printed dracula

    a letter from glenn smith of chicago says ive read your weird tales
since i was knee-high to a grasshopper ive relished it with greater pleasure with my
increasing years through it i acquired the incentive to inquire at the public library
about other writers of weird tales of the past thus i became a lover of the writ-
ings of such as poe bierce and all the others as well as our moderns blackwood and
machen i am writing to say i hope you discontinue your policy of reprinting weird
fiction that anybody can get at the public library i regard it as a waste of space
for who is there who cant go to the library to get dracula or frankenstein and
such if you must reprint i suggest reprinting the inimitable stories that modern
writers have written for weird tales itself one of the greatest novels ive read
in your pages was on the dead mans chest by eli colter

    linus hogenmiller of farmington missouri writes to the eyrie let me
voice the plea of myself and many others in asking most insistently that you pub-
lish dracula after frankenstein is completed certainly even those who have read
it will be glad to see it again in weird tales give us some good german and
french weird stories and publish serially some long reprints of the cream of weird
tales from over the globe i am only one of those late readers who have never read
lovecrafts earlier masterpieces are you going to reprint them and other equally
famous classics of weird lore

     i was pleasantly surprized by the announcement that you were going to reprint
frankenstein writes frederick b shroyer of decatur indiana why not after
this story comes to an end keep up the good work and print another scientific mas-
terpiece of the past i am sure they would be received with enthusiasm by your
readers

     i am not in favor of having reprints writes hyman vinunsky of cleveland
you see ive read these reprint stories before they were put in weird tales i
have read them in books taken from the library in my city ive already read frank-
enstein and dracula so why should i read over reprints when ive read them before
i say put in an original new story in place of the reprint

    warren greenspan of yonkers new york writes i see that you are won-


weird tales

dering what to do about reprints i think that the readers would rather have re-
prints from back issues of weird tales rather than elsevere i can easily get drac-
ula and frankenstein in book form many of your new readers would like reprints
from weird tales some reprints i would like to see soon are the bird people
and the bride of osiris both by otis adelbert kline his tam son of the tiger
was a rattling good story and the woman of the wood hy a mzmtt

    writes donald allgeier of mountain grove missouri i am one of the un-
fortunates who have never read either dracula or frankenstein not only that but
our local theater has never shown the picturized version thus it is that i hail the
coming of frankenstein to your magazine with great delight and hope you will fol-
low it up with dracula and others your reprint department is one of the most inter-
esting features of your magazine

     emil petaja of milltown montana writes i am very glad to hear that you are
going to publish frankenstein in the reprints but i do hope that you will not pub-
lish dracula as i have read it and i think that most of the readers of weird tales
have also i think it would be a good plan to publish stories out of back issues of
weird tales in the reprints as new readers will enjoy reading stories by their favor-
ite authors

    the wolf-leader by alexandre dumas proved to be one of the best weird
tales i have ever read writes d a arnone of jamestown new york but the
devils bride by mr quinn is so far the best story that has ever been printed in
weird tales as for frankenstein and dracula they are fine stories but not for
reprints

     readers what is your favorite story in this issue of weird tales lovecrafts
graveyard tale in the vault is in a close struggle with the third installment of sea-
bury quinns novel the devils bride for first place in popularity among all the sto-
ries in our april issue with nictzin dyalhis story the red witch close behind

between life and death felt not as i did
such deep and bitter agony i gnashed
my teeth and ground them together ut-
tering a groan that came from my inmost
soul justine started when she saw
who it was she approached me and said
dear sir you are very kind to visit me
you i hope do not believe that i am
guilty

  i could not answer no justine said
elizabeth he is more convinced of your
innocence than i was for even when he
heard that you had confessed he did not
credit it

  i truly thank him in these last mo-
ments i feel thesincerest gratitude towards
those who think of me with kindness
how sweet is the affection of others to
such a wretch as i am it removes more
than half my misfortune and i feel as if

i	could die in peace now that my inno-
cence is acknowledged by you dear lady
and your cousin

  thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort
others and herself she indeed gained the
resignation she desired but i the true
murderer felt the never-dying worm alive
in my bosom which allowed of no hope
or consolation elizabeth also wept and
was unhappy but hers also was the misery
of innocence which like a cloud that
passes over the fair moon for a while
hides but can not tarnish its brightness
anguish and despair had penetrated into
the core of my heart i bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish

  we stayed several hours with justine
and it was with great difficulty that eliza-
beth could tear herself away i wish
cried she that i were to die with you

i	can not live in this world of misery

  justine assumed an air of cheerfulness
while she with difficulty repressed her bit-

    the first warning of the stupen-
    dous cataclysm that befell the
    earth in the fourth decade of the
    twentieth century was recorded
    simultaneously in several parts of
    america at twelve minutes past 
    oclock a m during a lull in the
    nights aerial business several of
    the larger stations of the western
    hemisphere began picking up
    strange signals out of the ether
    they were faint and ghostly as if
    coming from a vast distance as
    far as anyone could learn the sig-
    nals originated nowhere upon the
    earth it was as if some phantom
    were whispering through the ether
    in the language of another planet
