asteroid adventure 

            the day when fisti-cuffs had become obsolete was now history but a
            pair of ato-power prospectofs didnt hesitate to revive the age-old
            custom when they look like being hi-jacked ofl their own nuclear

tvell at least its something new
remarked ken grayfield peering into
the visiscreen at the asteroid which they
were approaching  we can add it to the
official astromap perhaps that will con-
vince the directors of planet prospectors
limited that were doing our best to locate
new radio-active minerals for em

 asteroid

a space island to put us in the good books
ken weve been tramping around in space
for months using up their precious atom-
fuel and we havent a thing to show their
last spaceradio call didnt sound exactly a
birthday greeting if we dont locate radio-
active stuff for em this trip i think itll be
our last

  i wonder why this asteroid hasnt been
discovered before said ken thoughtfully
glancing at the astromap its a bit off
the mars-jupiter beaten track but not so
far away that-

  ken grayfields words ended in a gasp
as the little spacecraft lurched and spun
giddily as though caught in a whirlwind of
tremendous force the plump jimmy was
flung violently against the foam-rubber
padding on the side of the vessel and
asteroid adventure

jyhen a couple of prospectors sink their last dime in finding
the biggest ato-power strike in the millennium theyre not
going to be claim-jumped without a good-old prehistoric scrap

landed squashily on the floor ken at the
controls grasped one of the larger levers
and hung on grimly although his arm felt
as though it was being torn from its socket

  look out yelled jimmy clambering to
his feet his bulging eyes fixed on the visi-
screen where the asteroid was looming
hugely and with astonishing speed were
right on top of it repulsion jets-quick

  ken nodded he was vainly trying to
steer the craft around the obstacle but the
ship was streaking towards the leaden mass
with ever-increasing speed he grasped the
emergency lever the last resort and one
which in unskilled hands could be disast-
rous to cut in emergency too quickly
could weaken the hull of the craft and the
sudden deceleration could shatter the bodies
of the two men

qlowly and repressing an urge to drag
 at the emergency lever ken moved it
across still the ship plunged on but the
recorder indicated a slight diminution in
the speed then just as suddenly as it all
started the craft was under cotrol sweat
started from kens forehead as he operated
the emergency jets it was a matter of
seconds now an error in judgment either
way  a great relief surged through
the pilot as the needle gradually moved
back it had been a near thing but his
skill and judgment had won

  can you flatten out ken jimmy
briscoe was looking through the glastic nose
at the asteroid kens answer was implicit
in the action of the craft the grey mass of
the asteroid disappeared from the front of

the craft and instead appeared in the glastic
panel in the floor the spacecraft was flying
parallel to the asteroid

   ill circle this asteroid a few times to get
the feel of its atmosphere values said ken
its no wonder the place hasnt been dis-
covered and charted theres a belt of cos-
mic activity around it sufficient to toss any-
thing but the largest spaceliner out of con-
trol ill bet more than one spacecraft has
found itself on the edge of that activity and
veered away quick smart    great sagit-
tarius said ken suddenly

   whats the matter jimmys voice was
nervous the experience of the last few
moments had left him jumpy

  gravity replied ken look at the
grav recorder and youll understand why
the normal repulsion jets werent so hot
and im beginning to understand why im
feeling a bit heavy headed

   three times earth gravity said jimmy
eyeing the recorder its going to be a job
getting around when we do land

   it misiht be something worthwhile too 
jimmys blue eyes were sparkling in bis
round face the density suggests some-
thing new in minerals radio-active stuff
boy if it is and we claim it for planet
prospectors limited were made

  you might have something there
admitted ken catching some of his friends
enthusiasm still weve got to land ex-
plore test and get away again through that
cosmic maelstrom although  dont anti-
cipate any trouble in getting through that
now that i got the hang of the conditions
still exploring the ground in this gravity is
going to be an exhausting job

   and gradually under his careful delicate
operation the little spacecraft sank slowly
to the ground

the two spacemen struggled into their
spacesuits the weight of which rend-
ered them difficult to handle but when they
were locked within the suits they felt better

pag i
thrills incorporated

  im still as heavy as lead said jimmy
speaking into the helmet transmitter but
im getting a bit of support the neck sup-
ports are giving my spine and neck muscles
a rest anyway ready to poke around
ken

  yes got the enercounter plugged into
your suit

  the plump young man nodded inside his
helmet and picked up the enercounter the
leads of which were already plugged into
his suit panel

  ken led the way through the air-lock
which automatically sealed closed after
them imprisoning the precious earth atmos-
phere in the spacecraft the ground be-
neath their feet was a powdery silvery sand
ken stooped and scraped at it and it
trickled quickly through his gloved fingers

  the two men ploughed heavily through
the silvery sand jimmy waiting eagerly for
the broadcast of ticking which would indi-
cate radioactive substances but the counter
remained silent

  false alarm grunted jimmy this
place is a fraud if there were any radio-
activity id have picked it up by now

  well push on to that darker patch over
there said ken but his voice did not
sound hopeful

  push is right grumbled the plump
jimmy disgustedly its like trying to walk
underwater

  slowly and heavily they  moved towards
the horizon which on this small world was
distinctly convex sweat was pouring from
the faces of the two men as they forced
their triple-weighted bodies along the metal-
lic surface their feet sinking into the silver
sand it was becoming an increasingly pain-
ful effort to raise one leg after the other
but they struggled on doggedly the lure of
a fabulous reward urging them forward
they reached the darker patch which

eroved to be a smooth expanse of metallic
joking rock

  and still the enercounter was silent

oanting they sank to the ground ive
- had enough of this place ken gulped
jimmy better get back to the ship and
takt off this gravitys too much for me

  ken nodded heavily he was bitterly dis-
appointed the place had all the earmarks
of a radioactive mine but the counter was
infallible and it indicated clearly that the
asteroid was a dead mass even though it
floated in the midst of a cosmic turbulence
there was more of the tiny world to ex-
plore of course but the structure seemed
the same everywhere leaden sand inter-
spersed with flat stretches of that dully-shin-
ing rock but all dead stuff long before
they could cover the entire surface they
would be exhausted and in any case they
would have to return to the ship again and
again for an oxygen recharge for their
bodies were using up oxygen at a high rate

  guess ill take a sampie of this stuff
back if i can blast a bit off said ken he
withdrew his atoblaster from its pouch and
directed its muzzle to the rock he pressed
the switch and a lightning-like beam shot
out and lifted a few inches of the rock-ike
substance and turned it to slag and simul-
taneously a wild yell in his helmet ear-
phones almost deafened him

  the enercounter yelled jimmys voico
its gone mad

  what

  its ticking away like fury cried jtmmy
excitedly it-it can scarcely record the
beats the place is alive-alive its one
mass of radio activity

  ken moved closer to the section of the
blasted rock secure against radioactivity in
his spacesuit he could see beneath that
skin a dully glowing metallic substance
and he understood

  its it all right he said his eyes danc-
ing with excitement see this rock is a
dead skin a baffle against the radioactivity
within once the skins broken the activity
burst out and look at all these patches of
flat rock every one of em probably cover-
ing a reservoir of radioactivity

  what a strike yelped jimmy were
made ken-made well show planet
prospectors limited they reckoned we
were just loafing around in space using up
their fuel eh therell be a few red faces
among the staff when we get back

  and a few happy faces around the-direc-
tors table grinned ken
asteroid adventure

  and well be independent said jimmy
we split ten per cent of this little lot oh
boy come on ken get going again 
cant get back to earth quick enough

  ill take a sample of this skin-rock back
with me said ken he moved towards the
rock but stopped dead as jimmys voice
raised in alarm filled his helmet

xt en-look he turned as quickly as
 conditions would allow and followed
jimmys upward gaze and gasped high
above the asteroid tossed and whirled in
the great whirlpools of stormy energy
around that little world was a small space-
cruiser it was hopelessly out of control
but the pilot was trying every trick to keep
the craft clear of the asteroid

  poor devils muttered ken oh
good

  the craft instead of plunging straight
into the mass of the asteroid suddenly
veered at the last moment and shot like
a silver bullet over the low western horizon
missing that little world by a narrow
margin

  good work said ken hes putting
up a great fight i wonder if hes shot clear
of the influence of this place he deserves
to after that effort hes not a genius of a
pilot by any means or he would have
grasped the situation and handled it-hullo
here he comes again

  the spacecruiser had appeared over the
western horizon and was streaking low
down over the asteroid

  the fool shouted ken why doesnt
he keep out hes going to crash

  nothing now could save the spacecruiser
its speed had diminished the retarding jets
flat out but it was not built for landing at
speed it swept down only a matter of
feet above the surface then it touched
ground

  it landed on the edge of the strip of
metallic sand ploughed across it sending
up an enormous silver spray like a speed-
boat through water and left a deep dark-
ened scorched furrow behind it then it
came to rest and rolled over on its side
smoke belching from its rear

hphe two men attempted to run over to
the wrecked ship but succeeded only
in achieving a lumbering walk there was
a long gaping gash in the bottom of the
ship the repulsion jet-tubes were red
hot and twisted out of shape

  ken who was first to the scene opened
the air lock and clambered into the ship
inside through a dense fog of smoke he
could see something moving on the floor
he bent and grabbed at the figure and saw
that luckily the pilot was already garbed
in his spacesuit the figure was lying face
downwards and moving futilely

  with a tremendous effort ken succeeded
in rolling the man over and a pair of dark
frightened eyes looked through the shield
into his own

  can you hear me asked ken into his
transmitter

  yes the voice was faint but at least it
proved that the mans headradio was tuned
into the universal spacesuit wavelength

  jimmys head appeared in the open air
lock

  help me with this fellow jimmy said
ken we cant carry him against this con-
founded gravity but we should be able to
drag him clear this crate is going to heat
up any minute now once the atomic fuel 
tanks are reached by the heat well be
crisped to nothing step on it if we can
get him out in time ill have a look for the
other passenger he may have escaped so
far

  jimmy struggled into the machine and
as he bent over the recumbent figure of the
pilot a big spacesuited figure lurched through
the pall of smoke a voice harsh and thick
sounded in the rescuers earphones is he
alive hes all right replied ken but
well all be in trouble if were not clear in
a minute or two here take his head
jimmy you get his other leg all ready
right start dragging

the prostrate man seemed to weigh tons
as the three men tugged and heaved

  the tanks the big spacesuited man
looked fearfully over his shoulder at the
cloud of smoke

pag j
thrills incorporated

  well manage said ken through gritted
teeth were nearly there his words and
his example stimulated the other two and
with a last combined heave they dragged
the semi-conscious pilot through the air lock

  now shouted ken pull and run
he and jimmy grasping the legs of the
man dragged madly the other passenger
took one arm of the pilot and the stfange
procession ploughed through the metallic
sand through the back of his spacesuit
ken felt a sudden warm sensation

  he turned and saw that the little space-
cruiser was now a white-hot glowing mass
and sending out a brilliant spray of fused
metal particles

  think you can make our craft flow
ken spoke to the pilot any injuries-
bones broken

  im all right  think replied the dark
man wearily just shock and exhaustion
all right well move

  inside the craft the four men divested
themselves of their spacesuits ken eyed
the two newcomers curiously the pilot was
of slight build olive skinned and naturally
quick and nervous of movement the other
was big and blonde with close-set cold
blue eyes not a particularly prepossessing
couple was his mental summing up

  how did you come to find this spot 
asked ken bluntly

  the dark eyes narrowed slightly then he
laughed just cruising i guess and sort
of exploring we were going to do galaxy
-and perhaps a bit further

  exploring ken raised his brows 

  first chance weve had to get away from
the usual space routes explained the
other im sel geddes and my pal here is
herb smike both spaceliner pilots on the
venusian run we pulled out for a spell
and hired that natty little spacecruiser for
a run around thats all

after the two had made their way to
the middle compartment jimmy turned
to his companion what do you make of
em ken

  dont like the look of em replied ken
frankly theyre both liars for a start

they arent spaceliner pilots if they were
theyd have handled that landing better
and that natty little spacecruiser isnt th
sort you can hire from what i could set
of it both in the air and on the ground
it was more in the millionaire class yes
theres something queer about them

  queers right grunted jimmy briscoe
notice how interested they were when we
mentioned our job im jolly glad you
kept quiet about oqr radioactive mine

  well we must keep our eyes peeled
said ken rising and getting into his space-
suit im going out now to get that sample
of rock-skin its almost as important as
the radioactive stuff its thin but it seems
to be a perfect shield against radioactivity
its possible that it could be analysed and
duplicated in the laboratories on earth ill
go now while our two guests are oqt of
the way

  he left by the air lock and trudged
across towards the smooth rock about
twenty yards from the craft he turned sud-
denly and immediately a head which had
been watching through the middle glastic
window ducked out of sight

co youre inquisitive eh he muttered

   well im not going to satisfy your
curiosity instead of walking in the direc-
tion he had intended to follow he moved
towards the blackening twisted mass of
metal which had once been a luxury space-
cruiser and stood looking at it for a few
minutes for the benefit of prying eyes
then laboriously returned to the spacecraft

  theyre definitely not to be trusted he
said to jimmy as he removed his spacesuit
one chap was watching me through the
window they must suspect weve got on
to something here ill wait until theyre
asleep before i go back to that claim it
will mean postponing our departure but

  if youre going to postpone leaving until
were asjeep my friend said a voice in
the doorway youll be here a long time

  the dark man was standing in the door-
way holding a small glittering atoblaster
his eyes were alert watchful behind him
loomed the figure of the big man smike

asteroid adventure

  just where is this claim demanded
geddes and what is it

        eyed him in sijent contempt for a
moment a grateful pair you are he
said bitinglv where would you have been
now but for ijs

  pardon me said the dark man mock-
ingly  should have thanked you for sav-
ing our lives but of what good are our
lives if we cant enjoy them and if you
two prospectors have found a worthwhile
claim of radioactivity it will provide the
means by which we can enjoy life to the
full in fact my friends a discovery like
that means more to us than you can
imagine he grinned knowingly at his
companion

  and you think you can hold us up for
the claim and get away with it said ken
what do you intend to do about us

  youll manage here for a while re-
plied the other calmly when we get far
enough away well spaceradio your position

and a lifecruiser will be sent to pick you
up but in the meantime the claim will be
ours

  and how are you going tg explain away
your leaving us here

  that will be our worry said geddes
easily

  ken pursed his lips he knew there
would be no spaceradio distress call knew
that these two crooks would not be leaving
them on the asteroid-alive

   just take that enercounter smike said
geddes take a look around outside the
claim shouldnt be hard to find on this place
ill keep these fellows quiet

   the other donned his spacesuit plugged
in the enercounter and left the craft geddes
keeping the two men covered

  a madly desperate urge to throw him-
 self at the dark cold-blooded ruffian
entered kens mind but he thrust it aside
only too well he knew the lightning lethal
power of that little atobjaster a squeeze of
the switch and he would be dissolved in an
atomic ray his eyes strayed towards his 
own spacesuit in the pocket of which was
his own atoblaster the only other weapon
on the craft if only he could get to that
he shifted his ppsition slightly but the
mans voice rapped out in curt command

  another move like that and youll never
move again im taking no risks with either
of you get that into your skulls before
you get this in your guts

  the air lock opened and the big man
entered his eyes gleaming with excitement
behind the shield and kens heart sank
he had secretly hoped that the man with
the counter would miss that tiny escape of
radioactivity so long as the claim was not
found he and jimmy would have some
semblance of bargaining power with these
ruffians but now his hopes in that regard
were shattered

  radioactivity the big man had
switched over to outer two-way broadcast
and receiving and his voice boomed
through the craft triumphantly this little
pebbles alive with radioactive stuff theres
a spot there with the rock peeled away and 
the counter cant catch up with whats
underneath it theres millions here sel-
millions

  very pleasant prospects-for us said
the dark man you may as well know now
my friends that we are not merely cruising
around on a space holiday and that the
nice little cruiser we had was not our own
its owner was a wealthy settler on venus
who came to a rather sudden end he
moved his atoblaster significantly it was
the only way he said in mock apology
we made things a little too warm for us
on the green planet and it was a case of
get away quickly or-the end for us our
intention was to use the cruiser to get us
to a remote planetoid and lie low for a while
we were in a tight spot we had to find
a remote space island which produced food
and as experienced spacemen you realise
that that is not easy

pag 
thrills incorporated

  but now thanks to you our problem is
virtually solved we have another space-
craft we have your identity call to allow us
to enter earths atmosphere through the
radio-beacon guard and we have informa-
tion about this claim which we can pass
on for a price to certain interests on earth
who will not ask any-er-awkward
questions

hat about us burst out jimmy
the dark man shrugged you are
-unfortunate he turned to his space-
suited accomplice open the air lock for
them he commanded

  youre going to send us out there with-
out our spacesuits gasped ken well be
smothered in those gases in a few minutes
naturally agreed the other but
please yourself if you dont get through
that air lock you will be blasted out of exist-
ence with this it is for you to decide but
make up your mind quickly

  for a moment ken eyed the ruffian then
he rose slowly heavily well this looks
like it jimmy he said bitterly we may
as well go out this way at least well have
the ultimate experience of an asteroids
atmosphere before we- he broke off and
lurched heavily at the man holding the
atoblaster gripping his wrist

  the man keen-eyed and alert as he was
nevertheless was a fraction too late he
pressed the switch and ken felt a searing
flare of heat past his temple as the blasting
ray barely missed him and then a stench
of melting foamrubber and fused metal told
their own story the ray had blasted a
hole in the side of the spacecraft

  ken clutching the mans wrist forced it
to the edge of the hole and as the hand
holding the atoblaster touched against the
red-hot jagged edge of the hole geddes
uttered a scream and dropped the atoblaster
through the hole and it fell out on to the
asteroid

  the hole in the crafts side was barely
twelve inches in diameter but already great
waves of the heavy outside gases were pour-
ing in jimmy who had taken kens action
as a signal had immediately flung himself at
the spacesuited figure of smike bearing him
heavily to the floor but this first effort was

also his last overcome by the gases he
now lay on the floor his face gradually
turning blue geddes who had also fallen
to the floor clutching his seared wrist was
rapidly slipping into gasping unconscious-
ness but ken still upright was as yet
scarcely affected by the heavy gases which
were flowing in and settling low down

  he staggered away from the hole towards
the automatic oxygen valve which had cut
in and was automatically endeavoring to
restore the atmosphere to normal he
gulped in some precious oxygen then
turned and struggled over to jimmy and
dragged the unconscious form of his friend
towards the hissing valve held his head
close to the stream of oxygen and watched
while the blue tint died first from the plump
face and then from the lips and jimmys
eyes flickered open feebly and he gulped
greedily at the life-giving oxygen

rphe big man safe in his spacesuit but
 hampered by its weight was dragging
his unconscious accomplice towards the
oxygen valve

  the oxygen croaked ken it cant
last long at this rate well have to plug
that hole  no time to get out the self-
welding plates to patch it   jimmy
that-that suit of mine might do it can
you help

  jimmy nodded dumbly

  get a lungful then and hold it

  the two men inhaled deeply felt the
oxygen pouring into their starved lungs
then lumbered across the craft to the space-
suit lying sprawled on the floor it was like
battling against an invisible surf and by
the time they had picked up the spacesuit
their heads were spining madly they
struggled towards the hole but as they
reached it jimmy spent reeled helplessly
away clutching at the nearest handrail to
keep himself upright ken keeping his
mouth shut tightly struggled with the heavy
suit raising it higher and higher towards the
hole he was on the verge of a whirling un-
consciousness every joint in his heavy body
was a focus of agony his lungs on the point
of bursting but with a last fierce effort of
will he jammed the spacesuit into the hole

page 
asteroid adventure

plugging the big leak with the tough triple-
skinned material designed to resist pressures
and gases

  gradually the prolonged hiss of the
oxygen valve lessened kens head cleared
he turned slowly and saw that jimmy was
reviving and then he remembered-his
own atoblaster was in the pocket of the
spacesuit it was a bitter realisation one
atoblaster lying out on the ground the othei
jammed in that hole in such a position that
it was impossible for him to get it out it
was small comfort to reflect that the jam-
ming of that leak was an immediately urgem
task that the lives of all had been in the
balance that a few seconds lost would have
resulted in his sinking down unconscious
and drowning in the foul heavy gases build-
ing up on the floor of the craft

  the spacesuited man had helped the
revived geddes to his feet the latter almost
recovered as the oxygen forced out the
asteroids gases through the small waste-
discharge valves and the atmosphere within
the craft returned to normal

and as he looked at the two men a
sudden audacious plan came to ken
if he could only dive out through the air
lock grab the atoblaster lying on the
ground and get back in it would be a risk
a terrible risk to plunge into that gas-laden
atmosphere unprotected but there seemed
no other alternative the big man in the
spacesuit was virtually in control now pro-
tected as he was from any ordinary mechan-
ical assault the latter his faculties un-
impaired bad already snatched up a heavy
spanner from the shadow-board and was
advancing on the two unprotected men
behind him holding a hammer which
smike had pushed into his hand came
geddes staggering slightly but still dan-
gerous

  and then inspiration came to ken he
backed away apparently afraid of the two
threatening men and the eyes of the big
man glinted with mingled triumph and
hatred

  not so sure of yourselves eh boomed
his voice through the two-way speaker ger
back there are you goin to make a fight
lor it or act sensible

  come and find out snapped ken he
backed away further his hands behind his
back he felt one of the little cold levers
no not that one   he moved further  
yes that was it gently carefully he
moved the lever a fraction there was a
slight almost imperceptible movement of
the spacecraft but only he prepared as he
was for it noticed it and the movement
coincided with his suddenly raised voice

jimmy he roared im going to dive
out for that atoblaster

  he made a rush for the air lock but
pulled up short as the big spacesuited man
moved in the same direction he aimed a
vicious blow at kens head with the spanner
ken ducked and swerved avoiding the blow
but the big man dropped the spanner and
with a triumphant laugh echoing through
his loudspeaker plunged through the air
lock in quest of the atoblaster

   well thats the finish my friends said
geddes grinning evilly no dont touch
those controls if this craft starts to lift hell
burst it apart with the atoblaster

  yes ken pointed to the glastic panel
in the floor of the craft just take a look
through there

  what- the man stared and slowly

the color drained from his dark face he
was looking down on the asteroid from a
height of a hundred feet-looking down on
a sprawled flattened spacesuited figure

  thats your friend said ken he fell
for what id planned fell in more senses
than one the craft was at least fifty feet
up when he took his dive and fifty feet in
this grav pull is more than something
every bone in his body is smashed to pieces
 operated the retarding jets just enough to
lift us i knew he wouldnt risk my grabbing
that atoblaster he knew that even if i
collapsed out there id blast the craft as a
dying gesture and he thought hed have no
trouble in getting it protected by his space-
suit he turned to jimmy right-o let
her down again well get busy with the
self-welding plates on this hole then back
to earth with the news of our strike and onc

jets-helena was the comment so here
we are on good old-whats the name of
this planet anyway

  nothing so far as i know she hur-
ried over to dr ibn yussuf who lay groan-
ing in the cast which protected the ribs and
arm broken in the first explosion of ionian
pinafore when we passed the system on
our way to deneb a week ago captain

hauberk named the sun maximiilian-
after the assistant- secretary-general of the
terran council that would make this
planet nothing more than maximiilian ii
a small satellite of a very small star

  what a deal donelli grumbled the
last time i had to abandon ship  found
myself in the middle of the antares-solarian
war now i get crazy in the head and ship
out on an expedition to a part of space
where humanitys just thinking of moving

in i pick a captain whos so busy buttering
up to scientists and government officials
that he doesnt bother to check storage
tanks let alone lifeboats  ditch with three
people-no offence helena-who cant tell
a blast from the hole in cygnus and they
get so cluttered up trying to seal the air-
locks that when the secondary explosion
pops off from the ship it catches us with-
in range and blooies most of our jets and
most of our q then to top it off  have

comfortable position and chuckled

  sad isnt it but ours was the only boat
that got away at that we were lucky

we werent lucky he disagreed we
just happened to have a good spaceman
aboard me ill scout around our island
and see if i can find any characters to talk
to our only hope is to get help from the
folks here if any sit tight till i get back
and dont touch any equipment you dont
understand

  want me to come with you-er don-

might forget which button great gravities

  donelli hadnt forgotten the incident of
the air-locks yet  

  shaking his helmeted head donelli
started the air-lock machinery

  the orange ground was brittle underfoot
he found and flaked off as he walked
despite the yellow atmosphere he could
see the complete outline of the island from
the hill near the ship it was a small enough
patch of ground pointing reluctantly out of
an irritated sea of hydrofluoric acid

  most of it was bare little dots of black
moss breaking the heaving monotony of
orange between the ship and the sea was

a grove of larger vegetation great purple
flowers on vivid scarlet stems that held
them a trembling thirty feet in the stagnant
air

  he had noticed a small cave yawning in
the side of the hill when he climbed it
sliding down now he observed its lower
lip was a good bit from the ground he
started to enter checked himself abruptly

  with his metal-sheathed finger he clicked
on the searchlight imbedded in his helmet
and with the other hand he tugged the
supersonic pistol from its clamps in the side
of his suit and waited for its automatic ad-
justment to the atmosphere of the planet
at last it throbbed slightly and he knew it
was in working condition

  just inside the cave entrance the beam
of his light showed a score of tiny maggot-
like creatures crawling and feeding upon
two thin blankets of flesh

  a clacking sound in his headphones
brought him to a halt again squeezing a
bubbling elation back into his heart

  could it be so early and so easy he
drew the screen away from the built-in
geiger on his chest the clacking grew
louder he turned slowly until the flash-
light on his head revealed a half-dozen
microscopic crystals floating a few inches
from one wall

  contra-uranium the most compact
super-fuel discovered by a galactic-explor-
ing humanity a fuel that required no refin-
ing since by its very nature it could only
occur in the pure state it was a fuel for
whose powerful uses every engine and
atomic converter on every spaceship built
in the past sixty years had been designed

  but six crystals werent very much the
lifeboat might barely manage a take-off on
that much q later to fall into the hydro-
fluoric sea

  still donelli soliloquised  its right
heartening to find some so near the surface
ill get an inerted lead container from the
ship and scoop it up but maybe those
crystals have a family further back

pag u

  the crystals didnt but someone or some-
thing else did

  four large chest-high balls of green
veined thickly with black and pink lines
throbbed upon the ground at the rear of
the cave eggs if not eggs what were
they

weird beings

tlonelli skirted them warily even
though he saw no opening in any of
them they were anchored to the ground
but they were unlike any plants he had
seen in nine years of planet-jumping they
looked harmless but -

  the back of the cave divided into two
tunnels which were higher and wider than
their parent hollow smooth all around
donelli might have taken them for the
burrows of an immense worm had he not
noticed the regularly-spaced wood-like
beams crossed upon each other at intervals
in both shafts the tunnels extended a good
distance ahead then curved sharply down
and away from each other

  donelli hated to use up power in his
helmet-transmitter but he might run into
trouble and it was essential that the three
scientists learn of even the small amount of

	in the cave after all the creatures who
built these tunnels might not know eneugh
chemistry to appreciate his inedibility be-
fore they sampled him

  he turned on his headset donelli to
ship good news ive found enough  to
keep up breathing until after this atmos-
phere burns through our grojen shielding
well be able to sit around in our space-
suits for at least three days after the ship
is eaten out from under us nice youll
see the crystals about half-way into the
cave and dont forget to use an inerted
lead container when you pick them up

  where are you going jake he recog-
nised helenas voice

  couple of tunnels at the rear of the
cave here have regulation cross-supports

thats why we didnt see any cities when
we came down the smart babies on this
world live underground im going to try
to talk them into a reciprocal trade treaty
-if we have anything they want to recipro-
cate with

  wait a minute donelli blaine shouted
breathlessly if you meet any intelligent
aliens its more than possible they wont
understand universal gesture-diagram
this is an unexplored fluorine-breathing
world im an experienced archaeologist
and iu be able to communicate with them
let me join you

  helena came back on id suggest you
take him up on it her steady voice said
archibald blaine may get switches con-
fused with buttons but hes one of the few
men in the galaxy who knows all nine of
ogilvies basic language-patterns tf these
miners of vours dont respond to an oailvie
pattern-well they just dont belong in our
universe

  a pause all right blaine ill be mov-
ing up the right-hand tunnel and helena
-see that his space-suit is all buttoned up
before he leaves the ship he can catch
an awful cold in that yellow air

  he ducked under a cross-beam his light
momentarily pointing down when he
straightened again he saw he had company

  at the far end of the tunnel where it
slanted down several long segmented be-
ings were moving slowly toward him there
was only the faintest rustle in his head-
phones as they approached

  donelli noticed with relief that only one
of them had a weapon a crude hand-ax
without a handle come to think of it
though an ax-head thrust forcefully might
penetrate not his suit but-what was more
dangerous-the grojen shielding leaving
the metal exposed to the corrosive atmos-
phere not so good but they didnt seem
hostile

as they arrived within a few feet of him
their speed decreased almost to im-

mobility but their three pairs of three-clawed
limbs pushed them to his side then they
stopped and the long thin hairy appendage
on their heads brushed against his suit in-
quiringly and without fear their toothless
mouths opened and made low gobbling
sounds to each other

  they evidently had a language donelli
saw the flat membrane on their backs that
was obviously an ear but he looked in vain
for eyes of course living underground in
darkness they were blind a fat lot of help
universal gesture-diagram would be even
if they could understand it

  a terrific crash sounded in his ear
phones the three burrowers stiffened
around him donelli turned and swore

  blaine had entered the tunnel and
smashed into one of the cross-beams he
was stepping over the fallen log now his
space suit seemed undented but his self-
confidence had not fared so well also a
little bubble of earth formed over the area
which had rested on the beam end

  the natives had nibbed their head fila-
ment upon the ground as if examining its
intentions now before donelli could get
started they scampered down the tunnel
towards the fallen support working in
perfect co-ordination without any apparent
orders they quickly lifted and inserted it
in its former position then they began
brushing against blaine

  deep space doc donelli moaned as
he came up

  sh-h-h-quiet the archaeologist had
bent over the nearest burrower and was
clicking his metal-enclosed fingers in an
odd rhythm over its ear patch the animal
curved away for a moment then began a
low hesitant gobbling to the same rhythm
as the finger-clicks

  can-can you talk to it donelli found
it difficult to see the old man as anything
but a doddering ineffectual

  ogilvie pattern five knew it knew it
those three-clawed feet and the sharp curve
of the ax like to investigate the material
of the ax-noticed the pointed tip right off
had to be an ogilvie five language can
i talk to it of course just need a minute

or two to establish the facets of the pat-
tern

   blaine began to stroke the side of one of
the creatures with his other hand the
gobbling acquired a note of surprise be-
came staccato

  amazing blaine said after a while
they mine everything and completely re-
fuse to discuss the existence of surface
phenomena most unusual even for an
ogilvie five do you know where they
get their supporting beams from the roots
of plants at least thats what they seem
tobe from their description but-and this
is what the galactic archaeological society
will consider significant-they cannot seem
to grasp the concept of plant blossoms they
know only of the roots and the base of
the stem their social life now is strangelv
obscure for so elementary a culture but
perhaps it might better be termed simple
consider the facts-

  you consider them donelli invited
im thinking of the q we need all this
space-suit power drain is cutting so many
hours off our total breathing time find
out what theyd consider a good trade and
ask them to move up into the cave ahead
so that i can show them what contra-
uranium looks like well supply them with
inerted lead containers for picking up the
stuff how far do their tunnels run

   all around the planet i gather under
the sea and under the continents in a cross-
ing branching network i dont anticipate
any difficulty being the dominant intelli-

   there are more wonders in the mind of
   man-to-be than we realise today

gent life-form of the planet and not par-
ticularly carnivorous theyre really quite
friendly

dlaines fingers clicked questioninglv
at the nearest alien and he stroked its
side with short and long rolls of his hand
the creature seemed confused and gobbled
to its companions then it moved back
blaine clicked and stroked once more

  whats the matter doc they look
angry now

   my suggestion of the cave its evidently
under the strongest of taboos these are
barbarians you understand just emerging
into a religious culture-matrix and a
powerful taboo takes precedence over in-
stinct then too living in the tunnels they
are probably agoraphobic-

  look out theyre trying to pull some
fancy stuff

  one of the aliens had scuttled under
blaines feet the archaeologist tottered
crashed to the ground the other two bur-
rowers grasped his long arms between their
claws blaine struggled and rolled desper-
ately looking like a confused elephant
attacked by jackals

  donelli he gasped i cant talk to
them while theyre holding my arms they
are-theyre carrying me

  the pair of burrowers were dragging the
old mans body down to the tunnel with
gentle but insistent tugs dont worry doc
they wont get by me that must have
been one powerful taboo you broke when
you mentioned the cave

  as donelli advanced to meet the group
the alien who had upset the archaeologist
scurried ahead to confront him a forward
claw held the small ax-head well back for
a thrust

  not here though the claw snapped for-
ward suddenly and the ax-head spun to-
ward his visored face with unexpected
velocity donelli jerked his head to one
side and felt the pointed tip of the weapon
scratch the side of his helmet the slight
buzzing in his right ear was replaced by an
empty roaring that meant the ear phone
had gone dead which in turn meant the

page f

grojen shielding had been chipped off leav-
ing the hydrofluoric vapors free to eat
through the metal

  the burrower had retrieved theax in a
lightning scamper and had it poised for an-
other throw as donelli brought his super-
sonic up he marvelled at the creatures ex-
cellent aim despite its lack of vision

  just before he blasted he managed to
slip the intensity rod on the top of the tube
down to non-lethal pitch the directional
beam of high-frequency sound tore down
at the burrower and caught it with the claw
coming around again it stopped in mid-
throw stumbled backwards and finally col-
lapsed into unconsciousness upon the
orange ground

  blaine protested with a grunt as he was
dropped by the other two they ran up to
the fallen burrower and edged around his
body insistently donelli held his super-
sonic ready for further developments what
happened took him completely by surprise

in a series of movements so rapid that he
could hardly follow it visually one of
the aliens snatched up the ax-head while
the other lifted the creature donelli had
blasted to its back they rolled up the
slope of the tunnel and scurried past him
on either side the fluorine atmosphere
almost crackling with their passage by the
time the spaceman had whirled they were
gone down the far end of the shaft where
it dipped into the interior of the planet

  they sure can hurry when they feel they
have to donelli commented as he helped
the older man to his feet which is what
we have to do if i want to get back to the
ship before  start sneezing hydrofluoric
fluid

  they rang the air-lock signal and clam-
bered in

      race against time

                                                                     i

hastily donelli stripped off his space
suit there was a thin scar on the
metal of the helmet where the grojen
castaway planet

ihielding had been scratched away and
hf vapor eaten in a little longer out
there and he would have been doomed

  hullo for the first time he noticed
that almost one-third of the cabin was taken
up by a great transparent cage one cornet
of which was occupied by a relaxed red
creature with folded black wings when
did the vampire kid arrive

  ten minutes ago helena naxos re-
plied she was adjusting a temperature-
pressure gauge at the side of the cage and
he-she-it didnt arrive  carried it inside
after dr blaine left i went over the island
with the telescanner and noticed this thing
flying in from the sea it went right to
those purple flowers and began cutting ofl
sections of the petals and putting them in
a sort of glider made out of vines and
branches that it was towing the things
obviously cultivate vegetation that patch
out there is one of their gardens

  imagine the archaeologist breathed
another civilisation in embryo-avian
this time an avian culture would hardly
build cities but this is a culture where
the glider comes before the wheel

  so you put on a space suit and went
out to get it donelli shook his head
you shouldnt have done that helena
that creature might have packed a wallop

  yes  considered the possibility but
i didnt know if you two were going to hit
anything important and this winged thing
looked as if it might prove to be a link be-
tween us and this world its ability to fly
in particular while we are grounded could
prove valuable it was fairly quiet when 
approached neither scared nor angry so i
tried the little ogilvie i know-pattern one
didnt work

  of course not dr blaine told her posi-
tively this is obviously ogilvie language-
pattern three consider the hinged wings
the primitive glider you mentioned the hus-
bandry of flowers it has to be an ogilvie
three

  must have used up an awful lot of q
helena i notice you have pretty elaborate
temperature and pressure controls as well
as hf humidifiers and in-grav studs and
that loud-speaker system is wasteful

as blaine began experimental dronings
and buzzings into the instrument the
creature inside the transparent cage opened
its wings in a series of hinged movements
and revealed the whole rich redness of its
small body it crawled under the loud-
speaker and spread open a mouth that was
slit up and down instead of sideways the
black wings beat slowlv as it gained interest
reflecting cheerful yellow streaks in their
furrows

  this would take some time donelli
walked to the telescanner and faced dr
douglas ibn yussuf

  suppose we get this fellow to co-opc-rate
wheres a good place to tell it to look for


  all right i wont digress into a discus-
sion of the scientific attitude where would
you find contra-uranium on a planet thats
been shown to possess it near the sur-
face id say where the lighter elements
abound youve already found some in a
cave on this island that would indicate
that it was explosively brought to the sur-
face the only place it could exist when the
planet was in a formative state if there is
other contra-uranium on this world there
must be other caves like the one here

  donelli waved him to silence and bent
over the telescanner good enough deep
space and suppressed novas doc that
was all i wanted to know now ill see how
much i can find out before i use up the
dregs of our power

  he swept the beam across the sickly sea
and up the coastline of the continent until
he saw a dark spot in the orange ground
then nudging the telebeam into the cave
he saw at last the few shimmering crystals
that meant precious  he tried other aper-
tures here and there convincing himself that
while there was little enough in any one
cave the planet as a whole possessed more
than they required the sight of all the
unobtainable q on the telescanner screen
made donelli sweat with exasperation

  he made another discovery leading
down the rear of every cave was at least
one tunnel that denoted the presence of the
burrowcrs

page 
thrills incorporated

  if only we could have made them under-
stand donelli murmured all of our pro-
blems now would have been orbital ones
he rose and turned to see how his ship-
mates were doing with the winged alien
great gravities what did you do to it
the avian was back in a corner of the
fluorine-filled compartment its hinged
black wings completely screening its body
from sight the wings pressed down harshly
as if the creature were attempting to shroud
itself out of its environment

r archibald blaine his hands
cupped over the microphonc was chuk-
chuking urgently droning repetitiously
humming desperately no apparent effect

  it was the mention of the cave again
helena naxos explained her pleasant face
betraying worry we were doing fine going
from howdyedos to howveyebeens-
the girlie was beginning to tell us all about
her complicated love-life-when dr blaine
asked if she had ever been inside the cave
period she crawled away and started to
make like the cover of a hole

  they cant do this to us donelli yelled
this planet is practically crawling with 
which we cant get because we dont have
he  to cross a hydrofluoric acid sea the
only way we can get it is for these babies
to haul it over either underground through
tunnels or across the sea and every time
blaine starts talking about the caves where
the q is lying around they go neurotic on
him whats the matter with the caves
why dont they like them i like the caves
take it easy jake helena soothed
were up against a basic taboo in two sep-
arated cultures there must be a reason for
it find the reason and the problem is
solved

  im working on it he replied testily
withdrawing his mouth from the micro-
phone to creatures on the threshold of
civilisation however superstition takes
precedence over mechanical innovations if
its only superstition-thats another thing
we dont know could it be the contra-
uranium crystals theyre afraid of

  dr ibn yussut raised himself  his
sound vm that is doubtful their

chemical composition contains no elements
heavier than barium according to the spec-
troscope thus no contra-atomic chain re-
action would be set off by their bodies com-
ing in contact with the crystals perhaps the
mere existence of the crystals upsets them

  blaine frowned no unlikely there
would have to be a factor intimately related
to them in some way if i could only attract
her attention no matter what i say she
just lies there and gurgles he went back
to his urgent buzzing franctically using a
life-time of archaeological knowledge

   donelli looked at the fuel indicators his
lips flattened into a grimace

  ill have to go out there and pick up
those o particles in the cave that cage
you built may make that avian comfortable
but it sure drained us dry

  wait ill go with you helena sug
gcsted maybe i can discover what makes
these fearsome caves so fearsome

  you know her voice said into his
headphones as they trudged toward the hill
if dr blaine is able to talk some sens
into that creature and we manage to get to
a regular traffic lane and get rescued hell
make quite a smash before the galactic
archaeological society with his two co-
existing but unrelated civilisations ill get
some fair notice myself with the little ive
been able to deduce about these creatures
biologically without resorting to dissection
even lbn yussuf bed-ridden as he is has
been doing some heavy thinking on the
chemistry of a bromide soil and you-
well i imagine you want to get back to a
place where you can hurry up and get
drunk

  no

  her helmet turned toward him in sur-
prise and question	 -
no he continued if we get out of
this im going to take advantage of the life-
boat law heard of it

  she hadnt her eyes glowed intently be-
hind her visor

  the lifeboat laws one of the oldest in
space any spaceman-able or ordinary
r-who under a given set of circumstances
is entitled to assume command of a vessel
and successfully brings that vessel to safety

page 
castaway planet

may at his written request be issued the
licence of a third officer its called the life-
boat law because thats what it usually per-
tains to i have the experience all i need
is the ticket

  look at that helena had paused with
her back to the mouth of the cave

primitive war

jake donelli turned and looked back
at the ship across it in the grove of
fleshy purple flowers were at least a dozen
winged creatures like the one blaine was
attempting to interest in conversation far
over the sea were many dots that grew
larger and resolved into even more of the
avians some of them towed gliders lightly
behind them others carried light tubes
blow-guns

  wonder how they knew about susie
the spaceman mused was it because she
didnt come back at the usual time that the
posse was organised or are they tele-
pathic

  a combination possibly they certainly
seem fo know when one of them is in
trouble you wouldnt say theyre acting
belligerent

  nope just flexing what passes for their
muscles they dont know whether we in-
tend to serve susie fricassied or boiled in
her hie jacet better duck inside

  the biologist became her ccisp self the
moment she saw the white worms wish
i could tell exactly what it is theyre eating
now suppose i make a loose guess yes
it could well be jake where are those
other eggs

  other eggs back there funny kind
of eggs

  she slipped ahead of him her search-
light picking out the chest-high globules
with a muttered exclamation she bent down
and examined one closely it was slowly
splitting along a pink vein donelli waited
hopefully

  no she straightened it doesnt add
up even assuming as would seem pos-
sible that those small creatures in the front
are the live young of the burrowers and

these are the eggs of the avians it still
doesnt explain their relative distance from
the usual habitat of their parents if they
were the young of each species the posi-
tions should be reversed with their strong
taboos and respective phobias the avians
would not fly so far into the cave and the
burrowers would not crawl so close to the
surface

  continu-um he swore this isnt a
research paper for some scientific society or
other were in a hurry this is a matter
of life and death woman cant you put
sonie pressure into your thinking

  she threw up her arms in their ungainly
wrappings helplessly im sorry jake im
trying hard but i just dont have enough
facts on which to base an analysis of two
separate unfamiliar societies im not a
sociologist im a biologist so far as these
creatures are concerned ive just reached
the threshold

  the spaceman slung the inerted lead con-
tainer to the ground preparatory to catch-
ing up the crystals of contra-uranium

  whats the matter with them anyway
that theyre so afraid of the caves what
do they think will happen to them after they
cross the threshold

  what-do-they-think - will - hap-
pen helena repeated slowly what are
we all afraid of the fear intrinsic to any
living animal but how-the eggs-why
of course of course

  she bent toward him briefly and donelli
felt his helmet clang

  sorry she said  forgot i tried to

   from the beginning of time man has sought
   to find the essence of life itself

   but life must destroy other life in order to
   live    read the terrible fate of the genera-
   tion who will learn to create life  life which
   in turn must threaten them with extinction   

   dont miss the gripping terror when life runs
   amok and man is powerless against 

the escaped essence

kiss you what beautiful reasoning jake
  huh he felt absurdly clumsy in his
ignorance-and guilty

  i ii have to work the details out as 
go dr blaine-once i give him your pre-
mise he  be able to help isnt it won-
derful how removal of one stone from the
pyramid of obscurity sends the whole struc-
ture tumbling down now jake do you
think you could go into those tunnels and
fetch me a live but slightly stunned bur-
rower well need one you know

  i-i guess i can where do you want
him

  it jake it bring it right here to the
middle of the cave ill be waiting for vou
hurry

che ran out of the cave toward the ship
 donelli watched her go decided he
couldnt recall any particularly clever re-
marks he had made set his supersonic for
its lowest frequency and moved to the
tunnels

  he paused before the intersection he
and blaine had had their little scrap with
the burrowers in the right-hand one and
an elaborate trap might have been set there
against their return accordingly he chose
to walk down the shaft on his left

  the slope became steeper donellis
helmet light suddenly esfjosed another
more complicated intersection ahead in the
form of six tunnel entrances in front of
one two burrowers were chipping the end
of a large root out of the tunnel ceiling

  as his search beam hit them they
whirled simultaneously and waved the hairy
appendage at him for the barest fraction of
a second then both sprang for the tunnel
entrance in a flicker of ivory bodies

  donelli thought he had missed he had
brought up his weapon just as they leaped
but one fell to the floor the ax-head drop-
ping the creature was not completely un-
conscious gobbling wcakiy at him as he
approached donelli slung it over his
shoulder and started back the creature
squirmed limply in his grasp

  there was an odd ihsistent patter be-
hind him a sound of many legs pursuit

well they wouldnt dare follow him into
the cave he wished the suit werent so
heavy though he kept turning his head
to look at the empty shaft to the rear
nasty to be overcome from behind under
the suffocating earth of an alien planet

  even though the burrower stiffened with
fear when he reached the cave he felt bet-
ter the pattering grew louder stopped
came on slowly

  helena naxos and blaine were squatting
near the four large veined balls the avian
weakly fluttering between them they held
a supersonic over it the winged creature
had evidently had a dose of sound like that
of donellis captive blaine was speaking
persuasively in that hum-drone language
with little apparent effect

  put it right down here next to the
other one helena ordered with a little
time and a little imagination we may get
out of this fix too early to tell just yet
jake youll have to act as sort of armed
guard at this conference we mustnt be dis-
turbed susies playmates are too frightened
to come in but theyve been making all
kinds of fuss since we carried her out of the
ship and into the cave

  ill take care of it the spaceman prom-
ised

  he gasped with sheer astonishment when
he reached the entrance to the cave the
saffron sky was obscured by multitudes of
black winged avians dipping in short angry
circles a swarm of the dvians had sur-
rounded the lifeboat aiid as he watched
they lifted it slightly off the groitnd in the
direction of the sea

  the supersonic low-power beam rolled
them off the ship in a huge stunned mass

  they left the ship alone after that and
came in flying low at him with their blow
tubes in their mouths jagged darts shrilled
nastily all around him he felt one bounce
off his chest and hoped vaguely that they
were less effective than the weapons of the
burrowers on grojen shielding he moved
back into the shadow of the cave

  helena dr blaine and the two aliens
came up behind him and gathered round
the white worms near the entrance

  pretty dangerous here he told them

pag-ll
castaway planet

these avians of yours are an accurate
bunch of snipers

  no help for it she replied were
getting close i dont think theyll keep
blowing darts after they get a glimpse of
sister susie well be safe so long as were
near her

he moved past them toward the rear
noting that both the winged and clawed
creature were no longer under the influence
of the supersonics but were listening in-
tently to dr blaine as he alternately
hummed at one and clicked at the other
they almost watched helena gesture to the
white worms and their grisly meal and back
to them

  he began to cough no mistake this
time there was hf vapor seeping into his
suit through some scratch fluorine was
eating at his lungs well he didnt have
time to feel sick

  he looked over his shoulder no more
darts-werfc coming in at the rapt group
near the cave mouth evidently the avians
were possessed of more love for one of
their number than the burrowers he had
just started to turn his head when a heavy
object struck the back of his helmet he
dimly perceived he was falling it seemed
to him that the burrower which he had cap-
tured leaped over him and rejoined its
fellows and that susie flew out to a clus-
tered bunch of avians and that they all
buzzed and hummed like idiots

  what a waste of time he thought as the
fire began to consume his brain helena
let them go

  it seemed to him that helena and dr
blaine were hurrying to his side through a
shimmering mist of yellow agony it also
seemed to him that one of the chest high
balls split up along a pink vein and some-
thing came out

  but he was sure of nothing but the pain-
ful choking darkness into which his body
twisted nothing but the agony in his
chesf  

  he woke with a spacemans certain know-
ledge of riding a smooth jet his body felt
deliciously light he tried to sit up but he

was too weak to do more than turn his
head two men had their backs to him
after a while he identified them as dr
archibald blaine and dr douglas ibn
yussuf dr yussuf was out of his cast and
was arguing in an animated fashion with
blaine over a white ax-head imprisoned in
a plastic block

  why im in dr yussufs bunk donelli
muttered stupidly

  welcome back helena told him mov-
ing into range of his watery eyes youve
been pretty far away for a long long time

  away

  you ate enough hydrofluoric acid to
etch a glass factory out of existence i made
my biological education turn handsprings to
save that belligerent life of yours we used
up almost every drug on the ship and dr
yussufs organic deconverter-and-respiratbr
which he built and used on you is going to
make him the first physical chemist to win a
sblarian prize in medicine

  whgn-when did we take off

  days ago we should be near a traffic
lane now not to mention the galactic patrol
our tanks are stuffed with contra-uranium
our second jet is operating in a clumsy sort
of way and our converter is functioning as
cheerily as any atomic converted ever did

  after the help we gave them with their
own lives the population of maximilian ii
was so busy bringing us  that we ran out
of iherted lead containers from consider-
ing us the personifications of death theyve
come to the point where they believe
humans go around destroying death or at
least its fear and its jake donelli who
did that

  i did did i donelli was being very
cautious

  didnt you that business about the
threshold of life and death being the caves
was what i heard you develop with my own
ears it was the only clue i needed the
caves related not only to the sacredness of
birth but-more important to the primitive
mind-to the awful terror of death a
threshold you called it and so it was not
only between life and death but between
the burrowers and the avians once i had
that and with a little scientific guessing it
thrills incorporated

was simple to figure out why the eggs were
laid in apparent reverse order-that of the
burrowers near the front and that of the
avians at the rear-and why they had never
met each other

rthe spaceman thought that over and
- then nodded slowly

  simple donelli murmured yes that
might be the word this little shred of
scientific guessing you did just what did
it amount to

  why that the avians and the burrowers
were different forms of the same creature in
different stages of the life-process the
winged creatures mate just as their powers
start to decline before the young hatch
the parents seek out a cave and die there
the young those white worms use the par-
ental bodies as food until they have grown
claws and can travel down to the tunnels
where they become adolescent burrowers

  the burrowers after all are nothing but
larva-despite the timbering of their shafts
and their mining techniques which drs
blaine and yussuf consider spectacular
they can be considered sexless after seve-
ral years the burrower will return to the
cave in the belief of its fellows it dies
there since it returns no more it spins a
cocoon-thats what those large green balls
were-and remains a chrysalis until the
winged form is fully developed it then
flies out of the cave and into the open air
where it is accepted by the so-called avians
as their junior it evidently retains no
memory of its pre-chrysalis existence

  thus you have two civilisations unaware
of each other each different and each pro-
ceeding from the same organism so far
as the organism was concerned in either
stage it went to the cave only to die and
from the cave in some mysterious fashion
its own kind came forth therefore a
taboo is built up on both sides of the
threshold a taboo of the most thorough-
going and binding nature the mere thought
of whose violation results in psychosis the
taboo of course has held their development
in check for centuries interesting

  how did they take it

  warded at first  but it explained some-

thing they were very curious about and
swept away an immense weight of ugly fear
of course they still die in the caves to all
intents and purposes but they can see
their lives as a perfect reproductive circle
with the caves as a locus and what a re-
ciprocity they can work out-they are work-
ing out

  reciprocity donelli had almost moved
to a sitting position

  helena wiped his face with a soft cloth
dont you see the burrowers were injur-
ing the avian gardens by nibbling at the
roots they will now use only the roots of
old strong plants which the surface creatures
will designate and set aside for them they
will also aid avian horticulture by making
certain the roots have plenty of nourishing
space in which to grow in return the
avians will bring them surface plants which
are not available to tunnel creatures while
the burrowers provide the surface with the

  no wonder they broke their backs get-
ting q and after working that out for
them all you did was repair the ship fix
me up take off and set a course for the
nearest traffic lane

  oh so

   just so right dr blaine

  the archaeologist looked up impatiendy
of course of course there has not been
one moment since the disaster aboard the
ionian pinafore when i have not been
under mr donellis orders

  there was a pause in which dr blaine
muttered to dr yussuf over the ax-head

  how old are you helena donelli
asked

  oh-old enough

  but too clever eh too educated for

me

  she cocked her head and smiled at him
out of a secret corner of her face maybe
well see what happens after we get back
to the regular traffic lanes after were
rescued after you get your third mates
ticket here-what are you laughing at

  he rumbled the amusement out of his
throat oh i was just thinking how we
earned our q by teaching a bunch of
caterpillars that butterflies bring babies

    belli luigi

it looked like professor
mountheld had just
the ship to make inter-
planetary travel child
play  thats why a
few others took a hand
in his game  only they

wanted to play it rough

      tt

a challenge accepted

the man who alighted from the big ear
was heavily built swarthy of complex-
ion his cojd tawny colored eyes had in
them n expression of fierce hatred as they
urveyed the scene before him and as he

strode along the white concrete path hi
square jaw was set and determined obvi-
ously a man with a fixed immediate pur-
pose and one which he was determined to

achieve at any cost

the white path led up to a steel-barwd

pms

gate set in a high wire fence which com-
pletely encompassed the area in which stood
the enormous high building and several
smaller structures beside the steel gate was
a small cylindrical concrete building which
looked like a sentry-box and which in fact
served that purpose for as the big man
reached the gate a blue-overalled man
emerged with an air of elaborate careless-
ness and leaned lazily against the wire fence
one hand in a hip pocket

  the big man glared at the guard you
know me he snapped

  oh yes mr sweintz isnt it but ive
got my orders so ill have to ring through
wont keep you long

  the man sweintz muttered angrily under
his breath as the sentry re-entered his box
and operated a telephone he glared up at
the colossus of a building which stood in
the pleasant grassy grounds dominating the
other comparatively tiny bungalow-like
buildings to which white flower-fringed
tracks radiated from the main building

  okay mr sweintz said the sentry
emerging and unlocking the steel-barred
gate straight to the office he indicated
the nearest bungalow-like building

  the other grunted and strode along the
white track to the building on the door
of which was affixed a brass plate en-
graved astroaerial project office he
entered the outer office where a clerk after
giving him a quick searching glance escort-
ed him to an inner office and announced
him from the doorway

  good afternoon mr sweintz the
solitary occupant of the small sparsely furn-
ished office rose and greeted him courte-
ously he was tall and thin with a long
studious looking face surmounted by un-
tidy wisps of grey hair a pair of rather
pale grey eyes peered over the top of
crooked old-fashioned gold-rimmed spec-
tacles which incidentally had been repaired
with a piece of thin copper wire

  well said sweintz seating himself
what about it mountfield ive come to
make a last appeal to your commonsense
the professor smiled taking no offence
at the others harsh tone and belligerent
manner i am sorry mr sweintz he
said mildly it is really distressing for me
to save to refuse but i have complete

page 

faith in my project much as i should like
to accede to your-

   you can cut out the frills mountfield
snapped in sweintz i want yes or no

  then i am afraid mr sweintz said
the professor regretfully the answer is a
very definite no

  you dont seem to realise mountfield
he said that the jet-rocket principle has
been experimentally proved we have the
fact of experiment of trial one of our
robot rockets a perfect miniature of the
machine we are on the verge of completing
now has actually travelled in space for
 miles which is only fifty-odd thou-
sand miles short of our objective-the
moon not only that but it also made a
perfect return and landing your own
astrogyro has never been off the earth
it is a thing of mathematics and theory and
no one knows better than you mountfield
that a slip in a mathematical equation can
pyramid to a gross error in the final calcu-
lation

  i admit that mr sweintz said the
professor but in this particular case it
does not apply while there has been no
test flight in the usual sense of the term
the astrogyro has had every unit tested
over and over again during the construction
of its parts and the assembling of them if
you understood the principle i am using
you would know that errors are-well if
not impossible at least most unlikely

  the thing is just as likely to crash on
the return trip even if it reaches the moon
snapped sweintz and how do you know
how it will behave once it clears the earths
atmosphere youve never sent up a model
have you

  no because it was not necessary

  sweintz gritted his teeth at the others
calm assumption that the astrogyro was
the complete answer to space travel and
knowing professor mountfield as he did he
was racked with the fear that the astro-
gyro was indeed all that its inventor claimed
if that were so then all the money and effort
sweintz had poured into his jet-propulsion
project would be simply thrown away
wasted leaving him a penniless nonentity
instead of a wealthy powerful and respected
figure
space race

  with the cunning of desperation he tried
a new angle

  now listen mountfield he said lean-
ing forward you will agree with me that
the whole object of this bight to the moon
is to enlarge the scope of mankind to
enable men to study the other space bodies
with a view to the betterment of the race
generally

  most emphatically i agree

  the fact that there is the international
prize of five hundred thousand pounds as
well as enormous profits in the construction
of appropriate space-travel craft which will
be modelled on the first machine to com-
plete the lunar trip-those things are sec-
ondary to the true scientist therefore why
should we not for the benefit of the race

and of science combine our forces your
discovery whatever it is could be of great
assistance to me if it could be incorporated
in my machine while i on the other hand
could no doubt assist you we could share
in the honor and of course the profits-
although that is a minor matter-and our
fellows would benefit if we go our own
ways use our own methods we may both
crash and the loss would be enormous a
setback like that could put back space-
travel for years

  yes thought your jet-prop job was
perfect sweintz said a voice from the
doorway

  the big man turned quickly and stared
at the newcomer a tall well-built young
man dressed in grey overalls although
ruggedly built and tanned of face the
young man bore a close resemblance to
his father professor mountfield his face
was rather long his forehead high while the
expression of his eyes was an almost exact
replica of that of the older man

  oh its you growled sweintz who

hated the outspoken young scientist even
more than he disliked the professor you
ought to know he added in reply to ronnie
mountfields remark that nothing is per-
fect in science until it has been actually
tried-not even your precious astrogyro
itll do us grinned ron going now
sweintz were busy men you know got
an urgent appointment on the moon

   hope you keep your appointment
snarled sweintz rising and  hope you
live to tell the world what you saw on the
moon he strode to the door good day
to you both i wont trouble you again
ive given you a last chance to do the sen-
sible thing if you want to make the first
flight to the moon a race then i accept the
phallenge he slammed the door

treachery

tleasant fellow sweintz observed
ron so courteous and polite

  i can understand his feelings up to a
point said professor mountfield tolerantly
after all ronald he has spent many years
working on his jet-propelled craft and until
news of my work was revealed he imagined
that nothing could stop him from making
the first flight to the moon and thus winning
the international prize and the other ad-
vantages promised to the piqneer lunar
traveller

  yes said ron grimly and hes not
going to give up the idea of reaping all
those advantages either

  of course not the professor eyed his
son in some surprise we know that he
is determined to make the attempt

  i wasnt thinking of that aspect dad
said the young man im convinced that
not only will he make the attempt himself
but hell try to stop us from making our
flight

  my dear boy you are making some-
thing big out of a mere trifle the man is up-
set but beyond a display of anger he will
do nothing nothing that is except to
speed his preparations for the lunar trip
youre too easy going and trusting
dad grunted ron because you have
certain ideals and principles you think every-
one else has them anyway im going to
be wary for the next few days even if

page
thrills incorporated

sweintz doesnt attempt to stop us he may
attempt to find out the nature of your in-
vention and if he could get his hands on
your antigravity control hed have no com-
punction about using it and its a faci
that the thing is so delightfully simple in
operation he would grasp its potentialities
in no time

  be wary by all means smiled the
professor but within three days we shall
be on our way to the moon  have no
fears on that score and now ronald ha
the antigravity control been installed

  it has dad said the young mat
eagerly thats what i came to see yoi
about come and give it the once-over
he led the way from the office and ovei
to the huge square-topped building out
side the locked door of this building a mail
was busily engaged in digging in one of the
garden plots

  he wasnt there when i came out hi
remarked eyeing the man suspiciously
thats that fellow miles you engaged
dad  dont like the look of him
youre too suspicious altogether said
his father we had to have a gardener to
keep the grounds in order and we couldnt
spare any of our regular men this man
had excellent references

  ron made no further remark but as he
turned the keys in the double-locked door
he looked swiftly behind him to see thai
the man had stopped digging and vas eye-
ing him with furtive keenness immediately
the mans eyes dropped back to his task
youll bear watching breathed ron tc
himself as he opened the door

  inside the enormous cavern-like struc-
ture with its sliding roof stood astrogyro
the fruits of the combined mathematical
genius of the professor and the mechanical
and electrical skill of his son it was ol
glassily-smooth glittering metal an alloy
perfected by ron mountfield and his assist-
ant andy macbride and designed to resisi
the magnetic charges which would be en-
countered in space

  the craft streamlined and with a row
of tapering blisters of transparent plastic
along either side stood two hundred feet
high its transparent nose almost touching
the sliding roof it rested on its stern its
bo pointing directly upwards actually

the machine was designed to take off like
a rocket flatten out once it cleared the
earths atmosphere and again to assume a
vertical position when reaching another at-
mosphere or preparing to land but the
landing would be stern-first and controlled
by repulsion jetgyros the landing and
take-off gear was a splayed cylindrical mem-
ber consisting of a multitude of alloy
springs

  the two men entered the machine
hrough -a valve-door stepped into a tiny
ift and were shot up to the control room
icar the nose of the space craft

  from the lift they entered an extraordin-
nily topsy-turvy looking room in which
lials levers and a mass of switches were
placed at odd angles-there were dials set in
ihe floor and the ceiling switches high in the
walls others low and at intervals in the
walls floor and ceiling were short metal
handrails but there was nothing haphazard
about the design of that vital control room
lor in certain conditions the wall might be-
come the floor or the ceiling and each
unit was placed in a position which would
facilitate quick and efficient operation some
of them being duplicated for that purpose
when astrogyro was beyond the influence
of gravity the occupants of that room al-
though in an artificially created atmos-
pheric pressure of  lbs to the square
inch would be relatively without weight
and would have to pull themselves around
to the various controls by means of the
metal handrails

  picking their way through the maze of
instruments ron and his father opened a
small door on the far side of the room and
were greeted by a voice with a rich scotch
burr

  weel prof shes a complete the
speaker a short red-headed man with a
grinning face looked up from the glass-
topped metal box which he had been con-
templating the two men moved across
the tiny chamber and looked into the metal
case-looked into the very heart of the
great machine

  under the thick plate glass was a fluted
rod of dull grey metal about which was
wound coils of wire the whole mounted
on a tracery of delicate gears and tiny
levers and at either end of the case was an

page 
space race

ivory band calibrated with small numbers
it was the vital link between atmospheric
travel and space travel the antigravitv
control

  the professor had in fact found the
relationship between magnetic force and
gravitational force and had calculated the
combined unit the magnogravam the
calibration on the ivory strip in the regu-
lator was arbitrary being measured out in
decamagnogravams with the gravity ot
earth placed at  with the result that
when the regulator was charged at that
capacity the earth-pull was zero and the
huge astrogyro was without relative weight

  youve tried it mac said the profes-
sor

  aye responded macbride watch
 prof

  he operated a vernier control and the
dullness of the fluted rod gave way to a
bright green glow and at the same time a
faint humming sound came from the sides
of the machine which told that the magno-
gravamatic force was being fed along cables
all through the hull of the huge spacecraft
just as blood is pumped from the heart
through the arteries of the body the
scotchman operated a small capstan-wheel
and the rod moved slowly around until an
attached pointer ran across the calibrated
ivory strip until it stopped at 

  earths gravity murmured the profes-
sor his mild eyes gleaming now astro-
gyro should have no weight

  thats reet agreed mac try it if ye
like

  i will put in ron quickly he hurried
from the room descended in the lift and
emerged from the machine his hand shook
slightly as he extended it and placed it
under one of the transparent blisters al-
though he had implicit faith in his fathers
invention and had experimented with a
model he felt the immensity of this moment
when an upward movement of his arm
would reveal whether the calculations and
application of the experimental work as
applied to the real thing were successful

  he pushed upwards gently and the
enormous machine rose slowly and remained
poised in mid-air astrogyro now weighed
zero for a few moments the young man

stood gazing at the scientific miracle in front
of him then he moved over and gently pul-
led the huge machine back to its resting
place

  he was about to re-enter the valve door
when a faint scraping sound behind him
caused him to turn sharply he looked
around the big building there were several
work benches around the walls and a con-
fusion of crates and cases which would af-
ford cover fpr any intruder but the door
had been double-locked his mouth set
grimly if anyone was actually in the build-
ing then he had gone to considerable
l rouble to gain entry-probably managed

in some way to obtain a set of tplicate
keys

  the implied threat in the last words of
sweintz came back to the young man and
then he remembered miles he went to the
door of the building which was still locked
opened it and peered outside the mans
spade was there but its owner was not

  ron re-entered the building and at the
same time a soft heavy object crashed down
on his skull and he was engulfed in black
unconsciousness

  close call that muttered his attacker
slipping a black sandbag into his pocket
if hed started searchin here fer me it
would ave crooled things proper now to
get rid of yer fer a few hours

infernal machine

kon struggled up through the black void
of oblivion to painful consciousness
his hands and feet were securely bound
and a greasy gag was firmly tied over his
mouth he blinked around the room and
recognised it as one of the smaller outbuild-
ings only a short distance from the main
structure which was used as a store-room

  howdyer feel pal enquired a coarse
voice

  ron glared dumbly at the leering pseudo-
gardener miles

  yer neednt think yer ol mans worryin
about yer son said miles  cos he aint
i told im when he come outer the ship to
look fer yer that yerd gone down to the
main gate after id give yer a message from
a bloke who came up in a car then i tells
him yer went away in the car and would be
back in about an hours time he chuck-
led yer dad just shakes his silly old head
and says somethin about you bein rattic
and off he goes

  the man looked at a gun-metal watch
well time  started gettin busy ron
watched with burning anxious eyes while
the fellow produced from his hip pocket a
little ebonite case with a dial set into it
resembling a voltmeter he plugged two of
four leads into a power point and the other
two leads he attached to an adaptor which
in turn was connected to a wire which ran
through a hole in the floorboards

  having completed his task the man again
looked at his watch nearly time he
grinned at four oclock im goin to turn
on that there power point and after the
juice has passed through that there time-
switch for ten minutes itll liven up this wire
ere what runs in the garden bed up to the
buildin where yer precious astrogyro is

  that said the fellow with relish will
be the end of yer astrogyro cos why
cos theres enough high-explosive packed
around that buildin to send the ole business
sky-high thats why

  ron struggled fiercely but futilely with
his bonds

  no use wrigglin said the man ill be
the end of you too but that cant be elped
after all yer might be blown high enough
to git to the moon first see he grinned
at this pleasantry and went on its yer
own fault the boss wanted to play ball
with yer but yer wouldnt so he give me
the signal as he was leavin to-day to carry
on and do what ive been plannin fer
weeks i laid that there wire while i was
workin in the gardens and i dug the oles
around the buildin and packed in the ex-
plosive-finished the last one only a while

ago i was supposed to find out somethin
about your craft too if i could but it was
too risky anyway it dont matter now
because the bosss craft wont have to beat
no opposition he rose and felt in his
pocket withdrawing a bunch of keys if
yer wonderin how i got in son theres
how uster be a locksmith before i got
jugged after doin a little job made me
laugh to see you locking them two locks so
careful took me no time to make up a
set of keys if it hadnt been fer them guards
yer stuck around the buildin every night
id have ad a good look over that there
machine and praps did a nice job of sabby-
targe still whats it matter shell be
goin up in bits in-yes just ten minutes
from now so its time i wasnt ere its me
knock-off time and  want ten minutes to
git clear of this joint cos elle goin to
break loose cheerio son give me regards
to the hangels

  the fellow bent clicked over the power-
point switch and hastily quitted the build-
ing

  the dial of the time switch was facing
ron and the young man could see the cali-
brations there was a fixed hand on the
 and the other moving hand was tick-
ing faintly across the dial when the two
hands were level the circuit would be made
and then-

  ron struggled madly with his bonds but
the rascally miles was evidently an expert
at his job for there was not the slightest
slackening of the cords he gave it up at
last panting and half-suffocated by the
filthy gag in his mouth the moving hand
had reached 

  it was then that ron decided to concen-
trate on his gag he was quite close to the
big building and there was a chance-
admittedly only a faint chance-that mac
or his father might pass within earshot on
the way to the machine he chewed fran-
tically at the sodden mass of oily sponge
cloth in his mouth tearing bits from it and
working them out of his mouth with his
tongue but only with great difficulty and
as he chewed and grimaced his eyes were
held hypnotically by that slowly-moving
hand now passing from the th minute and
moving inexorably inevitably towards 
space race

  ron continued to chew frantically
at the same time listening eagerly the
footsteps came closer were within a few
feet of the door they were at the door-
then they began to die away

  a sickening sensation a feeling of physi-
cal nausea overcame the young man his
hopes which had soared for a brief moment
crashed two minutes to go he spat an-
other wad of the sodden cloth from his
mouth there was still a lump of the clotted
cloth in his mouth but it was no longer
secured although it was impossible to get
it from his mouth due to the strip of cloth
bound around his mouth and fastened be-
hind his neck but if he couldnt get it out
of his mouth in one lump he might be able
to swallow it

  he worked the wad around in his mouth
and gulped and for a few seconds he
thought that he had merely exchanged one
form of death for another the wad lodged
in his throat robbing him of air he fought
down the impulse to expel it from his throat
and instead gulped and swallowed fiercely
until at length he had swallowed the thing
and was breathing freely again

  and-then he shouted-shouted against
the strip of rag between his teeth shouted
with a wild frenzy that carried far beyond
the walls of his prison he thought he could
hear approaching footsteps but he did not
desist in his efforts in order to listen he
shouted again and again his eyes fixed on
the fatal needle which had less than one
minute to go before completing the circuit

  weel whats the trouble whats all
the shoutin-ronnie lad mac stand-
ing in the doorway stared at the squirming
young man

  switch rons cracked voice was
urgent turn it off off-off

  sweetch mac looked blank what
swcetch what-

  off-off rons voice rose to a scream
his eyes glared at the power-point switch

quick

  awreet lad dinna get yersel excited
aboot it mac stepped over to the power
point as he bent down ron saw the
black needle move over to the fatal 
he closed his eyes waited every nerve
tense for the explosion but instead he
heard macs voice

  noo to get ye undone lad and then
well hear from ye

quick decision

yes there isnt any doubt ronald that
sweintz was behind that dastardly at-
tempt professor mountfields tones were
troubled the mans words his admission
that he received a signal from his boss to-
day his boast that the boss would have no
opposition  yes there isnt any doubt
but unfortunately there is no proof

  no legal proof said ron bitterly un-
less ve could grab that villain miles and
make him confess but im more concerned
now about the safety of the machine if
sweintz has made one attempt to wreck
the craft and to murder us incidentally
then hell make another hes absolutely
ruthless

  he wouldnt dare- began the profes-
sor	v
hed dare anything if he thought he
could get away with it look dad theres
only one thing to do short pf taking positive
measures against sweintz and that is to
make the trip right now

  what tonight youre not serious
ronald

  why not everything is ready-stores
fuel space-suits-everything

  the lads reet prof said mac nodding
slowly astrogyro is ready an waitin
shell neer be a better craft than she is
tonight but if yon sweintz can get at her
shell be a worse craft by far

  but the interplanetary society they
must be told-

  tell em now ron pushed the tele-
phone table-set closer to his father tell
em were going just as soon as we can move
off if they want to send a representative
tell em to have him here within the hour
aye tell em just that said mac he
rose from his chair his rugged face aglow
with anticipation the lad an ill get things
to rights prof come on lad

  professor mountfield looked at his two
subordinates and something of excitement
crept into his mild eyes the enthusiasm of
the others was infectious and ron sensed
victory when he saw that gleam in his
fathers eyes

stern and i are at your command

  bronstern pale-faced and with shifty
pale-blue eyes nodded agreement

  very well the professor outlined the
partys recent activities and their plan of
returning to astrogyro and avoiding the
sublunar monsters en route after which the
inen moved on ron taking the lead

  sweintz and bronstern werp in the rear
and deliberately lagging well behind the
others ron looking around once saw that
sweintzs lips were moving

  mac he called quietly into his trans-
mitter those two are chatting over an-
other wave-length they may only be curs-
ing us to each other but they may be plot-
ting mischief try out your wavelengths
and see if you can pick them up i dont
like tie look of things

attack

ith the huge crater of posidonius now
a distant bulge to the north and the
hat expanse of mare serenitatis lying before
them the five men stood on jhe jagged sides
of the rock-wall surrounding the vast plain
in the distance glittering in the lunar sun-
shine like a silver pencil standing on its
end was astrogyro

  and now said ron all we have to
do is get aboard her he walked to one
side motioning to mac the scotchman fol-
lowed him and ron without speaking
turned his eyes meaningly in the direction
of sweintz and his companion silently the
scotchman shook his head indicating that
he had not been able to tune in on the
conversation of the two men during the
journey ron who had made similar at-
tempts without success shook his head also
no doubt sweintz had a peculiar wave-
length selection in the space-suit apparatus
into which other radios could not tune and
the knowledge brought further uneasiness to
the young man

  he led the way down on to the plain
and as he drew nearer to the great craft
his straining eyes picked out a score or so
squat blobs rising from the white ground

pace race

and set at regular intervals in a circle
around the landing member of the space-
craft

  theyre there he cried those con-
founded sublunar things are guarding astro-
gyrov

  the professor nodded slowly his eyes
grave yes theyve put two and two to-
gether and decided that their enemies came
from this foreign structure and theyre
guarding it to make sure that no other
enemies emerge to attack them he bit
his lip theyll squat there indefinitely-
or at least for the rest of the lunar day
which is another twenty-odd days of our
time

  shoot em up snapped sweintz draw-
ing a heavy revolver from one of the com-
partments of his space-suit

  dont snapped ron quickly put that
thing away svveintz-or better still hand
it to me

  thats likely isnt it snarled sweintz
whats tq stop you putting a bullet through
my headgear and letting me bust

  you wouldnt understand whats stopping
iie sweintz replied ron coldly  know
whats stopping you from doing it to us
youre relying on us to get you otf the
moon alive and if you want to get away
alive youll obey our orders give me that
revolver sweintz

  the big pian muttering angrily flung the
revolver at rons feet

  you too bronstern snapped ron
hand your gun to mac if you have one
youll be searched if you say you havent
one anyway

  and leave me nothing to protect myself
with said bronstern you say those
things down there are dangerous

  well do our best to look after them
said ron if sweintz here had fired that
shot there wopld have been scores
hundreds of the brutes coming from the
ground in a few minutes  told you before
that they have a communication system of
their own that sends an instant warning

through the whole colony  all right
mac theres his gun take it

   falling in beside his father ron moved
ahead any plan to get around these

creatures dad

   can only suggest son that we rush
the vaive-door weve learnt from our
incident in the tunnel that they do not
sense our presence but must see us with
that solitary eye of theirs remember 
stood for quite a while watching their
activities and we should have got away
without their knowing we were there at
all had it not been for that creature coming
from behind and seeing me therefore
our best chance is to approach as stealthily
as possible from different directions and
rush the door whichever one of us is
first seen will be attacked if it happens
to be the one making for the door the
others will have to concentrate on the
creature making the attack

   i can suggest nothing better dad said
ron after a moments thought better
get that knife of yours ready its sudden
death to these things if you get a chance
to use it but well have to speed up the
attack once we start otherwise well be
surrounded and completely overwhelmed
once these sentries give the alarm to their
pals underground    sweintz and bron-
stem he called have you knives in your
equipment and when the two men
surlily replied in the affirmative ron went
on get them out and be ready to use
them on these things now spread outv
you over there mac sweintz get over
to the extreme left bronstern move over
to the right thats the idea all set
im going to make a dash for the door
dad youd better keep a few yards behind
me ready to take a stab at the first creature
that attacks me everyone ready right

reinforcements

sphere was no movement from the
squat monsters as the men advancing
in a wide semi-circle approached the space-

page 

craft the sublunar creatures their
tentacles resting in convoluted masses on
their mushroom-like bodies appeared to
have no suspicion of any other presence
closer and closer the semicircle of humans
drew to the immobile monsters-twenty
yards fifteen   

   with less than half-a-dozen yards separat-
ing him from the spaceship ron saw with
a thrill of horror a huge single eye swing
around and come to rest on him

  now he yelled rushing forward and
at the same instant the creatures began to
swivel towards him their tentacles waving
threateningly and the dull white of their
bodies taking on a pink glow-a glow that
would act as a broadcast of alarm through-
out the vast underground colony

  the valve-door was directly ahead of
the young man and he reached it with one
of the creatures clinging to his leg it was
the leg of his space suit which was already
torn the inner plastic skin showing in the
gap and it would take but little more
damage before bursting

  frantically he pushed his arm up into
the streamlined sheath covering the wheel
which controlled the door he felt the
cold metal in his hand and commenced
winding rapidly furiously he felt the
outer skin of his space suit ripping away
under the fierce onslaught of the tearing
lightning-like tentacles the creature had
attacked the most vulnerable part of the
suit enlarging the hole already made
ripping great strips of the stout material
and once it got a good grip of the inner
skin   

  a great wave of relief poured over him
as the tentacles ceased their tearing he
cast a swift look down and saw the dying
body of the monster spread out at his feet
the professor however in despatching the
creature had been violently attacked him-
self and was reeling around a great mass
of pink tentacles around his shoulder
covering his helmet and blinding his view

  with a final wrench ron brought the
wheel to its limit and the outer valve-door
of the spacecraft slowly opened h
dropped back to the ground and rushed
pace race

over to his father who was hacking fran-
tically at the tcntacles covering his helmet
another of the creatures had fastened to
the professors legs and as ron reached
him his father tripped and fell falling on
top of the creature which was clinging to
his shoulders

  the little knife flew in a glittering arc
from the professors hand and ron pounced
on it as it fell he plunged it into the soft
body of the creature which was imprisoning
the professors legs-plunged it in and
drew it across the parchment-like skin and
saw the bubbling heaving life-fluid of the
creature pour out in a sickening viscid
stream he struck at the other creature
struck and tore a gaping wound in it and
its tentacles drooped away slowly and help-
lessly

  get in dad shouted ron quick
he turned to look for the others mac a

couple of yards away was struggling des-
perately with half-a-dozen of the monsters
gradually pushing his way towards the
spacecraft but on the verge of falling at
any moment bronstern was completely
overwhelmed lying on the ground too
frightened to use his knife properly his
screams in rons radio were ear-split-
ting and horrible sweintz however was
laying about with his knife a long-bladed
murderous weapon and around him were
several oozing carcases to testify to his ef-
forts

  but the man was scared the swarthy
face that looked across at ron through the

space-helmet was a dirty yellow colour and
his voice coming intermittently through the
screams of the prostrate bronstern was
roaring for help

  ron forgetful of the state of his space
suit raced over to the hard-pressed bron-
stern wrenched the knife from the fellows
feebly clutching hand and with swift tear-
ing strokes made gaping wounds in the
creatures bodies but although bronstern
was enabled to rise which he did with
alacrity and raced to the open valve-door
ron had diverted attack to himself the
creatures were flinging themselves at him
and again the fear that his space suit might
give yay clutched at the young mans heart

  he staggered towards the spacecraft into
which the craven bronstern was already
clambering sweintzs roars for help
sounded in rons radio but the big man
was slowly getting nearer to the craft hack-
ing madly at the impeding creatures with
his knife it was mac who was in real
trouble

  silently and without a suggestion of an
appeal the scotchman was using the heavy
revolver as a club but it had but slight
effect upon the resiliency of his attackers
bodies and as ron lurched towards him
mac went down his body smothered be-
neath the writhing mass

  again wielding the knife ron staggered
over to his friends assistance the outer
skin of his suit was hanging in great trailing
rags and two of the creatures were tearing
at the inner covering but he continued to
hack at the scotchmans attackers

  with a violent effort macbride flung one
of the oozing dying beasts from his chest
and struggled to a sitting posture he looked
behind ron his eyes staring with wild
despair

  this-this is it lad he gasped
theyre cornin-thousands of the things

  ron swung round wildly from the
mounds were pouring scores of the mon-
sters-the warning as he had anticipated
had been communicated throughout the
length and breadth of the vast underground
system as far as he could see across the
plain the mounds were disgorging the sub-

lunar inhabitants in an almost solid mass
the creatures swept rapidly toward the craft
a vicious lethal flood of pink-tinted bodies
and thrashing tentacles

final attempt

the gun mac as he uttered the cry

  a ron drew the revolver which he had
taken from sweintz knowing how effective
was the knife against the monsters he had
neglected to use the gun and although he
knew that the bullets unless fired through
the eye into the nerve-centre of the
creatures were almost useless he recalled
in that moment of extremity the temporary
shock which the firing of the guns under-
ground had given the creatures above
ground with the sound dissipated the same
ruse might not be effective but it was their
last and only chance

  he pressed the trigger again and again
and mac grasping his young friends idea
used his revolver sending spurts of flame
from the muzzle

  it worked rons voice was a yell of
triumph as the creatures temporarily
shocked by the noise fell away he yanked
mac to his feet and the two men raced to
the valve-door being held open by the pro-
fessor the great mass of sublunar inhab-
itants stopped suddenly at the sound df
gunshots but only for a moment evidently
reassured to some extent by their num-
bers they again came forward in a swivel-
ling rush making towards sweintz who was
furthest from the spacecraft

  the man staggered and almost fell over
the corpse of one of the creatures but the
combination of fear and lack of gravity sent
him flying forward at almost unbelievable
speed he reached the valve door flung
himself in on top of the others ron span
the wheel of the outer space-door and it
dosed on the massed horrors without

  ron stood in the transparent bubble of
astrogyro looking down on the plain of
mare serenitatis the ground was thick

with the sublunar inhabitants for hours
the creatures had waited patiently without
movement coldly intent to destroy this
queer invader of their system the young
man had taken innumerable photographs
of the things as well as of the lunar land-
scape itself through the transparent ob-
servation bubble and now the spacecraft
was ready to begin its long journey home-
wards

  at your post ron called professor
mountfield and you mac and
presently the order was given degravi-
tize and the order was repeated by
mac and then minor jetgyros and
minor jetgyros repeated ron

  slowly the spacecraft rose from the
lunar ground gradually the vast plains
shrank and the huge extinct volcanoes
dwindled away to tiny jagged looking
humps on the lunar face above big and
glorious in the black sky wreathed iiv its
halo of atmosphere was earth their ob-
jective

  ron and his father the controls being
set for automatic working stood again in
the observation bubble watching the
changing scenes above and below

  almost the end of a wonderful experi-
ence son murmured the professor

  ron looking through the bubble
nodded assent then as a faint groan
reached his ears he turned quickly to see
his father crumpling slowly to the floor

  not quite the end my friend rasped
the harsh voice of sweintz thanks for
dropping my revolver just inside the valve
door and thanks for not searching me for
ammunition he moved the big revolver
threateningly as the young man took a step
forward

  you fool cried ron you cant get
away with this youll wreck us

  i think not sneered the other your
friend mac will help us steer the craft
back to earth or else now just step over
here bronstern you take charge of him

  youre mad snapped ron whats
going to happen when you get back to
earth the world knows that this is
professor mountfields craft -

space raca

   was his craft corrected sweintz with
an evil grin most unfortunate that the
original crew were killed by the lunar
creatures ill have some photographs of
the things to show too but very fortunate
that bronstern and i managed to escape
and salvage astrogyro and of course
we shall be entitled to the rewards of sal-
vage

  so thats your idea you-you filthy
swine said ron why you- he
lunged forward but sweintz pulled the
trigger of his gun and ron felt the shock
of the bullets impact in his shoulder he
reeled away clutched at the stair rail and
fell and had it not been for the weak
gravity belt of the moon would have
crashed heavily

  as it was he reached the foot of the
stair flight dazed and bleeding from the
wound but with no ill-effects from his fall
above sweintz was levelling the gun at
him and ron ducked around the bend of
the staircase and staggered across to the
nearest door which led into the jetgyro
motor room as he almost fell into the room
he heard sweintz call to his accomplice and
a moment later the two men were hurrying
down the stairs

   as he rose to his feet ron felt himself
soaring upwards and the now-familiar
sensation of losing all weight told him that
astrogyro was once again in space under
the guidance of mac he wondered dully
whether the scotchman had heard the
revolver shots unlikely mac was in the
control room behind closed doors

   he grasped one of the handrails with his
uninjured arm and pulled himself through
the air towards the great pulsating motors
which were pumping out the motive power
the gyro-rays into space through the big
slotted openings there was a space be-
tween the motors and the inner hull and
towards this he pulled himself biting at his
lips in the agony of the effort his para-
mount need at that moment was to con-
ceal himself hide from these two murder-
ous ruffians until he could recover from
the shock of his wound and the loss of
blood

   he reached his objective and crouched
out of sight as sweintzs voice reached his
ears

   might have come in here bronstern
the door was open cant see him though
well have to track him down he might
wreck the ship if he thinks theres no other
way out

   i dont like it sweintz bronsterns
voice was quivering with fear that other
fellow mac will wreck the craft when he
knows about this

   dont be a fool man dont you think

	know enough about spacecraft to learn
how to pilot this thing these fools were
that excited about getting away from the
moon that i was able to see into the en-
trol room as soon as i came aboard the
thing is fundamentally simple-theyre
using a degravity control ill get some-
thing about the operation from mac i
have my methods hell be glad to tell
me everything before ive finished with
him sweintz ended with a cold laugh
and the listening ron felt a blinding surge
of anger welling up within him come
on man came sweintzs voice again
pull yourself around and look for him
theres plenty of scope for him to hide in
this great cavern of a place hes the most
dangerous one aboard he wanted to lock
us up by the way but the old chap was
quite sure we couldnt do any harm with-
out endangering our own lives

   he might be right too sweintz you

shadow all right mountfield he called
youd better come out

exit sweintz

ron remained motionless silent behind
the great motor he could hear
muttered words as sweintz spoke to his
henchman

  for the last time mountfield are you
coming out

  still the young man remained silent he
looked up and at the same time bent his
knees underneath him if sweintz ap-
peared in that opening the only access to
the space behind the motor ron promised
himself grimly that he would be ready foi
him

  but sweintz did not appear instead a
hand holding a revolver gleamed above

  and as the gun turned towards him ron
launched himself upwards grasoed the
wrist of the man holding the revolver and
twisted violently the gun roared above
the steadily pulsating motors but the bullet
went wide

  ron although weakened by the oozing
wound in his shoulder retained his fierce
grip on sweintzs wrist all the pent-up
fury and hatred of this vile wretch whose
life the astrogyro crew had saved was
behind the young mans grip sweintz
his dark face livid with fear and rage
raised his free hand and smashed it into
the face of his antagonist rons grip
weakened and the other pushed himself
away and shot up to the ceiling the
revolver which had slipped from sweintzs
grasp was floating within a few feet of
and between the two men both lunged
towards it but neither caught it instead
the weapon shot away from their lunging
hands and struck the wall opposite

  ron immediately catapulted himself to-
wards the figure up against the ceiling he
drove hard with his fist striking the other
on the jaw and causing him to spin around
bumping  bouncing back from the
ceiling	f

  the big man his eyes glaring stark
hatred suddenly twisted in mid air pressed
his hands against the ceiling and lunged
out with both feet the blow caught ron

who was shooting upwards in an attempt
to get to grips with sweintz full in the
face he shot backwards striking the
floor



  he opened his eyes to a whirling mass
of lights and saw through them that
sweintz jerked backwards by the impetus
of that kick was over against the hull
within a few feet of the slotted opening

  look out yelled ron involuntarily
that slot its the gyro-rays it goes
out into-

  he broke off as sweintzs body was
swiftly and suddenly sucked as though
it were a scrap of paper towards the slot

  the big mans eyes widened first with
surprise then with horror he turned his
head and a rattling scream issued from
his throat a scream that began in the
motor room and ended in space

conclusion

t ess than an hour to go said ron

    and then the earth he was
sitting in the control room his arm in an
improvised sling professor mountfield
his head bandaged was operating the jet-
gyros

  the great machine had entered the
earths gravity belt and was travelling
slowly downwards towards the pin-point
of its landing place under the guidance of
macbride

  the latter grinned across the room it
looks more like a space ambulance than
a spacecraft he commented weel i
canna say im sorry to be back where a
mon belongs hae did ye find bronstern
lad any better

  he hasnt got over the shock of what
happened to sweintz replied ron hes
more of a fool than a rogue so ill make
it as light as i can for him when we get
back hes lying in his bed in a daze and
a funk

  ron rose and went to the observation
bubble

  below the earth was rising slowly to-
wards them above the sky was again a
familiar blue and the sun the same golden
globe of old
