turning over slowly one at a time as they
were tested

  in the vikings upper control room
gerry norton and steve brent made a
final check of the instrument panels both
men wore the blue and gold uniform of
the interplanetary fleet fatigue showed
on both their faces on steves freckled
pan and on gerry nortons lean face
gerry in particular had not slept for thirty-
six hours his responsibility was a heavy
one as commander of this second attempt
to reach the planet venus from earth
well-he would have a chance to catch
up on sleep during the long days of travel
that lay ahead

  the two officers finished their inspection
and strolled out onto the open deck atop
the vessel for a while they leaned on
the rail staring down at the dense crowds
that had thronged the airport to see the
departure of the viking in this warm
weather the men wore only light shorts
and gayly colored shirts the women wore
the long dresses and metal caps and thin
gauze veils that were so popular that year
around the fringes of the airport stood
the ramparts of new yorks many tall
buildings with the four hundred story
bulk of the federal building a giant metal
finger against the midnight sky

  when are we going to pull out chief
steve brent asked

  as soon as the ship from mars gets
in and olga stark can come aboard
funny thing-ive never been able to
like that gal steve said gerry smiled
faintly

  that puts you in the minority from all
reports however-thats aside from the
point shes the most capable space-pilot
in the whole fleet and we need her
whats she like personally

  tall dark and beautiful-with a nasty
tongue and the temper of a fiend steve
said he yawned and changed the sub-
ject yknow-ive just been wondering
what really did happen to the stardust
gerry shrugged without replying that
was a question that was bound to be in
the minds of all members of this expedi-
tion whether or not they put it in words
travel between earth and mars had been
commonplace for more than a generation
now but there had not yet been any com-

munication with venus-that cloud-veiled

planet whose orbit lay nearer the sun than
that of earth two years ago the explor-
ing ship stardust had started for venus
she had simply vanished into the cold of
outer space-and never been heard from
again

gerry norton thought the viking
would get through science had made
some advances in these past two years
his ship would carry better rocket fuel
than had the stardust and more efficient
gravity plates the new duralite hull had
the strength to withstand a terrific impact
they would probably get through if not
-well-he had been taking chances all his
life you didnt go into the interplanetary
service at all if you were afraid of danger

  there comes the ship from mars now
steve brent said suddenly pointing up-
ward

  a streak of fire like a shooting star had
appeared in the sky far above it was
the rocket blast of the incoming space
liner yellow flames played about her
bow as she turned on the reverse rockets
to reduce the terrific speed the roar of
the discharge came down through the air
like a faint rumble of distant surf then
the rockets ceased and the ship began to
drop down as the helicopters were unfolded
to take the weight and lower her easily
through the atmosphere

  it wont be long now steve said in
his low deep quiet voice

  aye not long boomed a deep voice
behind them but im thinking it will be
a long day before we return to this braw
planet of ours

  angus mctavish chief engineer of the
viking was a giant of a man with a voice
that could be heard above the roar of
rocket motors when he chose to raise it
he had a pair of very bright blue eyes
-and a luxuriant red beard there were
probably no more than a dozen full sets of
whiskers worn in the earth in this day
and age and mctavish laid claim to the
most imposing

  fuel all aboard chief he said the
tenders cast off and were ready to ride
whenever you give the word

  just as soon as these people come
aboard
the golden amazons of venus



  tell me mac steve brent interposed
now that were all about to jump off into
the unknown-just why do you sport that
crop of whiskers

  so i wont have to button my collar ye
feckless loon the big engineer replied
instantly

  the scots are a queer race

  aye lad-the salt o the earth we
remain constant in a changing world all
the rest of you have forgotten race and
breed and tradition till yeve become as
alike as peas in the same pod all over the
earth we of scotland take pride in being
the exception

  and in talking like some wild and
kilted highlander of the twentieth century
youre out of date angus

  if you two are going to argue about
that all the way to venus gerry said
grimly ill toss you both out and let you
drift around in space forever

  speaking of the twentieth century
steve said one of the ancient folk who
lived in that long ago and primitive time
would be surprised if they could see the
new york of today why they made
more fuss about one of their funny old
winged air-ships flying the atlantic than we
do about a voyage to mars or the moon
 the ship from mars settled gently down
on the concrete landing platform and her
helicopters ceased to turn from a hun-
dred nozzles along the edge of the platform
came hissing streams of water playing
upon the hull that had been heated by its
swift passage through the outer layers of
the earths atmosphere then as the hull
cooled the streams of water died away
and the doors opened the passengers be-
gan to emerge

  a platoon of police their steel helmets
gleaming in the glow of the lights cleared
a path through the crowd for a small group
that hurried across to the waiting viking
a few minutes later three newcomers came
aboard all wore the blue and gold uni-
form of the interplanetary fleet the two
men were martians thin and sharp fea-
tured with the reddish skin of their race
the other was an earth woman olga
stark stood nearly as tall as gerry nor-
tons own six feet she had a pale skin
and a mass of dark hair that was coiled
low on her ncck

  pilot-lieutenant stark and flight-
ensigns tanda and portok reporting
aboard sir she said quietly

  youll find the officers quarters aft on
b-deck im calling a conference in the
chart room as soon as we get clear of the
stratosphere

gerry norton stood on the little
platform at the top of the control
room under a curved dome of transparent
duralite that gave him a clear view along
the whole length of the vikings super-
structure the last member of the expe-
dition was aboard the airport attendants
had all stepped back the time of depar-
ture had come at last

  close all ports he snapped

  close ports it is sir droned chester
sand the safety officer warning bells
rang throughout the ship tiny green
lights came winking into view on one of the
many indicator panels

  all ports closed sir the safety offi-
cer sang out a minute later for a mo-
ment gerry bent over the rail of the plat-
form and himself glanced down at the solid
bank of green lights on the board

  start helicopters he ordered

  there was a low humming the ship
began to vibrate gently from his place
in the dome gerry could see the vikings
dozen big helicopters begin to spin faster
and faster they moved as angus mctavish
gave his engines full power then the ship
rose straight up into the air

  here we go boys-venus or bust
steve brent muttered under his breath and
a low chuckle swept across the control
room

  the lighted surface of the airport fell
swiftly away beneath them the myriad
lights of new york were spread out like
a jeweled carpet in the night dwindling
and seeming to slide together as the drive
of the vikings powerful motors carried
her steadily upward at the three thou-
sand-foot level they passed a traffic bal-
loon with its circle of blue lights and the
signal blinker spelled out a hasty good
luck

at the thirty thousand-foot level they
passed an inbound oriental  west-
ern liner bringing the night mail from
	planet

china she hung motionless on her heli-
copters to let the viking pass her siren
giving a salute of three long blasts while
her passengers crowded the decks to cheer
the spacc-ship after another ten thousand
feet they were above ordinary traffic lanes
the glass windows of the control room
were beginning to show a film of con-
densing moisture and steve brent brought
the heavy duralite panes up into place

  stand by rocket motors gerry com-
manded stand by to fold helicopters
ready contact

  there was a muffled roar the vikings
nose tilted sharply upward momentarily
the space-ship trembled like a living thing
then she shot ahead while the helicopters
dropped down into recesses within the
hull and duralite covers slid into place over
them gerry climbed down from the dome
into the main control room momentarily
lie glanced at the huge brass and steel speed
indicators

  twelve hundred miles an hour he
said fast enough for this density of at-
mosphere hold her there summon
heads of departments and all deck officers
to the chart room

  the call was quickly answered

  the assembled officers stood leaning
against the walls or perched on the chart-
lockers now that the trip had actually
begun uniform coats were unbuttoned and
caps laid aside angus mctavish had a
battered brier pipe clenched in his teeth
the stem was so short that the swirling
smoke seemed to filter upward through
his whiskers

  better be careful mac said portok
the martian maybe the air filters wont
be able to handle that smoke of yours
never mind the air filters sonny
grunted the big scot with imperturbable
good humor theyll handle the smoke
of good baccy better than the fumes of
that filthy grricqua weed you smoke on
mars

  a radio loud-speaker had been left on
and they heard the voice of an announcer
on some european station

  we now bring you a brief sports
resume in canton china the shantung
dragons played a double header with the
budapest magyars the score of the first
game was 

stories

  wonder if they ever heard of baseball
on venus steve brent chuckled

  maybe theyll learn as fast as we of
mars said portok i seem to remem-
ber that in the last interplanetary cham-
pionship series we 

  skip it steve growled i lost a
weeks salary on that series

  mctavish and portok grinned

  gerry norton watched them with a smile
on his lean dark face they were a good
crowd the viking was going on the most
dangerous journey mankind had ever at-
tempted a journey from which no one had
ever before returned alive but he could
not have asked for a better group of sub-
ordinates they were people of his own
choosing and all but two were old ship-
mates though he had never sailed with
chester sand the safety officer had been
highly recommended neither had he ever
sailed with olga stark before but he knew
her by reputation as an excellent navigator
and when she applied to go he felt he
should accept her

for half an hour gerry held them to-
gether while he set the watches and
checked assignments and outlined other
routine details then the meeting ended
and only steve brent remained with him
they walked forward into the darkened
control room where the only light was the
dim glow from the indicator boards the
quartermaster on watch stood motionless
beside the steering levers

  gerjy noticed that he had a tendency to
rise a couple of inches off the floor with
each step the pull of earth was already
lessening he threw the switch that con-
trolled the attraction-gear and heard a
faint hiss of shifting gravity plates beneath
their feet the feeling and impression of
normal weight returned

  for a moment gerry and steve stood
looking out one of the big duralite win-
dows of the control room at this level
the legions of stars gleamed with an un-
real brilliance in the dead black of the
heavens the earth was a vast globe be-
hind them glowing for a quarter of its
surface with the familiar outlines of the
continents still visible with the lessen-
ing pull the viking had increased speed to
five thousand but she seemed to be stand-
the golden amazons of venus



ing still in comparison with the vastness
of space

  funny thing chief steve brent said
meditatively olga stark and chester
sand are not supposed to have met before
they came aboard this ship-but i saw them
whispering together in that dark corner off
corridor  as i came forward

  maybe shes just a fast worker gerry
said for a moment the incident irritated
him but then he shrugged and forgot it
on a purely scientific and exploratory ex-
pedition of this kind there was no possible
motive for any underhand work

the days passed in slow progression
the viking had attained her maximum
speed of fifty thousand miles an hour as
the ceaseless drive of her great rocket mo-
tors forced her ahead a speed possible in
the void of outer space where there was
no air to create friction for all her great
speed by earthly standards she was but
crawling slowly across the vastness of in-
terplanetary space

  life on board had settled down to a
smooth routine now and then alarm bells
would suddenly ring a warning of the ap-
proach of a small planetesimal or some
other vagrant wanderer of outer space and
the ship would change course to avoid a
collision otherwise there was little ex-
citement astern the familiar earth had
dwindled to a shining disc-like the but-
ton on an airmans uniform ahead the
cloud-veiled planet of venus drew steadily
nearer

  passing along one of b-deck corridors
one day gerry met olga stark coming out
of the recreation rooms she was oft duty
at the moment and instead of her uniform
she wore a long gown of green silk her
dark hair was surmounted by a polished
metal cap and a thin gauze veil hung
to her chin gerry stopped her with a
gesture

  very dccorative lieutenant he said
with a twitch of his lips but this is sup-
posed to be a scientific expedition i must
ask that you wear your uniform outside of
your cabin

  i am off duty she retorted her dark
eyes suddenly angry and sullen

  its true that youre not on watch at
this moment but everybody is on duty

twenty-four hours a day till this expedi-
tion is over resume your uniform

  and if i refuse she asked

  youll go into double irons when im
commanding a ship i do just that

  for a moment their glances met the wo-
mans hot and angry the mans cold and
unyielding then without another word
she swept away to her cabin gerry nor-
ton sighed and went on his way he had
never become entirely reconciled to the
presence of women in the interplanetary
fleet they made good officers most of
the time but occasionally they had fits
of feminine temperament

at last there came the day when the
yellowish cloud-veiled mass of venus
filled half the sky ahead watches were
doubled up rocket motors were cut down
as the attraction of the planet pulled them
onward then the forward rocket-tubes
began to let go for the braking effect and
the flame of the discharges filled the con-
trol room with a flickering yellow light

  as they entered the outer atmosphere
layers of venus the effect of air on the
suns rays gave them natural sunlight and
blue skies again for the first time in over
six weeks something about the effect of
yellow sunlight slanting in the port-holes
raised the spirits of all of them and men
were whistling as they went about their
work gerry brought the ship to a halt
a few thousand feet above the endless tum-
bled mass of clouds that eternally cov-
ered all of venus they were now near
enough to be fully caught in the rotation
of the planets stratosphere so that they
had normal night and day instead of the
eternal midnight that had gripped them for
weeks

  early the next morning with all hands
on duty the vikings helicopters began to
drop her down into the cloud-mass the
cottony billows swept up to meet them-
and then they were submerged in a dense
and yellowish fog moisture gathered
thickly on the windows of the control
room

  this reminds me of a good london
fog said angus mctavish who had come
up from his engine rooms for a few min-
utes i wonder if they have any good
pubs down there
	planet stories

  the soupy saffron-colored fog en-
shrouded the viking as she dropped lower
and lower gerry norton checked the alti-
tude personally watching the slowly mov-
ing hand of the indicator twice he held
her motionless while he sent echo-sound-
ings down to make sure they were not too
close to land then they went a little lower
-and suddenly came clear of the cloud
mass they were sinking slowly down-
ward through a peculiarly murky golden
light that was the normal day-time condi-
tion on the planet of venus they had
arrived

  below them stretched the rippling waters
of a vast and greenish sea it was broken
by scattered islands bare bits of rock that
were dotted with a blue moss and were
utterly bare of life except for a few swoop-
ing sea-birds on a distant shore were
lofty mountains whose peaks were capped
with snow in one or two places a narrow
shaft of sunlight struck down through a
brief gap in the canopy of eternal clouds
but otherwise there was only that sub-
dued and peculiarly golden light nothing
moved but those few oddly shaped birds

  lord-but its lonely gerry mut-
tered

  there was no sign of human existence
no trace of the towers and buildings of
mankind not even any sign of life at all
except for those sea-birds it was like a
scene from the long-ago youth of the world
when the only life was that of the teeming
shallows or the muddy shores of warm
seas the place was desolate and forlorn
and inexpressibly lonely

  they had opened some of the ports for
a breath of fresh air after long weeks of
the flat and second-hand product of the air
filters with its faint odor of oil and dis-
infectant the breeze that came in the open
ports was warm and moist and faintly
salty

  rocket motors - minimum power
gerry commanded quietly theres no use
landing on one of those bare islets well
see what lies beyond the mountains

  the subdued blast of only two rocket
tubes began to drive the viking forward at
a slow speed of about  mph while
long fins were thrust out at the sides to
carry the weight and free the helicopters
all hands were crowded at the windows

and ports after a moment olga stark
turned to gerry

  our magnetic compasses are working
again captain she said quietly i sug-
gest going across the mountains and then
turning southwest

  why there-rather than in any other
direction gerry asked quietly the girl
shrugged

  just a hunch of course its all guess-
work

  the viking had to go up to a level of
 feet above this lonely venusian sea
before she was above the peaks of the
mountains then gerry turned her in-
land just before they left the shore-line
they passed some sort of a flying thing
that swooped down to prey on the sea-
birds it had a reptilian body and a spread
of leathery wings about twelve feet across

  will you look at that steve brent
muttered

  id hate to meet that on a dark night
gerry said grimly along the shore-line
as they flashed inland he could see mon-
strous crawling things that moved slug-
gishly along the beaches or in the shallows
it began to seem that life on venus was on
a different level than that of the outer
planets

  the viking drove steadily westward
across the mountains from the lower con-
trol room windows gerry could see only
drifted snow and naked boulders and the
gauntly lonely peaks the air was thin
and cold the canopy of yellow clouds
was only a little way above them then
across the mountains at last they dropped
down toward a broad table-land covered
with patches of forest and alternate
stretches of open grass-land

  cut rockets gerry snapped pre-
pare to land

  a few minutes later the viking settled
gently down in a broad clearing where the
coarse grass was knee high for the first
time in over six weeks the sound and vibra-
tion of the motors ceased the expedition
had landed on venus

the landing party filed out a door that
opened in the lower part of the hull
the moist air was a little warmer than that
of earth and it had an unfamiliar smell
of growing things but its density seemed
the golden amazons of vends



about the same since the size of venus
was similar to that of their own planets
neither earth-man nor martian had much
trouble in walking as soon as they became
accustomed to a slightly lesser gravity
gerry found he could leap eight feet in the
air without any trouble

  gerry split the landing party into four
groups sending them spreading out like the
spokes of a fan

  dont go more than three miles from
the ship without further orders study the
countryside thoroughly and then report
back on board

  all the landing party wore light armour
of steel coated with duralite and carried
ray-tubes at their belts every third man
had a heavier ray-gun with its cylindr ical
magazine not unlike the old-fashioned ma-
chine gun their polished armor took on a
golden tinge as they tramped away across
the grass-land while behind them the vik-
ing lay motionless in the grass like a great
torpedo of steel and blue

  gerry took personal command of the
southernmost exploring party leading them
into a broad belt of forest it was very
still beneath the giant trees where strange
yellow flowers hung from the branches and
their path wound between clusters of ten-
foot ferns huge toad-stools of purple and
green rose higher than their heads and
once they saw a giant ant some three feet
long who scuttled off through the under-
brush with the speed of a galloping horse

  gradually gerry became separated from
the rest of his party bearing more to the
southward as he caught a glimpse of more
open-country through the trees then on
the edge of a small clearing he abruptly
halted as half a dozen men appeared on
the far side

  that is gerry thought of them as men
for lack of a better term they were like
nothing he had ever seen on either earth
or mars or any of the planetoids between
lean bodies were covered with glistening
gray scales though the hands seemed hu-
man the feet were clawed and webbed
short flat tails hung behind them the
faces were scaleless low-browed and green-
eyed with a jutting mouth and nose that
came together in a sort of snout they
had pointed ears that stood sharply erect
their general appearance was a little more

on the animal side than the human but
they had swords slung at their belts and
carried short-barreled rifles

  in the center of the group was a woman
she was naked except for a scarlet loin-
cloth and golden breast-plates this was
no semi-reptilian creature but a woman
straight and clean-limbed and beautiful
with long blonde hair that hung nearly to
her waist she had blue eyes and her
skin was about as white as gerrys own
though it had a faintly tawny tinge so
that she appeared all golden at the mo-
ment her hands were tightly tied behind
her back and a cloth gag distended her
lips while one of the scaly men led her
along by a rope about her neck

  gerry stepped out into the clearing with
his ray-tubes swinging free in his hand
his wide shoulders were thrown slightly
forward his whole muscular body was
tensed and ready beneath his armor as
always when he went into a fight his lean
and normally somber face was smiling

the captive girl saw him first and her
eyes widened in utter surprise then
the half dozen reptilian men caught sight
of the lone earth-man standing there in
his gleaming armor and their snout-like
mouths sagged open gerry walked quietly
forward

  he was half across the clearing before
the venusians recovered from their sur-
prise then one of the patrol flung his
short rifle to his shoulder there was a
hiss of escaping gas and a split-second
later an explosive bullet struck him in the
chest with a flash and a loud report it
would have instantly killed an unprotected
man but it did no more than slightly dent
gerrys armor

  the earth-man half crouched his eyes
narrowing and his jaw jutting suddenly
forward he had meant to try and parley
but diplomacy had no place with creatures
who shot first and challenged afterward
his ray-tube swung up to the level there
was a sharp crackling sound and for a
second a murky red light played around the
open end the nearest venusian crumpled
and went down he twitched for a sec-
ond and then lay still the gray scales
had turned dead black in the area where
the death-ray had struck him


planet stories

  at least the scaly men had courage i
the remaining five came forward with a
shrill and almost canine yelping advancing
at a bent-legged run their rifles hissed
as the compressed gases were released the
explosive bullets crackled all around
gerry twice more his ray-tube let go its
deadly blast-and then his weapon was
empty he cursed himself through
clenched teeth for having strayed away
from the patrol while armed only with a
light tube with simply three charges two
more of the reptile men lay twitching in
the tall grass but the other three were al-
most up to him after that one volley
they had drawn their swords which prob-
ably meant that their compressed-gas rifles
were cumbersome things to reload

  and then gerry norton suddenly re-
membered the greater strength of his
earthly muscles as the foremost venu-
sian lunged for him with long blade swing-
ing gerry bounded high into the air he
went clean over the head of his antagonist
coming down squarely on top of the next
behind they both went sprawling but
gerry recovered first gripping the fallen
venusian by the ankles the earth-man
swung him around his head like a flail and
hurled him squarely at the other two the
three of them went down in a tangled heap

  by the time the reptile men again
scrambled to their feet gerry had snatched
up the sword of one of the men he had
killed with the ray-tube now he had
something to fight with the long sword
whistled as he jerked it free from its scab-
bard for an instant he tested the blade
in both hands it was forged of some blu-
ish metal that seemed as strong and flex-
ible as well-tempered steel then still
smiling his thin-lipped smile though his
eyes were as cold as the wintry seas gerry
norton waited the onrush of the three
venusians

  there were a few seconds of clashing
steel the reptile men were good swords-
men but they were no match for the speed
and strength of the man from earth two
of them were stretched on the ground with
cloven skulls and then the last survivor
turned and ran gerry could have caught
him easily for the webbed feet of the
venusian did not make for great speed
but he was content to let him go

  when the scaly tail of the fleeing crea-
ture had vanished in the underbrush gerry
thrust his sword upright in the ground-
where it would be handy if he needed it
again in a hurry-and freed the golden-
haired girl from her bonds

  i wonder where you fit into this pic-
ture bright eyes he muttered knowing
she would not understand

  there was certainly nothing of the
shrinking violet about this girl when her
hands were free she faced gerry without
any sign of either fear or even much grati-
tude standing erect with her hands on her
hips and her eyes nearly on a level with
his own

  jaro quimtar-who are you  she asked
in martian

gerry stared at her in startled sur-
prise the girl had unquestionably
spoken in martian it was a very old and
antique form of the language that she used
a dialect that had not been heard on mars
itself for countless generations but it was
possble for gerry to understand it the
last thing he had expected to find on this
planet of venus was anyone who spoke
one of the tongues common on the outer
planets

  im gerry norton he said

  geree the girl repeated you talk
funny

  same to you sister gerry grinned
and just who are you anyway

  i am closana of course the daughter
of rupin-sang the girl said haughtily
dont you see the golden arrow 

  she touched a small golden arrow that
hung from a light chain about her neck it
seemed to be some kind of an insignia of
rank her deep blue eyes were looking at
him thoughtfully

  you wear queer clothes geree she
said at last where do you come from
from earth

  she frowned

  where is that is it one of the lands
beyond the great sea

  much farther away than that its an-
other planet far off in outer space

  you lie she said such a thing is
not possible

  okay sister gerry snapped we
wont argue about that right now who
the golden amazons of venus



were your unpleasant friends here what
do we do next

  closana walked across to take the sword
of one of the slain reptilians she tested
its balance seemed satisfied and then
belted the scabbard about her own waist
she handled the long blade with the ex-
perienced ease of a warrior and for the
first time gerry noticed the play of corded
muscles beneath the smooth and tawny skin
of her arms and shoulders closana
daughter of rupin-sang was feminine
enough but there was nothing of the cling-
ing vine about her she threw her long
hair back over her shoulders and faced
gerry with the sword in her hand

  you should have killed the last of the
scaly ones she said instead of letting
him get away now he will bring the
whole raiding party down on us

  who are they those things you call the
scaly ones

  their region lies beyond the frontier of
our land of savissa the girl explained
we are near the boundaries now there
is constant warfare between ourselves and
the scaly ones now and then their raid-
ing parties break through our ring of bar-
rier forts and it was a group of five hun-
dred such raiders that captured me this
morning that one who escaped will bring
the rest back with him

  then i guess well need help gerry
said grimly

there was a two-way short-wave ra-
dio set built into his helmet he
reached up to adjust the switch then
flashed the alarm signal a few seconds
later he heard the answering voice of por-
tok the martian who was in command of
the nearest of the vikings exploring
parties

  jumping ray-blasts chief we were
wondering what had happened to you
guide on my transmitter and get here
as soon as you can gerry snapped
hurry

  a few minutes later they saw a glint of
armor through the trees and then the half
dozen members of the exploring party
emerged into the clearing their eyes were
wide with surprise as they saw closana
standing beside gerry

  whos your yellow-haired friend

chief portok asked with a broad grin
he had spoken in martian the two tongues
being practically interchangeable with the
men of the interplanetary fleet closanas
eyes flashed fire

   speak of me with more respect little
 red-face she snapped portoks jaw
 sagged open but before he could say any-
 thing further the underbrush on the far
 side of the clearing suddenly vomited a
 yelling horde of the scaly ones

   they came in close-packed masses yelp-
 ing shrilly their scaly skins and the
 blades of their swords gleamed in the sub-
 dued yellow light evidently bent on cap-
 ture of the small group of strangers they
 were not using their gas-guns

   keep together fall back toward the
ship gerry roared drawing the sword
he had captured earlier in the day

   there was a sharp crackle of ray-blasts
 as the earth-men fell back before the
 charging horde of the scaly ones the
 short hand-tubes were soon exhausted but
 the heavy ray-guns carried by two of the
 men fired steadily murky light continu-
 ally played about their stubby muzzles
 dozens of the scaly ones dropped twitch-
 ing in the tall grass before the deadly blast
 of the rays but the shouting hordes came
 on unchecked and then a bugle sounded
 somewhere off on the flank

  now you scaly devils closana
screamed facing about and waving the
sword high above her head the frontier
guards have arrived i

  long lines of warriors charged out
through the bushes to take the reptile men
on the flank the front line of skirmishers
carried heavy bows and had quivers of
arrows slung on their backs the ranks
behind were armed with shields and spears
rank by rank and company by company
they came nearly a thousand strong the
ringing clamor of brazen trumpets urging
them onward gerry norton stared at
them blankly scarcely able to believe what
he saw all the warriors were women

   they were tall and clean-limbed with
long golden hair that streamed behind them
as they ran like closana they wore
bright-colored loin cloths and had round
gold plates fastened across their breasts
the might of the golden amazons of ve-
nus swept forward like a giant wave with
	plajvet

 a spray of tossing spear points above it
 then the trumpets sounded again and the
 arrow storm began

  the front ranks loosed their long shafts
swiftly and the air became full of the
twang of bow-strings and hiss of speeding
arrows a shouting officer of the scaly
ones went down with a pair of shafts
feathered in his chest his men were
dropping all about him as the gold-tipped
arrows struck home

the reptile men were using their gas-
guns now the sharp hiss of the dis-
charges rose above the twang of the bow-
strings the snap of the exploding bullets
was like a crackle of old-fashioned mus-
ketry the projectiles ripped holes in the
front ranks of the amazons but they still
came bounding forward then the sharp
reports of the exploding bullets died away
for the gas-guns were cumbersome things
to re-charge and there was no time the
two lines met with a clash of steel

  gerry norton had thrown his armoured
earth-men and martians as a guard around
closana when she ran toward the center of
the amazon line on two occasions small
parties of the scaly ones cut their way
through the guarding spears to reach them
and each time the blast of the heavy ray-
guns mowed them down the clatter of
meeting blades was like the noise of a
thousand smithies the shrill yelping of the
reptile men was drowned out by the trium-
phant blast of the amazon trumpets the
scaly ones were giving back all along the
line under pressure of superior numbers
and the greater agility of the lithe
amazons

  gerry fought with the long blue-bladed
sworcl in his hand and the shield of a
fallen amazon on his left arm with the
greater strength of his earthly muscles he
raged through the fighting while his heavy
blade wrought deadly execution and then
it was over the scaly ones broke up
into scores of fleeing groups and fresh
companies of amazons bounded in pursuit

with their long bows twanging closana
leaned on her dripping blade and held out
her hand

  it was a good fight geree i think i
will take you for my husband

  i think gerry said well just leave

stories

that idea for discussion some other time

the fleeing survivors of the scaly
ones had gone with companies of light
armed amazons in hot pursuit the others
were tending the wounded and gathering up
the dead picking up fallen weapons doing
all the routine tasks that are the aftermath
of battle closana was now surrounded by
a body-guard of tall blonde amazons
whose lion-cloths bore the same design of a
golden arrow-head as her own

  i think she said to gerry that you
should come to see my father rupin-sang
who is ruler of this land

  quite a thinker decided gerry

  we can take you there in the ship if you
show us the way he said shortly

  a horde of amazons thronged around
the big blue-and-silver hull of the viking
where she lay in the knee-high grass as
the members of the landing party filed on
board and turned their ray-tubes in to the
ordnance officer to be recharged the other
members of the crew came out to stare at
the visitors angus mctavish stood on
the steps of the ladder with his big fists on
his hips

  will ye look at all the bonny lassies
he said this may not be such a bad planet
after all

  the feminine warriors of venus saw
mctavish then and a sudden murmur
swept over the throng an instant later a
hundred blades flashed in the air in salute
and then all the amazons dropped down
on one knee

  now what the devil    muttered
steve brent who had come out of the ship
just behind mctavish

  just a proper tribute to my outstanding
personality lad the big scot muttered
aside closana read the surprise in gerry
nortons eyes

  there are few men in this land of
savissa she explained and the wearing
of a beard is the sign of a noble of the
highest rank

  wonder how long it will take me to
grow a good crop of whiskers steve said

  closana and a dozen of her body-guard
came aboard looking curiously about them
as the venusian princess walked into the
control room she came face to face with
olga stark for a long moment the two
the golden amazons of venus	

women stood looking at each other their
clashing glances hard and intent the
golden venusian and the dark haired
earthling then closana shrugged and
turned away

  i do not like her she said calmly a
slow flush spread over olga starks face
and her eyes smoldered but she did not
answer

  with helicopters spinning the viking
rose a thousand feet in the air then she
moved ahead at minimum cruising speed
closana stood at one of the control room
windows to point the way

it was a strange land that they saw mov-
ing past below them though a pleasant
one there were rolling uplands and
patches of forest and occasional villages
surrounded by broad tilled fields except
for the yellowish tinge to the vegetation
and the odd shapes of the trees it might
have been an earthly countryside then
gerry noticed another thing though it
was broad daylight as bright as it could
become on this planet there were no shad-
ows at all the diffusing effect of the
eternal cloud barrier kept the light equal
on all sides

  the land of no shadow he said
aloud for the first time in this busy day
he thought of the fact tliat they were forty
million miles from home if anything hap-
pened to the viking they would spend the
rest of their lives here

  they passed some of the barrier forts
square and stone walled buildings reminis-
cent of medieval castles on earth in the
misty hills beyond closana told gerrv lay
the country of the scaly ones

  what is it like he asked she
shrugged but her eyes were shadowed

   all i know about it is legend the sort
of tales that old women tell in the evenings
many of our people have been taken there
as prisoners in raids but none has ever
returned alive

  leaving steve brent in command in the
control room for the moment gerry went
aft to his quarters where he had a compact
tri-dimensional-cinema outfit he was
passing along one of the corridors on
b-deck when he abruptly halted a faint
humming was coming from behind the
closed door of the radio room

  the vikings sending outfit was not
strong enough to bridge the vastness of
interplanetary space such outfits existed
of course but only a small set had been
installed on the space-ship because of the
extra weight involved the radio room had
been closed and locked weeks ago no one
was supposed to have access to it except
steve brent and gerry himself and yet
-the unmistakable hum of a generator
was coming from behind the closed door

  gerry cautiously tested the knob of the
door it gave under his hand as he
opened the portal a crack he clearly heard
the sharp murmur of the sending apparatus
then he swung the door wide on its noise-
less and well oiled hinges a dim light
gleamed across the room a dark figure
was crouched tensely over the table that
held the sending set at the moment gerry
could not see who it was

  two steps gerry took into the room
three steps the rubberoid soles of his
shoes friade no sound then a crushing
weight descended on top of his head in
the half second before he lost conscious-
ness he realized that there had been a sec-
ond interloper in the radio room someone
who had been crouching against the wall
by the door and who had slugged him as
he passed

when consciousness returned to
gerry norton he was lying alone on
the floor of the darkened radio room he
sat up and rubbed his aching head and
swore softly there was no sign of the
interlopers nor any clue to their identity

  the whole incident puzzled him his
assailants must have been from among the
vikings crew that was surprising enough
in itself but there was also the problem of
motive why would anybody be sending
a secret message when there was no re-
ceiving set within millions of miles the
thing just didnt make sense

  closing the radio room behind him
gerry went back to the control-room and
drew steve brent aside

  look here steve i just found some-
one sending a secret message out over the
radio and got knocked on the head before
i could see who it was

  you must have been reading some of
those funny old twentieth century gang-
	planet

ster yarns of evil deeds steve grinned

  im serious that really happened
gerry snapped the grin faded from
brents freckled face

  then it must have been chester sand
he said promptly

  why do you say that

  brent shrugged

  because hes the only man aboard that i
dont know too well to suspect

  interesting logic gerry grunted but
we cant lock a man up on such negative
grounds keep your eyes open im going
to try to sweat some information out of
someone as soon as we get through this
ceremony of visiting the king of this
place

women working in the fields looked
up as the viking passed lifting a
hand to shade their eyes as they stared
aloft at the soaring space-ship other
women drove small carts along the white
roads that wound through the fields there
did not seem to be any men in this land at
all then atong the far horizon ahead
there began to lift the domes and towers
and minarets of a mighty city closana
proudly lifted her arm

  the golden city of larr she said
capitol of our land of savissa none
but our own people have ever penetrated
those walls except as prisoners of war
the walled city of larr dominated the
plain in all its towered splendor its walls
of polished yellow stone were more than a
hundred feet high the serrated battle-
ments at the top were faced with plates
of thin gold domes of blue and scarlet
gleamed within the walls slender min-
arets lifted their lattices high in the air
in the center was a massive round tower
whose top was shaped like the point of a
golden arrow

  but surely your people never built his
place he gasped closana shook her head

  the city was not built by my people
as they are now larr the golden city
is very ancient it was built by the old
ones-they who lived here long ago in the
dim dawn of time i have forgotten most
of the tale but my father can tell you
as they passed over the outer walls
gerry saw some long steel tubes mounted
on swivels above the battlements they

stories

were protected by gleaming metal shields
he touched closanas arm

  what are those things that look like
giant ray-guns

  those are the defences of the walls
the girl answered we also have them at
the barrier forts in some way they send
out rays of heat that bum and shrivel all
things within reach i do not know much
about them but my father can tell you
looks like hes going to tell me a lot
of things gerry said closana shook back
her long hair and looked at him thought-
fully for a moment

  yes geree he will also tell you why
you had better marry me as i suggested

  i told you wed have to let that subject
wait till later he said grimly steve brent
prodded him gently in the ribs

  persistent souls these golden ama-
zons  he said in english

the appearance of the viking in the
air over larr created a mounting ex-
citement among the citizens of the city
through the open windows of the control
room gerry could hear the brazen clamor of
many trumpets sounding the alarm
crowds appeared on the roofs arrows
streaked up at the space-ship futile shafts
that fell short of the mark as they neared
the central tower gun crews swarmed
about two of the ray-tubes knowing the
resisting power of the vikings duraiite
hull gerry was not greatly worried but
closana seemed to feel that things had gone
far enough

  hitherto the girl had been quite evidently
enjoying the consternation that the vikings
arrival had caused among the defenders of
the city now she leaned far out from the
open window and waved reassuringly as
she was recognized defense preparations
ceased and the gun crews began to cover
their weapons up again

  the viking settled gently down on the
worn stone pavement of a square plaza di-
rectly before the central tower a ring of
amazon spearmen instantly formed to keep
back the curious crowds and other compa-
nies were drawn up as a guard of honor
they saluted closana with a shout and a
surge of uplifted spears when she and
gerry stepped out the opened starboard
door then when angus mctavish came
the golden amazons of venvs



out with a group of senior officers a few
seconds later all the amazon warriors
dropped instantly down on one knee while
their spear-points rattled on the stones
the big engineer beamed through his
beard and tilted his uniform cap to a more
rakish angle

  i have already stated that these folk are
a verra discriminating people he said
with deep satisfaction closana turned to
gerry

  it would be better to take only a few
of your people along when we go into see
my father

  gerry faced about his glance running
quickly over those of his crew who had
emerged from the hull and were standing
nearby

  steve brent stays here in command
he said quietly you come with me angus
xnd portok and one other   he
hesitated then named olga stark later
he was to wonder what evil genius had led
him to select her as one of the party he
could not quite remember probably it
was just a desire to take as varied and
representative a group along with him as
possible closana looked annoyed at his
choice but did not comment

they passed through the ranks of the
spear-guard and up to the octagonal
main door of the tower where carved
golden leaves slid back into the wall on
each side a blue light glowed around the
inner frame of the door and closana held
up her arm

  wait till the blue light fades for it is
death she said quietly then as the
light died out they all stepped inside while
the golden leaves of the door closed clash-
ing behind them

  they were in a winding corridor whose
stone walls were faced with polished stone
and hung with ancient tapestries the
place was lighted by metal discs set flush
in the ceiling discs of a substance that gave
forth a soft and golden glow even this
light gerry noticed was so diffused as to
be shadowless the land of no-
shadow he muttered under his breath
remembering the phrase that had come to
him earlier somehow the friendly old
earth seemed very far away at that mo-
ment 

  in an ante-chamber they met the first
man they had seen since they reached ve-
nus aside from the half-animal raiders of
the scaly ones this man was short and
slight with a very high forehead and un-
usually large eyes his skin had the same
tawny tinge as that of the feminine war-
riors of his race but he was more lightly
built than they he wore a loose yellow
tunic and his hair and thin beard were
heavily shot with gray somehow he
looked tired and old even beyond his
years as though the sands of his race were
running very low

  rupin-sang awaits your coming he
said to gerry as portok and the others
from the viking came into sight the venu-
sian stared at them with strangely startled
eyes he said nothing more but his glance
seemed to hold a strange terrible haunting
fear

  at the end of the corridor they stepped
into a small golden car a door closed
behind them the floor shot rapidly up-
ward a few seconds later the door of
the lift-car swung open again and they
stepped out into a round chamber near the
top of the great tower

  enter to his highness rupin-sang
lord of savissa and the mountain lands
ruler of field and forest and castle heredi-
tary warden of the great sea the venu-
sian courtier said sonorously

  the room was circular with glassless
windows set in the walls every few feet
a warm breeze blew in to stir the tiny
metal discs that hung around near the tops
of the walls in a sort of frieze setting them
swinging till they clashed together with a
continuous jingling a small fountain mur-
mured in the center of the room a pecu-
liarly shaped telescope stood by one wall
and there were other scientific instruments
of a type unfamiliar to the earth-men

in a big carved chair in the center sat a
very old man a rolled parchment lying
across his knees what remained of his
hair and beard were pure white his face
was lined and sunken he half raised his
arm in a ceremonial gesture of welcome
but then a sudden expression of alarm
came over his face he pointed with one
shaking hand

  lie-woe to the city of larr the
	planet

hour of the fulfilment of the prophecy is
at hand woe to larr with its walls and
towers

  closana hurried to her fathers side a
moment later the old man had regained his
calm he greeted them with formalized
speech of welcome full of old phrases then
added

  forgive my agitation when you first en-
tered hisiren but it brought to mind the
doom-filled phrases of what we of savissa
call the prophecy of jeddah-khana

  what is that

  it is a very old prophecy carved in an
ancient runic script on the stone walls of
one of the vaults under this tower tradi-
tion says it was put there by the old ones
who built this city and of whose science
we are the unworthy heirs rupin-sang
bowed and touched his forehead as h men-
tioned the old ones the prophecy
states that the day will come when a red-
skinned man and a dark-haired woman and
a ruddy bearded giant will come together
to the city from afar and that within a
month thereafter the golden city of larr
will crumble and return to the dust

  but surely you dont take such old
legends seriously gerry said the old
man smiled

  my head tells me not to but supersi-
tion is strong in we of savissa however
-i can take comfort from the fact that the
old legend also prophecies a rebirth for
savissa after the great catastrophe but
enough of this talk of portents and legends
i give you welcome to savissa and to the
city of larr also i thank you for rescu-
ing my youngest daughter from the scaly
raiders whence come ye

  gerry sketched in hasty phrases the out-
line of present conditions on earth and
mars and told of their trip through space
to venus in the viking rupin-sang
nodded without showing any particular
surprise

  and so thats the story gerry con-
cluded were curious about some of
your conditions here the women war-
riors for instance  

  it was not always so in the land of
savissa rupin-sang said with a faint
smile in the days of the old ones
there was a natural balance of the sexes
but as the slow centuries passed the birth

stories

rate gradually changed now one child in
five thousand born in savissa is a male
the few men we do have are needed for
certain administrative and scientific work
particularly the supervision of the alta-
radium mines in the mountains from which
we get the raw material for the alta-ray
tubes that are our greatest protection
against invasion

  i saw the tubes on the walls gerry
said but why is it that your mobile forces
are armed only with primitive weapons like
bows and arrows

  because we cannot possibly mine and
produce enough of the alta-radium to do
more than supply the defences of the city
and of the barrier forts the possession
of the secret of that ray has kept our bor-
ders free from the scaly ones except for
isolated raids like the one you encountered
today but we cannot arm our troops with
the ray

  and the gas-guns of the scaly ones
they are a good weapon-but we have
not the materials to manufacture them on
this side of the border

  sounds like what we used to call a
balance of power in the days when earth
was torn by wars gerry said with a smile
but tell me one thing more i notice that
in this land you speak an archaic form of
aiartian

  the tempora-scope can tell you the
story better than my words

  rupin-sang nodded to his attendant and
a cloth cover was removed from a broad
metal disc that was attached to some kind
of a machine he touched a control lever
and the mechanism began to hum blinds
were dropped down over the windows so
that the room was filled with a murky twi-
light the humming sound grew steadily
louder now the metal disc glowed with
a brilliant light momentarily its polished
surface clouded over as though obscured
by a thin fog and then the mists drifted
aside

before them they saw the universe
as it was in the youth of the world
when roaring volcanoes were still active on
the moon and the rings of saturn were
just drifting out from the girth of that
spinning sphere it was as though they
were looking out through a circular win-
the golden amazons of venvs	

dovv somewhere in the sky the machine
gave a perfect illusion of reality not
merely tri-dimensional but touching all the
senses as well they could hear the roar
of new-made satellites spinning off into the
void and the rush of burning gases they
could smell the scent of molten rock

  then time passed the planets began
to cool the mud-flats steamed under a
cloudy sun the mountains shouldered their
way upward through the tilted and riven
fields on the edges of inland seas the hot
shallows were filled with slimy things that
crawled with their bellies dragging they
could hear the ripple of the waters and the
rustle of warm winds blowing through the
flowerless and fern-like forests gerry
could smell the rank odors of the steaming
and primitive jungles there was a pun-
gent taste on his lips once he stretched
his hand out toward a trilobite that seemed
to be crawling up to his feet-and he felt
the coarse surface of the shell before he
pulled his hand back again

   the picture changed once more center-
ing on a ruddy planet that swept toward
them while portok exclaimed at the sight
of mars in the ancient days before the
planets were built men and women walked
its smooth fields among the flaming scarlet
flowers music and laughter and the voices
of women drifted on the scented winds
but mars was changing it was drying up
life could no longer be the same some
of the people were beginning to draft the
plans for the great canals that were to con-
serve the planets failing supply of water
but others took to space-ships and sailed
off into the void

   then for the first time they saw the
planet venus as the martian space-ships
dropped down through the veiling clouds
they saw those first pioneers of space land
on venus and subjugate the natives and
build mighty cities in the plains but some-
thing happened to the birth-rate and most
of the science of the old ones was lost
when a series of great quakes swept the
planet the holdings of the descendants
of those interplanetary travelers of long
ago dwindled to only the city of larr and
the land of savissa itself

  the humming of the temporascope died
away the big metal disc again became
-planet stories-winter

blank the machine had ceased to function
and the illusion of the reality of the past
was gone they were simply in a shaded
tower room with a tired old man who sat
on a carved throne

   and that is the tale of the rise and de-
cline of our people hiziren he said sadly
now the sands of our nation run low

i am half inclined to believe that the old
prophecy will come true and that this is the
twilight of savissa and its people but-
enough of that raise the blinds again
rotosa so that we may have light while
we can and i ask you visitors from afar
to dine with me tonight before you go back
to your space-ship

the banquet table was set on the
ground floor of the arrow-tower in
a room where an open colonnade looked out
on a walled garden behind the palace of
the rulers of savissa a carved wooden
table was set with golden plates faint
music came from some hidden source in
the garden outside night birds sang softly
and there was a constant sound of running
water from many fountains

   in addition to rupin-sang there were
three of his male attendants and about
twenty women on this ceremonial occa-
sion they supplemented their usual scanty
garb with long and graceful robes that
gleamed like silk thin veils were at-
tached to jeweled circlets catching a
glimpse of the sullen discontent on olga
starks face gerry suddenly realized that
the earth woman was jealous of her own
appearance

   probably hating my guts right now for
making her wear her uniform he thought
women are queer

   to gerry norton that meal was a peace-
ful interlude between the monotonous
strain of the long interplanetary voyage and
the uncertainty of what lay ahead though
some of the native dishes tasted strange
to his earthly palate the food was gener-
ally good fragrant heady wines from the
hill country bordering savissa were served
in colored glass goblets a sound of distant
singing drifted across the garden

   gerry was wondering what disaster had
overtaken the first expedition that had set
out to reach this planet the space-ship
stardust that had left earth over two years


planet stories

ago under command of major walter lan-
sing perhaps it had landed in some less
friendly part of the planet and been over-
whelmed by the natives before it could get
away again perhaps it had met some swift
disaster in outer space and was now spin-
ning endlessly in the void-a lifeless and
man-made planetoid in any case he would
make a thorough search for some trace of
the stardust before he started back to earth
again

when the meal was over and they all
arose from the table gerry noticed
that angus and olga stark walked out into
the garden together it struck him as an
odd combination for olga was the one per-
son on board with whom the genial scot
was not friendly then he forgot about it

  a few minutes later closana took ger-
rys arm and led him out into the garden
colored lanterns hung here and there along
the paths but most of the light came from
globes of glowing metal that were con-
cealed near the tops of the trees the
effect was much like earthly moonlight
except that the moon was golden instead of
silver angus and olga should have been
a few yards ahead of them but both had
disappeared gerry wondered about it-
and then a dim figure rose up in the shad-
ows immediately before him a cloud of
choking gas hurled squarely in his face
from some sort of flask filled his lungs
with the pain of many fiery needles

  gerry crumpled soundlessly to the
ground he could see and hear what went
on but otherwise he was paralyzed and in-
capable of sound or movement for a mo-
ment he thought that closana was behind
some form of treachery then dark fig-
ures swarmed around him lifting him from
the ground and he saw the dim light gleam-
ing on gray scales the scaly ones had
penetrated to the innermost sanctuary of
the city of larr

  gerrys head fell back as they lifted him
and he could see that closana was equally
helpless in the grip of more of the raid-
ers a section of grass and bushes was
swung back on a hidden trap door re-
vealing a flight of moss-covered stone steps
leading downward the two prisoners
were carried down and the door dropped
hollowly into place above them

they were in a narrow and very an-
cient stone passage moss and lichens
covered the walls moisture dripped from
the ceiling on the floor in the midst of
another group of the scaly ones lay an-
gus mctavish evidently also a victim of
the paralyzing gas olga stark stood near-
by her long dark hair loose about her
shoulders and an expression of savage tri-
umph irffier eyes

  tie them securely she snapped to the
officer in command of the scaly men his
long-nosed brutish face creased in a grim
smile

  it shall be done mistress

  closana was stripped to her loin-cloth
a cloth gag was twisted into her mouth
her arms were tied behind her back gerry
and angus were treated in the same way
control of his muscles was returning
swiftly to gerry norton now as the ef-
fects of the gas wore off but he was al-
ready secured and helpless

  grim rage filled gerry then but even
greater than that emotion was his utter
amazement the thing was completely be-
yond his understanding this was no rou-
tine raid of the scaly ones against the
people of larr but a definite attempt to
capture him strangest of all was the part
played by olga stark who acted as though
she was in command of the scaly men
it just wasnt possible-but it was hap-
pening

  the three prisoners were pulled to their
feet guards gripped their elbows at the
first bend in the passage a small waterfall
came down from above and formed a gur-
gling stream that ran in a deep gutter at
one side the air was hot and moist and
heavy with the scent of running water and
fungus growths other jets of water came
down from above to add to the trickle of
water until as the passage widened a gur-
gling torrent ran along beside them sud-
denly gerry realized where they were
this was the sewerage system that carried
away the waste of the citys many flowing
fountains

  at last they came to the main drain a
vaulted stone passage where a twenty-foot
stream of black water flowed along beside
the narrow foot-path tied up there look-
ing like a sea-monster in the dim light of
the lanterns carried by the scaly men was
the golden amazons of venus



a metal boat that had only a narrow deck
and a round dome above the water a
crude submarine

  the three prisoners were forced aboard
their gags were removed now that si-
lence no longer mattered but their arms
remained bound and they were chained by
the necks to a steel bar as they sat in a row
at one side of the narrow hull the raid-
ers cast off came aboard and closed the
dome behind them motors hummed softly
and then the submarine  moved sluggishly
down the stream

  at the moment the three of them were
alone they could see the scaly skins of
some of their captors busied at various
tasks in adjoining compartments but there
was no one within hearing after twisting
futilely at his bonds for a moment gerry
leaned back against the steel bulkhead be-
hind him and looked over at angus

  well-here we are he said

  aye-so it seems the scots broad
face was grim i should have known that
black-haired witch had some deviltry in
mind when she asked me to walk in the
garden with her

  but where does she fit into the pic-
ture how does she get her control over
these scaly devils

  how do i know snorted mctavish
angrily ask me some more riddles
whats more to the point is where theyre
taking us in this queer craft

  i can guess that closana said quietly
the girl was very pale but she smiled
faintly as she met gerrys eyes this
drain empties into the giri river and a
few miles farther along that river forms
the boundary between savissa and the
lands of the scaly ones we have never
known they could travel beneath the water
this way

  what will happen after they get us
there

  torture and death once any of our
people are taken across into the land of
giri-vaaka they never return alive

  nice little trip were taking gerry lad
mctavish growled too bad you didnt
bring your cinema camera along i

the submarine moved sluggishly
ahead silent except for the hum of its
motors as gerry looked around he could

see that it was a crudely constructed and
makeshift craft even so it was more than
he would have expected from men of the
apparent mentality of the scaly ones

  thfc is a funny sort of submarine
he said to angus the big engineer who
had twisted around to peer at the bulkhead
directly behind them growled deep in his
throat

  its funnier than ye think lad look
at this  mctavish nodded toward one of
the sheets of thin steel from which the
bulkhead had been built on the edge there
were stamped a few words the letters
were small and in the dim light gerry
had to narrow his eyes for a moment be-
fore he could read them

u s govt steel lvois
atlanta ga

  how in heavens name did they get
that     gerrys voice trailed off with-
out finishing the sentence mctavish
shrugged

  ye dont need more than one guess
the stardust must have been wrecked
somewhere near here and these devils took
some of her parts to build this outlandish
craft

  at last long hours later the submarine
came to a stop as his captors led him up
on deck gerry saw that the ungainly craft
had grounded in the shallows on the shore
of a broad river it was just daylight a
pale yellow light filtered down through the
canopy of clouds and a flight of marsh-
fowl was winging by just overhead

  where are we asked gerry

  this is the giri river closana said
savissa lies on the far shore this is the
land of the scaly ones

  some of the reptile men hauled the sub-
marine into a cove and began to cover it
over with piles of reeds some twenty
others formed up in a column with the
three prisoners in the center then the of-
ficer in command barked an order and they
all moved out along a dirt road that led
away from the river olga stark was
walking beside the first rank of scaly war-
riors she had not looked at the prison-
ers at all

they tramped steadily onward through
the dust in silence except for the dull slap


planet stories

of the webbed feet of the reptile men and
the jingle of their equipment after a
while the officer in command came back to
look at the prisoners he was a grizzled
veteran with shaggy ridges above his eyes
and the long-healed scars of-half a dozen
old wounds on his scaly body mctavish
glared at him for a moment

  take a good look sonny boy the big
scot growled whats your name-if you
have one

  i should tear out your tongue for
speaking in that tone to an officer of giri-
vaaka the officer said his voice had the
high pitched and metallic quality typical of
his race and he bared his pointed teeth
in a not unfriendly grin but the torturers
of the lord lansa will take care of you
soon enough i am toll commander of a
strikka in the border guards

  where are you taking us

  toll grinned wickedly

  to the palace of lansa overlord of all
venus

gerry noticed that this countryside
of giri-vaaka was very different
from the pleasant and cultivated fields of
savissa over which he had passed the day
before the roads were dirt and half over-
grown not much of the country was un-
der cultivation strange purple bushes
with thorns a foot long covered much of
the land crowding close on the patches of
forest where ten-foot ferns towered high
overhead sometimes they came upon a
grazing herd of the yard-long giant ants
who would go galloping away with their
antenna waving in the air and their hard-
shelled leg-joints clicking loudly

  depression hung on gerry nortons
chest like a physical weight it was not
alone the fact that every stride carried them
deeper into a grim and hostile land-pris-
oners whose doom was probably already
sealed-that set him biting his lower lip
till he tasted the salt blood on his tongue
nor even the fact that closana shared the
same fate because she happened to have
been with him at the time of the raid it
was also the utter strangeness of every-
thing yesterday in savissa the people
and the mode of life had been nearly
enough to normal so that he was not deeply
conscious of the strange vegetation and the

other things in which venus differed from
earth and mars

  now everything seemed different and
alien the lowering yellow skies of venus
were ominous the hot winds brought
strange smells tand seemed to carry a hint
of doom the one thought that gave him
any real hope was the fact that portok
the martian had not been captured with
the rest of them he must have missed
them soon cfter the abduction there
might be a chance that he and steve brent
would bring the viking to look for them

they had begun to pass occasional
small farms these were scanty fields
carved out of the creeping masses of purple
thorns usually with a roughly thatched hut
in the center on one such occasion the
farmer and his family stood apathetically
at the roadside to watch the patrol of rep-
tile men go by

  but theyre not scaly gerry ex-
claimed closana shook her head

  no they are of the green men of
giri once they held this land while the
scaly ones dwelt in the marshes of vaaka
farther west but the scaly ones have now
been masters of this place for many gen-
erations

  the green men gerry noticed looked
like ordinary earthlings except for a slight
greenish cast to their skin probably like
the golden amazons they were also de-
scended from the old ones who had come
from mars so long ago the ragged and
mud-stained fanner gave toll a perfunc-
tory salute and then leaned on his hoe to
watch the column pass by

  the warriors of toll swaggered along
the road with the insolent assurance of men
who know themselves masters of all around
them the farmers green face was care-
fully expressionless but there was a gleam
in his eyes that spoke of no great liking
for his scaly masters when his glance
lingered on gerrys for an instant the
earth-man read a definite sympathy in it

  they camped that night in a clearing
beside a small stream one of the guards
shot a giant ant with his gas-gun then
cracked open the horny shell with his
sword they cut long strips of the meat
and roasted it over a fire though the
taste was peculiar the stuff was edible and
the golden amazons of venus	

the three prisoners managed to swallow it

  the condemned man ate a hearty
meal angus mctavish said with grim
humor wiping his fingers on the coarse
yellow grass beside him

  olga had gone on with a faster-moving
detachment and only a dozen scaly ones
remained with toll to guard the three pris-
oners gerry and closana sat side by side
before the fire their bare shoulders touch-
ing the ruddy and flickering glow of the
firelight touched angus giant frame a lit-
tle farther around the circle and then the
scaly skins and long snouts of the reptile
men watching them gerry clasped his
arms around his knees

  yknow angus at the moment were
living as our ancestors must have lived
long generations ago no ray-tubes or
dura-steel armor no portable electro-
phones not even a low-speed rocket car
to carry us along it must have been this
way back in the days when they built that
little old building thats now used for a
museum in new york the empire state
building

  youve got your dates mixed laddie
mctavish yawned the empire state
was built in the twentieth century and
even the people of those queer old days
were more advanced than most of what
weve seen of life on this planet of venus
i dont suppose those ancients knew
what they were missing

  maybe they were better off at least
they only got into trouble on their own
earth instead of wandering off to other
planets like a pack of fools as we have
toll and two of his men came toward
them earning the ropes with which they
had earlier been bound

  sorry but i must tie you up for the
night he said for an instant gerry
thought of making a break if he could
get away he might find some way of res-
cuing the others then he decided against
it one of the reptile men would be al-
most sure to bring him down with a gas-
gun before he got out of the circle of fire-
light in spite of the greater strength of
his earthly mdscles so he shrugged and
allowed the guards to tie him up again for
quite a while he lay awake hoping to hear
the hum of the vikings motors but at last
he fell asleep

on the thjrd day of their journey the
trail led upward into a range of
bleak and rocky hills a few mean huts
were the only signs of human habitation
then as they rounded a bend in the trail
which at this point clung to the face of a
cliff they saw the answer to a mystery
that had puzzled the civilized world for
two years

  it was the wreck of the space-ship star-
dust she lay at the foot of a cliff across
the valley her steel and duralite hull still
gleaming brightly through the thick green
creepers that had grown up around it
even from this distance gerry could see
the hopelessly crumpled rocket-tubes at the
stern and the gaping holes where plates
had been ripped away to make the subma-
rine that had brought them out of the city
of larr

  so that was the end of the stardust
gerry muttered i wonder what hap-
pened to her crew

  well probably find out soon enough
mctavish replied grimly ill bet all the
gold in savissa against an empty rocket-
oil tin that were headed for the same fate
right now

  poor devils-i suppose the scaly ones
did get them i never liked walter lan-
sing as you know but i could have wished
him better luck than this

  at last they crossed the hills and saw a
broad valley before them dim and snow-
capped mountains notched the yellow sky
on the far side of the valley a river
wound through the plain and on the shore
of the saffron waters of a mighty lake they
saw the gray walls of a city toll the
reptilian captain pointed across the valley

  yonder lies the city of vaaka-hausen
soon you will stand before the lord lansa
and then he added with a grim and
ghoulish humor neither i nor anybody
else will be bothered with you any more
the countryside immediately around the
city of the scaly ones was better kept and
more cultivated than what they had seen
of the rest of giri-vaaka there were
a number of small villages then they
passed in through the walls gray stone
ramparts that seemed to be very old and
were in poor repair the muzzles of heavy
caliber gas-guns peered over the battle-
ments here and there
	planet

  the crowds in the streets stared cu-
riously as toll led his prisoners toward the
center of the city tall reptile men swag-
gered through the crowds with their swords
slung on their hips but the shorter green
men were in the great majority most of
them men and women alike stared at the
captives without any particular sign of
emotion this gray and crowded city of
vaaka-hausen had none of the atmosphere
of pleasant friendliness that gerry had no-
ticed in larr it seemed a place of fear
and oppression

the palace of the ruler of the scaly
ones was a squat gray building in the
center of the city an arm of the river
swept along beneath one wall with the
muddy waters lapping at the aged gray
stones an iron gate swung aside to let
the newcomers into the courtyard men
who wore black metal breast-plates over
their scales took over the prisoners from
toll leading them down a long flight of
stairs into the dungeons beneath the pal-
ace they waited in a vaulted chamber
where the only light was a shaft of yellow
radiance that came from a narrow slit
high up near the ceiling

  it wont be long now gerry mut-
tered

  then a gong sounded somewhere near-
by it was a very resonant and deep-
throated gong and instantly the rock-
walled chamber became filled with a green
light it had no visible source seeming
to come from the walls or from the very
air itself again the gong rolled

  the lord lansa comes barked the
captain of the guards the overlord of
venus is at hand down on your knees
captives and slaves

  closana went to her knees though oth-
erwise holding herself proudly erect with
her hands tied behind her back in the
greenish light her long blonde hair looked
like molten gold angus mctavish mut-
tered savagely in his beard and stayed on
his feet instantly one of the reptile
guards drew his sword and held the blade
horizontally behind the scots knees

  kneel-or i cut the tendons he
snapped

  come down you stiff-necked idiot
gerry growled with a muttered oath

stories

angus dropped to his knees and the guard
stepped back into line

  then the door opened and three men
came slowly intosthe room two were
gray-scaled guards who carried their gas-
guns cocked and ready the third was a
tall man in a loose green robe his head
was hooded so that nothing of his face
could be seen at all his hands were tucked
in the sleeves of his robe there was some-
thing deadly and almost grotesque about
that silent figure gerrv knew that at last
he was in the presence of lansa lord of
the scaly ones and ruler of giri-vaaka
self-styled overlord of all venus

the seconds passed in silence the
guards were frozen motionless at at-
tention at last lansa spoke his voice
coming hollowly from the shadows of his
hood

  take them to the cells their doom
shall be decided when the serpent gods
have spoken i have ordered it

  the tyrant of venus gestured sharply
and the guards closed in about the pris-
oners for a fleeting instant gerry had a
glimpse of a thin green hand a hand where
the finger was missing at the second joint
then lansa went out and the door closed
behind him the deeply resonant gong
sounded again and the pulsating green light
instantly vanished so that there was again
no light except for the thin trickle of yel-
low radiance that came in the single high
window the prisoners were pulled to their
feet

  there was no chance to speak to angus
or closana again gerrys guards led him
down a narrow corridor past the steel
doors of cells it was very dim and si-
lent from some of the cells he heard a
faint rattle of chains from others a low
groaning otherwise there was no sound
but their own footfalls at last the guards
opened the door of a cell pushed gerry
inside and cut the ropes that bound his
arms as they slammed the heavy steel
door behind them he heard the rasp of
bolts then the slapping tread of the
guards webbed feet died away and he was
left alone

  dim as the light in the corridor had
been that in the cell was so much less that
gerry had to wait half a minute before he
the golden amazons of venus



could see at all then he made out the
outlines of a small bare cell with a bunk
made of a light and flexible metal at one
side there was nothing else in the place
gerry rubbed his wrists a moment to re-
store circulation then sat down on the
edge of the bunk and dropped his head in
his hands

  he seemed to be about at the end of his
trail well-that was fate he did not
mind so much for himself and angus
you knew you were taking risks when you
signed up for interplanetary travel in the
first place but he was sorry that clsana
had been dragged into it

  gerry had now lost all hope of rescue
by the viking he did not doubt that her
duralite hull could withstand the explosive
bullets of even the heaviest caliber gas-
guns nor that her three-inch ray-tubes
could blast a way into these underground
dungeons in a few minutes if only steve
brent knew where to come that was the
rub there was now no way for brent to
learn where the prisoners were being held
and he could not search all the land of
giri-vaaka

  something small and furtive was moving
about on the floor a few feet away gerry
scuffed his feet on the stones and the crea-
ture scampered quickly away probably a
rat it seemed that he was going to have
pleasant company during his stay in this
place

  restless and gloomy gerry stood up
again he started to walk up and down
the few feet that the length of his cell
allowed him then he froze motionless
a faint tapping was sounding from some-
where to his left someone was knocking
lightly on the wall of the adjoining cell
then a voice spoke softly in martian

  you there  you in the next cell can
you here me

gerry knelt down on the damp floor
and put his head close to the base
of the wall now he could hear the man
more clearly could even hear his heavy
breathing gerrys groping fingers found
a place between two of the stones where
the mortar had been picked away to leave
a small air space

  yes i hear you he called softly he
heard a dry chuckle

  good i have been waiting a long
time for them to put someone in the next
cell some of the stones are loose i will
come in

  there was a soft rattle of falling mor-
tar and a scrape of sliding stones gerry
saw the head and shoulders of a man
thrust through the opening and then the
man crawled laboriously into the cell

  who are you he whispered your
accent is not like that of the green men
of giri wait i have a light here

  a small flashlight clicked on its beam
pointed up into gerrys face then the
man gasped

  good lord he whispered it   
its gerry norton

  then the man swung the light so that it
swung on himself gerry saw a tall gaunt
man in the tattered remains of a blue and
silver uniform it was major walter
lansing once of the interplanetary fleet
who had commanded the ill-fated stardust
when she set out on her voyage into space

  norton he gasped in a hoarse whis-
per man i never expected to see anyone
from earth again

  we thought you were dead

  i might as well be lansing said
grimly but tell me how you come to be
here

  as they squatted there in the darkened
cell gerry whispered the story of the vik-
ings expedition and of his own capture
lansing told him how the stardust had
been wrecked on the rim of the mountains
when landing and how the scaly ones had
captured all the crew

  they have kept me alive because the
signs pointed that way when they cast the
omens before the serpent gods lansing
said but all the rest of the crew were
used as bait for hunting the giant dakta
they died you and your companions will
probably meet the same fate

  pleasant prospect gerry said grimly
lansing gripped his arm

  theres a chance norton listen
ive been able to get these scaly devils to
bring me a good many things from the
wreck i couldnt get a ray-tube they
were too wise for that but i did get a
portable radio by telling them it was my
tribal god i have it in my cell well
go over and you can phone your ship to


planet stories

come after us he eyed gerry eagerly
  lets go

  they both crawled through the gap in
the wall it was like gerrys own but it
was piled with an assortment of junk from
the wrecked space-ship in one corner
stood a compact two-way radio telephone
set with its tubes still intact

  think you can tell them how to come 
lansing whispered

  im not sure they marched us along
the roads and the route was winding
and 

  ill draw you a map lansing inter-
rupted you hold the light

  while gerry held the flash the other
man spread out a piece of crumpled paper
on the floor and began to draw on it with
the stub of a graphite stylus he talked
as he wrote in a shrilly excited whisper
gerry had never liked the man in the old
days considering him excitable and unde-
pendable and it was evident that the long
captivity had not improved walter lan-
sings self-control that did not matter
the main thing was to get out of this
place and then gerry saw something that
stiffened every muscle and made the short
hair prickle all down the back of his neck
the ring finger of lansings left hand was
missing at the second joint

the suspicion that had come to gerry
norton seemed impossible walter
lansing    the lord lansa it couldnt
be and yet-he was sure he had seen
that same mutilated hand thrust out from
the sleeve of a green robe an hour before
lansing was still talking as he bent over
the improvised map

  heres the line of the giri river tell
them to cross by the bald gray hill then
bear west-six-north using venusian mag-
netic bearings after that 

  he suddenly stopped and looked up
catching gerrys grim glance fixed on his
left hand hastily he jerked it aside into
the shadows he must have read in ger-
rys eyes that his move had been too late
for his own gaunt face hardened

  you rat gerry hissed between his
teeth his right hand shot out clutching
for the other mans throat but lansing
twisted aside and jerked a dark object
from his pocket an instant later a sting-

ing cloud of the paralysis gas took gerry
in the face and he fell limply to the floor

  lansing straightened up and tossed aside
the flask that had held the gas there was
a savage gleam in his narrow eyes

  all right norton he said well do
it the other way ho-guards

  a gong sounded in the corridor the
pulsating green light immediately flooded
the cell scaly-skinned guards swarmed
in and saluted lansing ripped off the
torn uniform revealing a tight-fitting
green garment beneath it and one of the
guards helped him on with the cowled robe
he had worn before he glanced down at
gerry for a moment

  bring him and the others up to me
when he recovers the use of his muscles
he said

by the time gerry norton recovered
from the effects of the gas he had
been securely bound again two guards
led him to the end of a corridor and up
a flight of stairs to the level above this
was also part of the prison zone of the
castle but built in an entirely different
manner walls and floor were of a pol-
ished green metal super-charged elec-
tronic locks fastened each door holding
death for anyone who attempted to tamper
with them metal globes gave a steady light
mirrors above each cell door gave the
guards who lounged in the corridors a
complete view of the inside of every cell

  this gerry realized was actually the
prison used by the lords of giri-vaaka
he had been placed in the old and aban-
doned dungeons beneath as part of the
scheme to lure him into calling the viking
to her doom glancing in the door-mirrors
of the cells as he went by gerry saw that
most of the occupants were men and wo-
men of the green race of giri with a
fair number of golden amazons and a
few reptile men who had been guilty of
some crime or infraction of discipline

  then he saw closana the girl was
tightly spread-eagled against one of the
polished metal walls of her cell her out-
stretched wrists and ankles held by steel
cuffs gerrys jaw jutted stubbornly for-
ward and for a moment he twisted help-
lessly against the cords that held his arms
behind him
the golden amazons of venus



  the guards halted before a door deep in
the interior of the palace where a pair of
scaly warriors stood on guard with gas-
guns cocked and ready the opening it-
self was not closed by any door but by
what looked like a tightly stretched curtain
of some transparent green material on
closer inspection he saw that it glowed
with a steady pulsation while occasional
specks of green fire ran through it when
one of the guards moved incautiously back
so that the tip of his scabbard touched the
green glow filling the door there was a
crackling hiss the tip of the scabbard
simply vanished it was as though it had
been cleanly cut off by a very sharp knife

  a challenge came from within and one
of gerrys guards shouted a reply the
green glow suddenly vanished from the
doorway whatever elemental force it was
that blocked the passage had been with-
drawn and they walked freely in through
the opening

the wide room before them was
walled with slabs of polished black
marble the figures of writhing snakes
and rearing reptiles were inlaid into the
black walls with some iridescent green
stone their eyes were inlaid jewels
thin trails of pungent smoke drifted up-
ward from their nostrils a low and throb-
bing music full of the thunder of muted
drums came from unseen source at reg-
ular intervals around the walls stood tall
golden standards with glowing globes atop
them

  this was the throne room of lansa
lord of giri-vaaka who had once been
an officer in the flying forces of earth
the man himself sat on a black marble
throne with a dozen of the higher officers
of his scaly warriors grouped around him
these inner guards wore breast-plates and
helmets of a bright green metal and their
pointed ears protruded upward through
twin openings in the sides of the helmets

  lansas swarthy face was gloatingly tri-
umphant it had always been gerry nor-
tons private opinion that walter lansing
was slightly mad brilliant in many ways
but definitely unstable at last he appeared
to have slipped over that shadowy border
that divides the rational from the insane

  it is unfortunate that my little scheme

to have you summon your space-ship here
did not work lansa said in english
but we will find some other way of per-
suading you to do it

  you think youre quite the little tin
god dont you gerry sneered

  i am a god-to these people lansa re-
plied quietly though the stardust was
damaged too badly to return to earth little
of her equipment was harmed except for
the rocket tubes themselves within six
months after landing i had made myself
master of these primitive but obedient peo-
ple the submarine that brought you
from the city of larr shows what can be
done with them in the meantime i had
communicated with friends on earth by
means of a secret radio frequency and
waited for the sending of the next space-
ship  

  he broke off as a door behind the
throne opened and a woman came into the
room it was olga stark now wearing
a long gown of shimmering green metal
strands of the same color were braided into
her dark hair which was crowned by a
circlet bearing the design of a rearing ser-
pent all the officers and courtiers lifted
their arms in salute the woman walked
over and stood beside lansas throne look-
ing down at gerry with a cold and imper-
sonal scorn it had not taken olga stark
very long to fit herself into the role of the
queen of giri-vaaka

a number of things were clear to
gerry norton now it had been olga
stark with whom lansing had secretly
communicated after he made himself mas-
ter of the scaly ones and that explained
her insistent requests to join the expedi-
tion again it had been olga who had
been surreptitiously using the radio to talk
to lansing that day when gerry had
stepped into the radio room on hearing the
hum of the generator they had been ar-
ranging the details of his abduction only
-who was olgas confederate who had
knocked him over the head when he had
walked in on than that time there was
still some traitor on board the viking

  i have now developed the resources of
this country to the point where the final
campaign is ready lansa boasted all
these reptile men needed was a man of


planet stories

sufficient brains and initiative to lead them
we are making ray-tubes modeled on those
aboard the stardust and will soon be able
to blast down the guardian forts of sa-
vissa and to conquer those few other por-
tions of this planet that still stand against
me then i will return to the earth in
your viking taking with me enough gold
to buy a vast fleet of ships there is more
gold available here on venus than all your
banks on earth have ever imagined i
could make myself ruler of earth with
all that gold but i will choose another
method i will bring back the space-ships
and load them up with my scaly warriors
-and then sail to conquer the outer
planets and whatever else may lie beyond

  gerry norton stared at lansa in a grim
silence the man was undoubtedly mad
stark raving mad no one but a maniac
would cherish such a wild dream of uni-
versal conquest he had that dangerous
combination of natural cleverness and dis-
torted values that has often distinguished
leaders who have taken nations into the
shadowy valleys of ruin for a moment
lansa hesitated his narrow eyes blazing
and one arm flung up in a dramatic ges-
ture then some of the fire went out of
him and he returned to more prosaic and
immediate things

  but all that lies in the future at the
moment i must ask you to radio-phone
the viking to come to this city and land
in the plain just below the walls

  ill see you in hell first gerry snapped
lansa shrugged

  i expected you to indulge in some
such heroics your type always does i
have not forgotten your attacks on my
reputation back on earth some years ago
norton nor your charges that i was unfit
to command the stardust it will give me
considerable pleasure to watch what is
about to happen to you ho-guards
bring him down to the torture chamber

the place of torture was a circular and
low vaulted chamber gerry was led
across to one of the walls and his bound
hands fastened behind him to a metal
ring the place was lit by a dim green
light that had no visible source though in
one spot there was a ruddy glow where

irons were heating in a brazier of burning
charcoal a bench was placed for lansa
and olga to sit on and four of their guards
stood beside them

  the torturers themselves had been se-
lected from among the green men of giri
instead of the scaly skinned warrior race
of vaaka they were squat and heavy
men those torturers evidently of the most
brutal and debased type that lansa had
been able to find one in particular whose
wide green face was made hideous by an
old scar that had put out one of his eyes
licked his thick lips in ghoulish anticipation
as his fingers prodded the flesh about ger-
rys ribs and felt the earth-mans muscles

  bring in the other two lansa com-
manded

  all about the room were the tools of the
torturers art some were familiar things
that have been used since men first began
to mistreat his fellow creatures-leaded
whips and stretching-racks and cradles lined
with pointed spikes others were strange
looking and probably even more horrible
mechanisms of coils and wires and elec-
trodes gerry licked his lips the place had
the hushed stillness of a chamber that has
been thoroughly sound-proofed probably
no screams of agonized victims ever pene-
trated beyond those smooth walls of pol-
ished green metal

  they brought angus mctavish in first
he looked like some shaggy red giant
wearing only a loin-cloth with his hair and
beard all awry then came closana her
crossed wrists were tied together before
her by a cord that was held by one of the
guards and she was very pale

  lansa nodded quickly

  let them begin said lansa tonelessly

  a suggestion sir olga leaned forward
on the bench the glance of her brooding
eyes was fixed on the young amazon prin-
cess let them work on the girl first
it will probably succeed more quickly i
think the man norton has fallen in love
with that empty headed young savage and
you know how men are

  you are right let it be done that
way

  closana was spread-eagled in mid-air
her upstretched arms fastened to ropes that
led to the ceiling and her ankles lashed to
metal rings in the floor below she could
the golden amazons of venus



move nothing but her head as olga stark
walked up to stand before her

  this will repay for the condescension
with which i was treated in savissa the
earth-woman said venomously closana
looked at her in silence for a moment and
then suddenly spat squarely in the other
womans face

  atta girl roared angus with all the
power of his big lungs olga struck the
helpless girl twice in the muuth with her
clenched fist then returned to her seat

  begin she commanded

  one of the torturers tossed closanas
long hair forward on either side of her
neck to leave her back entirely bare for
the lash the girls eyes were closed again
and there was a thin trickle of blood at
one corner of her mouth the torturer
shook out the lash whirled it once through
the air and then brought it smashing across
the middle of closanas back

the girls whole body writhed convul-
sively for a moment there was an
instant red welt where the whip had struck
a low moan escaped between her clenched
teeth then gerry norton leaned forward
where he stood bound against the wall

  you win lansing he said hoarsely
stop it make them leave her alone and
ill do as you say

  i thought you would the renegade of-
ficer said sottly there seemed to be a
definite disappointment in his cruel eyes
i will have the radio set brought here and
you can call the ship right now

  have them lower the girl down

  she stays where she is until you have
finished

  the portable radio-phone from the
wrecked stardust was brought in and set
up on a stand immediately in front of
gerry olga set up the sigmoid antenna
on its duralite frame and twisted the dials
to the space-ships wave length then she
took the transmitter

  calling steve brent on the viking
calling steve brent on the viking please
come in she repeated over and over

  at last the answering signal lit up and
steves familiar voice came from the re-
ceiver

  this is steve brent who is calling

  olga held the transmitter before gerrys

mouth lansa nodded to one of the tor-
turers who drew a white hot iron from
one of the braziers and held it a littlff way
from closanas face

  one false word and that iron goes into
the girls eyes the lord of giri-vaaka
warned in a low hiss after that all of
you will live in agony for weeks before
we have finished tell him to land near
the city and bring all but a single watch-
man to the east gate where they will be
well received

  hello steve this is gerry norton
gerry said brents voice shook with ex-
citement

  jumping ray-blasts chief we all
thought you were done for where did
you go what happened where are
you now

  im being well entertained in the city
of vaaka-havson these scaly men are
very pleasant and friendly when you get
to know them cross the giri river by
a bald hill 

  gerry finished the directions for the
coming of the viking and the landing of
its crew as ordered by lansa as the radio
was turned off the lord of the scaly ones
stood up with his thin lipped smile

  good our plans progress now you
three will go back to a cell and since
you are no longer of any value to us you
will be used when we hunt the giant dakta
on the shore tomorrow

the three prisoners were placed in the
same cell all spread-eagled against the
wall with their outstretched arms held by
metal cuffs angus mctavishs face was
sour and glowering as he turned to gerry

  that was an ill thing that ye did gerry
norton he growled

  i could not see them whip her any
more

  the three of us will probably meet as
bad a fate soon anyway from what that
thin faced devil said at the end and mean-
while yeve lured our comrades to deduc-
tion

  it couldnt be helped gerry said and
closed his eyes he had taken what was
probably the longest chance of his career
and he was not in a mood to talk about
it particularly when every faintest syl-
lable uttered in one of these metal cells
	planet stories

could be heard by the guards in the corri-
dor outside

  there was little rest for any of them
chained in that awkward position and with
the cell always filled with that pitiless green
light gerry dozed fitfully from time to
lime closana seemed to have fallen
asleep drooping forward in her bonds with
her head hanging low but her long hair
covered her face and it was hard to tell
angus made no attempt to sleep at all and
for most of the intervening time he was
muttering many tongued curses into his
beard

  at last they were freed from their
chains they were given water in metal
cups and a bowl of some kind of stew to
eat for perhaps an hour they rested and
eased their stiffened muscles then more
guards came and bound their hands behind
them and took them away

  it was again broad daylight when they
were taken out into the streets of the city
the peculiarly yellow daylight that filtered
through the cloudy canopy overhead the
three prisoners were surrounded by a heavy
guard of reptile men who marched them
across the city and out through a gate in
the far wall here a broad plain swept
down to the waters of a saffron colored
lake a sheet of water so vast that its far
shore was no more than a dun line along
the horizon a sort of grandstand had
been erected along one side of the plain

  i think i begin to understand the point
of this little game mctavish muttered
squinting as he peered ahead and i dont
fancy the idea at all

  i dont get what you mean

  mctavish snorted

  did ye never see a piece of cheese in
a mouse-trap

  then gerry himself began to under-
stand on a broad platform before the
grandstand stood a line of men armed with
gas-guns some were gray scaled officers
of the fighting forces and others were
dandified green men of the decadent
minority that had fawned upon and min-
gled with their conquerers in the flat
and marshy expanse of the plain before
them there had been driven a number of
short but heavy stakes like tent pegs each
with a metal ring set in the top there
were long rows of them gray scaled

guards were busy fettering prisoners to
the pegs making them fast by tying to
the metal ring the other end of the long
cord with which their hands were tied be-
hind them the hunters and the audience
were ready the bait was being prepared

  closana was a few feet away from
gerry fastened to the next stake she
stood erect her shoulders drawn back by
the strain of her bonds and her long hair
blowing in the wind

  this is the end geree she said if
not today then tomorrow or the next day
this was the tale told in larr of what
happens to the prisoners of the scaly ones
but i never believed it till now

there were sixty or eighty prisoners
fastened in the field to serve as bait
for the giant dakta about half were
golden amazons captured in various raids
the remainder were men and women of
the green people of giri prisoners con-
demned to death hy the grim and ruthless
tribunals of the scaly ones now a dozen
attendants carrying leather buckets ran
up and down the lines of the captives
splashing each victim with a dipper full
of a purple colored and very pungent oil

  now whats the game gerry mut-
tered angus bent his head to sniff at the
heavy liquid trickling down his hairy chest

  it smells like a harlots dream he
muttered sourly probably intended to
make us more attractive to whatever kind
of creature it is thats coming after us

  the attendants had hurried away with
their buckets of oil and now the crowds
in the grandstand and on the plain settled
down to wait they were in holiday mood
laughing and talking in their shrill voices

  then a black dot appeared high up in
the sky a murmur of anticipation ran
over the crowd the dakta came plum-
meting earthward as its super-keen senses
saw and smelled the attractive bait wait-
ing below the thing as it came near was
like some figment from a night-mare it
had a reptilian body between a twenty-foot
spread of leathery wings and a long beak
with a double row of pointed teeth one
of the things that gerry had seen flying
over that lonely sea when he first brought
the viking down through the canopy of
clouds that covered the planet of venus
the golden amazons of venus	

  so that is a dakta angus muttered
bonny little creature

  the winged lizard checked its flight
momentarily some ten feet off the ground
directly above one of the captive ama-
zons then he dove down the girl
screamed and twisted away to the length
of her tether and the toothed beak just
missed her the first of the hunters fired
as the dakta whirled and lashed out again
but the bullet exploded off to one side

  gripping the writhing amazon with his
beak and his clawed feet the dakta flapped
his great wings and soared upward again
two more of the hunters fired together
one of the explosive bullets missed en-
tirely the other blew one of the girls legs
to pieces but did not harm the monster that
held her

  then lansa tossed aside his green robe
and stood up gerry saw that he held a
ray-tube either one from the stardust or
one of the new ones he now claimed to
be able to make in giri-vaaka the tube
slanted upward murky light played
around its muzzle the dakta gave a shrill
and almost human scream then it dropped
its mangled victim and fell twitching to
the ground its leathery skin was turned
black where the ray-blast had struck it
along the edge of the field the close packed
crowds broke into wild cheering and lansa
acknowledged it with a condescending ges-
ture of one upraised arm

  the hunt went on sometimes the dakta
came singly sometimes in pairs the hunt-
ers had the range better now and dropped
them consistently on several occasions
the flying lizards were brought down be-
fore they had time to seize a victim at all
but most of the time one of the prisoners
was killed or mortally wounded before the
dakta was slain a green man tethered
to the stake next beyond closana had been
ripped about the throat by the raking teeth
of a daktas bill and was breathing with
a sort of gurgling moan as he bled to death
so far that was the nearest that one of
the flying lizards had come to gerry or his
two companions

  and then gerry saw the thing for which
he had been watching there was a streak
of fire along the eastern horizon the
blast of speeding rocket tubes a cigar
shaped hull of gleaming blue and silver

came streaking across the saffron sky with
a trail of smoke behind it the viking
had come

a swelling uproar came from the
crowds which began to mill about in
confusion lansa had risen to his feet
and was peering upward with one hand
raised to shade his eyes yellow flames
played about the vikings bow as the re-
verse rockets checked her momentum a
pair of swooping dakta veered away from
her then dropped down toward the bait
tethered below one of them was headed
straight for angus mctavish

   instantly one of the forward ray-guns
on the space-ship glowed into life and
the winged lizard crumpled in mid-flight
gerry knew then that someone on board
had been looking down through the pow-
erful viewing glasses and had recognized
him and angus he shouted hoarsely
knowing he would not be heard but unable
to keep silent

   drums were throbbing a swift alarm
and the milling crowds were in wild con-
fusion companies of the scaly warriors
were firing by volley but the explosive
bullets only flashed harmlessly against the
vikings duralite hull some of the heavier
gas-guns set on the battlements above
hissed into life then but even the larger
caliber explosives could make no impres-
sion on tempered duralite with her ray-
guns flashing and ripping black swathes
in the scaly ranks below with her heli-
copters spinning to take the strain as the
blast of the rockets died away the viking
settled rapidly groundward

   by lord steve came a-fightin mc-
tavish roared

  of course you old goat gerry
shouted back did you really think id call
the ship into a trap youre as bad as
that maniac who calls himself lansa i
knew that if i spoke too strongly of what
nice fellows these scaly devils are steve
would have the sense to know that i was
under pressure and in a trap

  and then came swift disaster over
the edge of the nearest black and battle-
mented wall of lansas palace thrust the
muzzle of a large caliber ray-gun steve
brent saw it too and tried to lift the nose
of his ship to bring his own guns to bear


planet stories

on this new menace but he was too late
the muzzle of the ray-gun on the battle-
ments glowed dully the blast of the supode-
rays struck the row of spinning helicopters
on top of the vikings hull the blades
of the big propellors went spinning into
space their shafts bent and crumpled like
straws in a gale robbed of their sup-
port essential when lacking rocket power
of at least  miles per hour the space-
ship plunged downward like a falling star
she struck the waters of the lake with a
mighty splash spray dashed as high as
the walls of lansas castle and when it
was gone the space-ship had vanished

gerry norton stood motionless
he was staring at the muddy and
foam flecked waters of the lake and at
the spreading ripples that still beat on the
shore as the effect of that mighty splash
subsided at the moment he felt old and
tired and defeated his brain numbed the
viking was gone freckled steve brent
and the cheerful portok and all the rest
of them were gone buried deep in the
muddy bottom of a venusian lake

  the second expedition from earth to
this cloud-veiled and ill-fated planet had
also ended in disaster in the future the
viking would be classed with the stardust
-simply another luckless space-ship that
sailed away into the void and vanished
the men of her crew and what they tried
to accomplish would be forgotten their
names would only remain on some yellow-
ing record buried in the maze of govern-
ment files so deep was cjerry nortons
bitter brooding that he scarcely heard the
words angus mctavish was shouting in
his ear

  come on gerry lad lets get away
while theres all this confusion

ever since they had been brought to
this field beside the lake angus had
been working at his bonds he was a very
strong man anyway and the swell of his
earthly muscles was far greater than the
strength of any of the races that the scaly
ones were accustomed to making prison-
ers while the attention of all the guards
was absorbed in the appearance and sub-
sequent wreck of the viking angus had
managed to snap his own bonds and was

now unhurriedly freeing gerrys wrists

  gerry ran to closana and untied her
hands while angus freed the nearest other
prisoner who was a stocky and broad shoul-
dered green man with a heavily lined face
as soon as his hands were free the latter
wheeled to face them

  my thanks hiziren he panted now
go while you can you are more easily
spotted in a crowd than i hurry i will
free as many of these others as possible
get into the city and try to reach the place
men call the square of the dragon say
that sarnak sent you hurry

  even though he was carrying closana
in his arms gerrys earthly muscles al-
lowed him to run in mighty six-foot
bounds angus went leaping along before
him so great was the confusion that they
were half way across the plain to the city
before anyone noticed them at all then
a shouting officer of the scaly ones threw
himself in front of them with his drawn
sword in his hand

  the big engineer roared like an angry
bull and leaped clean over the man be-
fore the scaly warrior could turn the scot
had him from behind an instant later
angus had the sword and was racing ahead
while the venusian lay sprawled in the
mud with his neck broken and his long
head twisted grotesquely awry

   the hal f dozen guards posted in the arch
of the gate stared indecisively at the white
skinned trio racing toward them angus
had a sword in each hand by this time and
he leaped at the guards with a shout the
fugitive broke through the line of swords-
men by sheer momentum and dashed into
the city there was no pursuit the first
of the panic stricken throng rushing back
for the shelter of the city reached the gate
a moment later and the guards were
swamped by a jostling mob of mingled
scaly ones and green men

  gerry and his two companions darted
into the nearest of the many narrow alleys
that twisted about this part of the city
they dodged from one dingy thoroughfare
to the next when they met a woman of
the green people gerry unceremoniously
tore off her robe and shielding veil and
flung them to closana to hide her own
tawny skin and golden hair later when
he and angus had also disguised them-
the golden amazons of venus



selves in the rough garments worn by the
poorer folk of this city of vaaka-hausen
they were able to walk quietly down the
streets without fear of detection unless
they met a patrol at dose range

  at last they came to a dingy plaza that
was surrounded by ramshackle buildings
of great age it had probably once been
a prosperous and fashionable part of the
city centuries ago before the scaly ones
overran the land of giri now grass grew
up between the paving stones and the roofs
of the dingy buildings sagged close to the
breaking point and piles of festering rub-
bish lay along the gutters the place was
a slum of the sort that had not existed on
the more enlightened planets of earth and
mars for many generations a canal
flowed along one side of the square and
in the center of the plaza stood the eroded
and ancient black marble statue of a rear-
ing dragon

  this must be the place angus mut-
tered from the shadows of the hood that
he had drawn up over his head

as they hesitated a few people peered
furtively out at them from the broken
windows and sagging doors of the houses
around the square then a man came to-
ward them he was bent and crippled a
beggar wearing filthy rags his matted
hair hung down over his eyes and his
whole body seemed covered with the caked
filth of one who had never thought of
washing as the man came forward with
a sort of limping shuffle gerry instinc-
tively laid his hand on the hilt of the sword
he carried concealed under his cloak while
closana drew the concealing veil more
closely over her face

  alms hisiren a little charity of your
generosity the beggar whined as he came
closer

  what place is this gerry asked try-
ing to give his voice the soft tone and lisp-
ing accent characteristic of the green men

  the beggar limped a little closer and
peered up into the shadows of gerrys
hood what he saw seemed to satisfy
him

  take your hand from your sword hilt
friend he said in a low voice quite unlike
his previous whine what place do you
seek

  the place of the dragon

  this is it who sent you 

  sarnak sent us

  it is good the beggar pointed down
a flight of worn stone steps that led to the
canal whose surface was some eight or
ten feet below the level of the plaza go
down there below the bridge and tap on
the stone that bears a rusted iron ring
you will find friends go quickly while
there are no strangers to observe you
do you trust that man  angus whis-
pered in english as they turned away
gerry shrugged

  weve got to its- our only chance
were too easy to recognize in spite of
these clothes to stay free in this city for
long

  the black waters of the canal flowed
sluggishly along between slimy stone walls
refuse drifted on the surface the water
itself had a foul and penetrating odor
gerry walked down the steps and then
along the walk that stretched beside the
water at one edge of the canal until he
was under an arch that served as a bridge
to support the street above the arch was
wide enough so that they were now com-
pletely hidden from the view of anyone
in the plaza above

  on one of the stones of the arch at
about the height of his shoulder gerry
saw a rusted iron ring he tapped on
that stone with the hilt of his sword he
heard a faint click and though there was
no visible change in the surface of the
pitted stone wall before him he heard a
whispered question

  who knocks

  friends gerry replied

  who sent you

  sarnak sent us

  there was a low metallic jingle a
section of the wall about the height of a
man and some three feet wide swung
quietly inward as soon as the three of
them had stepped through the opening into
a small room that was built in the interior
of the arch the door swung shut behind
them

there were half a dozen men in this
low roofed and stone walled chamber
all were of the green people dressed as
ragged beggars but with the bearing and
	pluvet

appearance of warriors drawn steel
gleamed in their hands their faces were
heavy with suspicion one of the men
had gone to stand with his back against
the closed door behind them

  who are you that come using the name
of sarnak snapped the leader

  suspicion became blended with puzzled
surprise as gerry and angus threw back
their hoods and the outlaws saw their white
skins hastily gerry told the tale of the
dakta hunt and of their subsequent escape

  so sarnak got away i the leader of the
green men exulted ho that is the
best news that we of the dragons teeth
have heard in many weeks  all right
slag take these strangers through to the
inner places

  one of the green men beckoned to
gerry to follow him down a narrow flight
of steps at the back of the room it ended
in a circular pool of water like a large
well the steps going on down below the
surface their guide opened a cupboard
built into the wall and took out four glass
helmets the helmets were attached to
leather pads that fitted tightly about the
shoulders and chest with straps to hold
them in place a cylindrical metal tank
was attached to the back of each helmet
with a tube that led to a valve at the side
the guide also took out some heavily leaded
sandals

  put on these helmets and then open
the valves he explained then follow me
down the steps be careful not to fall in
the darkness after w get around the
first bend in the corridor below there will
be light

  gerry put the globular glass helmet over
his head opening the valve as soon as he
had adjusted the straps the air in the
helmet immediately took on a faintly chem-
ical odor but it was pleasant and in no
way oppressive as soon as all of them
were ready the man called slag beckoned
and then started down the steps

  warm black water rose to gerrys knees
then to his waist as it came up to his
shoulders he saw the top of slags helmet
disappear below the surface ahead of him
for a moment the smooth surface of the
water was level with gerrys eyes as it
rose around his own helmet then he
stepped down into a darkness as black and

stories

impenetrable as though he were immersed
in ink

  gerry guided himself with his left hand
on the slime covered stones of the wall
beside him he reached back with his
other hand to steady closana who was just
behind all together he counted thirty
steps feeling carefully with his feet each
time before the floor leveled off the
wall curved around to the right gerry
followed it rounded a bend and was no
longer in darkness

  they stood in a straight passage that
was lined with blocks of polished stone
metal plates set in the ceiling at regular
intervals glowed with a greenish-yellow
light that was nearly as bright as the cloudy
venusian daylight the place was com-
pletely filled with water

  it was an eerie sensation slag was
standing a few feet ahead grinning at them
through the glass of his helmet but now
he turned and walked slowly down the cor-
ridor gerry followed him bent well for-
ward as he walked forcing himself ahead
against the resistance of the water all
their movements were sluggish and slow
but the heavily leaded sandals held them
down and gave their feet purchase

small fishes swam past them along the
passage their round eyes peering in
through the helmet glasses as they passed
clumps of colored seaweed grew out from
the walls and ceiling their long streamers
waving gently in the slow currents set up
by the passage of the men in spite of
the brightness of the light from the ceiling
plates the effect of the water made it dif-
ficult to see far down the passage ahead
the outlines of slag were clear enough as
he plodded along directly ahead of gerry
but everything beyond him was a little
blurred and uncertain it was like living
in a mirage

  at last they came to a point where the
passage branched here they passed a
sentry who wore a glass helmet and a tight
fitting green rubber uniform on his chest
was the insignia of a rampant black dragon
he was armed with a very thin almost
needle-like sword whose point was razor
keen gerry realized the reason for that
peculiarly designed weapon when the sen-
try swung his sword upward to salute their
the golden amazons of venus



guide the blade was so thin that it of-
fered little resistance to the water and its
power of being quickly wielded made it
a far more effective weapon under water
than a heavier sword would have been

  they passed more branching passages
and more rubber-clad sentries who stared
at them curiously as they went by there
was a whole network of corridors in this
underwater world at last slag opened
a metal door at the end of the particular
passage he had followed and they all
crowded into a small room slag closed
the door and dogged it then tapped on a
glass panel across the room

  a silvery flood of air bubbles came
pouring out the end of a pipe that pro-
truded through the wall at the same time
gerry heard the thud of heavy pumps start-
ing to suck water through gratings at the
base of the wall the water level dropped
rapidly when it was down to their waists
slag took off his helmet and slipped the
leaded sandals from his feet he mo-
tioned to the others to do the same

  we are about to enter the hidden realm
of luralla the home of the dragons
teeth he said if you can prove your
right to be here you will be welcome
otherwise you will go back into one of
these waterlocks-without any helmets on
he grinned cheerfully

the water dropped below the level of
the door sills the pumps sucked
noisly on the last few foaming inches for
a moment and then they ceased the inner
door was opened by a sentry whose tight
fitting green uniform with its black dragon
was made of dry cloth instead of dripping
rubber he wore a plumed metal helmet
and carried a heavy sword instead of one
of the thin water blades

  come in slag he said who are these
strangers 

  they were in a sort of guardroom a
square chamber where glass water helmets
stood in long rows on metal shelves and
many weapons hung in racks on the walls
the control levers of the pumps were just
to the left of the door there were half
a dozen uniformed men standing about the
room one of them bearing the silver in-
signia of an officer on his chest when
-planet stories-winter

slag had given a hasty account of the com-
ing of gerry and the others the officer
nodded toward an inner door

  prince sarnak has just returned you
will find him in the great hall take these
strangers there

  the sound of music and laughter and
the confused babel of many voices came to
gerrys ears as soon as the far door was
opened they entered a vast hall it was
low ceiled as were all the water-locked
chambers of this strange place but it was
broad and spacious heavy stone columns
carved like giant sea-horses supported the
roof patterns of seaweed and star fish
and other denizens of the deep were inter-
mingled wth rearing dragons in the painted
designs along the walls the room was
filled with wide tables flanked by long
benches

  the men and women who sat at the
tables or stood gossiping in noisy groups
in corners of the hall were nearly all of
the green people of giri but there were
a few escaped golden amazons who came
flocking eagerly around closana in out-
ward appearance these green skinned men
and women were similar to the folk who
lived in the city overhead with their scaly
masters but there was a subtle difference
these people had none of the cowed and
subjugated air of the citizens who lived
above ground there was a different look
in their eyes a more confident note in their
voices a firmer set to their shoulders
these folk had the air of free men and
warriors not slaves

  a stocky and merry eyed man caught
sight of them and came striding across the
hall it was sarnak the man who had
been tethered next to them in the field of
the dakta hunt

  welcome to the halls of luralla he
boomed we are glad to have you come
to the hidden realm of the dragons teeth
hizlren and comrades these are the out-
landers from afar who freed me this after-
noon so that i and a dozen more of our
people escaped death at the hands of the
scaly ones

  thrice hail roared the crowd while
a hundred blades flashed in the golden
light angus mctavish rung the water
out of his dripping beard

  these look like men of spirit he rum-
	planet

bled cheerfully i think im going to enjoy
myself again

a little later wearing dry clothes
the three of them sat down with sar-
nak and his officers at a table in the comer
of the hall young girls brought them
dishes of fried sea-urchins and broiled
steaks of the grappa fish and other savory
dishes

  we who call ourselves the dragons
teeth are outlaws descended from out-
laws sarnak explained our ancestors
were men and women who never acknowl-
edged the rule of the scaly ones when
they overran this once pleasant land of
giri i was born in this hidden place as
was my father before me and his father
before him we live here in the water-
locked halls of luralla and harass the ty-
rants in what ways we can and try to keep
alive the traditions and glory of the old
days when the dragon kings ruled in this
city and the scaly ones were still lurking
in their vaaka marshes to the westward
does lansa know of this place

  he knows that the dragons teeth ex-
ist as all rulers of the scaly ones have
known it but the location of our hiding
place has never been betrayed

  then roared angus pounding his big
fist on the table till the dishes rattled why
dont you revolt ill go with you myself
to strike a blow against those reptile
skinned devils up above

  count me in too gerry said quietly
angus voice had boomed out through
the big hall it was answered by a lilting
shout as men sprang to their feet hun-
dreds of sword blades flashed clear of their
scabbards only sarnak himself remained
seated slowly shaking his head there
was a twisted smile on his broad and heav-
ily lined face his eyes held bitterness

  it would only be pointless suicide
hiziren he said grimly we number
only about a thousand all together we
hunted men oi the dragons teeth against
the countless thousands of lansas scaly
hordes it would be different if our coun-
trymen up above could be inspired to a
mass uprising but the time is not yet too
long have they lived under the rule of the
tyrants they are cowed they have lost
their spirit and some of the younger ones

stories

have even become fawning satellites of
the conquerors i f there comes a day when
the forces of the scaly ones are engaged
in some major war along the frontier as
in this suggested assault upon the barrier
forts of savissa that lansa is said to be
planning then we may be able to do some-
thing for the present we must continue
to lie hidden and bide our time

  gerry norton was uncertain about his
own course now that the viking and her
crew had been lost with all hope of a re-
turn to earth cut off he felt hopelessly
adrift sarnak urged his visitors to stay
in luralla the place was a remarkable
engineering feat completely under water
and with its air constantly re-conditioned
and preserved but gerry felt restless and
cramped there though the outlaws car-
ried on a constant guerilla warfare with
the scaly ones it was all on a small scale
gerry felt that he would rather return to
savissa where at least the people were
free and the amazon warriors kept cease-
less watch on their frontiers closana of
course was very anxious to return home

  suits me too angus rumbled in
that country they at least show a proper
respect for a man of my attainments
meaning your whiskers gerry asked
look out angus closana warned with
a smile idly running her slender fingers
along the keen edge of her dagger some
savissan princess will choose you for her
husband as i have chosen geree here

  i told you we wouldnt talk about that
for the present    gerry began clos-
anas hand moved swiftly as a striking
dakta the keen blade bit through the
cloth of gerrys sleeve and pinned it to the
table top

  youll never get away from me geree
the girl said quietly angus mctavish
burst out in a great roar of laughter

  might as well admit youre licked now
lad these venusian women seem to be
verra strong minded lassies

they started two days later there
was of course neither night nor day
in the sub-aqueous halls of luralla but the
outlaws ran their lives on a normal sched-
ule sarnak supplied gerry and the others
with rubber uniforms and complete equip-
ment including the thin bladed water-
the golden amazons of venus



swords in the long feathery scabbards

  i will have you guided out to one of
our exits that is a quarter mile off shore
from the place where the dakta hunt was
held sarnak offered

  i thought that water was a lake gerry
said sarnak shook his head

  no it is an estuary an arm of the
great sea the chemical tanks on your
water helmets will keep the air pure for
several days travel and the sentries at the
last outpost will give you trained saddle-
dolphins so that you will make better time
toward the coastal regions of savissa

  sarnak went with them to the guard-
room at the edge of the water filled pas-
sages and personally checked over their
equipment

  these are our new type of helmet with
the audiphones that let the wearers talk
to each other under water he said touch-
ing the tiny microphones set into the
curved glass well-you had better
start may the dragon gods be with you

  they strapped on their helmets and ad-
justed the valves a uniformed guide
stepped into the water-lock with them
sarnak shook hands saluted and then
stepped back through the door which
closed behind him the guide lifted his
hand in a signal and a second later a tor-
rent of water rushed out of the gratings
to foam about their feet they were ready
to leave luralla

  again they went through the maze of
water-filled passages passing occasional
sentries after a while the character of
the corridor changed it was wider and
was arched instead of square and there
was a carpet of soft natural sand beneath
their feet instead of a stone floor

  we come to the last outpost of lu-
ralla hiziren  the guide said

  they stepped out of the end of the pas-
sage and found themselves in the open
sea many fathoms down a broad and
slightly sloping floor of smooth sand
studded with lumps of coral and clusters
of sea-weed stretched before them some
were giant ferns stretching twelve and fif-
teen feet high others were low and sponge-
like growths a school of tiny red fishes
shot swiftly past them larger fish sailed
majestically by overhead the top of the
water was a gleaming golden ceiling far

above them the greenish yellow light les-
sening in intensity as it came down to the
depths

  the end of the passage was surrounded
by a barrier of piled coral outlaw swords-
men stood on guard also armed with a
sort of compressed air cross-bow that shot
a heavy metal needle with great force from
a corral at one side an orderly brought
three saddle-dolphins

  the big fish were equipped with rubber
saddles strapped around the body and
short stirrups they were guided by a
bridle similar to that used on earthly
horses as gerry swung up to the saddle
his dolphin bucked once or twice with quick
flips of his tail then steadied down as he
felt the tight pressure of his masters
knees when the other two were mounted
the officer commanding the outpost lifted
his arm in salute

  the dragon gods be with you he
said at a distance of fifteen or twenty
feet the sound of his voice was slightly
muted but the words were perfectly clear
in the ear-pieces of gerrys helmet he
lifted his own rubber gloved hand to his
globular helmet and returned the salute

they rode off at an easy pace the
dolphins rising above the tops of the
tallest vegetation gerry found that it was
easy to sit the saddle as long as he bent
a little forward to overcome the resistance
of the water against his chest they were
about thirty or forty feet down on earth
such a depth would have been uncomfort-
able but the lighter gravity of venus made
it easily bearable

  gerry glanced back closana was riding
a few feet behind him slender and erect
controlling her restless dolphin as easily
as though she had been accustomed to such
steeds all her life angus was grinning
broadly through his globular glass helmet
as he sat astride a particularly big dolphin
and swung his light bladed water-sword
from side to side

  if any of our friends back on earth
could see us now in some sort of an astral
spectroscope the big scot cried theyd
think themselves crazy maybe this is only
a nightmare at that do you think well
wake up soon and find ourselves safe back
on board the viking
	planet

  im afraid not gerry answered he
wondered in what part of this vast sea the
twisted hulk of the viking was now lying

  all day they rode roughly following the
shoreline to the northward whenever it
got so deep that nothing was visible below
but a vast green shadow gerry headed
inland until the tops of the sea gardens
again came into view sarnak had told
them that by the middle of the next day
it should be safe for them to come above
water and check their maps and put fresh
chemical cartridges in the cylinders of their
helmets the scaly ones patrolled their
coast line in shallow open boats but they
did not go beyond their own borders

  once gerry checked his dolphin and
then headed downward as he caught sight
of something big and dark lying on the
sand the others followed him it was
the broken and rusting hulk of a space-
ship a vessel of a strange type with a name
in an unknown tongue still visible on the
shattered stern the wreck must have been
there for a very long time for the sand
was heaped high about it and sea-weeds
grew up through the open hatches

  leaping ray-blasts mctavish said
softly yon craft never came from either
earth or mars

  probably from some far distant planet
in outer space that weve never heard of
gerry said some adventurous wanderer
of the interstellar regions who came to
grief in this lonely spot

it was desolate and forlorn the sight
of that wrecked vessel from so long
ago it made gerry think of his own lost
command there were clean picked white
bones of strange shape lying about on the
sand gerry saluted a tribute to those
strange and forgotten wanderers of space
and then urged his dolphin to a higher
level again

  when the dimming light showed that it
was dusk above the water they rode in to
the four-fathom shallows and halted iti a
smooth patch of yellow sand gerry un-
saddled the dolphins and tethered them to
lumps of coral where they browsed con-
tentedly on the short vegetation then the
three exiles sat down in a circle on the
sand mctavish stretched his long legs
bouncing a few feet off the ground as he

stories

did so and then floating slowly down again

  ill never forget this journey if i live
to be older than the whole solar system
itself  he said also-im hungry
theres nothing we can do about that
until noon tomorrow gerry grunted
maybe the fasting will make you lose
some of that surplus bulk of yours but
ill admit i could do with some of that
special coffee portok used to brew in the
ward room on the viking in the evenings
id give a lot for a drink of plain
water closana said wistfully acres of
water around us and nothing to drink
when the last of the light was gone they
lit a small lamp that sarnak had given them
it illumined a circle some twenty feet
across a little patch of light in the midst
of the utter blackness of the depths of
the sea they sat there talking for a while
then gerry stretched out on the sand with
one arm hooked around a lump of coral
to hold himself in place he was thankful
that the waters of venus were always
warm it would scarcely have been pos-
sible to sleep at the bottom of one of
earths oceans in this manner even with
the equipment with which sarnak had sup-
plied them

  for a while gerry drowsed the audi-
phones of his helmet picked up all the
faint sounds of this watery world a
muffled splash as angus mctavish stirred
restlessly  the steady movement as
their drowsing but apparently sleepless
dolphins fed on the fields of sea-weed   
an occasional steady churning as some
larger denizen of the deep swam past above
them then he slept

it was well past midnight by the illumi-
nated dial of the waterproof chronom-
eter that sarnak had given gerry when he
awoke angus was shaking his shoulder
the light had been put out hours before
and there was no illumination at all except
for an occasional flash of green phos-
phoresence where some fish sped by

  either im an overgrown sponge the
big engineer muttered or theres a light
shining through the water off to the west
gerry yawned and sat up instinctively
starting to rub is eyes before his hands
bumped against the hard glass surface of
his curving helmet some of the bits of
the golden amazons of venus



coral around them glowed with an eerie
green radiance and a tall frond of sea-
weed had tiny specks of light on the tips
of its constantly waving leaves then far
off to the left gerry caught a faint glow

  it was hard to tell what kind of a light
it was so great was the refraction of the
water but there was something there it
was little more than a lessening of the
deep gloom that otherwise surrounded them
on all sides gerry got to his feet and
picked up his rubber saddle which he had
been using as a pillow under his helmet

  wed better investigate he said
wake closana

  they saddled their dolphins and rode out
at an easy pace holding the big fish down
with a tight rein as they rode the glow
ahead of them became more definite it
seemed to come from a long row of twenty
or more lights then they were near
enough -to see each other in the reflected
glow

  its some kind of a ship gerry said
those lights are her port holes

  its more than that snapped angus
its the viking i know the lines of her
stern anywhere even in this sunken and
god forsaken spot

  the space-ship lay quietly in the soft
mud of this part of the ocean bottom all
her port holes of transparent duralite were
glowing with the reflected light from in-
side the twisted wrecks of her helicop-
ters were still visible on top of the hull
but otherwise she did not appear to be
damaged

  gerry was in the middle as the three of
them rode their dolphins up close to one
of the big windows of the control room
the ship had evidently survived the fall
into the water for they could see dim fig-
ures moving about inside

  i told you that duralite hull could stand
u little thing like a fall into the ocean
mctavish exulted

  as they crowded their finny steeds close
to the glass of the control room window
portok the martian came to peer out his
red skinned face went pale as he saw them
and even through the ships hull their au-
diphones picked up his agonized cry

  steve tanda i just saw the ghosts
of norton and mctavish looking in the
window

  steve brent came into the control room
he looked haggard and unshaven and he
was stained with oily grease

  what are you raving about portok
he snapped

  its no raving steve the little mar-
tian chattered i tell you i saw the three
of them the chief and angus and the
amazon girl-all riding on some kind of
big fish and peering in that window
youre going crazy steve brent
snapped but he walked to the window his
own eyes widened as he saw the strangely
clad trio sitting their mounts outside gerry
waved violently to him

  let us in you idiot he shouted for-
getting that the viking did not carry any
audiphones that could pick up his words
he heard steves unsteady voice

  maybe were both crazy portok but
i think theyre really out there open the
outer door to the starboard space-lock

a small door swung open on the
starboard side of the vikings blue
and silver hull that small compartment
had really been designed for dropping ob-
jects into the void of outer space or for
testing the quality of the atmosphere on
any stray planetoids the viking might have
visited on her journey across the vastness
of interplanetary space but it would do
for a water-lock in this instance

  gerry and the others dismounted from
their dolphins and let the reins hang an-
gus gave his mount a slap on the flank
with a flip of its tail the big fish wheeled
and swam off and after a second the others
followed it gerry led the way into the
space-lock and closed the door behind him
it only took a few seconds for the blast
of the vikings powerful compressed air
tanks to blow out the water then as
gerry unstrapped his helmet and lifted the
big glass globe off his head steve brent
opened the inner door and stepped into the
space-lock

  i dont know if im crazy or dreaming
or what chief he said but im damn
glad to see you back

youre sane enough gerry snapped
its a long story so skip it for the mo-
ment i thought you were done for
not the viking larry affectionately
slapped the laminated duralite shell of the
	planet

space-ship she can stand more than be-
ing dropped in the drink from a few hun-
dred feet up our problem is how to get
going again weve been able to crawl
along the bottom by using minimum power
of one rocket tube and scaring hell out of
all the fish but thats the best weve been
able to do now that angus is back he
can take over what do you think about
the helicopters

  i could forge new ones in a week out
of that blue metal they have in giri-
vaaka mctavish muttered but god
knows how well ever get hold of a sup-
ply anyway i think i can reverse enough
of the gravity plates to give this craft re-
serve buoyancy so shell navigate on the
surface instead of hugging the bottom

  i never thought of that steve said
admiringly angus grunted and began to
strip off his green rubber uniform

  it takes  scotsman to show the rest
of the universe how to get out of a tough
spot

it was afternoon on the following day
when the vikings long hull finally
broke the surface she lay in the water
like a half submerged cigar the yellowish
ripples lapping on the curved blue duralite
of her superstructure the twisted re-
mains of the shattered helicopters were
ugly stumps along the space-ships sleek
back a single rocket tube flamed and
smoked astern its blast driving the vessel
through the water at a good pace while
her wake smoked and bubbled

  gerry norton opened the duralite dome
of the upper control room and stepped out
on the wet deck with a few of the others
they were well out on the great sea with
the green hills of the giri-savissa border
a low smear along the horizon to star-
board this was the same lonely sea they
had seen when they first dropped down
through the clouds to venus

  the vast and greenish-yellow waters
were broken by scattered islands bare bits
of rock that were dotted with blue moss
sea birds swooped about them lofty
mountains on a distant shore were capped
with snow in one or two places a narrow
shaft of sunlight struck down through a
brief gap in the canopy of eternal clouds
but otherwise there was only that subdued

stories

and peculiarly golden light in which there
movd only a few oddly shaped birds

  so much had happened since they first
saw that lonely sea it seemed as though
much more than a week had elapsed sa-
vissa and its golden amazons    the
arrow tipped tower of rupin-sang   
the scaly hordes of vaaka and the dread
palace of the insane lansa who had once
been an earthly officer    the secret
and water-locked halls of luralla where
the outlaws of giri dwelt-many scenes
went through gerry nortons mind he
seemed to have aged ten years since the
day he brought the viking down through
the cloud screen well-the immediate
problem was to get some suitable metal to
repair the smashed helicopters the vik-
ing might possibly get up into the air with
the power of her rockets alone if they
beached her on a sloping shore with her
nose upward but she could never come
down safely without helicopters

  ill hold her on this course a while
gerry said in the morning we can strike
over and try to pick up the frontiers of
savissa

  it was just at dusk that they saw white
towers against the sky they rose out of
the sea as gerry turned the vikings blunt
nose toward them-the mighty battlements
of a vast city closana who was standing
on deck beside him at the time rested her
hands on the rail and stared in utter amaze-
ment

  but it isnt possible geree she
gasped there isnt any civilization out
there on the islands of the great sea
could it be a mirage he suggested
a reflection of some savissan city on the
mainland 

  no the girl shook her head there
are no cities of that sort in any of these
lands geree-there is something strange
here i do not like it there cannot be
any city ahead of us there

  but there it is gerry said grimly
we cant all be seeing things well go
closer and get a better look

  it was sunset the unspectacular venu-
sian sunset which was simply a swift les-
sening of the golden glow from the cloud
veiled sky above lights were gleaming
from most of the tall buildings of the tow-
ering city as the viking drove toward it
the golden amazons of venus



through a quiet sea sea birds swooped
low about the ships wake the watchers
 deck could see the low shore line of the
island on which the city was built then
they heard distant bells pleasant bells that
seemed to be chiming a farewell to the day
and a welcome to the night and then a
red light flashed on top of the tallest build-
ing and in an instant the entire city van-
ished

one minute the strange city had been
clearly visible before them its grace-
ful towers agleam with lights as they
notched the sky the next instant the
whole place was gone there was nothing
in sight at all but a low shoreline it
was as though a thick veil of concealing
mist had been suddenly drawn across be-
tween the ship and the city only-the air
was clear and without a trace of mist
gerry walked across to the open dome of
the upper control room

  cut rockets he snapped get some
kind of an anchor overboard well just
stay right here off shore until morning
theres something queer going on

  gerry and steve brent leaned on the
rail together peering through the darkness
toward the island nothing was visible in
the faint phorphor-glow that marked the
venusian night but they could just hear
a distant singing as of many voices lifted
in chorus

  what do you think happened to the
city so suddenly steve asked gerry
shrugged

   i suppose some mist hid it

  there wasnt any mist steve said
flatly anyway-we could see the low hills
on shore just as clearly after the city dis-
appeared as before anyway 
listen gerry interrupted

  now they could again hear the sound
of bells coming across the water half
the time the sound was swept away by the
night breeze half the time they could just
hear it the bells were of many blended
tones and notes an immense carillon they
were singing some outland melody that was
full of the surge of ocean breezes and the
cries of the sea birds it rose and swelled
and died away again

   the citys there all right gerry said
slowly though i cant imagine why we

dont see any lights with the sound of the
bells that close but well see in the morn-
ing

  i tell you there is no city closana
said her voice troubled we have often
sailed ships into these waters from the
savissan coast and we know that none of
these outer isles are inhabited what you
have heard must be the ghosts of the old
ones ancient phantoms speeding through
the skies there is a legend that the bells
of their phantom ships can sometimes be
heard off the coast at night

  ghosts or no ghosts were going ashore
there in the morning gerry said stub-
bornly

all night the viking rode to a crude
anchor that angus had improvised
from some spare parts on board the
space-ships designers had never expected
her to lie in water most of the crew
were on deck as soon as it grew light
enough to see ahead of them less than
half a mile away stretched a sandy shore
backed by a line of low hills the island
had a wealth of the yellow vegetation typi-
cal of the mainland of venus so that it
had a more friendly appearance than the
other specks of land which dotted the great
sea and were only bare rock but there
was no sign of life certainly there was
no trace of any city there was not even
an indication of human habitation at all
as the dawn-mists cleared away they could
see that another range of hills stretched
along the horizon some miles behind their
greenish-yellow slopes were clear and sharp
against the cloudy sky beyond and they
were located well in the rear of where the
city had appeared to be in that hasty
glimpse the night before

  ready the landing party gerry com-
manded full armor and equipment
they gently beached the space-ship on
the sloping expanse of sand running her
nose a little way up above the water level
while the light surf lapped her dripping
sides some giant crabs scurried away
across the beach in startled surprise

  want to go ashore angus gerry
asked as mctavishs red bearded face came
up through an escape hatch the big en-
gineer shook his head

  ill just stay aboard here and brood
	planet

over my broken helicopters thanks my
last trip ashore took care of all my wan-
derlust for the present

  gerry took half the vessels crew with
him leaving the other half on guard
closana went with the landing party with
their armor gleaming in the golden light
ray guns and other weapons ready they
tramped up across the loose sand of the
beach beyond the shore line was firmer
ground a field of some low plants that
grew in orderly yellow rows

  ill swallow my ray-tube if this isnt
a field cultivated by man nature was
never that orderly steve brent muttered
gerry shrugged

  lord knows if we ever get those
helicopters fixed im all for a quick return
to earth this planet is certainly no peace-
ful garden of eden and ive had pretty
near all i want of it savissa was the only
place i really liked i wonder whats hap-
pening there now

  well know if anything very exciting
turns up steve said when we started
out on our search after you disappeared
that night i left tanda behind with a
portable radio to keep us posted sort of
figured it was our base on venus and any-
way there was always the chancc you might
wander back there

  great planetoids-i just thought of
something as soon as we get hack to
the ship remind me to radio tanda to tell
rupin-sang that the scaly ones had
learned to use the old sewers and that he
must either block them off or place a heavy
guard there

  for a mile they walked inland across
those odd fields the orderly rows of
plants stretched off to the horizon on bath
sides and then they came to a kind of
level plain the ground before them was
strange looking so strange that gerry
called a halt while he stared down the
slight slope at it

most of the plain was of bare rock
rock that was absolutely smooth and
level without any sign of weathering at
all along the outer edge it was pitted
at regular intervals by what looked like
shallow wells a foot in diameter beyond
that zone were many excavations of many
sizes and shapes all cut down into the solid

stories

rock with the sides perfectly straight and
smooth gerry took off his helmet and
scratched his head

  now what do you make of that

  i know what it looks like to me steve
said it looks just like the foundations
of a city-without the city those round
pits are the anchorages of the outer wall
those square holes are the basements of
tall buildings only-somebody has lifted
the whole city away

  youre crazy gerry growled steve
shrugged

  maybe we all are anyway im going
to take a look into one of those holes

  steve walked quickly forward toward the
nearest of the round pits suddenly just
as he reached the very edge of the zone
of bare rock there was a dull clash of
steel something had seemed to pick steve
up bodily and hurl him backward he
landed flat on his back on the ground his
helmet bouncing off and rolling a few feet
away

  it hit me he shouted

  what did

  i dont know steve sat up and rubbed
his head y know chief it really felt
more as though id just walked squarely
into a solid stone wall

  it has just occurred to me gerry said
slowly that maybe thats exactly what
you did do

  gerry walked forward cautiously a foot
at a time one hand stretched out before
him when he reached a spot on line
with the place where steve had been
stopped his hand encountered something
cool and firm and smooth it was like the
surface of a highly polished stone wall
or a sheet of heavy and invisible glass lie
ran both his hands over it the thing was
continuous and solid there was nothing
visible to the eye and he could see far
ahead of him across the strangely surfaced
rocky plain but there was an impenetrable
barrier blocking the path

  stepping hack a few feet gerry picked
up a pebble and tossed it upward the
stone bounced sharply back as soon as it
came in line with the invisible barrier he
threw the pebble higher and the same thing
happened there was something mysteri-
ous and disquieting about the way the stone
would soar up into the clear air-and then
the golden amazons of venus



sharply bounce back from a point in space
where nothing at all was visible

  magic closana said nervously even
the earth-men of the landing party had
drawn together in a compact group ray-
tubes ready and eyes alert

  gerry moved back a few feet farther
then hurled the stone forward and upward
as high as he could this lime the pebble
did not bounce back it simply vanished
in thin air and then from somewhere
off in the emptiness of space above them
there came the sound of a deep and mock-
ing laughter

as though that first laugh had somehow
eased the necessity for a carefully
enforced silence there came a whole burst
of unseen and eerie merriment there was
a murmur of many voics then it died
away again there was still nothing vis-
ible and the silence was once more un-
broken

  for lords sake lets get out of here
portok gasped this place is ghost
ridden i

  there are no ghosts here little red-
faced man boomed a voice

  the sound had seemed to come from
somewhere overhead from the empty
void above where there was nothing at all
until the cloud canopy was reached many
thousands of feet up one of the vikings
crew bared his teeth in a sudden panic and
lifted his ray-gun to fire blindly upward
before he could pull the trigger there was
a blinding blue flash and a crash like sum-
mer thunder captive lightning the ray-
gun flew from the mans hands and landed
a few feet away its wooden stock badly
charred and its barrel a glowing mass of
fused metal

  let your weapons rest for they are
useless here commanded that same boom-
ing voice from above whence came ye
strangers in odd clothing who have trav-
eled in a ship like a blue whale what
do ye seek here in the outer isles

  gerry stepped forward a few feet ahead
of the group he shouted that they were
a scientific exploring party who had come
from earth in a space-ship there was a
brief period of silence as though men con-
sulted in whispers then the voice called
him again

  you there-the leader the council
of elders will talk with you go fifty paces
to your right to where there are two
white stones and then come forward be-
tween them do not be afraid you will
not be harmed

  are you going to take the chance
chief steve whispered gerry nodded
ill have to

  about fifty yards to his right gerry saw
two white stones they were set some
twelve or fifteen feet apart on the very
edge of the invisible barrier gerry walked
over turned left and then walked squarely
in between the stones he held one arm
protectingly in front of him but this time
his hand did not encounter any barrier in-
stead-he found himself standing under the
arch-way of a gate with a mighty city
spread before him

the city had simply appeared in a
flash with its mighty towers soaring
up to the sky as soon as he stepped over
the outer line of the arch whatever it
was that held the place invisible from out-
side it had ceased to function for him as
soon as he came within the limits of the
outer surface of the walls glancing back
he saw that his companions were still star-
ing blankly at the spot he had just
quitted they were evidently unable to
see either him or any part of the city

  its all right steve he shouted just
hold everybody there till i come back
doors of heavily carved glass slid noise-
lessly out of recesses within the wall to
close the gate through which gerry had
just entered the arch in which he stood
was inside the thickness of the wall faced
with white marble inlaid with designs in
gold ahead he could see a broad avenue
that ran from the gateway down through
the center of the city it was tree lined
and pleasant thronged with people flow-
ers grew in little plots in front of the gold
and white houses small furry animals
dogs were evidently kept as pets they
drowsed on the doorsteps or scampered
about the neat gardens

  half a dozen men were standing around
gerry within the arch of the gate they
were slight in stature though wiry with
heads a little larger than normal and ex-
ceptionally high foreheads their skin bore

a tawny tinge similar to that of the ama-
zons of savissa two of them who imme-
diately took up posts just inside the glass
portals of the gate wore a semi-military
uniform that included a gilded helmet the
others wore white cotton tunics and high
leather shoes it suddenly struck gerry
that this was the first place on venus that
he had visited where the majority of the
citizens did not go heavily armed at all
times perhaps it was a good omen

  one of the men stepped forward a
bearded and gray-haired man who bore a
gold-tipped staff

  i am gool chairman of the council of
elders of moorn he said in the deep voice
that gerry had heard outside the coun-
cil has decided to see you at once you
are the first outsider who has been per-
mitted to enter the city of moorn-white
queen of the outer isles-in countless
generations it would not have been per-
mitted even now if you had been a man of
this planet come with me

they went up a flight of steps and
climbed into a metal car that hung
from an overhead rail supported by col-
umns along the street gool touched a but-
ton and the car shot ahead at high speed
along the overhead mono-rail the old
man who had settled comfortably back on
one of the upholstered seats was faintly
smiling as he watched gerrys face

  you are puzzled stranger he asked
at last

  yes there seemed to be nothing on
the plain but a lot of holes bored in the
rock and now 

  and now you find yourself in the city
of moorn gool said a knowledge of
dimensional control is one of the reasons
why we of this city have lived in peace
and safety for so many centuries while the
rest of the planet is torn by constant wars

  dimensional control gerry said
slowly gool nodded

  yes it is hard to put it into language
that will be clear to one who has no knowl-
edge of our science perhaps i can ex-
plain it by saying that the human eye is a
three-dimensional organism and therefore
capable of perceiving only things that fall
into that same category there are a great
many things in the universe some of the

greatest importance that the ordinary
mans senses are incapable of perceiving
we have learned how to cast a protective
screen of fourth-dimension rays about our
city and the effect is that it becomes com-
pletely invisible to the human eye do i
make myself clear

  not entirely gerry grinned but i
do know that your screen works but
since your science is so far ahead of the
other people of venus why dont you rhle
the entire planet

  the other races are all barbarians
gool said with a sort of disdainful gravity
we prefer to live here in our peaceful
isolation and not bother with them that
is an essential part of our philosophy
the speeding mono-rail car mounted
higher as it neared the center of the city
the track seemed to end on the blank wall
halfway up the tallest of the buildings but
as the car came near a circular doorway
suddenly opened just in time to let it
through they halted in a circular cham-
ber where heavy springs caught and al-
layed the last of the cars momentum and
a pair of gold-helmeted guards saluted
gool as they helped him to alight

  the council is ready and waiting my
lord said one gool nodded over his
shoulder to gerry

  follow me he commanded

  the council of elders of moorn sat at
a u-shaped table in a high-ceilinged room
whose walls were hung with heavy and
very ancient tapestries the dozen mem-
bers of the council were all old men gray-
beards who seemed dwarfed by the high-
backed chairs in which they sat they lis-
tened with grave attention to gerrys ac-
count of what he had seen of conditions
on venus but their austere faces showed
no sign of animation when he again sug-
gested that they should intervene in the
planets affairs

  we are not interested gool said list-
lessly

  suddenly the short-wave alarm in ger-
rys helmet buzzed loudly he pressed
the receiving switch

  listen chief  steve brents voice was
tense and excited as it came from the ear-
phones i just got a message from tanda
back in larr theres hell to pay back
there the scaly ones have in some way
the golden amazons of venvs



managed to storm one of the barrier forts
and now theyre pouring over the borders
of savissa in great hordes theyre armed
with supode rays too

  gerry switched off the radio and leaned
forward with his hands on the carved
table

  now is the time for you to act he
snapped lansa is a mad-man he
plans to overrun all venus if you come
to the aid of the amazons at this time
it will 

  our isolation of centuries is not to
be broken gool interrupted watching
the emotionless faces of the council of
elders he felt as though he were wading
through mud he was getting nowhere
the inertia of these gray-beards was a
leaden and tangible thing

  but if lansa wins he may come after
you he urged your walls are invis-
ible but theyre there i could feel them
with my hands now that lansa has the
equipment to project the supode ray he
may bring them down and 

  we take no part in what goes on out-
side our walls gool repeated firmly we
will give you the metal to repair your
own ship if you and some of your men
wish to return quickly to the mainland
in the meantime we will send you across
in our flying cars that is the most that
we can do

half a dozen flying cars rested on a
broad platform on top of one of the
walls of the city of moorn many bells
were tolling the noonday chimes as gerry
norton led his armored men from the vik-
ing aboard the compact little flying ma-
chines there was room for six men in
each car the pilot and five passengers
only angus and the necessary assistants
had remained behind to repair the space-
ship with the materials supplied by the
men of moorn gerry leaned from his car
to shake hands with gool who was lean-
ing on his gold-tipped staff

  thanks for this much help gerry
said next time we meet ill tell
you 

  we shall not meet again my friend
gool said with a half smile the words
seemed definitely ominous to gerry but
before he could say anything more the old

  man had bowed ceremonially and then
stepped back off the landing platform

  the flying cars of moorn were shallow
bowls of some gleaming blue metal oval
in shape and with three comfortably up-
holstered seats they had no visible means
of propulsion curved windshields of
heavy glass protected the passengers from
the air-blast of swift motion jerry got
in beside the pilot of the leading car who
was a slight and taciturn moomian with
the big head and high forehead of ids race
a complicated control board was fixed in
place before him closana and portok
were in the seat next behind while two
more members of the vikings crew occu-
pied the rear seat

  ready the pilot asked gerry nodded

  the pilot touched a switch on the con-
trol board before him and three globular
dials glowed with an iridescent light the
space-car rose easily from the landing plat-
form moving upward and outward at a
steep angle there was neither noise nor
vibration the city vanished as soon as
they passed outside the zone of dimen-
sional-control on its outer walls looking
back and down gerry saw only the pitted
rock of the foundations far below a cart
was moving toward the beach with some
bars of metal for the viking

  then the next flying car came into sight
as it sped out beyond the walls its nose
came into sight first then the middle sec-
tion finally the whole car one after an-
other the rest of the flotilla took off till
they were flying in a v-shaped formation
like a flock of wild geese

  what kind of power makes these cars
go gerry asked

  iso-electronic rays the pilot replied
shortly not taking his eyes from the indi-
cator board

  and can they be made invisible like the
city 

  yes the dimensional-control lever is
here the pilot pointed at many of the
controls then again lapsed into silence

it was evident that gerry was not go-
ing to be able to have any extended con-
versation with the driver of the car that
might be due to instructions the man had
received from his superiors or simply to
his own nature probably a combination
of both these men of moorn were a


planet stories

cold and self-centered race probably they
were an isolated off-shoot of the original
old ones who had first settled this planet
a group who had managed to retain the
scientific knowledge of their ancestors but
had lost the vigor and fire that are found
in active and vital nations

below them lay the greenish yellow
expanse of the great sea though
these electronic flying cars of moorn trav-
eled with a noiseless smoothness that was
the last word in flying comfort their speed
was much less than that of the viking at
even minimum rocket power the pilots
were holding the flotilla down to a level of
only a few hundred feet the sight of
the vast expanse of rippling waters sliding
past so close below them was a strange ex-
perience to gerry norton who had spent
his life in space-ships that always traveled
at the upper levels where everything be-
low looks like a gigantic patch-work quilt

  scattered islands shouldered their way
upward through the sea ahead and then
sailed past below so utterly smooth and
noiseless was the movement of the elec-
tronic flying cars that they seemed to be
standing motionless while a strong wind
blew against their glass shields and the
surface of the planet unrolled beneath
them it was well into the afternoon be-
fore the familiar mountain ranges border-
ing savissa came into view ahead

  closana was leaning forward on her seat
her eyes eager and youthful in the shadows
of the steel helmet with which she had
been fitted out from the vikings stores
then as the coast line became clearer with
every passing mile she suddenly pointed
ahead and down to two black dots on the
surface of the sea the pilot took one
glance at them and then his hand moved to
the dimensional control lever

  when they first entered the flying cars
gerry had noticed that each one bore a
very realistic appearing metal bird at the
end of a sort of flag-staff that protruded
upward at the bow at the time he had
thought it was simply a form of decora-
tion now he realized that the metal bird
fulfilled a much more useful purpose it
was outside the zone of invisibility and
gave all the pilots something to indicate the
locations of the other cars and avoid col-

  lisions when he glanced back all he
could see was a flock of birds following
them in a wide v the flotilla was keep-
ing formation

as they soared closer to shore the two
black dots gradually took shape as a
pair of good-sized surface craft a black-
hulled raider manned by a crew pf the
scaly ones was hotly engaged with a
wooden savissan patrol boat companies
of amazons crouched behind the high bul-
warks of their warship loosing their ar-
rows in stinging flights explosive bul-
lets crackled around them as the scaly
ones replied with their gas-guns the
boat was equipped with a big charging-
tank for reloading the gas-guns equip-
ment too heavy to be carried by land raid-
ers but possible here the tide of battle
was definitely setting against the amazons
the bodies of many of the golden-haired
feminine warriors lay sprawled in the scup-
pers or scattered on the riven decks

  closanas fists were clenched as she
peered down at the battle on the seas be-
low the decks of the savissan craft were
beginning to smolder and her arrow fire
was weakening closana threw gerry an
agonized glance and he turned to the pilot
beside him	

  is there any way we can strike at that
raider below he asked the moornian
pilot smiled faintly and then handed
gerry a long metal rod that was equipped
with gun-sights and had a sort of rubber
stock a wire trailed away from it and
was attached to the cars power plant be-
neath the control boar it looked like an
odd form of rifle but the metal rod was
solid instead of hollow

  aim-then press the button the taci-
turn moornian said

  gerry brought the strange-looking
weapon to his shoulder and sighted through
a line of rings set in the top he cen-
tered the cross-hairs amidships on the
black-hulled reptilian craft then gently
pressed the switch button set in the stock

  there was a blinding flash of lightning
an instant later came the crashing roar of
thunder momentarily the flying car
rocked under the buffeting of the disturbed
air masses then it steadied down again
on the sea below the battle had come to an
the golden amazons of venus



abrupt end that single blow was enough

  the lightning bolt struck the sea raider
amidships with a blinding flash the metal
hull glowed red hot water steamed about
it the jkfrk shapes of scaly warriors
went spinning off into the sea then the
tank of gas amidships exploded sending a
sheet of blue flame high into the air

  the savissan war-craft rocked violently
on the waves created by the lightning bolt
and the explosion the surviving ama-
zons clung frantically to bullwarks and
rigging to avoid being washed overboard by
the sheet of foam-flecked water that spread
over die decks then as their craft stead-
ied down again they looked up into the
sky all they could see was a flock of
small birds speeding rapidly inland they
lifted their weapons to the sky in salute
a tribute to whatever dark gods had sped
the deadly bolt that wrecked the enemy
craft

  gerry gingerly handed the deadly light-
ning caster back to the pilot

  thats an effective weapon he said
if these flying cars can only stay with us
for a few hours after we arrive at the
city of larr we can probably break up
the attack of the scaly ones and 

  we return to moorn immediately as
soon as we have landed you in larr the
pilot said with cold finality those are
the orders of the council of elders

dusk caught them just as they passed
over the savissan coast line they
saw the gleaming lights of various scat-
tered towns and hamlets below them an
hour later the lights of larr itself came
into view at first they were only a glow
along the horizon then as the flotilla
of flying cars swept nearer the lights of
the city began to take on definite form
and shape closana was again leaning
eagerly forward

  the lights look strange she said so
many of them are unsteady and flicker-
ing r

  gerry norton peered ahead through the
night his own eyes were narrowed and
thoughtful

  those flickering lights you see are ray-
gutis he said at last the city is al-
ready under siege

  before attempting a landing as they

came to the golden city of larr the flo-
tilla of flying cars swept in a wide circle
over the city and its surrounding suburbs
great fires burned in braziers along the
walls other fires had been kindled by the
besiegers dozens of cottages outside the
circuit of the city walls were also aflame
blazing furiously the whole place was
suffused with a ruddy and uneven light
and the observers in the flying cars had a
clear view of the scene below

  behind the battlements and bastions atop
the citys walls crouched the golden ama-
zons of the garrison loosing their storms
of arrows at the swarming besiegers below
them other tawny-skinned crews worked
the alta-ray tubes that belched blasts of
blue flame at regular intervals wherever
the blue beams struck the ground was
blackened while the twisted and charred
shapes of scaly ones writhed in brief
agony the myriad brazen trumpets of
larr sounded hasty rallying calls or else
tossed staccato signals from one part of
the defences to another

  the hordes of lansa had invested the
city on three sides the marsh-land on the
far border of the city protecting that side
from direct assault groups of scaly ones
took shelter behind tree trunks and mounds
of earth and any other possible cover fir-
ing their gas-guns up at the battlements
in an effort to lessen the arrow fire others
crept forward behind movable metal
shields heavy-caliber gas-guns inched
slowly forward behind wooden mantlets
that bristled with arrows and hurled their
larger explosive bullets up at the walls
wherever they struck there was a puff of
yellow dust and a scarred place on the
stones reptilian trumpets beat with a
staccato thunder as lansa kept in touch
with his various divisions not all the
advantage was with the besiegers however
even as gerry watched a blue heat-ray
struck full on one of the big gas-guns
and blew it up with a shattering crash

  in all but one particular the battle was
a large-scale edition of the type of as-
sault diat the scaly ones had often tried
against various barrier forts in the past
the difference was that they now pos-
sessed the supode ray which lansa had
been able to prepare for his forces long
beams of the familiar murky reddish light
	planet

were continually playing upon the walls of
larr

  the effect of the supode rays seemed
to be less serious than gerry would have
expected perhaps lansas ray-guns were
lacking in power because inefficiently made
perhaps the yellow stones that formed
the walls of larr contained some radio-
active substance that partially neutralized
the rays the walls were crumbling into
powder in dozens of small spots as the
searching beams of the rays found a weak
point or flaw in ijhe stone but there was
none of the wholesale collapse that lansa
had probably hoped to achieve

  the whole scene below was like a ma-
cabre nightmare the fires flashed and
crackled and the explosive bullets of the
scaly ones twinkled like fire-flies through
the drifting smoke red light glinted on
the points of flying arrows savissan trum-
pets blared defiance to the thunder of rep-
tilian drums most dramatic of all silent
but terribly deadly was the duel of the
ray-casters as the red beams of the attack-
ers and the blue rays of the defenders
darted back and forth through the night
like the rapiers of fencing giants

the flotilla of flying cars darted down
to the plaza in front of the tower of
the arrow the pilots kept them invisible
until they had landed lest the nervous crew
of a defending ray-machine blast them be-
fore their identity was known as soon
as the dimensional-control was switched
off there were cries of alarm and a few
hasty arrows glanced harmlessly off the
earthmens armor then closana shouted
reassuringly and they were recognized

  a little later gerry and a few of his offi-
cers stood with rupin-sang on one of the
balconies of the great tower the aged
king of savissa wore full armor though
in the shadows of his gilded helmet his
face looked old and gray and tired be-
side them a squad of the golden amazons
worked a long-range ray-tube that was fir-
ing at the rear areas of the reptilian posi-
tion the muscles of the feminine war-
riors rippled beneath their tawny skins as
they swung the heavy controls of the big
ray-machine

  they came against one of our barrier

stories

forts from the rear in great numbers
rupin-sang said wearily i cannot im-
agine how they had managed to get so
many men in behind our lines  

  probably brought them under water in
that submarine they used when they took
me captive gerry said brought them
through in relays i should have sent you
warning to block the river channel against
that craft but i never thought lansa would
strike so quickly

  at least we had enough warning to
prepare for the defense of the city after
they broke through the frontier rupin-
sang said we called in all the surround-
ing troops we sent the very young and
the very old the ill and the crippled back
to comparative safety in the hills by way
of secret trails through the swamps if
the walls will stand against the new rays
the scaly ones are using we should be able
to hold out for a long time

  the armor of my men is proof against
either rays or explosive bullets gerry
told him and our ray-guns are superior
to those that lansa has been able to make
well use my men as shock troops to beat
back any particularly pressing attack be-
tween us we can hang on until lansa gets
tired of the siege

  i hope youre right rupin-sang said
gloomily but i recall the old prophecy
it is in my mind that the end of the golden
city of larr is at hand and that the sands
of my nation run very low however-
we will fight to the end

  no bunch of half-lizards led by a white
renegade is going to lick me gerry
rasped

a week later gerry norton was less
confident haggard and unshaven
he stalked into an inner room and tossed
his helmet clattering on the table his ar-
mor was badly dented by the impact of
many explosive bullets and one forearm
was burned where a supode ray had mo-
mentarily pierced between the chinks of the
armor

  all right steve gerry said wearily
its your watch go up on the walls and
take over

  anything new  steve brent asked sit-
ting up on the cot where he had been sleep-
ing and running both hands through his
the golden amazons of venus	

tousled crop of sandy hair his freckled
face was as lined and drawn as gerrys
own

  another of the bastions on the west
wall came down under the rays but were
holding the breach all right with archers
and a portable ray-caster hurry and get
up there like a good fellow i left por-
tok in charge and hes dead on his feet

  i am not so damn much alive myself
steve muttered but he put on his helmet
and went clanking off up the corridor

  gerry sat down heavily on a bench at
the moment too tired even to take off his
armor the city of larr still held out-
but that was all that could be said the
scaly ones still pressed the assault day
and night without ceasing the once
mighty walls of yellow stone were crum-
bling under the constant attack of the walls
while the defense of the steadily widening
breaches put an added strain on the dwin-
dling numbers of the garrison

  if oniy the viking would come her
duralite hull would withstand either rays
or explosives and her own powerful ray-
tubes should be able to blast the attacking
artillery out of existence ad thereby raise
the siege but he could not raise the space-
ship on the radio that was the thing that
worried gerry most of all tanda had
been trying at hourly intervals for days
but he could not get any answer from
mctavish

  at last gerry stretched out on the cot
that steve had quitted and almost instantly
went to sleep it seemed only a moment
later that he awoke to find portok the
martian shaking him by the shoulder
gerry laboriously raised himself up on one
elbow shaking his head to clear his brain
so strong were the bonds of sleep that sev-
eral seconds passed before his brain
grasped the meaning of the words that
portok was shouting in his ear

 chief cant you hear me  the
whole western wall has come down carry-
ing all the ray-tubes with it the scaly
ones are in the city

gerry seized his helmet and weapons
from the table where he had thrown
them and dashed out of the room from
one of the balconies of the arrow tower
he could see the swift disaster that had

come upon the city of larr the cease-
less unrelenting play of lansas supode
ray machines had finally weakened the
citys western wall until the whole rampart
had collapsed

  the once towering wall was now only a
long mound of rubble the companies of
scaly ones nearest the wall had been
buried in the debris when it fell but fresh
hordes were pouring forward with a shrill
yelping the amazon archers defending
the wall from above had been mainly
crushed in the wreckage reserve regi-
ments were hurrying into place at the
double bow strings twanging and long
golden hair streaming out behind them but
there was one loss that could not be re-
placed all the alta-ray machines on that
wall were shattered and broken

  the despairing courage of larrs femi-
nine defenders was not enough to hold that
mile-long pile of rubbish whose sloping
sides could be easily climbed by the swarm-
ing hordes from giri-vaaka the ama-
zons were falling back all along the line
the retreat was a slow and stubborn one
but it was steady such of the alta-ray
machines as could be brought to bear upon
the shattered wall from other portions of
the fortifications swept the advancing
scaly ones with blue blasts that tore gap-
ing holes in their ranks but there were not
enough of them the firelight gleamed on
the armor of a few of the vikings men
who were fighting with the rear-guard
their ray-guns stabbing viciously into the
reptilian ranks as they fell back the
drums of the scaly ones took on a deep-
mouthed bellow of triumph and the brazen
trumpets of larr were the voice of a for-
lorn and fading hope

  rupin-sang appeared on the balcony be-
side gerry leaning his gnarled old hands
on the rail he was smiling as though
final disaster had at least brought a relief
from strain

  this is the end of the city of larr
he said the ancient prophecy of jeddah-
khana comes true after all save yourself
and your men while you can my friend

  cant we all escape through the swamps
and put up a better fight in the hills
gerry asked rupin-sang shook his head

  no my friend the last survivors will
do that when all is over but we will de-


planet stories

fend larr to the end-street by street and
house by house-as the tradition of sa-
vissa we are the last descendants of the
old ones we may die but we will do
it with honor

  the swift advance of lansas men bit
deeply into the city halfway from the
shattered wall to the central plaza sur-
rounding the great tower before it was
checked at a line of hasty barricades
there was bitter house-to-house fighting
all across the city gerry knew that the
stand at the barricades could not be sus-
tained for very long the advance of the
scaly ones had at the moment outdis-
tanced their supode ray casters and their
heavy caliber gas-guns for the present
the amazon arrows held them checked
the advance was sure to resume as soon
as lansas heavy weapons could be brought
up again

it was a hopeless fight-and yet gerry
could not bring himself to leave partly
it was his affection for the grief-stricken
but indomitable closana that held him
there partly it was the sheer courage of
the amazons gallant fight against such
heavy odds that kept him in the battle line
by some standards the affair was none of
his business but he could not quit now
however-he had not the right to hold his
men in the stricken city if they wished to
leave as he located the various members
of the vikings crew in the disorganized
amazon ranks he gave each one permis-
sion to escape from the city through the
eastern marshes portoks reaction was
typical

  run from these snake-skinned dev-
ils the little martian panted hoarsely his
ruddy face gaunt and his eyes sunken deep
in their sockets not while i can still
stand im staying with the rear guard-
as long as there is one

  new fires had been started by the vic-
tory-drunk reptilians fires within the
walls the lurid glow of burning houses
made the night hideous fully a third of
the city was in flames by now and only
the easterly wind kept the flames from
driving the defenders away from those
portions of the city that they still held

  by noon the next day the tale was nearly
all told the savissans now held less than

a third of their city a v-shaped sector
with the arrow tower at its apex the
murky beams of supode rays were now
continually playing against the walls of the
great tower itself and small cascades of
pulverized rock kept sliding off the face
of the stone work as the weaker parts be-
gan to decompose under the steady impact
of the rays and still the fight went on

  gerry liad forgotten what it was like
to lie down and rest he was leaning in
an angle of the wall actually asleep on his
feet when chester sand from the viking
hurried across to him

  rupin-sang wants to see you down in
the garden right away chief sand
panted you and steve brent both

  all right get steve gerry growled
he sighed and tightened his belt and went
wearily down the steps to the lower floor
of the tower

the pleasant walled garden behind the
tower was a very different place from
the stop gerry had seen when he first came
to savissa the explosive bullets of the
scaly ones had ripped up many of the
trees and shattered the marble statues a
heap of debris fallen from above lay along
the base of the tower wall while more was
constantly trickling down as the murky
beams of the supode rays criss-crossed
overhead the bodies of dead amazons
were scattered here and there on the tram-
pled grass dense clouds of acrid smoke
from the burning city swirled down over
the garden wall

  closana was waiting in the garden her
armor dim and battered her left arm
was heavily bandaged but she still carried
a naked sword in her right hand

  i was told that you wanted me she
said gerry shook his head

  no it was your father who sent for
vie just then steve and chester sand
came across the garden a faint suspicion
began to stir in gerrys mind

  where is rupin-sang he demanded

  sand hesitated and cleared his throat
his eyes were shifty then gerry heard
a slight sound behind him he spun
around-and looked squarely into the muz-
zle of a ray-tube held by lansa himself

  they had been neatly trapped lansa
and a dozen of his men had come up
the golden amazons of venvs



through the sewers and slain the amazon
guards posted there

  droptyour weapons lansa snapped
gerry shrugged and obeyed and the others
followed his example there was a tri-
umphant smile on the renegades saturnine
face i am glad you were not killed in
the fighting norton he said because
you and brent and the girl will make very
valuable hostages for me when your space-
ship eventually returns

  gerry turned and stared at chester
sand the vikings safety officer was
pale but he met the other mans glance
with a sort of weak defiance gerrys lip
curled

  so you are the rat who slugged me that
time i caught olga in the radio room he
said i should have known it i seem
to have left several loose ends i should
have watched but ill fix you for this some
day and 

  you wont be fixing anybody any more
norton lansa said grimly after ive
used you to get possession of the viking
youll die in the torture chambers at vaaka-
hausen thanks to my good friend sands
i also know the location of the invisible
city that too i will attend to but all
in good time guards bind and gag the
prisoners  

  he never finished the sentence there
was a sharp hiss and a thud a narrow
steel point stood a hands breadth out be-
yond his throat a wondering expression
came into his eyes then his knees buckled
and he went down on the trampled grass
across the garden still holding the air-
gun from which he had shot the long steel
slug stood sarnak of luralla

the scaly ones went for their weap-
ons but a vengeful throng of the out-
law brood of the dragon came pouring up
from below on the heels of their leaders
there was no thought of quarter between
these hereditary foes there was a short
sharp fight-and then the last of lansas
raiding part died in the shadow of the
wall sarnak came striding forward his
hand outstretched and a cheerful smile on
his broad face

  it seems that i came in very good time
my friends he said

a-planet stories-winter

  perfect gerry grinjjed but what
does your coming mean

  it means that the hour of deliverance
is at hand when lansa brought his full
force eastward against savissa it gave us
the opportunity we have been needing for
generations we of the dragons teeth
rose against the scanty garrisons he left
behind and put them to the sword the
mass of the people joined us then when
the chances of victory looked so strong
that hope overcame the despair born of
generations of oppression now the green
folk of giri have thrown off the yoke of
the invader at last and thousands of them
are marching this way to take the army of
the scaly ones in the rear

  but how did you come to arrive in the
garden at this particular moment gerry
asked

  the forces of giri have forded the
river and are marching overland but i
came ahead with a hundred picked cavalry
mounted on swift saddle-dolphins we saw
a crude type of under-water craft moving
in this direction and followed it at a dis-
tance you know the rest after bring-
ing down the sentries that lansa had posted
below we left our dolphins and our water
helmets down at the main drain and crept
up through the passages to this place
when do you think the rest of the
green folk will come closana asked

  within a few more hours princess
they will not be in time to save your city
but they will be in time to protect the
survivors

  if there are any of us left by then
the girl said bitterly gerry suddenly
pointed upward

  look there the worst is over now
he shouted the viking was streaking
across the sky in a burst of yellow rocket
flame

  the big space-ship dropped down over
the beleaguered city her powerful ray-
tubes flashing other murky beams
stabbed up to meet her but her duralite
hull was impervious to the rays and angus
kept her high enough so that the helicop-
ters were protected by the curve of the
hull one after another the ray casters
and heavy gas-guns of the scaly ones
went out of action when the ships
beanrs had silenced the artillery and com-

menced to rip black holes in the rmks of
the reptilian warriors themselves they
suddenly broke and fled

the war drums of the scaly ones
were silent at last while the trumpets
of savissa raised a long-drawn paean of
vengeance out of the ruined and flaming
city fled the reptilian men while troops
of swift-footed amazons hung on their
flanks and rear with twanging bows back
across the plains toward the border they
fled-and ran squarely into the grim thou-
sands of the green people who tore them
apart with the savagery of an oppressed
race just finding their souls again the
few that survived out of the powerful
army that lansa the mad earth-man had
brought eastward to attack savissa were a
handful who fled back across the land of
giri and vanished into the desolate vaaka
marshes from which their people had first
emerged generations before

  the golden city was hopelessly afire
past saving and the survivors gathered on
a level field outside the northern wall gerry
and sarnak and rupin-sang were standing
together as the viking dropped down to
land on the edge of the field mctavish
stepped out red bearded and jovial but
showing die effects of sleepless nights him-
self

  sorry we couldnt get here sooner he
said but weve been working night and
day to make proper repairs with that queer
metal the people of moorn gave us we
got your radio messages but couldnt re-
ply because the ships sending set is broken
and i figured the helicopters were more im-
portant repairs

  in a few brief words gerry told mc-
tavish of the fight in the garden the
big scot beamed hrs pleasure an did
they get that slinking she-devil of an olga
along with the rest of the carrion he
asked

  gerry shook his head no she wasnt
there at least we didnt see her it
wasnt likely though that she would come
she probably remained back in vaaka-
hausen

  mctavish frowned his disappointment
ah weel he shrugged ye canna have
everthing

  dont worry mctavish sarnak

grinned well probably have her in a few
hours a force of savissans and green
men have already left to clean up vaaka-
hausen

  gerry grinned good theres one
thing i would like to suggest i loathed
lansing as much as any of you but he is a
white man and i dislike thinking that he
may be hauled off and tossed into a com-
mon grave with the rest of the scaly ones
lets go to the garden and see that his
body has at least a half-way decent inter-
ment

  the rest of the party agreed to this and
they made their way back to the garden
they went down the steps leading to it
then all stopped in surprise the bodies of
the slain scaly men and lansa were gone

  mctavish rubbed his eyes unbelievingly
what kind of devilment is this he
whispered sarnak shook his head slowly
i dont understand unless the retreat-
ing forces found them and carried them
along with them they were all dead of
that im sure

  lansing too inquired mctavish sus-
piciously

  gerry laughed lansing never walked
away from here unless as a ghost i saw
him go down and men with an arrow
transfixing their throats dont do much
walking

  but the big scot didnt seem entirely
convinced and as they walked away he
was still shaking his great shaggy head in
doubt

  with the strain of the siege over at last
many of the garrison had simply dropped
to the ground and gone to sleep where
they fell gerry was watching the flames
sweep over the last of the city for a
long time the arrow tower remained
standing above the sea of fire but then
it began to tip faster and faster it fell
till it came down in a shower of sparks
closana dropped her head in her hands but
old rupin-sang touched his daughter on
the shoulder

  save your grief girl he said it is
true that the golden city of our fathers
no longer exists but there was a second
part to the prophesy that after the great
disaster the people of savissa would have
a re-birth a message that just came
through from those of our people who are
the golden amazons of venus	

hidden in the hills tells me that-of ten
children who have been born since we sent
all the non-combatants out of the city-
seven have been boys the curse has been
lifted from our race

two days later even before the ashes
of larr were cool working parties of
amazons began to clear away the ruins
to prepare for the building of a new city
sarnak of luralla had already returned
across the river giri to supervise the re-
building of his own land angus mc-
tavish came up to where rupin-sang and
gerry stood in front of the kings tent

  tests all complete chief he said
that material we got in moorn is all
right

  i dont suppose theres any way of
thanking them for it

  the big scot shook his head slowly tug-
ging at his beard the city isnt there
any more

  what do you mean

  just that its gone we heard the bells
a few hours after you left and then we
never heard them again you can walk
clean across the plain where the city stood
sand from the beach is drifting into the
holes that held the wall foundations and
grass is already beginning over the rest
of the place    its gone thats all

  they were queer folk the people of
moorn gerry said moodily i sup-
pose they were afraid they might get
dragged into the affairs of the planet in
spite of themselves and simply moved the
whole city off to some distant and unknown
planet

  but how could they do that mc-
tavish said gerry shrugged

  ask me another how could they
make the place invisible we know they
did that we dont know how much further
their science went anyway-im going
to be glad to get back to earth for a while

i	guess were ready to start

  he turned to look at closana for a mo-
ment the girl had laid aside her battered
armor for her customary bright loin cloth
and golden breast plates she shook back
her long golden hair and faced him with
a smile

  want to come back to earth with me
closana he asked

  either that-or the ship goes back
without its captain she said quietly gerry
laughed

  darling i feel sorry for any earth-
woman who ever concludes youre some
shy little stranger she can patronize well
-the trails of interplanetary space are
long and wed better get going all

captain mccausland which has just been

well this morning he seems depressed
and the difficulties of this expedition are
weighing on him thats all for today
this is -lop the interplanetary expedi-
tion ship goddard on the exploring ex-
pedition to pluto your reporter paulette
de vries speaking interplanetary time
o-six-o-o may  

  the girl snapped the key of her micro-
phone off and turned angrily to the young
man who had tapped her on the shoulder
what do you mean by interrupting my
broadcast adam longworth

  the tall young man was frowning at
her you know the crew listens in on
these broadcasts dont you

  well what am i supposed ter do about
that give three cheers

  listen paulette on an expedition as
dangerous as this is it right to let the crew
know the captain is feeling depressed or
doubtful i didnt mean to make you
sign off though

  i signed off because i was through
dont flatter yourself trouble with you
is you try to run everybodys business
 thought you might have got over that
in the ten years since i knew you in
school but you havent trying to keep me
out of the control room so i wouldnt hurt
myself  wake up mr longworth this
is  youre still living back in the
nineteen-hundreds when womans place
was in the home

  longworth glanced at a bandage around
the girls left wrist paulette reddened

  all right i slipped and sprained my
wrist so what so you have my things
moved to another cabin where ill be
more comfortable youre an interfering
old woman mr longworth youre hope-
less 

  longworth reddened uncomfortably

very well paulette ill stop interfering
as you call it but really you ought to
stop referring to the captain in such a
manner as to break down the morale of the
expedition

  the girl glared at him ill take or-
ders about that kind of thing from cap-
tain mccausland and nobody else and i
dont think the man im going to marry
will censor what i have to say

  adam longvvorths face set as he stood
for a moment irresolute then as paulette
said nothing more he turned and left the
cabin outside he paused gazing down
the long main corridor of the space ship
toward the open focastle lock where the
crew lolled in the month-long idleness of
space-voyaging he frowned strode off to
find captain mccausland

apt ain mccausland - old
steel-wall as he was known in the
league of planets space service - was
poring over the course plotted on the chart
table the handsome saturnine face and
straight back were those of a youth but
he was forty-five and had twenty years of
service behind him and had won the honor
medals of three planets he was so ab-
sorbed that he did not notice the mate till
longworth touched his arm

  yes he said turning round with a
pair of dividers in his hand

  it can wait sir if youre busy
mccausland looked at him out of cold
efficient eyes speak up

  its the crew sir you know how
these long runs are months with nothing
to do nothing to see

  there was a flicker around the cap-
tains mouth that might have been amuse-
ment trouble

  adam looked startled oh no nothing
yet i just wanted to head off trouble
before it started sir you heard miss
devries broadcast just now

  captain mccausland nodded and this
time the smile of amusement was definitely
present i think the word was de-
pressed wasnt it and youre afraid it
will throw the crew into a panic and theyll
turn the ship around on us and head for
home is that it mr longworth

  adam wishing he were anywhere but
just there and wilting visibly under the
	planet

sarcastic gaze of the captain plunged
desperately ahead well sir i took the
liberty of asking her not to do it again   
she said she was taking orders only from
you    that is    im sorry sir i didnt
know you were going to  

  to be married you mean well why
not he smiled again the ceremony
will take place as soon as we come back
from this expedition that gives her a
certain amount of privilege you under-
stand his face turned suddenly grave
and his voice a trifle sharp moreover
miss devries is here as radio reporter
for the interplanetary broadcasting i
want you to understand mr mate that
ill have no interference with her in-
stead of chasing bugaboos suppose you
check the course through the planetoid belt
ill leave you with it that will give you
something real to worry about for a
change

  adam stared hopelessly after his re-
treating back damnation everything
had seemed to go wrong since the begin-
ning of this voyage the harder he tried
to prove himself worthy of the appoint-
ment as second-in-command to old steel-
wall the worse things went with a
shrug he turned doggedly to the chart
work

  two hours later he stepped over to the
chart-room port and gazed out into the
velvet blue-black of space where the thou-
sand suns of the milky way burned across
the horizon it was no use he was go-
ing to have to make a fool of himself
again

  but could he help it  captain mccaus-
land had certainly asked him to check the
course through the planetoid belt perhaps
he would forget now and not ask about
the checking operation but if he did
certainly walter mccausland couldnt
have been wrong yet the figures-
adam studied his work sheet again shak-
ing his head

  finished the checking longworth
the voice startled him so that he jumped

  yes sir shall i take over the watch
sir

  little early arent you  what do you
think of the course mister

  adam hesitated

  it seems    likely to get us there sir

stories

  mccauslands eyes became points
are you by any chance evading my ques-
tion ill repeat it it was-what do you
think of the course  what is your
opinion 

  adam gulped here it was

  there seems to be a fault in it sir
im sorry

  indeed the tone was sarcastic
elucidate mister mate

  it takes us up out of the plane of the
ecliptic then back again beyond the
planetoid belt thats very good sir and
quite sate but didnt you omit the fuel con-
sumption factor the course as plotted
gives two shifts of forty-five degrees each
or half a complete stop as far as fuel is
concerned it would cut down the amount
of fuel available for exploration on pluto
to-well here are the figures a ive
worked them out wed have about
enough for two or three landings but
if we went right through the danger belt
of the planetoids as originally planned we
would save enough fuel to really explore
the planet we have to explore thor-
oughly if were going to find beryllium
there it wont lie on the surface why
its hardly worth going on at all if we
cant do any more exploring than that
   thats my opinion sir and i didnt
volunteer it and i ask your pardon in
advance

the great space captain smiled easily
no need to beg my pardon at all
at first glance one would think you had
the right of it but i just happen to have
gone into the matter a little deeper you
understand the reasons behind this voyage 
well suppose that after having been away
for two years we come back right on sched-
ule but without a load of beryllium with-
out having found any trace of it what
will happen the league of planets
simply orders out another expedition bet-
ter equipped and we go down as having
failed

  but captain in two years there may
not be enough light alloys left on the three
planets to build another ship as big as this
the service to mars will have to be stopped
long before that the lithium mines there
cant operate unless the water supply from
venus is maintained
expedition to pluto	

  well what of it nobody likes to
work in that martian colony

  adam caught his breath

  but how aro the atomic motors that do
all the work going to operate without the
lithium from mars

  and what of that even it would be
temporary just a few months or years
till another expedition could be sent out
you take things too seriously wthat is
there to prove that some other method of
armoring space-ships wont be found
beryllium may not be necessary after all

  perhaps youre right adam was still
skeptical but is it likely sir youve
been on the space run so long you havent
kept up with chemistry the armor
against meteorites now is so thick that any
metal but beryllium would double the
weight of the vessel and even with these
seven million horsepower buvier-manleys
we couldnt make the run from venus to
mars why sir it would mean the end of
the lithium mines it would mean the end
of atomic power and wed have to go back
to the barbarism of the twentieth century
when they ran everything by electricity
from waterfalls

  captain mccausland raised ah athletic
hand spare me that mister mate i
have heard it at approximately a hundred
banquets before starting out on this ex-
pedition yes we carry the fate of the
world and all that we have to find
beryllium or else the mars mines cant be
run and the atomic motors stop i could
sing it in my sleep but suppose we do
take chances and get this ship wrecked
wont the world have to go back to bar-
barous electric power after all for my
part i think some of those people in the
twentieth century probably had a good
time

  adam was silent there was something
in the captains reasoning he felt yet he
adam longworth could not but feel that
the issue was a desperately serious one for
every inhabitant of the three worlds-
earth venus and mars-belonging to the
planetary league the entire known sup-
ply of beryllium the precious light strong
metal that was alone suitable for the
armor of space ships had been exhausted
all that remained was in the hulls of the
few dozen ships carrying water from

venus to mars and from the arid deserts
of mars bringing to earth the equally
precious lithium which was the only mate-
rial with which atomic motors could be
powered

  every year in spite of the best of care
one or two space ships would be wrecked
-caught in the suns gravitational field or
lost through some small error of naviga-
tion soon there would be no more space
ships and no more could be built each
of the outer planets had been explored in
turn-each but the last the outermost and
most distant pluto they were on their
way there now  if they could not make it-

  very well sir he said aloud i see
your point will you take over the con-
trols at the change of course

  ill take over now report in two
hours    one more thing longworth
youre young damn young to be first
mate on this expedition you know you
were a last-minute choice because of an
accident to a much more experienced and
from what ive seen so far a much bet-
ter man make the most of your chance
but dont forget im captain here i cant
go into my reasons for everything i do
thats all mister mate

c ttello earth this is paul-

  	ette de vries speaking aboard
-lop space-ship goddard for the last
two days we have been running along the
first leg of the angle that will lift us over
the dangerous belt of tiny planets thirty
million miles beyond mars in a few
minutes the ships motors will be started
to turn our course again-straight for
pluto im going to turn you over to the
microphone in the motor compartment and
let you listen as the seven-million-horse-
power atomics take hold jake burcliall
is in charge down there at the motors   
ready jake take it away

     thats all folks were on the
new course with the engines shut off and
well coast along for eight months at a
speed of two miles a second  miles a
minute  miles an hour toward pluto
nothing for anyone to do-a nice vacation
for eight months were giving a costume
ball folks its all we can think of it
wont be much of a ball though as im the
only woman aboard im going to lend
planet stories

some of the space-men some of my
dresses- crash

  what was that quick-i

  she got the answer and went on

  its all right just one of the incidents
of interplanetary navigation hit by a
meteorite out here above the planetoid
zone and close to jupiter meteorites are
more common heres mr ivayland one
of the junior officers with a report
whats the damage mr ivaylandt it is
folks back on earth we surely got it tluit
time the meteorite penetrated right
through the twenty-inch beryll-steel armor
of our hull into compartment eighteen
the whole wall of the hull is crushed in
there weve lost a few hundred cubic feet
of air but the doors are closed and our
air supply is safe heres first mate
longworth just back from compartment
eighteen he says theyll leave the com-
partment as it is and build a tunnel of thin
metal through it to reach the five compart-
ments toward the stern

  folks can you imagine the shock of
that meteorite its only a foot through
and weighs five hundred pounds if it had
been one of the planetoids our whole hull
would be crushed now captain mccaus-
land turned our course to avoid the plane-
toid zone entirely and does that prove he
was right it does and how well
folks its been a long day and an exciting
one this is -lop space-ship goddard

adam had returned from the damaged
compartment in time to catch the
close of the broadcast as he was stripping
off the space-suit in which he was making
the examination dog-tired he had just
switched off the light preparatory to
turning in when the light and buzzer
flashed at the door

  its me jake came a voice

  the first mate switched on the light
and called  come in

  a small man his face seamed by a thou-
sand wrinkles slipped through the door
almost furtively and stood twisting his
hands in the audition helmet which
enabled him to hear in the engine room
above the noise of the motors

  didnt think youd be in bed so soon

mr adam he apologized but you
always was an early retirer i remember
when i had you on the training ship-he-
he-he he ended on a kind of nervous
little giggle and adam looked at him
sharply

  yes i remember i couldnt cork off
for a minute without hearing someone
pounding on the door and you yelling
its jake burchall time to get up 
his face sobered you didnt come here
to talk about old times jake whats on
j our mind 

  well you know how one thing and
another gets around on a long run like
this i didnt know but maybe there was
something i could help you about sort of
he-he-he

  afraid not jake everything on hand
is up to me you can tell me one thing
though i was just in from the mars run
when i found my name posted for this
expedition and i never did hear whose
place i got as first mate on this trip do
you know who it was

  didnt nobody tell you that it was
blagovitch

  why hes one of the most cautious
men in the service what happened to
him

  bruk his foot he-he-he there was
some said he did it on purpose

  but what could old steel-wall-that
is why did the captain pick him in the
first place

  well mr adam theres a lot of
things about this trip aint the same as an
ornary run i wonder myself sometimes
the capn he picks a course way out of
the ecliptic to dodge planetoids he didnt
stand one chance in a million of hitting
anyhow and he picks him a mighty cau-
tious mate and then he picks him a young
mate when the other one cant go whats
he fraid of

  hes afraid of failing thats all jake
he-he-he well maybe im a old
fool id say it was more like he was
fraid of succeeding

ulc for entering the atmosphere of pluto
were falling rapidly toward the planet

i con only see half of it filling the entire
horizon the color is almost exactly that
of a pearl in moonlight white with blue
lights and absolutely featureless sunlight
out here is indescribably weak our spec-
troscope handled by professor reuter
shows the atmosphere is high in fluorine
with traces of argon and outside that a
thin belt a very thin belt of helium and
hydrogen i told you all that the other
day we have accurate temperature read-
ings now folks and what they say is 
degrees belcno zero which is plenty chilly
you could drive a nail with a butter ham-
mer at that temperature folks and it
means we will have to do our exploring by
diving since the whole surface of the
planet will be covered perhaps miles deep
by liquid gases cant tell till we get
there once we do get in however these
talks will temporarily cease folks ill be
sorry because ive enjoyed them and ive
enjoyed hearing from all of you back on
earth so many million miles away but
ill be back and so will all the crew and
its heroic captain you may remember-
stand by were in the hydrogen layer
now its misty streaming past the ports
so i can hardly see anything i must sign
off now this is -lop spaceship god-

  adam longworth crouched motionless
the muscles bulged along his arms shoul-
der and neck quivered with tension and
perspiration stood in tickling beads on his
skin his eyes were fixed on the control
panel before him on either side was a
quartermaster at a set of controls and be-
hind the three stood captain mccausland
calm and watchful

  adams hand moved rapidly and a
quivering needle stood still on a dial

  three gravities insufficient

  the captains finger found a red but-
ton on the portable signal panel that made
a three-inch medallion on the left breast
of his uniform throughout the ship
there was a flash of red lights loudspeak-
ers echoed his stand by for five gravities

the quartermasters flung long levers
the motors boomed braking the speed
of the goddards fall toward the surface

to plutk	

captain mccausland slumped to the accel-
eration and recovered the air-speed indi-
cator crept toward the bottom of the dial
and had almost reached it when a loud-
speaker twanged nasally visibility fifty
feet liquid surface forty feet-going
down-afloat sir

  adam killed the motor with a plunge
of his finger and his ears rang in the sud-
den stillness

  thank you gentlemen said the cap-
tain perfect landing mister long-
worth relieve the navigation watch and
report to the chart-room in ten minutes
adam saluted said a few words to the
quartermasters and went out with them to
the focastle the men off watch were just
unstrapping themselves from their bunks
jake burchall stepped up

  do i take up the new watch mr
adam

  two hours from now look here
jake theres something i wish youd do
yes sir

  adam lowered his voice

  did you hear the report fluorine all
through this planet our ports are glass
and fluorine acts on glass theyre thick
of course and have layers of plastic but
it will wear them through eventually
weve got to think of something to do
about it and i think i have the answer
remember compartment eighteen shell
be flooded suppose when youre posting
that watch you get into a space suit and
slide in there dont go outside but cut
loose some of the mica lining around the
break when you get it you can make
some mica sheets for the helmet view-
ports of your space suit then get into
compartment eighteen again and try it out
im no chemical expert but mica should
insulate the view-ports on the helmet and
if itll do that it will insulate the view-
ports of the whole ship report to me pri-
vately i dont want to make a fool of
myself if professor reuter already has
some other scheme worked out

  jake grinned in understanding

  yes sir he-he-he hope he hasnt
in the chart room when adam arrived
he found a small gathering perkins the
chemists was there so was professor
reuter the astronomical man a couple of
assistants and captain mccausland look-
	plan et

ing extremely grave thoughtful but ruffled

  well longworth he said youre
just in time to order out the navigation
watch and set the course back to earth
adam was aghast not really

  ask these gentlemen he indicated
the scientists

  professor reuter cleared his throat but
it was perkins who spoke at least we
cannot remain here the fluorine here
will gradually but certainly cut through
the glass in this ship

dam flushed he burst out but
you knew there was fluorine a month
ago didnt anyone-

  captain mccausland raised his hand
please

  professor reuter explained to tell
the truth there was some discussion at
that time i am afraid i must confess
myself considerably at fault dr perkins
at that time urged that the expedition re-
turn and install quartz ports on the god-
dard at that time i judged the tempera-
ture would be about what it is minus 
and at that figure fluorine would not be
present in the liquid portion of the atmos-
phere but would exist as a gas and there-
fore would not make contact with our ports
while diving

  i warned you it would be in solution
remarked dr perkins

  yes professor reuter a big man
with folds of fat hanging from his cheeks
pursed his lips and blew through them
at the time i must confess i really must
confess that i failed to consider the fact
that the enveloping upper atmosphere of
the planet would cause the surface tem-
perature to be lower than that in the
atmosphere itself as a result it is just
cold enough to hold a certain amount of
fluorine in solution in this cold ocean-
and in a nut-shell we must turn
back said adam he appealed to cap-
tain mccausland isnt there anything
aboard ship with which we could insulate
the ports scientists always made diffi-
culties he thought an old space captain
like mccausland would not be so hard to
down

  we can try putting divers in space-
suits with double-thickness glass in the
ports that would last a couple of hours

stories

at all events i dont dou  but we could
get volunteers in this crew

  reuter blew through his thick lips again
dangerous as scientific head of the ex-
pedition i will permit nothing of the kind
naturally captain we are under your or-
ders but if you take such a step it will
be without my authority

  mccausland made a gesture of hopeless-
ness have you any other ideas to sug-
gest mister longworth

  was old steel-wall giving up this
easily adams thoughts wheeled but he
schooled himself to inquire mildly have
you thought of trying mica windows sir
that would do it cried dr perkins
excitedly fluorine doesnt attack mica-
at least at earth temperatures i dont
know about these sub-zero atmospheres
but it ought to work have we the mica
the ship is lined with it remarked
mccausland but we cant very well
take the ship apart

  compartment eighteen- sir adam
burst out

  try it by all means hurry though
for well have to shutter the ships ports
within an hour or get out of here i con-
gratulate you mister longworth that
was well thought of -

  was there a touch of irony in the voice 
as adam saluted and withdrew he won-
dered nobody else appeared to have
noticed it to have noticed that there was
something in the captains voice that
didnt somehow sound quite right

three men were grouped around the
air lock at eighteen and they looked
up as the first mate approached hes
coming out now sir said one of them
been in already once and bjornsen
fitted a mica shield over one of his helmet
ports hes trying that and the straight
glass shield in comparison

  adam nodded wordlessly watching the
lock handle presently it turned and out
stumbled a figure like a gnome cased in
hairy hoar-frost pretty cold out there
said one of the men as with gloved fingers
he labored deftly at burchalls helmet

  the little wizened face came out of it
grinning like a monkeys it works sir
i was in a good five minutes look here-
the glass lens is all pitted and scored but
expedition to plito	

the mica isnt touched something funny
out there in that ocean though

  what do you mean 

  something with legs only they werent
exacdv legs either-

  careful with that space suit there
jake materials brittle after that cold
adam raised his voice look here
men we have a job on our hands we
must make and install port covers for
every port on the ship you know the
regular collision covers-beryll-steel jake
go up forward and get a dozen men while
you bjomsen fix those mica covers on a
dozen space-suit helmets make it snappy
for heavens sake we have just one
hour to work in

  beg pardon sir but wouldnt it be
easier to do it outside this atmosphere
havent the fuel hurry

  the ship rang with orderly disorder
as man after man of the off-duty watch
reported received the space-suit with the
new mica windows and passed out through
the air-lock in compartment eighteen to
join the others who were adjusting protec-
tive collision-shutters over the big ships
ports the last man through adam em-
barked on an inspection tour of the ship
compartment  checked-all ports shut-
tered compartment -

  a bell rang violently and the loud-
speaker system shouted first mate
longworth wanted in the captains cabin
at once first mate longworth wanted-
first mate longworth reporting
adam remarked into his chest phone and
hurried along the corridor

captain mccausland was seated at his
desk drumming on it with his fingers
mister mate he burst out as adam
entered do you know what time it is
no sir

  the captain indicated the space-chro-
nometer set in the wall your hour is
up call your men in were leaving
but sir theyre nearly finished-
mister mate i have taken the trouble
to explain my orders to you once before
ill do it once more so there will be no
possible mistake im responsible for the
safety of this expedition and the lives of
the people aboard in the present case its
my responsibility to see that this cold
fluorine ocean doesnt eat through the

ports and put everyone to a horrible

death corroding as it freezes them-in-
cluding miss devries call in your men

thats an order

  adams mind filled suddenly with the
picture of paulette struggling vainly to
beat back the hideous icy wave of acid at
a temperature lower than anything on
earth of    he lifted his chest phone
and spoke slowly working party out-
side abandon work and return at once
enter by lock in compartment eighteen

the sound of hammers and the grind
of wrenches on the outer hull went
on uninterrupted an expression of sur-
prise spread across adams face captain
mccauslands darkened with anger first
mate longworth speaking did you hear
me burchall answer at once

  again that pause punctuated only by
the sound of tools mccausland lifted
his own phone burchall heinstatt
captain mccausland speaking answer
at once again no reply but the mocking
tap of hammers the captains face
flushed darkly

  longworth if this is more of your
officiousness ill have your badges mis-
ter longworth you will get into a space
suit at once and bring those men in
knock them out if necessary

  adam ran down the corridor toward the
compartment eighteen air lock thinking to
himself that if this was a mutiny it came
at the most fortunate time for the success
of the expedition he took his time don-
ning the space suit his time about enter-
ing the air lock and turning on the
pressure jets that would clear the way be-
fore him into the icy ocean outside just
as he was about to throw open the outer
door of the lock the indicator on it moved
it was flung open from the outside and
the first of the divers stumbled in accom-
panied by a rush of the icy sea that began
immediately to vaporize in the warmer
space of the compartment the clang of
hammers outside sank to a tap then
ceased altogether the work was done
they could float on tliat plutonian sea for
as long as necessary without danger

  when they were out of compartment
eighteens air lock again with the helmets
off adam turned to jake burchall


planet stories

  why didnt you answer me or captain
mccausland just now didnt you know
you could be sent to the mines on mars
for disobedience

  didnt hear you sir you see we was
in such a hurry to get out that we kind
of forgot to put our radiophones on the
helmets

  before adam could put another ques-
tion the bell clamored for lunch

aboard the space-ship goddard the
fiction of keeping up the normal
twenty-four-hour early day was main-
tained and it was not till after the meal
called by courtesy lunch that adam
again faced captain mccausland across
the desk of his cabin paulette devries
was on the captains other side as adam
entered and saluted stiffly

 your report mister mate i am
anxious to learn why my orders werent
obeyed

  no radiophones on the suits sir

  the captain stared taken aback at
last he nodded his acceptance of the wholly
reasonable explanation

  very well    glad you got the shut-
ters installed in time as matters stand
then we can remain here for some time
professor reuter reports we are near one
of the poles of this planet we might
as well start exploring here as anywhere
will you take the detail

  adams face lighted he hadnt ex-
pected a chance like this id be delighted
sir he began and then catching sight
of paulettes slightly disdainful smile
broke off short

  very good take at least one good
man with you professor reuter says the
depth here is about sixty feet which is
the equivalent of thirty feet on earth due
to the difference in gravity that is the
pressure ought not to bother anyone in a
space suit provided the depth is constant
im sending you because you made good
on that mica stunt now heres your
chance to do something bigger youll
have complete charge of whatever party
you take

  mr longworth will enjoy that very
much remarked paulette he likes to
take complete charge of things

  ive noticed that said mccausland

drawing down the corner of his mouth
he reached into a drawer and producing
one of the ugly ungainly rocket-pistols
shoved it across the desk this thing
fires the new atomic shells pretty danger-
ous as you probably know but its about
the only thing that will work in these
liquid densities and you cant tell what
youll run into out there good luck
adam saluted and was just turning
away when out of the comer of his eye
he caught sight of paulettes face it
had gone suddenly rather white and her
lips were slightly parted he turned
back to speak but the moment had passed
and contenting himself with an awkward
repetition of the salute he made his way
out of the cabin

jake burchall responding to a
call over the loud speaker system
found him changing into the electrically
warmed clothes used in the depths of
outer space

 want to come with me jake an
hour or so scouting along the ocean floor
well be the first men to land on pluto
to his surprise the wizened little man
instead of bursting into his habitual gig-
gle looked thoughtful

  whats the matter jake

  nothin mr adam i was just won-
derin thats all if maybe you volunteered
for this but i dont spose youd care to
tell

  i dont mind telling you captain mc-
causland assigned me

  burchall scratched his head evidently
seeking to choose his words

  you think a mighty lot of him dont
you mr adam

  adam stopped dressing with a zipper
half closed his mouth open why sure
ever since i was a kid-iremember being
brought up on the story of how steel-wall
mccausland saved the venus mail rocket
the time-

  yes i know mr adam but looky
here im goin to tell you for your own
good there some folks think old steel-
wall is a little bit too smooth outside and
too hard inside and i aint satisfied
theres some mighty funny things goin
on i dont like the way he called us in
from that port detail-and that there navi-
expedition to pluto



gation around the planetoids-and this
here exploring trip-im just maybe a old
fool but i got my ideas

  bunk jake captain mccausland has
other people to think of too   adams
sentence trailed off as he remembered the
captains willingness to give up the ex-
pedition when they had landed on the wet
surface of pluto could it be possible that
the hero of his boyhood the man paulette
was going to marry-

 what have you got there jake
burchalls voice interrupted his chain of
thought i spose the captain gave you
that too inquired the old engineer
picking up the rocket pistol and when
adam nodded not for mine mr adam
them things is twict as dangerous to you
as to whatever you shoot em at come
back there with me to the engine room
i got some of those marble bombs stuck
on long rods back there when you poke
something with them you know the explo-
sion isnt going to blow you into the mid-
dle of next week

  cased like lobsters in their space suits
the pair waddled clumsily up the spiral
ramp to the main outlet lock the pair of
duty men at the lock swung the handles
in a bored manner and just as he was
entering adam thought he caught another
glimpse of paulette around the comer of
the corridor and raised one sheathed arm
to wave her farewell but she did not
answer

  all right jake called adam through
the chest phone there was a series of
clicks all right mr adam

  adam swung the lode control and felt
the grip of the pale ocean colder than
anything on earth sliding up around his
legs to his waist another spin of the
handle and side by side the two were set-
tling gently through the opalescent depths
toward the surface of pluto

inside the ship the lock attendants
had gone off duty and the corridor
was for the moment empty paulette
glanced at the pressure gauge saw that it
registered a blank which meant that the
two had left the lock and then turned
swiftly to look along the corridor no one
in sight

  at least walter had said to her wait

till those two come back you dont know
what may be in that ocean out there-an
ocean of liquid air and fluorine dr per-
kins says we dont know a thing about the
climates of these extreme cold planets and
what forms of life may exist think of
those horrible quick-acting fungi that
destroyed the explorers of the first uranus
expedition

  but you practically ordered mate
longworth to go she had retorted

  thats different danger is his busi-
ness

  there was no point in arguing she
left it at that and promising walter to
rejoin him later strolled down the cor-
ridor and up the ramp to the outer air-
lock but danger was her business too
she told herself as she swung back the
door to the compartment in which the
space suits were kept and hastily took
down the smallest on the rack yes the
eye-pieces were mica-covered

  danger was her business she told her-
self again as she turned on the pressure
jets to clear the lock she was paulette
devries the radio gal chosen for her
part in this expedition out of all the radio
recorders of three planets for her utter
fearlessness and besides that snip of a
first mate adam longworth had inti-
mated that she needed protection the
lock snapped to behind her and as it did
so she thought exultantly that captain
walter mccausland might as well learn
now as any other time that he couldnt
order his prospective wife around even if
he could make everyone else aboard the
goddard jump

the water was very dark the color
of bottle glass splotched here and
there with darker purplish shadows far
above her paulette could see the faint
shimmering line of light that marked the
space ship it looked to be hundreds of
feet above her five steps in any direc-
tion she knew would blot it out com-
pletely she had no great fear of getting
lost as the compass guide at her belt was
tuned to the ships control compass and
would always point to it somewhere
down here in the dark around her adam
and jake were also exploring the bottom
although she couldnt see them the
	planet

thought gave her courage she stepped
tentatively forward one-two-three-
four-five-at each step floating a little
before she came down she could no
longer see the faint comfortable lights of
the ship somewhere above her and for a
brief moment panic tore at her throat
she fought it down silly she peered
around her as though the thought of
jake and adam wtrnld make them mate-
rialize there there they were she
could see them dimly like shadows to her
left she turned and walked as swiftly
as she could in the direction how adam
would laugh at her for her fears what a
little coward- she stopped suddenly
and cold clammy fingers of fear rippled
along her spine the dark shadow before
her wasnt adam or jake it was some-
thing tall and thin something that
seemed alive weaving back and forth and
about the same color as the water it
seemed about ten feet high and six inches
through and was made up of sections like
a string of sausages then over to the
right she saw more of them-a regular
forest

  like the snapping of a brittle icicle the
tension broke they were plants some
form of natural flora swaying to and fro
in the icy currents of that dark sea she
laughed hysterically and relief flooded her
bathing her in perspiration but the ex-
perience had nevertheless unnerved her
coward or not she decided she had had
enough and turned to find her way back
to the ship then she saw it behind
and a little above her something big
whiter than the color of the water hover-
ing drifting she tried to hurry tried
to tell herself it was just another surpris-
ing but inanimate form of life to be found
in this strange planet but as she glanced
back and up she saw the thing was keep-
ing perfect pace with her horrified she
watched as it settled slowly toward her
huge white hideously opaque she
couldnt move she could only stand
rooted as in some frightful nightmare
staring with bursting eyes as the thing
drifted gently toward her then panic
took her she opened her mouth to
scream but no sound came from her
strangling throat and her tongue clove
tightly to the roof of her mouth she

stories

put her arms up like a child trying to
push aside a horrible dream her hands
touched a soft white pulpy body touched
it then to her utter horror passed thi-bitgh
intv the body itself they were gripped
in that opaque substance and still the
thing settled lower like a great hideous
white cloak it would cover her com-
pletely absorb her as it had absorbed
her hands as it was even now absorb-
ing her wrists-her arms   

adam and jake burchall had set out
with the idea of tracing a circle of
some  yards around the ship in spite
of the weak gravity the pressure was
against them and at each long floating
step they paused while adam probed into
the silt of the ocean floor with a long
rod rock surface was only inches down
what kind of rock he could not tell at
each step they encountered the same
sausage-like chain-weeds paulette had met
and twice adam attempted to pull up one
of the singular plutonian plants only to
find it breaking into sections at a touch

  i suspect said adam through his
phone that these are some very low form
of life look how they break along the
joint jake they probably reproduce in
that fashion breaking off to form an en-
tirely new plant

  funny we havent seen any other form
of life

  yes it would be more usual to find
a couple of hundred on an ocean floor
like this

  a surge in the water round them nearly
swept the explorers from their feet adam
looked up scarcely ten feet above him
a huge brownish globe shot past twice his
own height its smooth surface studded
with countless tiny arms that beat the
water in unison as he gazed at it a paler
whitish mass soared through the twilight
to leap on the brown globe and twisting
in each others grip they passed from
sight

  jakes gasp came through the earphones
and then his giggle pie-he-he mr
adam theres two more forms of life and
we make another one if we stay alive till
we get back

  another three steps and they halted
again at the sight of a shapeless almost
expedition to pltto



white mass looming through the fog of
green ahead it was alive it moved but
flowing rather than swimming and as
nearly as they could make out in the dim-
ness was without eyes mouth or visible
organs of any kind a huge shapeless
jelly adam reached for the rocket pistol
at his belt but jakes eye had caught the
motion and his voice came through the
earphones dont use that thing mr
adam it aint-holy catfish

  the huge colorless jelly had sidled
toward them through the water then
sheered off revealing as it did so a core
of some darker color through its trans-
lucent sides and three shapeless legs whose
motion propelled it as it made the turn
away from the explorers it bumped one
of the curious segmented weeds and jake
had cried out

for where the animal had bumped the
weed a huge dent appeared in its
rounded forward end growing rapidly till
it was a cavern a cavern which engulfed
the chainweed instantly the lips of the
cavern closed adam could see that the
surface had become as smooth as before
while inside the translucent structure of
the animal the outline of the weed was
faintly visible

  ive seen things like that before said
adam softly as though fearful of attract-
ing the monsters attention

  where  i aint never seen nothing like
that and im telling you mr adam i
been around a lot even in those dinosaur
swamps on venus

  ever look through a microscope jake
cant say as i have very often mr
adam

  thats just what you see in a micro-
scope jake that brown thing was just
like a rotifer those big white lumps that
can turn themselves into mouths anywhere
they want to and then close up and turn
themselves into stomachs theyre amoebas
amoebas as big as whales theyre the
most savage animals in the whole created
kingdom-and just about the most danger-
ous for their size

  the engineers voice was doubtful
you mean were sort of in a microscope
adam grunted

  microscope my left foot those things

are real theyre dangerous theyre
the lowest form of life but what hap-
pened is probably that they couldnt de-
velop into any higher forms on this cold
planet so they simply grew to gigantic
size lets get out of here

  he took off in a long soaring step that
carried him jerkily six feet through the
water jake following they had pro-
gressed perhaps three leaps when the
engineers voice was suddenly loud inside
adams helmet-look on the left
there

  adam checked himself in mid-leap and
saw a dark figure in the green gloom of
the undersea world with one of the giant
amoebas swooping toward it a man
came jakes voice its attacking one of
the crew stand still you were coming

there was no answer the other
diver only put up his arms to ward
the thing off and they saw his hands were
empty weaponless another leaping step
carried them almost within reach of the
hideous thing that at the first touch of
the other divers hands had suddenly
formed itself into the huge ingestion fun-
nel adam swung his arm back to stab
the amoeba with his explosive spear but
jakes voice came through the earphones

  too close mr adam hes right on
top of that man youll blow him to pieces
let me try to attract him away

  jake was holding out the harmless end
of the spear he prodded the giant
amoeba briskly and he did so the jelly-
like creature again opened a huge funnel
and swooped with a speed surprising for
so large and formless an object jake
dodged and flattened to the sea-bottom
shouting give it to him

  adam jabbed pressing the button of
his spear as he did so there was a vio-
lent shock adam himself went down from
the impact of the compressed water and
as he fell saw the diver they had rescued
tumbling also above them a cloud of
milky silt boiled up then whipped away in
long ribbons as some obscure current of
that strange sea caught it the giant
amoeba loomed through the murk with a
great ragged hole in its side-but the
hole was closing healing before their very
eyes


planet stories

  as he tried ta rise and draw the rocket-
pistol again adams ears caught jakes
growl of fury and he saw the engineer
lunge with another of the bomb-spears
again there was the violent shock and
murky cloud half clearing to show adam
the strange diver who took two staggering
steps toward him and then collapsed
against his supporting arm at their feet
the giant amoeba lay a whitish shapeless
mass injured beyond the power of a sec-
ond restoration-but no as he watched
a foot long budsuddenly projected from
the side of the mass swelled detatched
itself and then slithered off into the dim-
ness

  holy catfish ejaculated jake you
cant kill the thing who is it you got
there 

  dont know hello there hello
doesnt answer

  better get him inside ill help

  together they half dragged half lifted
the diver toward the air-lock leaped
caught it and in a few minutes more were
in the lights in the corridor were blind-
ing bright jake and adam snatched off
their own helmets and worked fever-
ishly on the gears of the stranger to
reveal the pale half-unconscious face of
paulette devries

she grinned feebly and licked pale
lips

  hello adam oh boy was i glad to
see you a few minutes ago i thought
that thing had me it was like a bad
dream

  are you all right how did you get
there 

  im all right now thanks  i walked
she got up a tottering step and slipped
out of her space suit i dont need help
-excuse me im being ungrateful what
was it

  giant amoeba i think he might
have found that space suit of yours a lit-
tle hard to digest but you would have
smothered waiting for him to discover
that what ever persuaded you to go out
there without your headphones connected
up or any weapons

  adam longworth are you going to lec-
ture me again she began then her face
broke into a smile oh i suppose youre

right this time though the main reason
was really to show walter that i could do
my own thinking to be honest and-
thank you again

  she held out her hand in gratitude it
lay cool in his for a minute returning the
friendly pressure and then she was gone

  i think said captain mccausland
that we can evade any more incidents
with these animals of yours by having the
digging parties work in an air-lock at-
tached to the ships entry lock diving
suits wont be necessary in that case

  of course sir that would be safer
wont it use up a good deal of fuel to
move the ship for each separate dig
though sir were very low on fuel
may i suggest we pump into storage the
amount necessary to make the return
voyage whatever is left over we can
use for exploration from a special tank
when that tanks empty were through and
we have to go

  good suggestion give orders accord-
ingly mister mate

  what would you think of sampling
parties sir say three well-armed men
chipping off the surface rock wherever they
can find it 

  waste of time beryllium will have to
be dug for

  where shall we dig sir right here
i understand that beryllium would be
closer to the surface near the planets
equator-if there is any

  you understand what gave you to
understand anything of the kind are
you the geologist well dig right here
professor reuter has made a very ex-
haustive study of the question and he
thinks the pole is much the likeliest spot
adam stared professor reuter i
thought he was an astronomer

  reuter is an eminent scientist-which
is more than youll ever be mister mate
you have your work to attend to and if
you do it youll have no time for doing
mine or professor reuters now detail
an engine-room party to pump fuel for the
return trip allow ten per cent margin for
safety   what are you staring at me
like that for do you realize you are
impudent allow ten per cent then re-
port to me how much is left for explora-
tion next watch have the mechanics
expedition to pluto



begin work on the digging lock by the
way-may i have my rocket pistol back
adam remembered that he had handed
the pistol to jake burchall and had seen
it disappear in his capacious pocket at
another time he might have said as much
but in his new-born suspicion of the cap-
tain he merely replied

  sorry sir must have dropped it in
that fight with the giant amoeba-

  he stopped for just an instant there
had flashed across walter mccauslands
face an expression of fierce snarling
hatred then a smooth mask seemed to
be drawn across it and the captains voice
was serene of course if it turns up
return it to me thats all

ttut adam thats absurd what
jd possible reason could he have for
wishing to make the expedition fail

  paulette looked anxiously from jake
burchalls face to adams and back as the
three sat in die girls cabin

  i know said adam i dont under-
stand myself paulette why hes been a
hero of mine ever since i was big enough
to know what a space ship looked like
but-

  jakes wrinkled visage contracted in a
frown i dont know much about the
rest miss but i do know i could have
navigated through that planetoid belt my-
self and im only an engineer but he
certainly used up an awful lot of fuel
jumping over it

  yes adam broke in excitedly and
he knew there was fluorine in the atmos-
phere here but he landed right into it with-
out making any preparation to shutter the
ports though he knew very well fluorine
eats into glass like water into sugar then
he wants to turn back then he gives us
an impossibly short time to shutter the
ports and tries to call in the men and leave
before they get it finished i wont men-
tion-

  the girl burst in on him adam youre
frightfully unfair theres a perfectly sen-
sible explanation of everything youve men-
tioned she held out one hand really
you saved my life down there and i dont
want you to think im ungrateful but
youre letting things get you you mustnt

s-planet stories-winter

think youre running the whole expedition

  adams face flushed he swallowed
twice as though about to speak but before
he could say anything jake burchall slowly
produced from his pocket the rocket-pistol
and laid it on the table before the three

  look here miss he said i dont
want to say nothin but when i got into
my own bunk i took one of the shells out
of this thing the others are in the maga-
zine now i want you to look at this

  he snapped back the catch at the side
of the pistol and two atomic-power shells
dropped out-the most powerful and ter-
rible weapons yet invented by the scientists
of three planets ugly little things in their
gleaming metal cases jake picked up one
of them and handed it to paulette indi-
cating a spot on the side of the shell with
his finger-tip the girl bent and gazed
there was a tiny pin-prick a puncture en-
tering the side of the shell

  do you see that little hole there said
jake do you know what would happen
when the trigger was pulled with that shell
in the gun instead of firing the bullet
toward the giant amoeba that hole means
the whole force of the charge would have
gone off in the gun itself and thats the
gun captain mccausland gave adam   
im sorry miss i didnt mean to-hurt
your feelings

  paulette had collapsed suddenly across
the table her shoulders shaking with sobs
her face buried in her hands go away
please go away she cried as adam
touched her shoulder

 t tello earth this is paulette
 devries reporting progress aboard
the goddard by recording for later broad-
cast the first dig ended in a failure this
morning fifty feet down and dr per-

the best chance of finding the metal we
need just reached the half way mark
   hello the motors have stopped ill
find out what the reason is for you in fust
a minute whats going on rossiter   


planet stories

hello earth our motors have stopped
the fuel in the special tank we had set aside
for exploration purposes is exhausted ive
seem to be somewhere near the equator
of pluto    no the fuel didnt run
out theyve found a leak a leak in the fuel
tank its all right folks weve set aside
enough fuel to ride home to earth on but
well have to dig here instead of at the
south pole im going to ask-

  isnt it a curious coincidence mister
mate that this leak should bring us down
over the equator-just where you wanted
to dig all dong captain mccauslands
voice was biting

  yes sir

  curious coincidence too wasnt it that
when those shutters were being put on the
workmens radiophones went out of order
listen here mr mate there have been
too damned many coincidences around here
here to suit me a few more and youre
going to find yourself working in the en-
gine room thats all get out of here
and get the digging lock rigged

  adam saluted mechanically and left the
cabin he knew with sickening precision
what the captain meant demotion to the
engine room would mark him forever in
the space service as an inefficient mate he
could never hope to obtain a command of
his own and throughout the rest of his
life wherever he went the record of it
would follow him even now the unfavor-
able report mccausland was sure to turn
in when they returned to earth would block
his way to any higher command any other
rating he felt sick at heart as he joined
the group at the main lock helmet in hand
as they were about to launch themselves
into the green ocean below-six men
armed with the bomb-spears jake burchall
had provided

  he was surprised to note that paulette
devries was standing waiting with the
others helmet in hand and her face deathly
pale

  paulette he begged do you really
think you should go remember what
happened last time does mccausland-
he knows im going

  all right but keep with the men please
for my peace of mind if not for your own
sake all ready close lock

  the green waters rose about them in

the lock and they swung off adams voice
came clearly through the earphones of the
party

  be careful everyone this is a regular
jungle of those chain-weeds

  paulettes voice answered look adam
where im pointing theres something
different over there little round things
dark red with a few yellow ones

  i see them paulette i dont think
   jake i dont like this lets test
that bottom and get back as soon as we
can

  the men stooped and scraped in the silt
with their metal tools reporting results
not over six inches to rock here eight
inches here just about as shallow here
as before

  take a few samples then make it
as quick as you can as soon as you get
your samples move back be ready to ascend
to the main lock

adam could see nothing but the cloudy
liquid around him stirred to green
milk as the sampling of the silt raised a
murk around him paulette he called
whats your compass reading

  nineteen-o-thirty south sixty-three-
seven west

  i cant see you move due east two
long steps and stand still ill reach for
you

she complied and called out to him
whats your reading now he asked
and she thought his voice sounded strange
as she replied same south reading sixty-
three-six west

  jake where are you and whats your
reading

  im right here mr adam cant see
you this silt doesnt seem to settle down
theres a current of some kind carrying
it i can just stand against it my read-
ings eighteen-forty-forty-two south
sixty-two-fifteen west

  bjornsen rossiter report and extend
hands if you dont touch anyone reach
out with the safe ends of your bomb-spears
and swing them in a circle till you do   
ah whos that who just touched me
rossiter sir

  that makes three of-

  the words were suddenly cut off by the
shock of an explosion that nearly tore them
expedition to pluto



from their feet and a heavier cloud of the
milky silt came eddying past fragments
of chain-weed moving through it burch-
alls voice came through the earphones
attacked  new kind of animal eight-
een-forty-twenty-one south twenty-
thirty-two west

  never mind the bearings cried adam
rossiter paulette hang on to the ends
of these spears and take three steps with
me dont lose contact

  the three leaped as one then again and
again through the murk in which every-
thing was invisible as they touched bot-
tom at the end of the last leap adam saw
a long writhing arm with a barbed tip at
the end of it swing past his helmet view-
ports caught a gasp from jake through
his earphones and then felt paulette at his
side pull free from his gripping hand and
reach up with the bomb-spear

  there was the shock of another explo-
sion down he went and saw something
murky with whirling arms fly past the
view-ports then paulettes voice came
through clear and triumphant

  i got rid of it adam and heres jake
hes all right i guess

  everyone attention said adam pick-
ing himself up make toward the direc-
tion where that explosion came from then
join hands and get back into the ship
quick

  a few moments later when the space
suits had been put away and the men were
dispersing along the corridors to their
cabins paulette touched adams arm

  what was the idea of keeping asking
for those compass bearings she said
we found the main lock all right didnt
we

  yes replied adam shortly thanks to
your compass and thanks to you too
jakes life was saved but didnt you hear
the reports from those others every one
of those compasses was wrong sometimes
wrong by a whole degree and every one
was different

  i dont understand replied the girl
didnt you have the compasses checked
before you started

  thats just the point i did have them
checked and adjusted and professor
reuter was the man who adjusted them
if you hadnt been with us-

 ttello earth this is paulette

   i devries speaking to you from
pinto in about an hour or more well be
through one way or another the digging
has gone down to a depth of fifty feet
sheathed in its steel casing and theres no
sign of beryllium yet we havent enough
fuel to try another dig ive just been
down in the well the men have sunk look-
ing it over theyre working at the bottom
with the new aiomic power diggers that
compress the material taken out of the
well into a fused rocklike substance with
which the walls of the well itself are lined
as they go down making it safer the deeper
they get one strange thing about the
digging so far is that the temperature has
advanced sharply as we go down the
ocean from which were working is two
hundred below zero as you know down
there they struck rock colder than any ice
on earth at the start and had to work in
warm air supplied from the ship now
the temperature has gone up at least a
hundred degrees and its rising faster with
every foot just a minute people are
hurrying past me theres been some kind
of an accident at the dig ill have the de-
tails for you 

  the girl snapped off her key and hurried
down the corridor to the open lock above
her the loudspeaker system was booming
all watches summon all watches sec-
ond mate wayland report to captain mc-
causland diggers have broken through
into a cavern seven men have fallen all
watches

  two or three men were standing at the
edge of the air-lock gazing down the spiral
staircase that wound its way into the dig-
ging

  whos down there asked paulette

  the man saluted first mate long-
worth he replied six men with him
were trying communication by radio but
havent got in touch with him yet

  an icy hand gripped tightly at paulettes
heart

  adam she cried and was surprised to
discover there were tears in her eyes as
a touch fell on her shoulder and she looked
around to see the face of captain walter
mccausland

  whats the matter my dear  he asked

  your dear she half shrieked im
	planet

not your dear and i wouldnt marry you
if you were the last man on earth you
did this i

  the captains mouth curled in a sneer
so thats it is it hes persuaded you
he can run you as well as the expedition
well i hope he can run things down where
he is as well as he can everything else he
turned on his heel and walked away with-
out another word

it seemed useless to go any deeper but
adam driving the digging machines
hard at the bottom of the excavation was
determined not to give up till he was called
back there would be no more excava-
tions there was no more fuel to take the
goddard to another spot the lights led
down from the ship flared about them the
tongues of the atomic power rasps worked
against the rocks with an annoying grat-
ing sound discharging their take of pow-
dered rock into the machine that fused it
and worked slowly around the circular wall
of the excavation behind them plastering
it with white-hot material that cooled rap-
idly into the smooth stony cylinder that
towered far above to join with the ship

  suddenly one of the diggers took on a
new high-pitched note adam turned and
as he turned felt himself slipping clutched
at something and the next minute was
sliding down down a long slant it seemed
into total darkness a weight gripped him
around the chest he rolled over but his
hands caught only loose stones and when
the slide came to a stop as abrupt as its
beginning he found himself lying on his
back the weight across his legs looking
up far up toward where a speck of light
from the ship seemed miles away

  he reached out one hand and touched
something as smooth as though it were
polished and gently warm mr adam
said a voice suddenly and he recognized
it as jakes are you all right mr
adam

  i think so but my legs are caught

  ill get you free in a minute anybody
else

  i got hit in the belly came a voice
wheres flack

  the engineer was lifting something
can you get out there now mr adam
well be all right in a minute adam

stories

gave a heave felt his entangled legs slide
free and pulled himself onto a pile of debris
just as a light glared on like a star from
one of the other men

  are we all here wheres flack
there was a counting of noses and a gen-
eral feeling of bodies for bruises above
them where the wall of the cylinder
stopped they could make out that the sud-
den break through had carried them down
some twenty feet here he is just an
arm sticking out im afraid hes done
for come here everyone

  one of the digging machines was brought
into play and they labored to get the pris-
oned man free but as they cleared the
broken stone and rubble from around his
face it became evident that the effort was
useless the eyes were glazed the head
hung limp adam stepped back against the
wall of the cave-in around them and as
he did so his hand touched it once more
he noticed it was both smooth and warm
he turned and in the light of the atomic
lamps now blazing across the top of the
cave-in examined it it was not only
smooth and warm but polished and just
over his head he could see where the rock
stopped and metal began-a clean-fitted
job a manufactured wall

  jake he called excitedly bring that
digging machine over here for a second
the one with the cutting head

  the little engineer turned and bounded
over in a couple of steps digging machine
in hand why thats a metal wall he
cried and applied the head for a moment
in a brief surge of power the bit cut
out an inch-deep circle of metal dropping
it on some of the rubble with a tinny
clang jake bent to pick it up

  its light enough to be beryllium he
said handing the disc to adam and turn-
ing back to the wall drove his cutter into
it with renewed energy

  what are you doing demanded the
mate hefting the disc of metal

  this wall sounds hollow here goes
he had driven the machine deep in and
stepping back pulled the handle marked
split there was a sudden rending
clang a crash and a six-foot section of
the wall fell inwards the two men stared
into the hole it had left heedless of the
fact that the other members of the exca-
expedition to pluto



vating crew were crowding up behind them

  they were looking into a low square
room perhaps twenty feet across at the
far side was a doorway and in the door-
way stood a man

  to be sure he was such a man as none
of them had ever before seen he was
not over four and a half feet tall yet with
arms as long as an earthlings hanging
down below his knees tremendously broad
shoulders and a head that seemed per-
manently pushed forward and downward
above them below that head the creature
was wrapped from neck to toe in some
shimmering blue material with a metallic
luster banded around the arms and legs
with red metal

  as they gazed in astonishment the man
took two steps forward his head bobbing
on his neck at each step opened his lips
and uttered wahwahroo in a voice thick
with gutturals

adam glanced around at his own men
then once more at the plutonian
dwarf whose face as far as he could judge
bore an expression of intense interest
rather than of fear or anger the remark
he judged would be a greeting

  wahwahroo he replied amiably but
the plutonian continued to stare in a man-
ner that indicated adams first lesson in
this unknown tongue was far from a suc-
cess

  stand by he remarked to the crew
im going in and try to talk to this bird
ma be trouble catching the sides of
the split in the wall he jumped down in
a small cascade of pebbles that rang on the
floor below in a manner which assured him
this also was metal

  i dont understand what youre saying
old man he remarked to the plutonian
who had remained standing in the door-
way and touching a finger to lips and ears
to emphasize the point i dont under-
stand but maybe youll be able to get it
from a picture

  from one of his pockets he produced
a piece of paper and with one of the new
print-pencils that had just been developed
sketched rapidly at a crude drawing of a
rocket-ship with little men issuing from
beneath it into the waves of an ocean

  the plutonian accepted it from his hand

looked at it with a puzzled expression then
returned it nodding violently but with
an expression on his face that bespoke
complete lack of comprehension

  mr adam it was jakes voice from
the door im sending the others back
with flack to get some weapons

  all right just stay there to keep up
communication jake adam called back
im trying to get over the idea to this
guy that were civilized

  he stepped over to the wall of the room
and with his print-pencil tapped on the
metal ping then twice ping-ping and
then three times ping-ping-ping

  the plutonian watched him attentively
grimaced with thick lips and then catching
adams eye tapped with his foot once
then twice then three times in quick suc-
cession adam smiled approval the plu-
tonian reached out took the drawing again
and studied it gravely for a moment then
pointed at one of the little figures at adam
and smiled

  adam did his best to signify that the
plutonian had grasped the point the
dwarf held up one hand palm out toward
adam then turned to the door behind him
adam watched without moving and a
frown spread across the plutonians face

  i got it mr adam called jake from
the rent in the wall all the signals are
different here he holds up his hand to
stop you because he wants you to come
along

  it might be adam took an experimental
step toward the plutonian and saw the
latters face clear they reached the door
together and adam noticed it did not open
on hinges but slid the plutonian touched
some kind of lever or contact in the frame
uttered something in his deep voice and
stood waiting beyond the door adam
noticed was another room perfectly dark
but as the plutonian stopped speaking
there was a rustle of feet within and a file
of half a dozen dwarfs emerged each an
exact duplicate of the first as nearly as
adam could judge they formed a circle
staring at adam and at the torn wall with
jake gazing through each in turn stepped
forward examined adam from head to
foot and having emitted a few expressive
grunts took his place in the circle again all
seemed friendly but after the last one had
	planet

looked over adam one of the plutonians
produced some kind of weapon with a
hammer-like head and a handle set cross-
wise and waved the earth-man back toward
the tear in the wall

  adam looked around at jake saw that
he had one of the digging machines in his
hand and decided that retreat toward this
protection was the best policy but it was
not the plutonians intention to dismiss
him evidently one of them whose metal-
lic armbands were more numerous than
the rest stepped forward reached for
adams print-pencil and when adam
added to it his piece of paper was busy
for a moment

on the paper when he handed it to
the earth-man were seven groups of
dots one in the first two in the second
three in the third regularly up to seven
dots in the seventh group

  the dwarf pointed to himself then to
the single dot and followed by indicating
each of the other six plutonians in turn
with one of the lines of dots

  when this effort at communication had
been executed he pointed to the single dot
again then to adam and finally to the
wall

  what does he want  asked jake
whats he trying to get at 

  i think i know replied adam see
these numbers of dots hes trying to
tell me hes the number one man here and
he wants to talk to our number one man
he turned to the plutonian saluting and
laughed to see the dwarf returning him a
carbon copy of the movement

  ill stay here he said to jake as
soon as they get that emergency ladder in
position report to captain mccausland and
ask him whether he can come down you
might take along those metal samples you
routed out ask dr perkins to test them
for beryllium theyre light and strong
enough to be the stuff

      eneral staff assembly in the
vj mess room time one-two-four-
five general staff assembly in the mess
room time one-two-four-five general-
the ships loudspeakers were carrying
the message all through the big hull and
even down into the base of the tunnel

stories

where the spiral stair of alloy had now
been carried to the spot of the cave-in
and second mate wayland was superin-
tending the job of fusing some of the debris
into place to strengthen and lengthen the
cylinder

  coming down the corridor toward the
mess room adam almost ran into paulette
she took his hand impulsively im so
glad for you adam she said you
wanted this expedition to succeed so much
and youve worked so hard on it

  he smiled wryly lot of good itll do
me now the captains going to turn in
an unfavorable report and hes even now
threatening to demote me to the engine
room

  the girls eyes flashed never mind
you forget that im the power of the press
when paulette devries the radio gal lets
go captain walter mccausland is going
to be good and sorry for some of the things
hes done

  adam stopped and stared at her in
amazement why i thought you were
going to marry him

  him i wouldnt marry him if he were
the last man on-on pluto she gave a
laugh that was half a sob

  then-then theres a chance-

  sssh here we are

  the scientific staff dr perkins pro-
fessor reuter three assistants the medical
staff and a geographer were at the front
of the room with the second and third
mates and the other officers of the expedi-
tion captain mccausland in their midst
as adam and paulette the last to enter
came in mccausland glanced at them
sharply under lowered brows adam real-
ized suddenly that he was holding the girls
hand and dropped it someone laughed and
mccauslands hard thin face was etched 
in a sneer

  miss devries he said i called the
entire staff together to listen to this report
on the sample of metal brought from be-
low because it is very important would
you be good enough to open your key and
make a record of this report 

  the girl obediently snapped the switch
on the device that hung at her chest and
spoke briefly into it hello earth pau-
lette devries speaking we are about to
hear the report on the metal found in the
expedition to pluto



digging on pluto dr perkins our chem-
ist will speak first  

  perkins report was brief i have made
spectroscopic tests on the metal brought
from the digging and which is used by
the inhabitants of the interior of pluto
it registers as certainly beryllium

paulette was about to speak again
when mccausland held up his hand i
would like to hear from professor reu-
ter he said he conducted the chemical
and physical analyses of the metal after
dr perkins had finished his spectroscopic
tests

  professor reuters oily voice boomed
out i regret to say that although this
metal responds to the spectroscopic tests
for beryllium it will not do for our pur-
pose it is in fact an isotope of beryl-
lium a metal which resembles it spectro-
scopically but not physically the weight
is wrong the metal is much too heavy and
will not do for making armor for space
ships

  but-but- babbled adam i didnt
weigh it of course but it seemed very
light to me

  and to me also remarked dr per-
kins there was a frown of puzzlement
if not of suspicion between his brows

  miss devries you will not make a
record of this useless argument snapped
mccausland professor reuter will ex-
plain-

  i will explain that the sample in its
original form was full of air particles like
a fine sponge remarked the professor
easily but with his mouth working the
plutonians evidently have some process of
lightening in this fashion

  isnt there any way of treating it
mccausland turned to dr perkins
will you explain to our young but over-
enthusiastic friend about that

  dr perkins shook his head the frown
still persisted not if its a true isotope
that would be the same thing as trans-
muting elements but i still confess i do
not entirely understand

  mccausland took up the word swiftly
meanwhile since it is certain that the
metal used by these plutonians will not
do for our purpose i think it important
that we at least look into the composition

of their civilization to some extent he
remarked i propose to investigate them
with professor reuters co-operation mis-
ter longworth you will take charge of the
ship guard

  paulette spoke up suddenly captain
mccausland i think it is important that
i go with you on making this contact with
the plutonians certainly everyone on the
three planets will want to knowabout them
the captains mouth writhed a moment
and adam noticed the glance he shot at
professor reuter but his voice was smooth
to be sure miss devries i think then
this is all that comes before the present
meeting dismiss

the space in front of the metal wall
that shut off the plutonian domain
had been cleared as paulette accompanied
by professor reuter mccausland and
bjornsen of the engine-room staff reached
the bottom of the dig and stepped over to
it they noted that although the wall still
showed part of the jagged break a door
had been fitted to fill most of the gap

  the four stepped over to it and mc-
causland tapped at the door there was
no answer at first then from the other
side there came an answering tapping-one
tap then two then three as though for a
signal mccausland answered in the same
fashion and after a moment the door slid
back revealing one of the strange ape men
of pluto he saluted in a strange copy
of the movement adam had made at the
time of their first contact and mccaus-
land returning the salute stepped through
the door and producing a piece of paper
from his pocket began to make sketches
while the dwarf watched with interest his
face working rapidly to indicate compre-
hension

  after a moment the captain beckoned to
reuter and both stepped down into the
plutonian room leaving paulette and
bjornsen on the heap of rubble at the base
of the digging the girl looked round
then in a low voice said to the engineer
will you do me a favor

  sure what is it

  id like a souvenir see where that
part of the wall is torn could you break
me off a little sliver of that metal to take
back with me


planet stories

  simple the giant mechanic stepped
over to the wall and twisted at a rag of
metal it tore loose with a little ping
the other two were absorbed in their pen-
cil-and-paper conversation with the plu-
tonian and did not appear to notice as
paulette slipped the fragment into the
pocket of her skirt

  bjornsens eye looked along the crack
and the fitting of the door and he was
shaking his head clucking despondently
these people he said they are bad
mechanics look at that joint ill fix
it for them

  he bent and picked up one of the atomic
power drills that had been left at the foot
of the dig and applying it to the wall
turned on the power as he did so there
was a commotion a dozen or more of the
plutonians all dressed in the same wrap-
pings but with varying numbers of metal
bands came pouring through the back door
of the room mccausland turned fiercely
drop that he shouted do you want
to bring them all down on us 

  i was just repairing this break for
them replied the engineer

  dont touch anything that doesnt be-
long to you replied the captain and turn-
ing began to draw rapidly on his paper

the crowding plutonians gabbling in
their guttural language were examin-
ing the work that bjornsen had done gaz-
ing at him admiringly and then at the
power drill he had used three or four
of them attached themselves to him while
another picked up the machine and pulled
him along as though to lead him through
the rear door of the room while their chief
made a rapid drawing for mccausland

  they want you to go with them and
work for them explained reuter peering
over the plutonians shoulder as he
sketched just disengage their hands
gently bjornsen well explain

  yes said mccausland and go back
up to the ship you and miss devries
both i dont care how important this is
for purposes of record thats an order
go

  adam was on duty at the head of the
spiral stair when they arrived did you
get it he asked

  paulette put a finger on her lips and

glanced at bjornsen then as though re-
ferring to some previous arrangement said
easily do you suppose dr perkins will
explain the matter now

  i think so he replied catching on
quickly ill leave burchall in charge of
the watch and we can go up and see him
at all events

  a few moments later they had reached
the top of the ship where the scientific
laboratories were located in a series of
outer compartments dr perkins looked
up from his desk as the pair entered

  hello miss devries he said glad
to see you longworth whats on your
mind

  adam spoke i just wanted to ask you
two questions

  go ahead

  well die first is-what did you think
of that isotope business

  the chemists face gathered in a frown
i think it was rather a tragedy after
so much effort and such high hopes the
world can go back to barbarism again now
and it will be barbarism too all the
machinery will have to be built to use crude
electric power the standard of living will
have to be reduced and only a few people
will profit-the people who own the electric
plants  he glanced at paulette
is this an interview for the press 
no replied adam slowly and that
wasnt exactly the answer i wanted but
perhaps youll understand from the second
question why did professor reuter make
the test on that beryllium instead of you
i understood you were the chemist of the
expedition

perkins glanced at him sharply i
might say that you take a good deal of
interest in a good many things young
man captain mccausland remarked about
that already but for your information
professor reuter is the head of the scien-
tific staff and is perfectly adequate to con-
duct so simple an examination you arent
insinuating he isnt capable by any
chance 

  an irritated retort rose to adams lips
but before he could make it paulette laid
her hand  his arm and broke in mr
longworth of course doesnt mean to in-
sinuate anything dr perkins he came
expedition to pluto	

with me because as press representative
i felt that we ought to be perfectly sure
in a matter that so vitally affects the fu-
ture of the world there are going to be
quite a number of questions asked when
we return and i thought we ought to have
a confirming test made by you

   a curious expression flashed across per-
kins face reuter should have allowed
me to make one in any case i think he
said where can i get a sample

  i have one here the girl produced
the fragment bjornsen had wrenched loose
for her

   you neednt mention this to anyone till
we get back to the earth said dr per-
kins sawing the sample in two i wouldnt
want to appear insubordinate now lets
see well leave the spectroscope test out
-that was made on the other sample
he sliced off a shaving set it on the view-
ing table and adjusted the light thats
odd he remarked after a moment
theres no sign of the air bubbles reuter
found in the other sample

  one of the other fragments he dropped
into a crucible set the dial at  degrees
and flicked on the little motor that would
melt it by atomic power heat

  adam watched breathlessly as the oven
was opened the little molten globe of sil-
very metal quenched in acid then dropped
into an open-ended pipette and the con-
tainer filled with liquid

  the difference between what that
pipette held and what it should hold ex-
plained dr perkins as he adjusted a scale
to weigh the liquid which had been poured
off will be the displacement of the sample
see- cubic centimeters now the
weight we read it direcdy by putting
the displaced weight in water on one arm
of the scale and the sample of metal on
the other now when they balance the
pointer-my god longworth

  there was a ghost of a smile around
adams mouth paulette gripped his arm
yes

   longworth the specific gravity is 
this is more than important its vital
im going to call in my assistant and make
that test over again spectroscope and all
this is no isotope this is perfecdy gen-
uine beryllium how could reuter have
made such an error

  adam and paulette left the chemist

feverishly ringing for his assistant

t tell you walter i dont like it

   -l weve got to get out of here pro-
fessor reuters usually smooth voice had
an edge of worry and his fat face was
haggard

   whats the matter losing your nerve
taunted captain mccausland

   the professor slapped the table of the
cabin to which they had returned from
their visit to the subsoil of pluto i tell
you walter im risking everything by go-
ing on my own men are wondering about
that fluorine fiasco and perkins was just
able to swallow my analysis of the beryl-
lium and no more i have a scientific
reputation to keep up you want to remem-
ber  it wont do me any good to succeed
if i go back with my reputation for ac-
curacy in tatters

  reputation mccauslands voice was
mocking just like a school girl afraid
to be caught out with the boys why you
old goat if anything went wrong now do
you suppose anyone would blame me no
they wouldnt i only acted on the advice
of my head of science youre in this right
up to the neck reuter reputation or no
reputation and now youre going to see
it through-on the lines i mark out for
you

   the professors weak anger collapsed
now now walter dont be angry i
had no intention of falling down on you
but it seems to me that im taking a good
deal of the risk while you-

   while im going to get all the profit i
suppose now listen you have as many
shares as i have anyway we can settle
such details at a later date what weve
got to work out now is details that young
longworth suspects im sure and hes
got the girl onto his side

  the professors voice became smooth
and unctuous again it was too bad about
that rocket-pistol youre sure they didnt
suspect anything about that

  wouldnt longworth have mentioned
it  hes just the sort of hot-headed young
busybody who would burst out with the
whole story no he lost it all right the
main tiling now is to keep any of the rest
of them from getting a sample of that
	planet stories

unalloyed beryllium wall down there

  in which you are fortunately aided by
the plutonians interest in bjornsen you
can give orders now that the thing isnt
to be touched for fear of provoking them
theyre amazingly strong physically by
the way

  we might- what it was that mc-
causland was going to suggest they might
do was never finished the buzzer at the
door sounded at that moment and as the
captain said come in the pair of con-
spirators looked up to see a little proces-
sion composed of dr perkins his two
assistants adam and paulette coming in
the face of the chemist was alight

  gentlemen he exclaimed i am glad
to say that our expedition is a success after
all i have found another sample of beryl-
lium and tested it there is no indication
of isotope the weight is correct and it
has been checked by these two gentlemen
were saved

  there was a rasping sound from pro-
fessor reuters throat but mccauslands
saturnine face never altered

  and where did this other sample come
from 

  from a different portion of the wall
replied paulette i found it

  probably beryllium exists in both forms
here remarked the captain easily but
in any case i hardly see how that affects
our problem what do you propose to
do

  do load up with beryllium and head
for home cried adam

  unfortunately the beryllium belongs to
the plutonians they use it in these par-
titioned compartments to keep out the in-
tensely cold ocean that surrounds their
planet i do not well see how we can
deprive them of it especially over their
opposition he gathered a sheaf of pa-
pers from his desk here are the notes
of a picture-conversation i have had with
them they naturally decline to part with
their metal i had the idea of taking some
of this isotope beryllium back with us

  there was a moments silence in the
cabin through which came the wheezing
sound of professor reuters breath heavily
indrawn

i know that said adam after a mo-
ment because i have just been down

to the bottom of the dig and held a picture
conversation with the plutonians would
you be good enough to look at these sir
the plutonians say that they are only
anxious to have these compartments built
against the entrance of the ocean when
i offered to replace any beryllium we took
with walls of our stronger steel alloy they
agreed at once to give us all we wanted
we can use the steel from compartment
eighteen

  why    thats fine mister mate
captain mccausland seemed to be drawing
his breath in with some difficulty i con-
gratulate you you may start work at
once

  oh my lord said reuter softly

tello earth this is paulette

  jl  devries recording for later broad-
cast this folks is our last day on the
planet pluto-our last day by earth time
though the plutonians wouldnt recognize
it they seem to have no sense of time or
time-telling instruments i told you in
our last record how the ship has been
loaded with beryllium we have her full
now of as much of the metal as we can
carry compartment eighteen has been cut
away and the ship neatly joined together
along the line of the cut the metal that
armored the compartment has been worked
over into partitions to replace the beryllium
from pluto

  the entire crew has been given shore
leave for this last day only captain mc-
causland and professor reuter will remain
aboard the ship with your radio gal
paulette devries herself i have to work
up my description of the interior of pluto
gathered on my trip a few days ago

  just for the present ill tell you its
a wonderful world down there-four thou-
sand miles in the center of a planet filled
with streets and houses plants grown by
artificial chemical fertilization never any
bad weather the plutonians who live here
have told us in their picture language that
this planet was the center of life in the
solar system millions of years ago when
the sun was much larger they sent out ex-
peditions to the other planets of which
earth was one we may be descendants
of theirs    just a moment theres
someone at my door signing off
expedition to pluto



  she flicked off the key and opened the
door to reveal captain walter mccaus-
land

  oh hello she said

  paulette-miss devries he said ear-
nestly can you come to my cabin for a
few minutes i want to say something
very important to you where we wont be
interrupted

  if its important

  it is he stood aside for her to pass
and they moved silently down the empty
corridor to his cabin when they were
seated he looked at her seriously for a
moment

  i never asked you why you took it upon
yourself to break off our engagement in
so dramatic a manner

  the reason was sufficient for me it
doesnt matter otherwise

  his lips drew back i suppose it has
something to do with that young puppy
of a mate

  that captain mccausland is none of
your business

  he leaned forward paulette stop
fencing with me ill be frank you know
that not everything has gone smoothly on
this expedition you may think you know
the reason perhaps you do and then
again perhaps i know a lot more about
it than you do you think that the expedi-
tion is a great success so far but i want
to remind you that were not home yet
we havent even left pluto and those queer
people down there i think-that is-if
you really want to be certain that we will
get back to earth with our load of beryl-
lium it might be an extremely good idea
if you reconsidered your breaking the en-
gagement

  she spoke with acidity

  captain mccausland i still wouldnt
marry you if you were the last man on
earth anything else-

  the buzzer whirred and a voice spoke
through the loudspeaker system profes-
sor reuter requests captain mccauslands
presence in the laboratory professor
reuter requests-

  the captain snapped his key said com-
ing and then turned to paulette wait
here i havent finished theres some-
thing more important- and was gone
leaving her there

it was a chance for which she had long
hoped perhaps she could discover why
he seemed to be intent on wrecking his
own expedition she glanced about her
noting every possible location for hidden
things there was the chart rack full of
rolled maps not likely then the book-
case rows of neat bound volumes there
remained the desk and the safe methodi-
cally she examined drawer after drawer
feeling sure that nothing very important
would have been left so loosely about
there was nothing-but what was this a
slip of paper on which were written four
numbers and the words changed


  she pocketed it quickly

  hastily she went to the safe and tried
out the simple number locks-to find the
handle swing instantly open its contents
were two bundles of papers the first
consisted of ancient stock certificates her
eye glanced at the name on one one thou-
sand shares of niagara hydro to walter
mccausland worthless old things   
but kept in the safe then the light broke
she pieced together a dozen slight refer-
ences from remembered conversations-
walters warm liking for the ancient days
of electricity and steam his hatred of mod-
em things he had plotted to turn the
world back four centuries to destroy the
whole system that had been built on atomic
power and she realized as she explored
the thick pile of stocks that he would be
the richest man in that restored world it
was a wild dream an insane one yet she
shuddered as she thought how nearly he
had succeeded

  idly she glanced at the other slab of
paper-the drawn conversations with the
plutonians nothing else but why were
they also kept in the safe she glanced
hurriedly through them frowned at one
and then gasped in sheer horror as she
understood it it was an incredible draw-
ing of dwarf men who thrust taller humans
into a tank of water while other dwarfs
bowed in a strange ritual but the horror
was for the vague thing drawn inside the
tank-it was impossible yet what mistake
could there be    she must hurry
   hurry    yet she banged the safe
shut and locked it before leaving and
rushing down the corridor with the bundle
	planet

of drawings hugged to her gasping breast

mccauslands face was drawn
with some nameless thought but his
eyes narrowed shrewdly enough when he
saw the girl had left hastily he tried the
safe and found it locked reuter came in
and asked wheres the girl

gone back to her cabin most likely
the professors eyes glanced idly ver
the floor and grew large mccausland
looked where he pointed there between
desk and safe lay a stock certificate

  reuter was the first to recover his
speech left her alone here eh try
the safe  but mccausland was al-
ready opening it and together they stared
at the empty space where the plutonian
drawings should have been

  search the ship snapped the captain
then well reuter why are you look-
ing like that 

  you dont think shes he licked his
lips furtively gone down there with the
others    trying to save them 
captain mccausland gray in the face
was shouting into the loudspeaker
paulette paulette

  she wont answer you if shes seen
those drawings reminded reuter

  cursing he rushed down the corridor
to the open lock that connected with the
plutonian world below far down on the
bottom he glimpsed a familiar tiny figure
as it vanished from sight

  paulette come back his voice was
a hoarse scream he leaned against the
side of the lock and groaned

  walter reuter arrived panting shes
gone we cant help it she turned you
down anyway didnt she lets get the
ship out of here quick

  walters face was ghastly pale but he
straightened his back do you think id
leave her those other fools yes but
not my girl you old goat shes mine i
tell you

  reuter groaned

  but theyll get you too    you cant
leave me alone here

  the captain turned back snarling
thats right i wont leave you youd
start the ship and leave us all wouldnt
you very well youre coming too

  a heavy hand dragged the screaming

stories

protesting professor into the lock-door and
pushed him savagely down on the rungs
of the ladder

adam herded the forty-six sight-seers
from the goddard into the room
he was a little puzzled the plutonians
now on the last day not only permitted
but actually suggested that the crew visit
their sacred temple he looked hastily
around the ante-room trying to keep the
men in order the half dozen scientists
were everywhere poking about into things
with cries of excitement two strangely
dressed guards began throwing open the
temple door and everyone surged forward
inside they gazed open-mouthed the
huge room was three times as high as the
usual low plutonian ceiling on which the
earthmen frequently bumped their heads
at one end was a large gallery ten feet
off the floor and here tier on tier were
hundreds of the dwarfs they rose at
the moment and began reciting a sonorous
chant

  in the center of the room twenty feet
square milky blue lit from unknown
depths below was a glass tank adam saw
with a gasp of horror and dread the thing
that floated in it-it was a huge amoeba
he looked shrewdly about and noted the
reverent attitude of the gallery could this
horror be the plutonians deity  the great
god amoeba nervous now he glanced
behind and shouted the temple doors
were closing

  wayland jake he cried leaping to
the doors a dozen men turned and came
on the run but they pushed and battered
in vain on the smooth metal as the doors
clanged shut

  were prisoners snapped adam
anyone bring a weapon    anything
at all even a spanner bjornsen a
bomb-spear rossiter dont use it fool
youll kill us all well were in a hell of
a fix our bare fists lets get at those
dam dwrarfs on the balcony anyway each
fellow boost his neighbor up ready 

  they rushed in a mob and though the
ten-foot wall meant incredible height to
the dwarf plutonians their front ranks
drew back nervously and the rearmost
made for the exits when they saw these
earthmen climb on each others shoulders
expedition

and actually drawing themselves over into
the gallery they broke in a panic and milled
about the exits great bjornsen was amopg
the first and while the others turned to aid
their companions he charged roaring but
a dozen of the dwarfs dangerous as
trapped rats threw themselves on him
three went down with pile-driver blows
skulls cracked like egg-shells but the giant
was pulled down by sheer numbers and
would have been killed on the spot had not
a cry from the rear of the balcony saved
him the plutonians were through the
doors which were held open until the en-
gineers assailants rushed through where-
upon they closed shut the earthmen
charged and raged against them five min-
utes before adam called them back

  save your strength men this is a
good place to keep together and wait its
all we can do    theyll have to come
at us some time-

minutes passed slowly watchfully
nerves were tense to the breaking
point then on the ceiling low over their
heads at the back of the gallery the familiar
whining snarl of one of their own atomic
drills broke out adam crouched muscles
ready for whatever might offer the drill
droned on and the point showed through
there was a pause and with a clang a great
section of the ceiling was wrenched up and
fell over on the floor above and the open-
ing framed the face of paulette devries

  come up she cried softly oh hurry
hurry and into adams ear she poured
her story as soon as he had crawled on
bjornsens shoulders to her side adams
voice immediately broke into action urging
the men to greater speed he lay on his
stomach reaching down to aid the climbers
from below bjornsen was the last man
and as the strain of his weight fell on
adams muscles he saw the door of the
temple open and a vast mob of plutonian
guards rush in bjornsen was up now and
paulette tugging at adam to come too
but adam had seen something-could it
be yes no mistake there were two
humans still struggling being carried
across the temple floor to the great tank
a dozen dwarfs bore the leading man to
its brink and with a great heave and a
shout from the mob he fell into the milky

to pluto	

water its the captain groaned adam
half-lowering himself as though to attempt
a rescue but bjornsens great arm gripped
his leg the dirty rat growled that
giant hes gettin what he planned for
us anyway its hopeless sir

  and as he dragged adam away from
the hole in the ceiling he caught one last
glimpse of walter mccausland frantic
staring eyes pressed to the glass under
watr as the great white amoeba closed
its flesh around him and the mans form
became cloudy and after a moment ceased
struggling

  oh adam hurry moaned paulette

  they were in a low space which ex-
tended in all directions supported by squat
pillars its a sort of bulk-head space
above their hollow world-separates them
from the water above explained the girl
i broke into it from the dig-tunnel and if
we hurry 

  mr longworth sir a member of the
crew broke in excitedly ive still got
this bomb-spear i can set it and time it
to go off why not leave it here behind
us and blow this damn bulk-head to pieces
wipe out that lousy nest of murderers
he gripped the missile in his hands and
bent over to place it against the bulk-head
wall adam turned to him flashingly
none of that rossiter these people are
only protecting themselves and if we
flood their world we can never come back
to it for more beryllium come along
weve got to move    did you hear
me rossiter  i said to pick up that bomb
and come along

  rossiter looked at adam with red fury-
filled eyes to hell with what you said
he screamed these lousy freaks killed
captain mccausland theyre not going
to kill me do you hear theyre not
going to kill me ill blow them all to
hell first yes and us too let me go
theyll kill me you fool let me go
ah-a-a-a-ah he collapsed inertly to
the floor of the tunnel

  adam sucked his bruised knuckles his
eyes like bits of flint his gaze stabbed
at the silent circle of men around him
anyone else feel the same way  he asked
quietly no all right well go on
petersen pick him up and carry him along
hell be all right he cracked poor devil
	planet

  they raced along the bulk-head crouch-
ing in the confined space after what
seemed ages paulette gasped just ahead
of us  see it   there

  the jagged hole in the wall appeared
before them but even as they tore madly
toward it it filled with a horde of seamed
wrinkled faces and squat ugly bodies
adam knew there could be no hesitating
if they stopped now they were lost dont
stop he shouted keep going right
through em  with a thudding shock the
earthmen met the dwarfs bare fists rose
and fell flailing like sledge-hammers the
brown horde fell back before the on-
slaught countless numbers were down
skulls crushed like egg shells then sud-
denly the crunch of bjornsens fists cleared
a gap and the desperate crew plunged into
it ahead of them was the dig-tunnel
with its ladder leading upward to the pre-
cious safety of the space-ship the way
was clear for the astounded plutonians
had not had time to rally their scattered
forces

 but adam knew it would not be
long before they did across the inter-
vening space the little party dashed straight
for the opening of the dig-tunnel fifty
feet just fifty feet above them was safety
but climbing the ladder with an uncon-
scious man among them was torturingly
slow work adam was the last to go up
as he passed the quarter mark he heard
the enraged shouts of the dwarfs behind
him he risked one quick look over his
shoulder they were already pouring into
the tunnel and the first ranks had started
to swarm the ladder hurry he gasped
theyre coming up like a snail he
climbed rung by slow rung time stood
still there was no sound except the pant-
ing of the earthmen above and the ever-
nearing swish of small slippered feet below
then adam saw that the first of his crew
had reached the ship and were clambering
through the port he saw paulette enter
and hands reached down to help petersen
and his unconscious burden they could
go up faster now another moment or
two and they would be safe adam gasped
in relief as he saw the open port close
above him three more rungs two
one

  something gripped his foot something

stories

that pulled and clung like a vise in spite
of his frantic kicking he looked down
twp of the plutonians had grabbed him
and bracing themselves were pulling fran-
tically helplessly he watched while
long powerful arms went out closed about
his other foot he felt it pulled from the
rung and now he hung there held only
by his arms that grasped the rung above
him arms that creaked in their sockets
until darting streaks of pain shot across
his eyes hands that were wet with sweat
slipping    slipping   

  quick sir here adams staring
eyes saw the huge figure of bjornsen lean-
ing from the port above him but so far
above him the man could never reach
him then he felt strong huge hands that
gripped him by the arm-pits and pulled
pulled until he thought his body must tear
in two but he was going up with the
last of his strength he kicked his feet vi-
ciously trying to dislodge those straining
sinewy hands that gripped his legs then
suddenly they let go like a limp bag
of sand he was hauled through the port
and lay gasping on the flooring quick
he croaked the door close it with
the clang of metal against metal he heard
it shut and lay back drawing in great
lungfuls of cool refreshing air after a
moment he clambered rockily to his feet
his eyes met those of bjornsen his hand
went out and was clasped in the nor-
wegians great paw thanks he said
quietly i shall never forget that he
shook his head and passed an aching arm
across his eyes some measure of strength
returned to him and with it the realization
that as officer in command there was much
to be done to your stations men pre-
pare to ascend immediately close the
inner hatch were not safe yet they
have our atomic drills and if they start
to use them on the ship were lost mr
wayland come with me jake to your
engines

  with paulette at their heels adam and
wayland hurried along the passages of
the great ship until they reached the con-
trol room engines ready jake he
asked into the radiophone stand by
very well mr wayland six ascensions
please

  wayland gasped six sir why thatll
expedition to pluto	

tear the ship to pieces she wont stand

it sir

  adam fixed him with cool eyes i said
six ascensions mr wayland

  way land opened his mouth to protest
further then closed it with a snap very
good sir six ascensions sir he seized
a lever to the left of the control board
moved it to neutral then shoved it hard
over six red lights glowed suddenly on
the board for a moment nothing hap-
pened then deep in the bowels of the great
ship a low almost inaudible whine started
like a siren it rose in pitch and tone until
it sounded like a hundred banshees scream-
ing and wailing a great shudder passed
through the ship from stem to stern like
a wounded beast struggling to rise she
strained upward from the bottom of the
icy ocean until it seemed she must tear
herself to flying screaming fragments
waylands eyes were filled with fear
paulette stared unblinkingly breathless at
adam little beads of sweat stole out on
his forehead but with a calm he didnt
feel he forced himself to keep his eyes on
the panel before him let me know the
moment were clear he ordered for a
long minute no one spoke then from the
control board a voice were clear sir

  waylands eyes lost their wild look a
great sigh heaved from his lips and he
slumped to trembling relaxation paulette
uttered a single glad cry then sank gently
to the floor while great sobs racked her
bowed head and trembling shoulders re-
duce to two ascensions mr wayland
adams voice was hoarsely unsteady in
two minutes plot your course and shift
your engines were heading home then
in two steps lie was beside paulette was
bending over to pick up the sobbing girl
he held her close with her arms curved
tightly around his neck and her head
buried in his broad shoulder

it was a quiet group that gathered some
two hours later in the main cabin of
the goddard every member of the
crew was there deep within the great hull
the engines were running smoothly out-
side the glassed ports the dark blue heavens
stretched away on all sides like the shim-
mer of a thousand diamonds against a

velvet backdrop the suns of the milky way

danced and glowed at adams side sat
wayland and paulette adam looked at
those before him at ease gentlemen
with the grace of good fortune we are on
our way home the expedition is a suc-
cess a success that is materially as
you all know we have lost captain mc-
causland and dr reuter if i am cor-
rect you all know also the reason and the
manner in which we lost them perhaps
captain mccausland is not entirely to
blame perhaps it is given to every great
man to fail once whatever the reason
he has always been-up to this trip-a hero
to all of us and to the world i must of
course make a complete report of his death
that report will be killed by the plutoni-
ans in defense of his ship and his crew 

   for a long moment no one spoke then
paulette with tears of happiness dimming
her eyes turned and gripped adams hand
in her own my dear she smiled
thank you as adam turned to her he
felt wayland gripping his other hand
tightly i understand sir nothing will
be said adam smiled tenderly at paulette
then his eyes turned anxiously to search
those of his crew on every face was a
commending grin of approval in every
pair of eyes was a promise that had been
given and would be kept with a sus-
picious huskiness in his voice adam drew
himself erect thank you gentlemen he
said softly the crew filed out

   with his arm around paulette he drew
her gently to the starboard port and
pointed to a dim fast-receding silver-
green orb there it is darling i dont
know whether to curse it or bless it he
grinned at her quizzically she came close
to him and her arms stole gently about
him ill bless it as long as i live she
breathed

   he held her close his head bowed to
meet her soft red lips

  beg pardon sir waylands voice
sounded far away

   yes adam did not turn his head

   the course it set sir any further or-
ders sir

  yes mr wayland one

   yes sir

flagship of the rocket-sliip fleet sped on its
way to the moon

  he moved to the forward telescope at
the side of the control cabin and squinted
at their objective the pale circular bulk
of the moon loomed larger than when he
had last observed it he twisted to look
through the rear telescope and saw with
satisfaction that the other seven ships of
his fleet were following in echelon each a
mile and somewhat to the right of the one
before it

  ross grinned with pleasure it wasnt
his first trip to the moon but on that
earlier occasion when magnus king of
the moon people had pledged a truce with
the earths council of seven he had com-
manded only the flagship now he had his
own flagship larger and more powerful
that that outmoded rocket ship of five years
ago and seven more fighting ships besides
he strolled over to stand behiud his navi-
gator plump bespectacled harrell moore
who was squinting strainedly through the
star-scope

how are the stars behaving harry
moores forehead was corrugated with
concern without taking his eye from the
scope he muttered sofdy something
funny going on bruce

  he moved back to let his chief step to
the eye-piece but before the flight-com-
mander could take the seat a sliding door
opened with a bang the two turned
startled

  in the opening swayed a white-faced
clerk sir he gasped theres trouble
with communications

  well snapped ross

  the clerk brushed sweat off his brow
the ray-type machines gone dead sir
and the ray-phones crippled we get only
a weak muffled voice from the council of
seven headquarters

  how about the blinkers from the other
ships snapped ross

  blinkers are working sir- the clerk
stopped short as ross jumped to the rear
of the control room

jorgens snapped ross signal each
ship and ask if theyve-they can get
seven headquarters on the ray-type
aye sir the signal chief hastened
to the blinker buttons and began to rap

out the message he was half through it
when a dull boom echoed like a sigh
through the control room

ross and moore exchanged startled
glances jorgens white of face looked
up his hand poised as if paralyzed over
the buttons then ross jumped to the
rear telescope which commanded a view
of his following seven sfoips

 there were only six where the
seventh-the last in the staggered-line-
should have been a faint glow filled the
air ross stared at it heart-sick was
that blow the last sign of his rear guard
a rocket ship blotted out-destroyed but
how how

  jorgens he snapped you had the
moon on the ray-type a while ago try
to get that peak one station again

  aye sir breathed jorgens shakily
he tapped the black key rattling the call
signal feverishly then snapped on the re-
ceiver the prong-like type fingers made
no move

  the ray-phone rasped ross

  the signal chief plugged the yellow
cylinder into its gray socket and flashed
the light beside it first fleet calling
peak one he chanted peak one
answer first earth fleet

  ross moore and jorgens held their
breath no sound came through the ray-
phone trumpet jorgens lifted a gray face
toward ross	-

  the fleet commander smiled wryly
let it go jorgens check all the bat-
teries and connections before you try
again

  as jorgens nodded and disappeared to
trail the snaky coils of insulated ray-tubes
to their batten- reserves ross turned to
moore number eights gone he said
softly

  moore blinked gone where

  where the woodbine twineth said
ross

  moores breath came faster wiped
out he whipped off his spectacles and
polished them absently his jaw working on
his half-forgotten chew of tobacco
gone he muttered dazedly

  a sudden thought struck ross he
gripped his navigators shoulder the
war-lords of the moon



stars you said there was something
funny going on

  moores eyes flashed yes he
slapped his glasses on come on let
me show you he led the way to the
star-scope

  ross following stopped as a signalman
approached with a typed message - the
answer to the blinker call that jorgens had
started the first sentence was short and
blunt number two reports ray-type
dead ray-phone weak messages from
the other five ships were identical except
in the case of number seven an added
sentence from the last ship of the line
stood out on the page and ross felt sick
inside as he read it number seven also
reports explosion on right quarter where
number eight was flying no sign of
number eight

at the star-scope moore hovered as
ross applied his eye to the powerful
lens thats denabola youre on the
navigators jaw worked his eyes glitter-
ing

  dim muttered ross clouds
no exploded moore denabola was
bright as ever then suddenly went dim
ross sat up quickly a question in his
staring eyes

  you mean-the way the red stars go
dim when we drain them of the red rays
that power our ships and inter-planet
communications 

  just that way said moore blinking in
excitement

  for a long moment their glances were
locked then ross heaved a stifled sigh
this may mean a lot harry he mur-
mured i wonder if it might not even
mean-

  whatever happened to number eight
asked moore quickly

  slowly ross nodded lets see dena-
bolas a blue star have you checked on
any other blue stars

  moore took the seat at the star scope
only vega shes dim too let me
get sirius he twirled a knob at the side
of the telescope barrel then another then
straightened with an explosive gasp
look at sirius

  ross looked and caught his breath

sirius the brightest star in all the firma-
ment was a dull lackluster thing

  flight-commander bruce ross sat back
at the star-scope and pushed his space hel-
met off his head he ran a steady hand
through his unruly blond hair smoothing
out the tight wrinkles in his bioad forehead
as if to silencethe urgent question that
hammered in his brain something was
happening in the jieavens and all his lore
of flying and fighting might be none too
much to set against the celestial puzzle

  harry he asked finally the moon
men know all about our red-ray work do
you suppose theyve gone to work some-
how on the blue stars 

  moore screwed up his face blinking be-
hind his glasses well he said finally
theres horta

  ross nodded i was thinking of
horta he admitted grimly he had never
forgotten horta lord of the moon
caverns the darkly hostile savant who had
held out so long at that fateful conference
when the council of seven rulers of the
earth had made their all-or-nothing flight
to the moon there to lay the question of
peace or war before magnus the moon
king and his lords the seven had won
horta over finally by offering him all the
earth secrets of the red rays that had
made earth-moon travel possible they
had even set up a ray reservoir in hortas
great cavern and had shown him how the
harnessed rays could provide power for
ships and explosive for sky-torpedoes
yet horta had never succeeded in building
any but tiny ships that could barely cir-
cle the moon and he had denied any suc-
cess with the torpedoes only on the
ray-type and the ray-phone essential to
earth-moon intercourse had he followed
instructions with real results

kinlue rays then muttered ross
xj staring at moore he turned as
jorgens appeared hesitantly well
garbled message by ray-phone from
our earth station sir from censor
trowbridge apparently jorgens handed
over a sheet of paper we put it down
as we heard it

  ross and moore bent over it eagerly
   trouble    moon    four   mag-


nus killed  

     bridge

  ross wheeled on jorgens
killed is that what you heard

  jorgens shook his head thats what it
sounded like he insisted he flicked a
hand at the ray-phone and thats all we
got she went dead on us but he
added hopefully the ray-type seems to be
coming to life

  good work on it jorgens and
try for the peak one moon station or
peak four ross watched jorgens join
the little group of signalmen toiling over
the ray-type machine and shook his head
did you get that harry magnus
killed

  moore blinked inquiringly do we go
on

  go on ross hesitated he read the
mangled dispatch then squared his shoul-
ders nothing here about turning back
so on we go heaven knows what well
find

  magnus dead moore shook his head
who takes over

  on the moon i happen to know be-
cause it came up at the conference five
years ago queen boada and the two chief
lords form a council of three thatll
be boada horta and artana lord of the
peaks you remember him 

  sure moore wagged his jaws chew-
ing reminiscently nice kid

well he was sixteen then hell be
twenty-one grown up and say remem-
ber the princess illeria she was four-
teen shell be nineteen now sweet kid
skinny grunted moore

  yes ross agreed absently well
well get a welcome from boada and
artana maybe horta will kick up a fuss
but hes the minority

  the ray-type machine came to life with
a faint rattle jorgens watched it crit-
ically then stared as the words ran out
on the page he waited for the sentence
to finish then snatched the sheet from the
machine and held it out in trembling fin-
gers to ross

  the message was brief ross read it
shoved it at moore and grasped the orders
tube gun crews he sang out load
fore and after torpedo tubes and stand

he waited for the aye sir to
sound from both gun stations then turned
back to moore

  the navigator was standing with jaw-
agape he repeated the message word for
word as if in a hypnotic spell nagasaki
destroyed purple death

  ross shook his arm harry snap out
of it weve got to fight

  fight what  sked moore dazedly

  i dont know rapped ross savagely
but at a guess id say the purple death
whatever that may be

 ii

the assistant navigator looked back
from his post by the helmsman
coming in to peak one sir he called
whats our speed asked ross

  two thousand sir

  cut her down to a thousand com-
manded ross any signals from the
peak

  the navigator shook his head nervously
none yet sir shall i cut speed if they
dont signal

  yes ross decided slow up as you
see fit and hover at fifty miles if they show 
no signal he gestured to his chief navi-
gator come on harry lets inspect
ship

  the two passed from the control room
to the gleaming engines here the silent
engine crew hearkened to the pulse of the
powerful rocket engine and kept steady
eyes on the gauges that showed the com-
pressed ray fuel was feeding steadily into
the discharger out of the engine room
they passed to the after gun station ross
tapped one of the six-inch torpedoes and
slapped one of the slim three-inch cylin-
ders in the number two torpedo rack we
may need them all soon he told the sta-
tion chief

  the gunnery chiefs eyes widened
well be ready sir can you-is there
anything i can tell the men about-num-
ber eight

  ross shook his head shes gone he
said briefly might have been an acci-
dental explosion-but i dont think so
were landing soon just be ready thats
all

   planet stories

it ended with by

    magnus-
war-lords of the moon



  he swung away to the forward gun
station saw that all hands were alert and
led the way back to the control room
jorgens was pulling a sheet from the ray-
type he handed it over quickly

  it was from the moon warning to
earth fleet it began peak one
wrecked come in on peak four and
it was signed artana

  ross strode forward his blue eyes blaz-
ing thats all jorgens

  no sir more coming now he
waited until the flying keys had rattled out
two more lines then ripped the sheet off
this message told more

peak one wrecked by rebels who as-
sassinated king magnus signal systems
at peaks one two and three destroyed
greetings to commander ross artana
rebels exclaimed ross

  horta  murmured moore

  the chief signalman caught the name
that louse he exclaimed in disgust
pretended we couldnt teach him any-
thing the time we set up his systems for
him hes raising hell on the moon com-
mander 

  ross frowned thats just a guess
jorgens he reproved the signalman we
only know this much for sure he tapped
the two sheets

  huh ten to one that blue-nosed
devils in it grumbled jorgens turning
back to the ray-type want to answer
chief 

  yes ross thought rapidly he
spoke in a low tone to moore this might
be a trap

  moore blinked you mean artana
sent this to decoy us in to four and smash
us 

not artana corrected ross horta
gosh yes moore fumbled his
glasses off i hadnt thought of that
no reason why horta couldnt send a
message in artanas name

   its a possibility ross grinned sourly
he turned to jorgens send this
greetings to artana lord of the peaks
from ross coming in to peak four
repeat it too in case they arent getting
it any too clear he wheeled to the
helmsman noted the speed was cut down
now to six hundred miles and nodded

approval change course for peak four
moore laid an urgent hand on his chiefs
arm as the helmsman obeyed say
bruce this is risky

  risky ross laughed shortly of
course its risky

   wouldnt it be better to stand off and
wait for more news

  ross shook his head his eyes blazed
harry theres a lot of hell breaking out
on the earth and on the moon too were
in the middle we cant be in both places
but we can find out-i hope-whats go-
ing on up here and if we do maybe we
can put a heavy foot on whats happening
to the earth do you remember what
trowbridges message said

   moores ordinarily placid features tight-
ened the purple death he whispered
youre the boss bruce all i want is to
get in on whatever happens

the earth fleet slid slowly down to
the craters the pale surface of the
moon gleamed dully phosphorescent lam-
bent where the rays of the sun struck
crater tops off to the left the high peak
peak number one to the earth visitors
loomed dark and sinister

  but peak four showed all its lights
bright and steady ross ordered the six
following ships to stand off and await
orders or act on their own judgment if
the flagship came to harm then he took
his place beside the helmsman take her
down slow he ordered

   the rocket ship glided straight and sure
for the brightest light slowly the pin-
point of white fire became a circle then an
oral then it broke up into hundreds of
lights surrounding a platform the helms-
man muttered an order and the rocket
ship answering the urge of her flippers
dived briefly and straightened out into a
glide from the control windows the
shape of the platform took form and dim
little figures could be seen scurrying on
its edges

  moore fidgeted uneasily well be
duck soup for them if its horta he mut-
tered

  ross chuckled wheres your sporting
blood he jibed bet you even mone
its artana
	planet

  thats an easy bet for you retorted
moore you wont live long enough to
pay off if its horta

  the crew of the ship seemed to sliare
his fears every man hunched tense at his
station the ship glided lower to three
hundred feet two hundred she lost
way almost entirely and grounded with
scarcely a jar

  nice set-down ross complimented
the helmsman

  instantly the crew sighed in unison
tension was broken they peered
through the windows

  back to your stations rapped ross
he glanced through the control port and
immediately saw a group advancing
toward the ship for an instant he held
his breath then he whooped its
artana

  the crew cheered briefly knowing
nothing of the importance of that single
identification two artisans stood by the
gangway waiting

  secure your helmets men shouted
ross he adjusted his own headgear
made sure that the thin tubes from his
breastplate were feeding their tiny jets of
oxygen to his nostrils and signaled to the
artisans they threw the door wide and
ross stepped forth to meet artana

  the young lord of the peaks came for-
ward with a glad cry ross he ex-
claimed and grasped the earth-mans hand
warmly

  artana cried ross he eyed the
moon lord from head to foot and
grinned youve grown lord of the
peaks

the boy he remembered was indeed
now a man matching the six-foot
ross in height he stood straight and slen-
der carrying easily the weight of the
ray-rifle slung on his shoulder and the
poison-pistol at his belt he smiled briefly
at the earth-mans sally then sobered at
once

  you come at a critical time he mur-
mured pitching his voice so that his half-
dozen followers could not hear the
moon people are divided by revolt and
the fate of the kingdom is not easy to
predict he caught sight of moore

stories

ah my friend harrell moore his
hand went out in a warm clasp

  hi artana returned the navigator
awkwardly youre looking great
whats the trouble ill guess its horta
softly uneasily the lord of the
peaks glanced about him let us go to
the peak chamber where we may speak at
ease he led the way from the plat-
form halting only to allow ross to relay
an order for his six ships to land
through a winding subterranean corridor
they hastened to the council room of the
peak which marked the administrative
center of one of artanas provinces once
inside the great room artana led them
to low divans of stone covered and made
comfortable with soft cellulose-like stuff
that rustled as they moved he gave them
the news bluntly without preamble

  horta has seized power in two-thirds
of the kingdom he cried his voice break-
ing with emotion king magnus was
killed perhaps not by hortas orders-
but who else would have plotted it the
assassination seemed to be the signal for
an uprising-and horta issued a proclama-
tion as one of the three regents declar-
ing that he would act to preserve order in
the caverns and the land beyond where
the crater folk live three of the peaks
were overrun and the signal systems were
all destroyed here at peak four my sol-
diers were ready and all the rebels were
slain

  queen boada-and the princess -
ria asked ross

  they are safe artana twisted on his
couch in his distress they were at peak
five when the attacks were made and are
coming here escorted by a strong body
of my troops i expect them soon but
you my friends how can i receive you
when my people are embroiled in civil war
-for that is what it is

  ross waved his hand deprecatingly
dont worry about us artana of
course we cant take sides here we can
help to preserve the regency since the
truce demands it but theres one thing
id like to ask

  of course my friend

  have you heard of trouble on the
earth 
war-lords of the moojv



  artana looked up quickly we have
had no word

  or-well trouble in the sky

  artana shook his head puzzled

  ross answered his unspoken question
one of our ships was destroyed on our
flight from the earth and i dont think
it was an accident

  a rocket ship artana sat up then
his eyes flashed horta he murmured
as if asking himself a question

  moore leaned forward has horta
been up to anything in the ray business 
he asked eagerly

  artana shook his head slowly lord
horta and his savants have made progress
in employing the r-ray drawn from the
red stars as you taught him he knit
his brows i have heard of nothing else
-but wait he and his most learned
men have worked secretly for many moons

i	know not to what purpose you think-
we think cut in ross grimly that
its possible that lord horta may be cook-
ing up something new in the ray field
artanas face darkened if that is
true he murmured we may have the
explanation of the disappearance of two
of my brigades i sent them out in force
to scout hortas territory no word has
come from them his hand clenched
a war of rays-here on the moon

ross and moore exchanged uncom-
fortable glances they had fought
in the terrible war on the earth when na-
tions battled with the new red ray and
whole fleets of the ancient steel warships
were sunk by the first of the ray-torpedoes
before the council of seven was formed to
rule all earthly affairs and they had
served in that first moon-flight and had
slain with rays the first moon armies who
had resisted the intrusion of the earth-
fleet was history to repeat itself-in re-
verse with hortas moon machines raking
the earth with death perhaps that
strange purple death of the trowbridge
message 

  ross made his resolve if your armies
cant find out what hortas doing artana
perhaps my fleet can

  your fleet artana looked up a flicker
of hope in his somber eyes you mean

  that you would fly over the caverns
ross nodded and study the work he
has done photograph it and report to
you and the queen if you then wish us
to try to destroy it ill take the respon-
sibility i feel that the council of seven
would approve

  artana stood up his eyes alight ah
ross if you succeed and bring peace
to the moon people your planet and mine
will do you homage

  ross flushed sheepishly well maybe
for my part id rather be overlooked
you know theres an old old saying
where i come from a hero today a bum
tomorrow 

  a bum echoed artana puzzled
a-a sort of- ross remembered in
time that there were no beggars on the
moon nor panhandlers nor paupers nor
hobos oh never mind well take off
in the first hour of light and see what
we can see

  in the meantime artana hastened to
say you must sleep he ushered them
into a circular chamber the elevator that
would take them to the spacious under-
world of the moon closing the door he
pressed a button the resultant motion
was almost imperceptible but ross and
moore knew they were being hurtled
toward the moons core at hundreds of
miles an hour almost instantly the cham-
ber stopped the shock of cessation being
oddly cushioned artana opened the door
and the three stepped into the great ro-
tunda whence radiated the life and activity
of the province of peak four moon
people hurried to and fro only a few
stopped to stare at the earth-men bakers
were hawking the curious brick-shaped
loafs of bread and the fruits that had
grown from the seeds from the earth were
stacked on stands drapers stood by their
gossamer-like fabrics soldiers hurried to
and fro in squads and their presence ex-
plained to ross and moore the inhab-
itants disinterest in the earth-men

  the spacious chamber to which artana
led them was guarded by two tall sentries
and tastefully furnished the lord of
the peaks cast a last glance about said
i shall call you at the first light and
vanished
	planet stories

  moore sank gratefully down upon a
high-piled bed well if this is to be my
last nights sleep im going to do well
with it

  youre always worrying chaffed ross
but he lay awake mind racing long after
moores even breathing denoted that the
chubby navigators fears had succumbed to
his fatigue

ill

artana awakened them as he had
promised his first words were of
the widowed queen boada is here he
told ross she has slept and will greet
you after you have eaten

  they breakfasted in the chamber on
food that artana had commandeered from
the rocket ship with some of the pale
delicious moon pears beside the familiar
earth fare artana talked fast as the
two earth-men ate

  two of the cavern men came in with
the queen as the two flyers looked up
in plain surprise he smiled yes they
were h ortas men but they say they do
not wish to serve him longer they say
he plans to rule the moon kingdom alone
and will make war with the earth
the two leaned forward food forgot-
ten did they say asked ross how
horta plans to make war with what
weapons

  artana shook his head sadly they
deny all knowledge of such things they
are star savants and they say all hortas
war secrets are known only to his war
chiefs

  the flyers disappointment impelled
artana to go on they do say that horta
and most of his forces arc gathered in the
great cavern where all his secrets are
kept and that too is where he has set
up his ray machines

  ross narrowed his eyes the great
cavern eh well thats what well have
a shot at

  you would have me accompany you
artana asked eagerly

  ah no artana you are needed here
what if horta were to make a sudden at-
tack you must give us a guide though
to show us the great cavern and i will

  leave my chief signalman jorgens so that
we may keep in touch with you

  artana assented somewhat cast down
truly the great cavern held a secret
and the lord of the peaks was as eager
as any to learn it but he regained his
cheerfulness as they sought out the queen

  she was in the great chamber where
artana had first received the earth-men
erect and haughty she sat on the central
divan regarding them with brooding eyes
as they entered so much ross saw be-
fore his glance went to the slim figure
beside her he caught his breath

  a dream a goddess this girl-ah
yes the princess illeria but a woman
now not the scrawny girl of five years
ago ross tore his eyes from her with a
jerk artana was presenting him to the
queen widow

  -commander ross leader of the
earth-fleet was a visitor at court five years
ago artana reminded the queen

  she extended her hand surveying him
with a softening of her austere expression
as he bent over it-she said in a harsh
voice that was obviously held steady with
an effort commander ross you come at
an unhappy time

  ross murmured condolences then
plunged into the subject that was filling
him with impatience i seek permission
from you queen and from the lord
artana to fly over the caverns and report
on conditions there

  queen boada darted a sharp glance at
artana then averted her head i see no
occasion for such a flight she said curtly

  artana stepped forward a rebellion

o	queen  surely that is occasion
enough 

  she met his eyes frowning but these
are not our people

  yet argued artana the earth people
are at peace with us

  ross saw the princess regarding her
mother curiously moore too was star-
ing in frank astonishment at the queen
as she sensed their intent regard she re-
laxed her rigid pose oh very well but
there shall be no fighting

none o queen ross hastened to say
artana nodded with satisfaction
there remains then the finding of a
war-lords of the moon	

guide for the fleet i could send
cajisto-

  the princess spoke for the first time
calisto has not the gift of the earth-
tongue who guides the commander ross
must speak the tongue he knows best

  thats true muttered artana taken
aback who then-

the princess was looking at ross
almost hostilely he thought con-
fusedly had she resented his long open
stare she was such a picture clad in
only a single filmy garment caught at the
waist with a gold twisted belt and cut
tunic-like at the knee bare-armed with
softly swelling contours and a skin like
peach down she was an entrancing sight

  his confused thoughts were set at rest
the princess had a plan i shall go with
the commander ross she said

  the queen turned sharply artana
scowled no no he cried sharply if
there should be fighting-

  fighting echoed boada in a whip-like
tone

  no no not fighting artana hastened
to correct himself but danger perhaps

  boadas brooding gaze came to rest in-
quiringly on ross

  there can be no danger i think he
assured her and wondered why he did
so for if horta was on the war path
surely the earth ships would be his targets

  he felt his heart beat faster as he con-
sidered the possibility of this amazing girl
standing beside him in the control room
of his flagship then a moment of depres-
sion as he reflected that the queen would
refuse her consent but to his surprise
boada after one dark look at the lord
of the peaks nodded

  they left at once there was a moment
of delay when illeria given an oxygen
helmet demurred at the idea of wearing
it until she was convinced that it would
save her life if the shell of the rocket ship
were pierced in the upper air she wore
it with ease the straps fitting snugly over
the flowing golden locks and the oxygen
tubes crossing her face to add to the
piquant enigmatic look she wore

  the flagship took off with a rush the
six following ships keeping their distance

once in the air they formed the echelon
then ross turned to the princess and led
her to the telescopes trained through the
floor of the ship

  she studied the crater surfaces wonder-
ingly like a child with a strange toy then
she remembered her duty sail there
she directed pointing

  amusedly ross gave the order pri-
vately artana had given him a full de-
scription of the great cavern so that once
he had sighted it he could map his own
course but the girl had guided him truly
in a few minutes the yawning chasm lay
on their bow

  he called moore all the cameras set 
all set grunted moore squinting
through a glass going to skirt the cav-
ern 

  ross nodded no use tipping horta
off at the outset we may get a good
look without his knowing were here

  as the last word left his lips a cry from
the port lookout froze the three in their
places they turned fearfully the look-
outs face was working as they watched
tears began to stream down his face he
tried to speak but he could only point

  ross sprang to the winddw the sky
was clear save for the following ships
number two and four and five six
where was six and seven he
whirled on the lookout

  the man gulped drew a deep breath
and said huskily there was a flash sir
and-and then-nothing nothing where
number seven was flying and then
number six-went the same way

  ross and moore stared frantically at
one another then ross sprang to the
signal post jorgens wheres jor-
gens

  a white-faced signal-man spoke up
hes back at peak four sir

  oh yes ross in his agitation had
forgotten well signal ships two
three four and five to sheer off the
cavern and return to peak four

  the man sprang to obey ross turned
to order the course changed but the
crashing din that followed silenced him
his body hurtled against the stanchion
and suddenly he found his arms about the
princess illeria


planet stories

her body was soft to his touch her
silky hair caressed his cheek her
breath sweet on his face but he pushed
her aside and cried out to the helmsman
how does she fly

  the helmsman craning his neck as he
curled an arm about the wheel shouted
back on even keel sir but she wont
steer 

  ross pushed the princess unceremoni-
ously from him and stood erect he
rushed to the window and saw with relief
that the ship was circling away from the
crater gauges showed that the ship flew
steady except for that odd circling an
artisan bursting into the control room
from the after gun station explained the
mystery

  one rudder flange haywire sir

  so thats it ross spoke calmly
shot away

  the mans face worked burned away
sir

 burned- ross thought fast he
nodded to the artisan who departed with
a scared look about

 moore had heard the report he
whistled burned away huh sounds
like a b-ray

  b-ray whats that snapped ross
b for blue explained moore affably
hortas draining the blue stars or im no
harvard man

  ross eyed the navigator narrowly
you really think that

  what else countered moore calmly
horta was a washout on the r-ray-and
besides our red ray doesnt burn like that
i think hortas got something

  ross turned to the helmsman then
studied the chart that artana had pro-
vided we can circle just like this and
make peak four if we can cut that drag
a bit try reducing the speed

  it worked at reduced speed the ship
flew more truly with less pressure on the
rudder ross sighed in relief keep her
there he spied the princess leaning
against the stanchion and walked over
quite a scare wasnt it

  she regarded him steadily you do not
like me

  he gaped at her why do you say
that 

  you pushed me away from you

  oh that  ross was nettled a man
must fight his ship princess

  yes she nodded agreement but
i was afraid i thought we were doomed
and i wished you to be with me it is
not given to every woman to die with the
man of her choice and you are the man
i wish for

  ross stared open-mouthed say-ay
he asked cautiously you didnt get a
knock on the head did you

  she shook her head unsmilingly the
earth-girls they do not speak so to men 
ill say they dont ross assured her
feelingly

  oh said the princess illeria in a small
voice

  ross didnt know what to say then
well he exclaimed well soon be back
at peak four

  he was right but grim news awaited
them at the peak

iv

artana met them his face a thun-
dercloud he handed ross a ray-
typed message this came just before
you landed he said tensely

  before ross could read the message
the name signed to it caught his eye
horta the lord of the caverns was
coming out of his silence and with what
a greeting know o queen read
hortas message that i have destroyed
three of the earth-ships as i shall destroy
all who fly against the destiny of the moon
kingdom know too that i have de-
stroyed a second earth city the place called
los angeles as a warning to the earth
people that their destiny is not ours
ross read it with a sinking heart los
angeles a city of two million people
destroyed then it was horta who had
wiped out nagasaki	

  moore pounced on that thought naga-
saki then los angeles he muttered

  ross turned to artana any other
news 

  artana shook his head no but i
have a plan you know that when the
rains come we store them in the great
reservoirs so that our under-world may
war-lords of tee moon	

not be flooded then why not loose the
waters in the reservoirs and flood the
caverns-

  ross stared in admiration but he
slowly shook his head youd have to
kill half your people artana just to dis-
pose of horta

  but argued artana desperately
horta will destroy half our people him-
self to seize the kingdom and he will
destroy the earth folk too

  moore spoke up the reservoirs are
full

  no admitted artana the rains
have not been heavy the reservoirs are
but half full he sighed horta might
escape the flood

  thats no good then ross said em-
phatically tell you what moore and i
will go and scout the cavern on foot we
may be able to get near enough to the ray
works to smash em

  you would die artana said somberly
horta guards his cavern well

  ross nodded maybe but theres no
other chance horta can knock us down
out of the air and hes knocking earth
cities to dust he must be stopped if
we die you can hold out on the peaks
and flood him out when the rains come

  thats right artana moore agreed
but let me go chief ill take a couple
of good men you stay here

  no dice harry ross assured him
firmly im the head man and its my job
id like to have you along though
sure said moore mildly

  artana regarded them with admiration
you are brave men but what can i
do

   just sit tight artana and wait for the
rain to fall grinned moore and when
it comes avenge us

  that will i swore artana

they set out in the dark moore and
ross and the guide whom artana had
indicated with a gesture they had cov-
ered only half a mile when ross turned
sharply suspiciously to the guide sure
you speak the earth tongue he de-
manded if you do why cant you say
something 

   the guide threw back the cowl-like head

covering and ross caught his breath ii-
leria what are you doing on this tour 
i go to die with you my lord said
the princess simply

  my lord squawked moore excuse
me he walked forward hurriedly

  ross his face burning in the gloom took
illerias arm roughly this is no job for
you princess there will be danger
even death agreed the slim princess
equably no matter and the lord ar-
tana is agreed that i go

  artana agreed ross was taken aback
he looked ahead to where moore waited
looked back over the way they had come
then shrugged oh well here we go

  happily illeria caught his arm and they
strode forward moore chuckled in the
dark everything settled

  yes dammit grated ross did you
ever see such a mess

  moores reply was sober we couldnt
have a better guide he pointed out and
we know the princess is loyal how could
we be sure of some other guide  a jigger
who might sell us out to the first horta
sentry

ross grunted agreement and they
trudged on they saw no one heard
no one until the first of the craters lay
behind and the moon terrain sloped down
and down into the caverns they came
upon the first two sentries suddenly both
swung their ray-guns up but moore was
quicker his gas-pistol spat twice and
the sentries crumpled

  are they dead asked the princess
amazed

  dead to the world-er i should say
dead to the moon ross assured her
theyll staythat way twelve hours which
ought to be long enough for us

  moore chuckled before then well be
on top of the world-i mean on top of
the moon-or dead heroes

  the way was easy a steady down slope
for a while then the rock formations
began they slipped and crawled the
princess suffered a cut on her knee but
shrugged at the suggestion of a bandage
the second set of sentries were easily
overpowered they lolled at ease against
a ridge and ross shot twice to gas them
	planet

to sleep here the light was better and
ross paused to look them over they were
darker than the peak men with less color
and their veins stood out against their
blue-white skin they bore the ray-rifle
of all the moon soldiers and another curi-
ous weapon besides a jagged-edged sword
with a hooked point

  its the old moon sword said illeria
horta worships the old customs and
swears by the beliefs of the astrologers
its the astrologers who direct his actions
my mother had said

  its a dirty weapon shuddered moore
ill take a ray-gun any time

  he came within an ace of regretting his
choice a moment later when a whole squad
of soldiers rounded an outcrop of rock
ross whispered a warning and shot fast
moore went into action then but not be-
fore one of the horta men had fired the
ray blasted past them and sheared off a
half-ton of rock behind them

  whew that was close gasped moore
as the last of the soldiers fell

  how about ray-guns now gibed ross
do you know i think were in luck this
party is evidently supposed to relieve the
sentries we met-so therell be no alarm
over their condition

  youre right exclaimed moore now
all we have to do is to get to that ray
machine

  they stood within sight of it when the
heavy hand of horta fell

in the shadows of the cavern they had
crept from arsenal to foundry until
they had inspected from tar or near every
establishment in this dim and fearsome
chasm and finally they saw it a great
cylinder nestling deep in the ground and
looming high in the cavern supported by
guy beams of gleaming metal

  a ray-gun cried moore his incau-
tious exclamation was their undoing a
half-clad foundry worker looking like a
gnome in his eye-shade helmet and droop-
ing gauntlets gaped at them ross shot
a split second too late to stop the shout
of alarm the foundryman dropped but
a dozen soldiers came on the run moore
and ross fired and fired again but they
went down in a charge of scores of horta

stormes

soldiers the flat of a sword struck ross
a stunning blow on the side of his head

  he came to his senses to find himself
in a strange room bound hand and foot
and prone on a stone floor beside him
was moore

  where are we muttered ross

  in hortas headquarters whispered
moore heres horta

  ross twisted his head he blinked for
horta was an eyeful

  the lord of the caverns was a giant
fully seven feet tall he must have weighed
four hundred pounds but he bore his
great bulk with ease and a certain dignity
he strode over to the two prisoners looked
them over with curiosity but without visi-
ble rancor and spoke sharply to a guard
in the moon tongue the guard hastened
to free the two flyers

  they exchanged glances of surprise
you dont suppose hes a pal in disguise
asked moore blandly he looked up with
a start when he heard a rumbling chuckle

  horta was amused no earthman
you are prisoners but i have no need
to bind you for you cannot escape yet
you need not fear death for if you will
stay and serve me you shall have life and
all the blessings that will be showered upon
a new kingdom

  new kingdom  moore blinked its
a regency isnt it

  hortas great laugh boomed out nay
i am the king and for my queen-
well you have delivered her to me

  ross sat up and stared you mean-
illeria

  horta chuckled as he nodded

  illeria ross stifled a curse his mind
raced the girl was a prisoner too he
spoke aloud easily well i guess we
can give your royal highness a hand
hey bruce moore expostulated
you dont mean-

  why not drawled ross turning to
face moore he winked we know a lot
that will pay our way with the new king-
dom

  moore blinked of course he as-
sented hastily sure

  horta stared suspiciously at the two
flyers make sure then that you have
no secret longings to return to earth he
war-lords of the moon



warned heavily for henceforth there
shall be no intercourse between moon and
earth the truce is ended

  ross ventured a question whatll you
do with the men of the peaks 

  horta smiled grimly they will sub-
mit or die he gestured imperiously
and the guards pushed the flyers forward
as horta strode from the room

   as they trailed behind moore whispered
he doesnt look like a killer

  probably a fanatic ross muttered
  whats the play

  watch our chance and wreck the ray
machine

  and us with it grumbled moore
  most likely ross agreed

  they entered a softly lit room in the
wake of horta as their eyes became
accustomed to the dim light they gasped
there was illeria but beside her was
the queen-boada 

she swept them with a glance in which
contempt was mingled with a kind of
pity you did not expect to see me here
she said harshly but i serve the destiny
of the moon the wise men have shown
me that the moon was never destined to
serve the earth but must stand with the
blue stars when the universe is rent
asunder and now the moon is ready to
defend itself tiianks to the new king
horta

  in the silence that followed ross heard
the girl gasp the queen spoke softly
and you my daughter shall be the new
queen wife of the almighty horta the
liberator

  not ross muttered between his teeth
if i can help it

  me too whispered moore

  the girl said nothing but her eyes
sought ross with piteous entreaty

  horta broke the silence the nuptials
shall be solemnized in tomorrows full
light you earthmen shall remain under
guard until you have given earnest proof
of your fealty

  the guards punched the two as horta
rapped an order in the moon tongue and
they allowed themselves to be led away
through a dim corridor they passed and
into a stone cell with oddly fashioned

stone bars and a door that slid on a metal

base locking them into their tomb

  ross circled the cell then shook his
head we couldnt get out of this with-
out a ray machine he muttered

  moore sat down against a wall guess
not say bruce did you hear the old
girl

  the universe is to be rent asunder
grunted ross where does that leave
us

  behind the eight ball as i believe they
used to say back in the twentieth century
grinned moore that is thats where we
would be if the universe really were to
be rent asunder

  oh grunted ross in heavy sarcasm
so it isnt going to happen

  gosh no chuckled moore its the
silliest kind of astrological fake discredited
two centuries ago where horta picked
it up i dont know probably he got some
power from the blue stars by accident and
his faker astrologists strung him along on
the big bust-up idea

  nice clean fun muttered ross well
we missed hortas still got his ray ma-
chine hes also got the princess-and
the queen for an ally

  hes also amended moore dryly got
us

and how grunted ross how long
do you suppose well last if we dont-

  he stopped abrupdy a faint noise came
to his ears hear that he asked puz-
zled

  moore cocked his head to one side
running water he remarked they
havent got a river down-

  a scream faint and far away took his
breath away another sounded and then
a chorus dimmed by space and the stone
walls suddenly ross and moore whirled
to face one another

  artana cried ross

  hes opened the reservoirs gasped
moore

  they leaped to their feet ross tried
the door savagely moore broke the skin
of his hands on the stout stone bars of the
window in a moment water was swirling
at their feet

moore stared down at it gloomily i
was two days on a raft in the middle of
	planet stories

the atlantic he sighed and i didnt
drown

   the water rose to their knees

v

ross tugged at the door you arent
drowned yet how did this door
open 

  from the outside grumbled moore
tugging with his chief it rolled-ha
its opening weve got it

  the door was sliding open a rush of
water swept them half off balance and
they splashed into the flood when the prin-
cess illeria catapulted into them
princess yelled moore good girl
ross gripped her arm whats going
on

  panic she panted clinging to him
horta and his steadiest men are at the
ray machine fighting to keep the water
out of the ray reservoir the queen went
with him im-afraid-

  cheer up ross consoled her and
lets get out of this he led the way out
of the cell water was waist deep in the
corridor ross pointed up an incline where
the swirling waters ran thinly looks
good he suggested he whirled then on
illeria where do you suppose we could
get some guns

  what good would they do growled
moore

  theres that ray machine ross re-
minded him

  oh yes but- moore shot a
glance at the princess dont forget-
the queen-

  ross scowled i know

  illeria touched his arm if the queen
must die that the moon people and the
earth folk may be saved let it be so she
urged simply

  the two men bit their lips

  come urged the girl there is a
guardroom above there must be weap-
ons

  i could use one of those antique hook-
em swords on old horta growled
moore

  they burst into the guardroom prepared
for sudden and violent action but the
great chamber was empty of moon men

on the walls hung ray rifles ross and
moore each snatched one

  now where asked moore

  ross surveyed the room windowed
on all sides it had only two doors the one
they had entered and another opposite
well try that ross decided what
weve got to find now is a spot that com-
mands the square where the ray machine is
bedded

  the sloping corridor led them to such
a spot on a balcony they stood and for
a moment were content to watch hortas
artisans toiling with sandbags and debris
to make barricades against the flood

  theyll do it too moore said aloud
voicing his chiefs thought

   artanas trick was probably just to help
us out ross judged he hadnt enough
water to flood em out

  moore fidgeted lets do something
bruce theres that ray reservoir think
these pop-guns will punch a hole in it
ross raised his rifie and lowered it as
suddenly for into sight beside the giant
horta walked queen boada moore ex-
claimed under his breath fingering his
rifle

   it was the princess illeria who snatch-
ing the rifle from moores hands leveled
it swiftly and fired as ross sought to
snatch it from her she faced him defiantly
let destiny rule us she exclaimed my
mother is an unhappy woman who stands
in the way of peace let me fire again 
her demand left ross irresolute as
he held her hand moore cried out they
spotted that shot bruce theyre looking
for us

  it was true horta stood legs spread
his fierce glance sweeping the open space
workers had begun to drop sandbags and
pick up guns ross loosed his hold

   lets fire together then he said heav-
ily the double shot may pierce that
thick metal aim at the muddy mark il-
leria  ready-fire

  the two rifles spat together moore
yelled youve done it duck-fast
they could not take cover fast enough
ross had one glimpse of a tremendous
sheet of flame licking out of the hole they
had blasted saw its counterpart high in
the sky at the mouth of the ray cylinder
war-lords of the moon



heard a great roar and seemed to know
nothing else

he regained consciousness on the
platform of peak four where his
flagship now repaired rested airily ar-
tana moore and illeria bent over him
solicitously

what happened he asked fretfully
artana spoke soberly the queen is
dead he turned to illeria dropped to
one knee and bowed his head long live
the queen

  ross glanced at moore the navigator
winked order is restored chief he
explained that blow-up finished horta
and all his works and earth is on the
phone all serene there since the los
angeles disaster you are ordered to re-
turn and report

  illeria dropped to her knees beside ross
you will not go you will stay-and my
people shall make you king

ross looked long into her eyes and the

earth seemed far away and an unreal
world but he slowly shook his head as
he rose and gently lifted her to her feet
i must go illeria he said but-per-
haps i shall return good-bye artana
you will restore peace to the moon

  the lord of the peaks bowed his head
that i will farewell ross

  with one last glance at the white-faced
princess ross nodded shortly to moore
they strode to their ship without a back-
ward glance at a curt order the helms-
man took her off and in seconds the two
figures on peak fours platform had dwin-
dled to specks

  you can come back moore grunted
  think so

  sure when the council hears what
youve done theyll give you twenty years
leave with pay

  ross smiled and the smile lingered
as he turned to jorgens to dictate a mes-
sage for the earth the rocket ship droned
on through space

   cave-dwellers of saturn

by john wiggin

  across earths radiant civilization lay the death-shot shadows of
  the hideous glohe-headed dwarfs from mars one lone earth-ship
  dared the treachery blockade risking the planetoid peril to find
  earths life element on mysterious saturn of the ten terrible rings

  it was a crisp clear morning in the	snow-covered hills gleamed whitely but the

  city of copia a cold winters sun	streets of copia were dry and clean there

  glinted on the myriad roof tops of the	were not many people stirring at such an

  vast spreading metropolis to the north	early hour the dozen broad avenues

  
cave-dwellers of saturn	

which converged like the spokes of a great
wheel on government city in the center of
copia were quite deserted there was lit-
tle apparent activity around and about the
majestic government buildings but the
four mammoth gates were open indicating
that government city was open for busi-
ness

  at the north gate the sentry sitting be-
hind his black panel with its clusters of lit-
tle lights switches and push-buttons
glanced upward there was a faint hum-
ming and a man was circling downward
about a hundred feet above him the rays
of the early sun flashed off a helmet and
the sentry knew that this man was a sol-
dier the newcomer dropped rapidly the
stubbed wings on his back a gray blur
then the humming ceased as the soldier
switched off his oscillator and landed lightly
on the ground before the sentry

  the sentrys swift glance took in the im-
mensely tall broad-shouldered figure cov-
ered to the ankles in the green cloak he
took in also the pink smiling face and
merry blue eyes and the lock of bright
red hair which showed as the soldier
pushed his helmet backward off his fore-
head

  your business asked the sentry

  i have orders to report to the com-
irander-in-chief said the soldier with a
pleasant smile

  lets see said the sentry glancing at
the insignia on the helmet youre a de-
curion of the eightieth division and the
name 

  dvnamon said the soldier

  oh yes said the sentry with a recol-
lective smile i remember you as an ath-
lete didnt i see you in the regional
games two years ago

  yes said the soldier with pleased
surprise i was on the team from north
central b

  i thought so the sentry chuckled as
i remember you walked away with practi-
cally everything but the stadium hold on
a minute now and ill clear the channels
for you

  the sentry bent over the panels
punched some buttons threw a switch and
recited a few words in a monotone he

-planet stories-winter

listened for a moment then threw the
switch back and looked up

  it seems youre expected he said
third building to the right and theyll
take care of you there

  ten minutes later dynamon stood in the
doorway of a large beautiful room and
saluted the salute was answered by a
grizzled dark-skinned man sitting behind
an enormous desk this man was argal-
lum commander-in-chief of the armies
of the world he rose and- beckoned to
the young soldier

  this way dynamon said he opening
a small door what we have to talk
about requires platinum walls

  dynamons face was a mask as he fol-
lowed the commander-in-chief into the
little room but his heart was pounding
and his mind working fast the platinum
room that meant that he was about to
learn a secret of the most vital importance
to the world he remembered now that
there was a delegation of martians in co-
pia they had arrived about a week be-
fore ostensibly to carry on negotiations
in an effort to avert the ugly crisis that
was developing between earth and mars
but the conviction was growing among
the citizens of copia that the chief object
of the martian delegation was to spy it
was a well-known fact that the grotesque
little men from the red planet had a super-
human sense of hearing that seemed to
enable them to tune in on spoken conversa-
tions miles away much as human beings
tuned radio sets they could hear through
walls of brick stone or steel the one sub-
stance they could not hear through was
platinum hence the little room off the
commander-in-chiefs office which was en-
tirely sheathed in this precious metal

argallum sat down heavily behind
a little desk and gestured dynamon
to be seated opposite him

  on the basis of your fine record said
argallum i have selected you dynamon
to lead a dangerous expedition you may
refuse the assignment after you hear about
it and no blame will attach to you if you
do it is dangerous and your chances of
returning from it are unknown but here
it is anyway


planet stories

  the situation with mars is growing
worse each month they are making de-
mands on us which if we accepted them
would destroy the sovereign independence
of the world-state we would become a
mere political satellite of mars but if we
dont accept their demands we are liable
to a sudden attack from them which we
could not withstand they have got us in
a military way and they know it we might
be able to stand them off for a while with
our fine air force but if they ever got a
foothold with their land forces then its
good-bye they have a new weapon called
the photo-atomic ray against which we
have absolutely no defense its a secret
lethal ray which far outranges our voltage-
bombs and which penetrates any armor or
insulation weve got

  now of course our council of scien-
tists has been working on the problem of
a defense against the ray but the only
thing theyve come up with is a vague idea
they believe that there is a substance
which they call tridium which would ab-
sorb or neutralize the photo-atomic ray
they dont know what tridium looks like
but by spectro-analysis they know that it
exists on the planet saturn so i am
sending you with an expedition to saturn
to find if you can the substance known as
tridium and bring some of it back if pos-
sible

  saturn gasped the decurion

  i said it would be dangerous argal-
lum said bleakly no human being has
ever set foot on the planet and very little
is known about it but thats where youll
find tridium if were to believe saturns
spectrum you will have the latest fast-
est cosmos carrier you will have a com-
pletely equipped expedition you will have
for assistants the best young men we can
find as head of the expedition you will
be promoted to the rank of centurion do
you accept the assignment

  yes sir said dynamon unhesitat-
ingly i accept the assignment

dynamon walked thoughtfully out
of government city by the north
gate the sentry noticed that his helmet
was now adorned with the badge of cen-
turion and came to a smart salute dyna-

mon went past him without seeing him and
the sentry glared after the new centurion
disapprovingly lost in thought dynamon
kept on walking until he came to with a
start and found himself in the middle of
the shopping district

  the sun was getting uncomfortably
warm and dynamon switched off the elec-
tric current that heated his long cloak and
looked around him a sign in a shop win-
dow said only fourteen more shopping
days before the twenty-fifth of decem-
ber dynamon sighed he wouldnt be
around on this twenty-fifth and it was
going to be a very gay one it was to be
the nine hundredth anniversary of the
great armistice-from which had come the
unification of all the peoples of the earth
dynamon sighed again

  the long peace was threatened

  the earth in this year of grace 
was a wonderful place to live in and copia
was the political and cultural center of the
earth for nine hundred years now the
peoples of the earth had lived at peace
with one another as members of a single
integrated community the world-state
had grown into something which that war-
torn handful of people back in  could
scarcely have imagined no longer did
region war against region or group against
group or class against class humanity
had finally united to fight the common ene-
mies-death disease old age starvation

  and on this nine hundredth anniversary
of the great armistice the people of the
world would have a great deal to cele-
brate disease was now unknown as was
starvation arduous physical labor was
abolished for now the heaviest and the
slightest tasks were performed by ma-
chines pain had been reduced both phys-
ical and mental helpless senility was a
thing of the past death alone remained
but even death had been postponed hu-
man beings now lived to be almost three
hundred years old

  all in all dynamon mused as he
strolled along the broad avenue the hu-
man race had eveloved a pretty satisfac-
tory civilization more was the pity then
that human restlessness and vaulting am-
bition should have led to the construction
of the great cosmos carriers if man
cave-dwellers of saturn



had been content to stay on his own little
planet then communication would never
have been established with the jeolous lit-
tle men of mars and this beautiful civiliza-
tion would not now be threatened by a
visitation of the terrible martians and their
frightful photo-atomic ray dynamons
deep chest swelled a little with pride at the
thought that he had been selected by the
commander-in-chief to take an important
part in the coming conflict

he turned the corner and found him-
self standing before an imposing
building across the top of the facade in
block letters was the legend state thea-
ter of comedy a few minutes later he
stood in front of a doorway at the side
of the great theater building the door
opened and a tall lovely girl appeared

  dynamon she exclaimed i didnt
expect to see you for another ten days
she stepped out of the doorway and
reached her arms up impulsively kissing
dynamon

  the tall young soldier gripped her shoul-
ders hard for a minute and then stepped
back and looked down into her soft brown
eyes

  yes i know keltry he said soberly
i had to report on short notice

  oh said the girl called keltry are
you here on duty

  very secret duty said dynamon with
a meaning lock he twiddled an imaginary
radio-dial in his ear and looked around
mysteriously

  the smile died on keltrys smooth
brown face to be replaced by an expres-
sion of concern

  you mean-them she whispered

  dynamon nodded yes i am being
transferred to a new post he said slowly
and i thought if you had no objections
i would ask to have you transferred along
with me

  do you need -to ask a question like
that said keltry you know perfectly
well id have a lot of objections if you
didnt ask for my transfer

  there may be some danger he said
giving her an eloquent look

  all the more reason why i should be
with you keltry said quietly

four days later a conference was
breaking up in the platinum room be-
hind the commander-in-chiefs office ar-
gallum stood up behind his desk and care-
fully folded a number of big charts he
laid one on tcp of another making a neat
stack on the desk then he looked keenly
at the four young men standing before
him

  once more gentlemen argallum said
for the sake of emphasis i repeat-dyna-
mon has complete authority over the expe-
dition you mortoch-looking at a lean
hawk-nosed man in a soldiers helmet-
are in command of the soldiers and you
thamon-turning to a studious stoop-
shouldered man-are in charge of civilian
activities and borion-glancing at a
stocky broad-shouldered figure-you are
responsible for the carrier but in the
last analysis you are all under dynamons
orders this is a desperate venture youre
going on and there can be no division of
authority

  there was a moment of silence argal-
lum seemed satisfied with the set deter-
mined expressions on the four men in the
room with him are there any further
questions he said

  dynamon shifted his feet uneasily is
the decision-on keltry final he said
huskily

  im afraid it is dynamon said argal-
lum gently i had the director of the
theater over here for half an hour trying
to talk him around but it was no good
he said he would under no circumstances
spare keltry he said she was the most
promising young actress in copia and that
he would forbid her to go on any danger-
ous trip inasmuch as keltry is stil an
apprentice the director has full authority
over her i can do nothing

  dynamon drew himself up to his full
height and squared his shoulders yes
sir he said briefly

  very well then said argallum i
wont see you again you will take off
from vanadium field promptly at four
oclock tomorrow morning every one of
the one hundred and twenty-nine people on
the expedition has his secret orders to be
there at three dynamon you have a hand-
picked personnel and every possible re-


planet stories

source that our scientists could think of
to help you may you succeed in your
mission

  thank you sir they chorused
argallum shook hands separately with
each of the four men after which they
filed out of the platinum room

  outside the war building mortoch the
decurion and borion the navigator took
their leave of dynamon and strolled away
toward the west gate but thamon the
scientist fell in stride with dynamon

  for your sake im sorry said the
stoop-shouldered scientist shyly i mean-
about keltry

  thanks thamon said the centurion
it was a nasty blow i dont know how
im going to get along without her i
guess ill just have to

  well-i just wanted you to know
said thamon that i sympathized

in the middle of vanadium field a great
gray shape like a vast slumbering
whale could be indistinctly seen in the
soft half-light of the false dawn no
lights showed on the field and  sound
was heard but scores of people clustered
around the sides of the cosmos carrier
dwarfed to ant-like proportions by its great
size inside the carrier standing near the
thick double doors in the carriers belly
was dynamon near him his three chief
lieutenants mortoch thamon and bo-
rion the members of the little expedi-
tionary force filed past the youthful com-
mander each one halting before him for
a brief inspection one hundred brawny
soldiers divided into squads of ten stepped
through the double doors each squad led
by its decurion dynamon ran a practiced
eye over the equipment of each man and
then for good measure turned him over to
the scrutiny of the chief decurion mor-
toch then came twenty-five civilians in-
cluding ten engineers four dieticians five
administrators and six scientists but for
a cruel prank of fate dynamon reflected
his own dear keltry would be a member
of the expedition

   but there was no time for regretting that
which could not be dynamon turned and
walked toward borion

  are you satisfied he asked the navi-

gator borion nodded and mortoch and
thamon likewise nodded in answer to
dynamons unspoken question

  all right said the young centurion
stations

  a moment later the great outer door of
the cosmos carrier swung silently shut
after which the thick inner door was se-
cured and the great ship hermetically
sealed dynamon followed the navigator
into the control room

  this is a gorgeous ship said borion
its absolutely the last word theres a
cluster of magnets underneath our feet
that are brutes and yet they can be so
finely controlled ill guarantee you wont
feel a bump at any time dynamon these
magnets are so strong that this ship will
go at least ten times faster than anything
that has yet been built once we get up
out of the stratosphere beyond the dan-
ger of friction we can go almost twenty
miles a second you ready for the take-
off if you want to use the loud speaker
system just throw that switch

  dynamon nodded a moment later his
voice was heard in every compartment of
the cosmos carrier

  men we are taking off hold your
stations for five minutes after which you
may take your ease until further com-
mands

  come and watch the altimeter borion
said after dynamon closed the loud speaker
switch you wont believe were off the
ground these controls are so smooth the
centurion watched the needle creep gently
upward a few feet at a time but he could
feel no trace of motion

  im going to take her up vertically to
two thousand feet said borion then
well be clear of all obstacles and can pick
up our course horizontally-

  yes good dynamon broke in quickly
but dont tell me your course until we are
out of the stratosphere

  aye aye sir said borion with a
wink little pitchers have big ears dont
they 

  how soon will we get out of the strato-
sphere dynamon asked

  well im lifting her very slowly an-
swered the navigator i dont want to take
any chances on friction i would say in
cave-dwellers of saturn	

about three hours from now we will be
ready to go

  i will be with you then said dyna-
mon and walked out the door

the young centurion had in mind to
make a thorough inspection of the en-
tire ship but he had scarcely been ten min-
utes away from the control room when the
loud-speaker system boomed forth

  centurion dynamon is requested to
come to the control room dynamon hur-
ried up a metal staircase and then through
a companionway as he threw open the
door to the control room borion turned
quickly and laid a finger on his lips then
the navigator gestured dynamon toward a
series of glass panels there were six of
these panels each about a foot square and
ranged in two vertical rows of three each
one word periscopes was stenciled at
the top and beside each mirror were other
labels port bow port beam port
quarter the other three panels were la-
beled in the same way designating their
location on the starboard side borion
flicked the switch beside the starboard
quarter panel and it become dimly illu-
minated dynamon threw a swift glance
at the altimeter and saw that it said two
thousand feet then he bent over and
peered into the periscope panel a wide
panorama of twinkling lights spread out
before him the street lights of copia but
the pale blue of approaching dawn was
creeping fast over the city shedding just
enough light to reveal a dark shape a mile
behind the cosmos carrier and perhaps a
thousand feet below as dynamon stared
into the periscope screen he thought he
could detect a faint glow of red in the
following shape he turned questioningly
to borion the navigator was writing rap-
idly on a piece of paper a second later
he handed the paper to dynamon it said
i queried headquarters and was told
that the conference with the martian dele-
gation is still officially going on but that
carrier following us is bright red the color
of the martian carriers

dynamon held the piece of paper in
his hand for a minute and gazed
doubtfully into the periscope screen then

he took the pencil from borion and bend-
ing over wrote the following

  i dont like the looks of this can we
outrun them once we get out of the at-
mosphere 

  borion nodded slowly

  as far as i know we can he said
unless- he reached for the paper in
dynamons hand and wrote -unless they
have developed a new wrinkle in their car-
riers that we dont know anything about
well said dynamon we wont waste
time worrying about things over which we
have no control proceed as usual

  there followed some anxious hours
which dynamon spent with his eyes glued
to the periscope mirror in a short time
the early golden rajs of the sun appeared
and the martian carrier followed behind
inexorably glowed an ugly menacing crim-
son once dynamon instructed his com-
munications officer to speak to the martian
ship

  lovely morning mars where are
you bound for was the casual message

  there came back a terse answer test
flight and you

  were testing too dynamons com-
munications officer said well show you
some tricks up beyond the stratosphere
all so elaborately casual dynamon
thought grimly it was fairly evident that
the martian ship intended to follow the
earth carrier to find out where it was go-
ing those inhuman devils why did the
earths people ever have to come in con-
tact with them

  dynamons thoughts went back to his
childhood to that terrible time when the
men of mars had abruptly declared war
and descended suddenly onto the earth in
thousands of cosmos carriers only the
timely invention of that remarkable sub-
stance geistfactor had saved earth then
it was a creamy liquid which spread over
any surface rendered the object invisible
the principle underlying geistfactor was
simplicity itself being merely an applica-
tion of ultra high-frequency color waves
but it saved the day for earth the world
armies cloaked in their new-found invis-
ibility struck in a dozen places at the rav-
aging hordes from mars the invaders
in spite of their prodigious intellectual
	planet

powers could not defend themselves
against an unseen enemy and had been
forced to withdraw the remnants of their
army and sue for peace

  but the unremitting jealousy and hatred
of the little men with the giant heads for
earths creatures was leading to new-
trouble it enraged the martians to think
that human beings whom they despised as
inferior creatures should have first
thought of spanning the yawning distances
between the planets of the solar system
it was doubly humiliating to the martians
that when they too followed suit and went
in for interplanetary travel they could
do no better than to copy faithfully the hu-
man invention of the cosmos carrier it
was only too evident that mars was gath-
ering its strength for another lightning
thrust at the earth this time with the
photo-atomic ray there was no doubt
that they intended to destroy or subjugate
earths peoples for good and to that end
the martians had been inventing new bones
of contention and had been contriving new
crises a peace-minded world govern-
ment had been trying to stave off the in-
evitable conflict with conference after con-
ference but to those on the inside it was
only too evident that the martians could
invent pretexts for war faster than earth
could evade them

dynamon watching the blood-red
carrier in the periscope mirror felt
a surging bitterness at the martians if
they could only be reasonable he reflected
if only they could be human then he dy-
namon would not now be floating away on
a dangerous mission far from the earth
and the woman he loved he tried to im-
agine what keltry was doing at that mo-
ment in his minds eye he could see her
on the stage of the theater of comedy
enthralling audiences with her youthful
charm as she played a part in the latest
witty comedy or sang a gay ballad in a
new revue

  he broke out of his reverie and tossed
a glance at the altimeter the needle was
moving much faster now climbing steadily
toward seventy thousand feet

  its about time to go now isnt it
he asked borion

stories

  the navigator nodded just about he
said and put his hand on a lever marked
gravity repellor

 as the navigator pushed the lever
smoothly forward dynamon turned back
to the periscope mirror and saw the red
ship behind suddenly dwindle in size the
new cosmos carrier was beginning to
show its speed

  apparently the martians were momen-
tarily caught off guard the red carrier
diminished to a tiny speck against the
dark background of the earth but then
it began to grow in size again as the mar-
tians unleashed the power in their great
magnets

  borion how about friction dynamon
asked

  we dont have to worry about that
yet was the answer were not going fast
enough and the temperature outside is
about sixty-five below

  dynamon nodded and glanced again at
the altimeter the needle was steadily
climbing a mile every ten seconds once
again he looked into the screen of the peri-
scope the earth was now far enough
away so that the young centurion could be-
gin to make out the broad arc which was a
part of the curving circumference of the
globe silently he said a final good-bye to
keltry and turned to speak to borion at
that moment the door of the control room
burst open and an engineer stepped in and
saluted the navigator

  stowaway sir  the engineer said
just found her in the munitions com-
partment

  dynamon stared out through the open
door at the woman who stood out there
between two soldiers

  it was keltry

it was a harried and heartsick centurion
who a few minutes later called a con-
ference in his own quarters borion and
thamon sat regarding him gravely while
mortoch the second in command lounged
against the wall a faint derisive smile on
his lean face

  we are faced with a situation dyna-
mon said heavily i would like to hear
some opinions

  flagrant case of indiscipline mortoch
cave-dwellers of saturn	

said promptly that is if we can regard
this impersonally

  personalities said dynamon sharply
will have no influence on my final
decision

  in that case  said mortoch harshly
it seems to me you are bound to put back
to earth and hand the woman over to the
right people for corrective action

  good heavens cried borion i hope
we dont have to do that we already have
a problem on our hands in the shape of
that martian carrier

  what do you say thamon the cen-
turion asked after a significant pause

  well said the scientist quietly you
cant altogether regard the situation with-
out considering personalities keltry
stowed away for a very personal reason
and one which it is hard to condemn en-
tirely i think we are over-emphasizing
the official breach of discipline i person-
ally cant see that it makes so much dif-
ference after all we on this expedition
are on our own and are likely to remain
so for some time to come i am in favor
of going along about our business and for-
getting how keltry came aboard

  spoken like a civilian said mortoch
sourly and i hold to my opinion just
because dynamon was promoted over my
head i see no reason for trying to curry
favor with him

  there was an awkward silence during
which dynamons face grew very pink and
his blue eyes grew cold

  im going to forget what you just said
mortoch he said you are a valued
member of this expedition and you are
much too good a soldier to overlook the
danger that lies in that kind of talk with-
out my participation you are out-voted two
to one we will not turn back

  he stood up with a gesture of dismissal
and the three lieutenants filed out of the
door  he paced the floor of his quarters
for a few minutes then walked to the door
and gave orders for the prisoner to be
sent in

  ah keltry darling he said after the
guard had left the two of them alone
you have put me in an impossible
position

  i dont see why it should be that bad

keltry answered it was an inhuman
thing to do to separate us and i just wasnt
going to permit it

  yes but dont you see said dyna-
mon i will be accused of playing favorites
because i dont turn around and take you
back to earth

  im not asking favors keltry retorted
calmly i just want to be a member of this
expedition

  whatever dynamon was going to answer
to that it was interrupted by the loud-
speaker booming

  centurion dynamon is requested at the
control room

  dynamon leapt to his feet crushed kel-
try to him in a swift brief embrace and
then opened the door

  escort the prisoner to the scientists
quarters he ordered and release her

dynamon walked into the control
room and saw that borions face
was gray the navigator was standing in
front of the periscope screens looking from
one to another the centurion walked over
and stood beside him

  the martians are showing their hand
finally said borion they have decided
that were headed for another planet and
i dont think that they want to let us carry
out our intention see here and here
dynamon peered into the port and star-
board bow panels he could see dozens of
little red specks rapidly growing larger

  they will try and surround us borion
said and blanket our magnets with their
own

  thats not so good is it dynamon
murmured what is our altitude from

earth

  forty miles was the reply and i
think they still may be able to overhear our
conversation

  let them said dynamon quietly we
have no secrets from them and they may as
well know that were going to out-run
them full speed borion

  the navigator advanced the repellor
lever as far as it would go there was a
slight jerk under foot then he adjusted
a needle on a large dial and moved the
attractor lever to its full distance there
was another jerk as the great carrier


planet stories

lunged forward through space borion
smiled

  i put the attractor beam on the moon
he said and well be hitting it up close
to nineteen miles a second in a few min-
utes we should walk away from those
drops of blood over there

 are we pointing away from them
enough dynamon asked whats to
prevent them from changing their course
and cutting over to intercept us see
thats what they appear to be doing now
the navigator peered critically at the for-
ward periscope screens it may be a
close shave at that he admitted but
please trust me dynamon ill make it past
them

the tiny red specks in the periscope
screens were growing shockingly fast
indicating the frightful speed at which the
earth-carrier was traveling bigger and
bigger they grew under dynamons fasci-
nated gaze the centurion darted a glance
at borion in this fantastic encounter
every second counted could the naviga-
tor elude the pursuing red carriers  bor-
ion haunched tensely over the control
levers his eyes glued to the screens the
martian ships were as big as cigars now
and tripling their size with every heartbeat
dynamon clenched his fist involuntarily and
fought down an impulse to shout a warn-
ing that would be worse than useless now
-the fate of the expedition was entirely
in the hands of borion

  dynamon held his breath as a flash of
red flicked across the port bow periscope
screen the carrier heaved under his feet
for a second then quickly settled to an even
keel again the sweat stood out in little
drops on borions forehead

  too close for comfort muttered the
navigator his eyes widened as another
huge red shape loomed up in the starboard
bow screen borions hands flicked over
a dial spinning a needle around then he
hung desperately back on the repellor
there was a momentary shock the car-
rier seemed to bounce off something bor-
ion staggered and dynamon hurled for-
ward and crashed into the forward bulk-
head of the control room

  then borion shouted were through

  dynamon picked himself up off the floor
with a rueful smile i thought we were
all through for a minute he observed

  well that was a bad minute there
said borion excitedly i thought that one
fellow was going to get us but i kicked
him off by throwing the beam on him and
giving him the repellor but you can see
for yourself they are far behind now and
theyll never in the world be able to catch
up

  dynamon peered into the port and star-
board quarter screens and saw a group of
rapidly diminishing red specks he looked
up with a sigh of relief

  good work borion he said and the
navigator grinned

  i dont think we will have to worry any
more about the martian ships from now
on if were careful borion said im
going to run for the shadow of the moon
and from there ill plot a course straight
for jupiter avoiding mars entirely

the door to the control room opened
and a smiling spectacled face peered
in it was thamon the scientist

  that was quite a bump thamon ob-
served were we trying to knock down
an asteroid

  dynamon gave a short laugh no that
was merely some of our friends from mars
trying to head us off but theyre far be-
hind now and we dont anticipate any
trouble for a good many days

  ah round one to the earth people
thamon observed in that case dyna-
mon have you decided how you are going
to conduct affairs within the carrier in the
immediate future

  not quite dynamon replied sup-
pose we discuss that in my quarters
thamon nodded im at your disposal
centurion

  dynamon led the way down the little
stair and into the compartment that served
as his office once there he threw off his
long military cloak and sat down at a little
table his great bronzed shoulders gleam-
ing in the soft artificial light

  i suppose the first question said
thamon sitting down opposite the centur-
ion is whether to institute suspended ani-
mation on board
cave-dwellers of saturn



  i think wed better dont you said
dynamon

  it would save a lot of food and oxy-
gen the scientist replied you see even
at our tremendous rate of speed now it
will take two hundred and twenty-six days
to reach the outer layer of saturns at-
mosphere until we actually land the ship
there is no conceivable emergency that
couldnt be handled by a skeleton crew
quite right said dynamon ill have
mortoch take charge of the arrangements
if you will stand by to supervise the tech-
nical side

  its as good as done said thamon
we have the newest type of refrigeration
system in the main saloon i can drop the
temperature one hundred and fifty degrees
in one-fifth of a second by the way i
was a little worried by that outburst of
mortochs when we were talking about
keltry

  oh well said dynamon mortoch is
only human he was a senior decurion
and i was passed over him for this job
he couldnt help but be a little jealous but
he will be all right hes a soldier after
all

  i hope so said thamon doubtfully
why certainly dynamon affirmed
as a matter of fact i wish he had been
given the command in the first place be-
tween you and me im not too keen about
this expedition to a comparatively unknown
planet thamon why on earth werent
human beings content to stay at home
why did they have to go to such endless
pains to construct these cosmos carriers
before these things were invented the in-
habitants of earth and the inhabitants of
mars didnt know that each other existed
and they were perfectly happy about it
but when they both began spinning around
through space between the planets all of a
sudden the solar system was not big
enough to hold both peoples

  its come fatal restlessness in the make-
up of human beings thamon replied do
you realize how far back man has been
trying to reach out to other planets
well the first successful trip in a cos-
mos carrier was made seventy-eight years
ago said dynamon

  thamon chuckled

  as far as we know that was the first
successful trip the scientist corrected as
a matter of fact the first cosmos carrier
was anticipated hundreds of years ago
just the other day in the library i found
a very interesting account of an archaeolog-
ical discovery made up in north central
a-the island that the ancients called
britain a complete set of drawings and
building plans was found in an admirable
state of preservation the date on the
plans was  and as you will remember
from your school history all of north
central by that time had been terribly
ravaged by the wars the inventor whose
name was leonard bolton called his con-
trivance a space ship wonderful those
old names arent they but the most re-
markable thing of all is that the designs
for that space ship were very practical
if the man ever had a chance to build one
which he probably didnt it might very
well have been a successful vehicle
thats very interesting said dynamon
were there any clues as to what happened
to leonard bolton

  none at all the scientist replied all
we know about him is that he designed the
space ship and then was presumably
blotted out by the savage weapons used in
the warfare of those days but as i say
the remarkable thing is that when we got
around to building a cosmos carrier eighty
years ago we were able to use several of
leonard boltons ideas which all goes to
show i suppose theres nothing new under
the sun

  im not so sure about that said dyna-
mon with a smile ive an idea that were
going to bump into several things new to
us on the planet saturn

  as to that thamon nodded i
shouldnt be surprised if you are right now
i suppose id better go and make arrange-
ments for the refrigeration job will mor-
toch be responsible for providing each in-
dividual with a hypodermic and return-to-
life tablets

  that will be taken care of said dyna-
mon ill see you later

dynamon stood beside borion in the
control room staring fascinatedly at
the periscope screens the images that


planet stories

were reflected in the six panels made up a
composite scene that was awe-inspiring and
fearsome the great cosmos carrier was
finally arriving at the end of its seven
months journey in front of the earth-
craft a vast barren expanse uniformly
dark gray in color spread for thousands of
miles to one side of the carrier a wide
belt of mist and shimmering particles
stretched upward from the planet out
toward space dynamon realized that this
was a small section of the great ring en-
circling saturn that could be seen in the
powerful telescopes from earth glancing
at the stern vision screens dynamon saw
the sun twinkling so far away it was
now- that it was hardly bigger than a large
star and gave off not much more light
even though they were coming to saturn in
the middle of a saturnian day there was no
more than a gloomy half-light to illumine
their way

  saturn revolves on its axis with such
speed observed borion that i should
imagine there will be tremendous prevail-
ing winds on the surface i think i can
see a range of steep mountains down there
it might not be a bad idea if we landed in
the lee of them

  yes agreed dynamon i think that
would be a good idea as a matter of fact
we may have to dig below the surface en-
tirely to prevent being blown away how
is the gravitation pull

  its a curious thing borion replied
it should be tremendous but the centrif-
ugal force is so strong that it counterbal-
ances to a certain extent the ship is han-
dling very easily

  how soon do you think well make the
surface said dynamon

  i should estimate somewhere around
six hours from now the navigator an-
swered i could make it sooner but im
feeling my way

  that suits me said dynamon that
will give us just time to turn off the re-
frigeration and bring our people back to
life lucky devils to be able to sleep
through this trip-have you ever been so
bored in your life

  never agreed borion but i am not
bored now

  dynamon walked across the control room

and threw a large switch in the wall panel

  decurion mortoch and scientist tha-
mon he said into the loud-speaker sys-
tem proceed at once to remove the sus-
pension-of-life condition in the main sa-
loon as soon as everyone is revived
stand by to take landing stations

  as the centurion closed the- switch and
turned away borion called him over again
to the periscope screens

  that is a range of mountains said the
navigator i can see it more clearly now
i think ill slow up our descent a little bit
so that by the time were ready to land it
will be midday again as you probably
know saturn makes a complete revolution
in only a little more than ten hours
that sounds sensible said dynamon
well need all the light we can get to
make a safe landing

  borion nodded and reached toward the
repellor lever he pushed it gently forward
and then looked at his altimeter he seemed
to be dissatisfied with the altimeter reading
and pushed forward the repellor lever a
little more then he looked again at the
altimeter and an expression of bewilder-
ment came over his face with a muttered
exclamation he jammed the repellor lever
as far ahead as it would go at the same
time watching the altimeter dynamon
sensed that something was wrong as he
watched the color drain out of the naviga-
tors face

  the saints preserve us the navigator
cried hoarsly something has gone ter-
ribly wrong-the repellor isnt working 
were dropping at a frightful rate of

speed-

  borion leapt to the loud-speaker system
and issued rapid orders to the navigating
engineers

  whats going to happen to us  dyna-
mon demanded

  i dont know borion said his face
ashen i think it is just a simple mechan-
ical failure in the controls from the repellor
lever down to the magnets i dont know
how soon my workers can discover the
trouble and repair it in the mean time-
in the mean time dynamon broke in
gloomily we may all be spattered all over
that gray landscape

  either that borion gritted or we
cave-dwellers of saturn	

burn to a crisp from the atmospheric fric-
tion i can feel it getting warmer in here
already

dynamon fought down the sickening
sensation of panic that was starting to
creep over him

  how long do you think we have got 
he said with an effort

   at the most said borion staring white
lipped at the altimeter at the most i should
say a half an hour

  the door to the control room burst open
and thamon rushed in closely followed by
keltry

  i heard you talking to your engineers
borion the scientist said rapidly are
we in trouble 

  we are said borion and it may be
the last trouble any of us ever have our
repellor has gone out for some reason and
were heading for the surface of saturn like
a metorite

cant anything be done said thamon
my engineers are doing all they can to
find the source of the trouble borion re-
plied but until they do i cant slow the
ship up

  keltrys great brown eyes were enormous
as she moved over beside dynamon and took
his right hand in hers

  as long as im with you dynamon she
said in a low voice im not afraid to die
but i hate to see your expedition fail per-
haps the fate of the earth depends on us
here in this carrier

  i know said dynamon squeezing her
hand his eyes followed borion as the navi-
gator went to the loud-speaker system again
but apparentiy the news from below was
not encouraging and borions shoulders
sagged as he turned to face the other three
people in the control room

  they havent found the source of the
trouble yet he said dully and theres not
a thing to be done until they do im sorry
that as navigator of this carrier i am
plunging you all to your death but its a
case of a simple mechanical failure which
i couldnt foresee

  keltry stepped forward impulsively and
laid her hand on the navigators wrist

  nobody could blame you borion she
said gently it isnt your fault if the at-

tractor or the repellor lever whichever it
is gets broken you are already-

  wait a minute borion shouted eyes
darting out of his head the attractor
in my excitement i forgot

  the navigator leapt to the control levers
spun the dial and put his hand on the at-
tractor lever

  if-im only-on time he muttered
agonizedly its just possible-the coun-
ter-attraction of jupiter-lord its hot
the control room was silent as death as
the navigator eased the attractor lever care-
fully forward dynamon whipped a glance
at the periscope screens the ground was
rushing up at a terrific rate and out behind
the carrier a dense cloud of black smoke
was forming the veins were standing out
in borions forehead as he inched the at-
tractor lever forward the girl and the
two men watched him with bated breath as
he slowly raised his eyes to the altimeter
a wild incredulous expression appearing on
the navigators face

  its-its working borion muttered
hoarsly the attractor beam from jupiter
is slowing us up

dynamons heart leapt and he sprang
 back to the periscope screens the
column of smoke behind them was still there
but it seemed to be thinning out but the
surface of saturn seemed to be rushing
upward just as fast as ever dynamon
twisted his head around to look at borion
a feverish smile was lighting up the navi-
gators face as he pressed forward on the
attractor lever

  we may just make it he breathed and
dynamon said a little prayer

  in the screen a range of dark gray moun-
tains stood out in bold relief and seemed
to reach claw-like peaks toward the speed-
ing carrier but the smoke had ceased to
whip past and only a small black cloud far
behind served to remind dynamon of the
fearful friction that the surface of the ship
had been subjected to at the same time
dynamon felt an invisible force dragging
him toward the front bulkhead of the con-
trol room and he knew that the carrier was
slowing up its forward speed through
the bow periscopes the jagged range of
mountains seemed so close that dynamon al-
	planet

most felt he could reach out and touch them
miraculously they rose up to one side of the
ship a moment later a voice sounded in
the loud-speaker system

  the magnet room calling the navigator
a break in the control shaft has been dis-
covered and repaired throw the repellor
lever into neutral and than advance it
borion gave a little sob flicked back the
repellor and then pushed it forward again
the floor of the control room heaved for
a minute and then settled on an even keel
dynamon stared unbelievingly at the star-
board midships periscope screens and saw
that the great carrier was resting immobile
not more than twenty feet above the gray
soil of saturn

  saved cried borion hysterically and
it was keltry who did it in my excitement
i would have let all of us plunge to our
death if keltry hadnt reminded me that
there was such a thing as an attractor lever
dynamon thamon we should get down on
our knees and thank our stars that keltry
was in here

  the door of the control room opened and
mortoch stepped in

  do you have to toss us around like that 
the lean decurion said i had a near-panic
on my hands with some of those people just
coming out of their suspended animation
oh- mortoch smiled ironically- i be-
gin to see why we had such a rough passage
if beautiful stowaways are given the run of
the control room i should imagine it would
be hard for the navigator to keep his mind on
his work

  borion started forward with a snarl but
dynamons voice cracked like a whip

  attention  both of you  try and re-
member that you are modern civilized men
not twentieth century-brutes

   borions hands fell to his sides and he be-
gan to laugh

  youre absolutely right dynamon he
said i dont know why i should let myself
be annoyed by this crude soldier after all
the cream of the joke is that mortoch would
never have been able to come in here and
make sarcastic remarks about keltry if
keltry hadnt been here for the past half
hour

  what do you mean by that said mor-
toch suspiciously

stories

  i mean said borion that if keltry
had not been in here you and everybody else
aboard this carrier would now be dead

  now  said dynamon i think we have
had enough of personalities suppose we
get a little work done mortoch prepare
the first decuria for reconnaissance duty
each man should be equipped with cloak
oxygen mask counter-gravity helmets and
a supply of voltage bombs and each mans
radio should be set at eighty-one thousand
meters have them ready at the main door
in fifteen minutes i will lead them on a
short tour of exploration andthamon will
accompany me in the mean time mortoch
you will remain in charge of the carrier
until i get back

dynamons heart was pounding with
excitement as he and thamon walked
through the main saloon toward the group
of cloaked figures standing by the big round
door as far as he knew he was going to
be the first human being ever to step foot
on the planet saturn he mentally checked
over his own equipment and made sure that
it was all in place including the hard rub-
ber box slung over his shoulder on a strap
that box contained his supply of voltage
bombs-little glass spheroids smaller than
golf balls which when hurled at an enemy
burst releasing a tremendous electric
charge there was little likelihood that
these bombs would be needed because the
periscope screens had shown no sign of
life anywhere in the gray arid valley in
which the cosmos carrier was lying how-
ever dynamon was taking no chances he
glanced briefly at thamon beside him the
scientist was unarmed carrying the light
metal staff which was the badge of his pro-
fession

  dynamon stepped forward and ran his
eyes quickly over the masked muffled fig-
ures of the first decuria then he signed
to an engineer who quickly unfastened the
great door dynamon then stepped through
and his party followed him crowding into
the air lock between the inner and outer
doors thamon stepped forward ma-
neuvered a lever the outer door swung
open and saturn lay waiting for the touch
of dynamons foot

  it was not an especially inviting prospect
cave-dwellers of saturn



a blast of unbelievably cold air swirled
through the open door carrying with it
particles of fine gray sand in the dim
murky twilight tall gray mountains loomed
ominously across the valley floor dynamon
shivered and turned up the heat in his elec-
tric cloak then with one hand on the
knob of his counter-gravity helmet he
stepped gingerly out on to the ground

  instantly he sank to his knees in gray
sand that was as light and powdery as fresh
snow with a quick twist of the knob on
his helmet he kicked his feet free and stood
lightly on the surface again

  attention first decuria he said into
the transmitter of his radio phone adjust
counter-gravitation to approximately plus
ten pounds

  stepping backward he turned and
watched the masked figures of his com-
mand leave the carrier one by one tha-
mon came out first followed by the de-
curion and after him the soldiers me-
chanically dynamon counted them as
the tenth soldier stepped out on the gray
soil dynamon started to turn away when
to his astonishmenj an eleventh cloaked
figure came out of the door of the carrier

  decurion dynamon said sharply into
his transmitter since when have you had
eleven men in your command

  never came back the prompt answer
in dynamons ears as the decurion faced
about to count his men one of them moved
over beside dynamon

  forgive me dynamon came a soft
feminine voice but i had to come with
you its keltry please dont send me
back i promise not to be any trouble
dynamon hesitated then reluctantly
agreed to allow her to come along

  stay close to thamon he warned and
started off down the valley the rest of the
party following him

  lightened as they were to keep from
sinking deep into the treacherous powdery
sand the humans made fast progress ac-
celerated by the strong breeze that blew at
their backs down the valley at that dy-
namon realized that the lofty mountains
on either side provided protection against
immeasurably stronger winds higher up
from the saw-toothed peaks on the left
dark streamers of sand stood out for yards

indicating constant winds of gale propor-
tions up there

the valley itself as far as dynamon
could see in the dim half-light was
barren of any kind of life there was no
sign of a creeping crawling or flying crea-
ture  nor was there any vegetation trees or
grass dynamon led his column nearly a
mile down the unchanging gray of the val-
ley and then called a halt

  thamon he said beckoning the scien-
tist to him can you see any possibility of
human habitation in this valley

  off-hand i dont not on the surface
the scientist replied i would have to test
the atmosphere for oxygen but i doubt if
there is a large enough proportion my
guess is that there is nothing but nitrogen
in this air that wont support human life
or any other kind of life except possibly
certain kinds of plants

  what about tridium said dynamon
how do you go about looking for it
electrophysiological tests of all kinds
said thamon i must say this valley
doesnt look very encouraging it looks
like burned out volcanic ash say whats
that up the valley

  dynamon gazed back in the direction of
the cosmos carrier and felt an uneasy
prickling along his spine the desert val-
ley floor behind them seemed suddenly to
have sprouted some tall bushes there were
possibly a dozen of them standing at in-
tervals of twenty yards they were too far
away-perhaps one eighth of a mile-for
dynamon to see them very well but they
appeared to consist of a score of leafless
branches radiating outward in all direc-
tions from a small core it was as if a
basket ball was bristling with ten-foot
javelins

  where did they come from dyna-
mon gasped i didnt see them when we
walked over that ground a few minutes

ago

  nor i agreed thamon i cant imag-
ine where they came from

  just then one of the bushes apparently
moved a few feet as if blown by the wind

  good lord exclaimed thamon did
you see that one of those things rolled
forward


planet stories

  then another of the fantastic bushes
started to roll and another and another
in a moment all twelve of the extraordinary
apparitions were rolling rapidly down the
wind toward the humans dynamon felt
the hair on the back of his neck stiffen
and he sprang into action commanding his
soldiers to converge around him

  thamon what are those things  dyna-
mon cried

  i dont know the scientist replied
i dont think they can be animals but
they might be rootless nitrogen-feeding
plants of some kind look those branches
are covered with long thorns

  the fantastic creatures were rolling
swiftly down on the little group of humans
and dynamon could see the sharp thorns
around the end of each branch he reached
into the box at his hip

  decuria ready with voltage bombs
he commanded and looking around saw
that each man held one of the little glass
bombs in his hand the bushes were only
fifty feet away now rolling lightly over
the gray sand on their spindly branches

  ready warned dynamon throw

  a shower of glistening glass balls flew
through the air into the midst of the menac-
ing apparitions there was a series of
blinding flashes and loud reports some
jagged white lines appeared among the black
branches of the monsters but they kept
right on rolling downwind dynamon felt
a surge of dismay those voltage bombs
had been for years mans best weapon

  theyre plants all right came tha-
mons voice you cant kill them with
electricity any more than you can kill a
tree

  dynamon looked at the men huddled
about him and thought quickly

  all we can do men is to try and
dodge them he announced spread out
and as soon as one of those things passes
you run upwind keltry thamon stay
close to me

the line of rolling bushes was almost
upon them as the soldiers deployed in
all directions seizing keltry by the hand
dynamon leapt to one side dragging her out
of the path of one of the spiney monsters
thamon gasped a warning and dynamon

turning his head felt a thrill of horror as
he saw another of the creatures almost on
top of them acting instinctively dyna-
mon snatched the metal staff from tha-
mons hands and flailed frantically at the
black thorny branches to his amazement
they shivered and snapped under the metal
rod like matchwood hardly daring to be-
lieve his eyes dynamon struck again and
again at the horrible creature until in a few
minutes it was nothing but a pile of scat-
tered broken faggots on the gray sand

  but cries for help and screams of an-
guish sounded in dynamons ear phones
and he saw that five of the soldiers were
on the ground impaled on the cruel thorns
of others of the monsters he ran toward
them and beat them to pieces with the rod
but too late to save the lives of the men
they lay pierced in a dozen places by long
black thorns the rest of the decuria had
managed to dodge the whirling branches of
the other bushes and now stood safely up
wind of them dynamon summoned the
survivors around him

 what do you think thamon he
asked in your opinion are there likely
to be more of these horrible things
around

  there may easily be the scientist re-
plied promptly but since the only de-
fense against them is this one metal rod
i recommend that we leave our unfortunate
comrades here and head immediately for
the mountains over there those poor fel-
lows are beyond our help and we should
be able to find better protection from these
blood-thirsty thorn-bushes among the foot
hills when we get there we can work
upwind until were opposite the carrier
again

  that sounds like good advice said
dynamon and well act on it its get-
ting so dark now that we couldnt see to
protect ourselves if any more of those
creatures came rolling down the wind
everyone join hands and follow me

after a nerve-racking march of about
twenty-five minutes through the gath-
ering darkness the party of nine humans
felt the ground rising beneath their feet
dynamon halted and hurled a voltage bomb
forward and upward as the bomb ex-
cave-dwellers of saturn	

ploded the momentary flash revealed to the
party that they were at the foot of a steep
rock-strewn declivity dynamon led the
party upward feeling his way over the
great boulders after a few minutes of
climbing he called another halt and again
threw a voltage bomb

  well stay here for a few hours the
centurion announced until it gets light
enough to see our way we will be safe
in the lee of these big rocks so make your-
selves comfortable

  nine dim figures spread out on the slop-
ping ground then one of them drifted
apart from the rest up hill

  who is that dynamon demanded
keltry came the answer i am just
going up hill a little distance when you
exploded that last bomb i thought i saw
something that looked like the edge of a
volcanic crater

you cant see anything in this dark-
ness said dynamon wait till it gets
light again before you do any exploring
oh i wont go far said keltry
really i wont

  well be sure that you dont dyna-
mon smiled into his transmitter then he
said thamon where are you

  right here and a figure moved over
beside the centurion

  dynamons question was casual

  did you see anything that looked like
a volcanic crater

  come to think of it the scientist re-
plied i think i did its just up here a
few yards

  shall we go along and have a look at
it too then said dynamon getting up on
his feet just then he stood rooted with
horror as a piercing scream rang in his ear
phone

  dynamon dynamon im falling
keltry the centurion exclaimed
whats the matter has something hap-
pened to your helmet

  yes keltrys voice was fainter ive
lost it it was unfastened and when i
stumbled it rolled off fainter and fainter
grew the voice im falling down a black
hole a mile a minute with a muttered
sob dynamon scrambled up the slope a
moment later his foot stepped out on empty
space he started to fall into nothingness

  keltry he cried into his transmitter
where are you  answer me

  straining his ears dynamon heard a
tiny voice far away saying im still fall-
ing

  im coming after you keltry the cen-
turion yelled and reaching up to the knob
on his helmet twisted frantically by do-
ing that he multiplied the gravitational pull
of the planet and was now falling much
more swiftly than keltry how deep this
black pit was dynamon had no idea but
he prayed it would be deep enough so that
he could catch up with keltry before she
hit the bottom it was a desperate chance
but dynamon was willing to take it

  keltry he shouted into the transmit-
ter can you hear me im coming for
you

  yes i hear you dynamon came the
answer and dynamons heart leapt as it
seemed to him that the voice sounded a
little stronger

  keep your courage up keltry he said
trying to sound calm im falling faster
than you are there doesnt seem to be
any bottom to this pit so im bound to
catch up with you

  oh dynamon you shouldnt have
jumped after me theres-theres only-
one chance in a million that we dont
crash

keltry was bravely trying to hide the
dispair and terror in her voice but
most important of all to dynamon was the
fact that she sounded-stil nearer he
resolutely put out of his mind the frightful
probability that at any second first keltry
and then he would be dashed to pieces at
the bottom of the pit it seemed to him
that he had been falling for miles and he
thought that there was beginning to be more
air resistance now he bent his head and
peered downward trying to pierce the inky
blackness with his eyes but he could see
nothing it was a fantastic sensation or
better still a lack of all sensation he
seemed to be resting immobile in a black
nothingness with only the rushing air tear-
ing at his cloak to indicate that he was
falling

  keep talking keltry he cried

  oh you sound so much nearer there
	planet

was a note of incredulous hope in keltrys
voice

  i told you id catch up with you
dynamon exulted

  suddenly his heart gave a great bound
he was still peering downward and it
seemed to him that far away he could see
a tiny pin point of light

  keltry he cried am i seeing things
or is there something that looks like a star
way down there

  oh i think i see it keltry answered
breathlessly dynamon what could that
mean 

  i dont know said dynamon but it
seems to be growing larger and im get-
ting much nearer to you

  under his fascinated eyes the star grew
bigger and brighter by the second in a
few moments dynamon hardly daring to
believe his eyes thought he could make out
the outlines of a flying figure between him
and the light

  keltry he shouted ive almost
caught up with you hold your hands up
over your head

  oh dynamon i think i can see you
the point of light which dynamon
thought was a star was growing into a
larger brighter disk keltrys body was
sharply outlined against it now and she
seemed to be scarcely ten feet away dy-
namon bent himself into a jack-knife dive
and kicked his feet up behind him the
air pressure was tremendous now and
dynamon began to realize that it was no
star or sun or planet down below but the
bottom of the pit rays of light spread
upward illuminating the smooth shiny
sides of the shaft a few more agonizing
seconds went past and dynamons hands
grazed the tips of keltrys upraised fingers
dynamon dared not estimate how far above
the bottom of the pit they were but con-
centrated on gaining the few inches he
needed to get a grip on one of keltrys
wrists

  weve-almost-made it he panted
here-grab my right arm and hang on
for dear life

  an involuntary shout of relief came
from dynamons lips as he felt keltrys
strong fingers close over his arm

 hang on he shouted and his left

stories

hand flew up to his helmet and carefully
turned the counter-gravitation knob at
the same time he twisted his back around
and fought his feet downward a mo-
ment later he gripped keltrys torso under
the arms with his knees frantically he
tried to estimate how far above the bot-
tom of the pit they were they might be
five thousand feet-or five hundred feet
slowly he turned the dial on his helmet
resisting the almost insuperable impulse to
twist the knob too fast if he tried to stop
their fall too quickly it would tear their
bodies apart

  slowly ever slowly the air-rush dimin-
ished by now they were well down into
the area illuminated from the bottom of
the pit and they could see that they were
falling through a round shaft perhaps one
hundred feet in diameter dynamon judged
that they were less than one hundred feet
off the bottom

  look out keltry he said ive got
to put on the brakes hard

  he gritted his teeth and flicked the knob
on his helmet he stifled a groan as in-
visible ropes attached to his feet and hands
seemed to be trying to pull him apart but
gradually the terrific pressure released he
moved the knob a shade and released the
grip of his knees on keltry

  there he grunted as they both landed
lightly on solid ground there wasnt
two seconds to spare

keltr drew a shuddering sigh and
put a hand on dynamons arm for
support

  oh dynamon she whispered if i
werent such a well brought-up girl i would
break down and cry from sheer relief

  i dont blame you said dynamon in
a voice that shook a little that was- quite
an experience but we came out of it all
right now where do you suppose we are
how do you suppose this pit was ever
formed 

  the two earth-people stared around
them curiously they were bathed in a
bright light and yet there was no apparent
source of illumination it began to dawn
 them that the rocks which formed the
side walls at the base of the shaft were
themselves luminous glowing with a curi-
cave-dwellers of satvrn	

ous greenish light dynamon tilted his
head back and stared up into the darken-
ing shaft suddenly he uttered an exclama-
tion and seizing keltry by the wrist
dragged her to one side a few seconds
later a round object dropped out of the
shaft and bounced on the ground it was
keltrys counter-gravity helmet

  dynamon reached down and picked it
up its a good thing that these things
are well built he remarked with a smile
or this would be smashed to bits the
knob is still set for plus ten pounds and
that was quite a fall i wonder whether
it still works

   he twisted the knob experimentally and
the helmet started to sail upward

  say dynamon cried it works all
right here put it on keltry

   keltry accepted the helmet with a laugh
put it on her head and was buckling it
under her chin when her blood suddenly
congealed in her veins a loud shout rang
echoingly through the shaft dynamon
whirled around and beheld a curious figure
standing in front of a rock not sixty feet
away it stood upright on two legs and
cradled a sort of club in its arms its head
was covered with long yellow hair that fell
down on to its shoulders and the lower half
of its face was covered with coarse yellow
hair blue eyes glinted from under shaggy
brows in a menacing glare at the two
earth-people

  it jooks quite human doesnt it
whispered keltry

   dynamon nodded arid slid his ear phone
off his right ear as he saw the strangers
hairy mouth opening and closing keltry
followed his example in time to hear the
strangers rumbling voice

  whoo-yoo

  dynamon touched keltrys hand that
sounded like who are you didnt it he
said wonderingly

   it certainly did keltry answered i
think thats some kind of human

   if its a human dynamon said then
there must be some sort of breathable at-
mosphere down here you notice hes not
wearing any oxygen mask

   whoo-yoo the stranger repeated an
whey cum fum

-planet stories-winter

  hes speaking a kind of english said
keltry excitedly he said who are you
and where do you come from

  by jupiter cried dynamon i think
youre right if he can breathe without
a mask so can we ill have a little talk
with him

  a moment later the centurion stood bare-
headed helmet and oxygen mask in hand

  were humans from earth he told the
stranger pronouncing each word carefully
who are you 

  the strangers eyes and mouth flew open
in astonishment and the rod sagged in his
hands

  humes fum-earth he cried hoarsely
then turned his head and gave an ear-split-
ting yell

a moment later a dozen or more
short hairy-faced creatures closely
resembling the first stranger came tumbling
through a passageway behind him and
stood rooted with astonishment at the sight
of dynamon and keltry their bodies
were completely covered the torsoes with
loose gray tunics and the legs with ugly
baggy tubes they advanced cautiously on
the two people from earth

  take off your helmet and mask dy-
namon directed keltry the air is per-
fectly good well try and find out the
mystery of how these humans ever got
here

  he turned and addressed the first
stranger again enunciating slowly and care-
fully immediately the whole crowd burst
into excited jabbering here and there
dynamon thought he recognized a word
finally one man taller than the rest stepped
forward

  yoo cum thus he declared

  certainly dynamon nodded with a
smile and reached out a hand to keltry
the crowd with wondering eyes opened
up a line and the two young people from
earth followed their self-appointed guide
through it a short narrow passageway
led off at a sharp angle through the rocky
wall of the pit and presently dynamon
and keltry found themselves on what ap-
peared to be a hill top both of them gave
little gasps as a vast and magnificent pano-
rama spread out before their astonished
	planet

eyes it was as if they had stepped into a
new world

  a gently undulating plain stretched away
in three directions as far as their eyes
could see it was predominantly gray in
color but here and there were scattered
long narrow strips of green these green
strips all had shimmering silvery borders
and dynamon couldnt help recalling to
mind some arid spots back on the earth
that were criss-crossed with irrigation
ditches there were no trees on this vast
plain but strewn around in a haphazard
wav were a quantity of great boulders
and these rocks like the rocks at the base
of the pit glowed luminously however
the landscape was clearly illuminated by
some other source than those scattered
rocks dynamon lifted his eyes upward
and saw that above them and stretching
as far as the eye could reach there was a
softly luminous ceiling there was no way
of telling how high up this ceiling was it
might be twenty feet or twenty miles the
effect was like that of certain days on the
earth when wide-spread clouds blanket
the sky and diffuse the suns rays

  the plain was by no means deserted
here and there along the green strips four-
legged creatures moved slowly creatures
that on earth dynamon would have said
were cows nearer at hand a flock of
small white creatures milled around aim-
lessly and dynamon could have sworn he
heard the cackle of hens dynamon
glanced over his shoulder and saw that
the little hairy-faced men were filing out of
the passageway to the pit the guide
tugged at his sleeve

  this oo-ay he said and pointed to his
right

  still holding keltrys hand dynamon
turned and followed the man and the
others fell in behind them their way
eventually led toward a tall set of cliffs at
the base of which a score or so of cave-
like openings could be seen

  these are humans arent they dyna-
mon  keltry whispered

  they certainly look like it dynamon
answered although obviously theyre very
primitive

  then how and when did they come to
saturn keltry persisted

stories

  i havent the faintest idea dynamon
shrugged perhaps well find out

  other strange humans came running up
the hill and joined the crowd behind them
apparently they were not all men for some
of them had no hair on their faces and wore
long robes over their bodies the guide led
them straight to one of the openings in
the cliff then halted and faced the two
adventurers impressively

  the koo-een he announced in a loud
tone

  dynamon and keltry looked wonder-
ingly at each other and then back to the
guide at that moment a woman appeared
at the mouth of the cave she was small
and delicately formed and strikingly beau-
tiful she had the bluest of eyes and
golden hair that fell away on either side
of a marble brow a long-sleeved white
garment gathered at the waist covered her
from neck to toe but its shapeless folds
could scarcely conceal the delicious curves
of her little body

  humes the guide shouted proudly
fum earth

the womans blue eyes widened as
she stared solemnly at dynamon and
keltry

  are you from earth she said in slow
musical tones so strange so wonder-
ful  how did you come 

  dynamon grinned we came in a cos-
mos carrier he said easily and to us
it seems even more strange and more won-
derful that we find humans already on
saturn

  a shy answering smile came over the
womans beautiful face

  we have been here hundreds of years
she replied in the same slow accents but
come inside the palace and we will talk

  she turned with an inviting look and the
two adventurers from earth followed her
through a passageway lined with the by
now familiar luminous rocks they came
out in a fairly large high-ceilinged room
in the center of which was a sort of table
made out of a long trimmed slab of rock
at one end of this table was a high-back
chair made of woven reeds the woman
walked over to the chair and sitting down
in it indicated stools on either side of her
cave-dwellers of satirn



  sit down she said and tell me more
about yourselves

  thank you dynamon answered and
turning to his companion said its warm
in here i think we might take off these
cloaks

  keltry nodded and putting her hand to
the throat fastening zipped it downward
dynamon did likewise and the two stepped
out of their cloaks there was a sudden
scream from the beautiful little woman
and her hands flew up in front of her eyes

  what are you doing she squealed
why youre-youre practically naked
youre positively immodest

  keltry threw a startled glance at dyna-
mons long brown legs

  why not at all she said quietly we
are dressed like everyone else on earth
at the present time modesty with us
nowadays is something much more impor-
tant than lengths of cloth

  the little woman kept her hands before
her eyes and shook her head vigorously
its immodest she insisted and you
must put on your clothes at once dont
you realize that im the queen

  reluctantly keltry and dynamon
stepped back into their heavy cloaks and
zipped them up the front

   well thats better said the little queen
primly my goodness she said with a
slight glance is everybody on earth as
big and brown as you two

  were about average i should say
keltry answered with a smile and seri-
ously we didnt mean to offend you in the
matter of clothes

  well we on saturn said the little
queen dont believe in indecent exposure
now you say you came in some kind of a
carrier 

  yes said dynamon its up on the
surface we were exploring in die dark-
ness and fell down the long shaft

  why werent you killed said the
queen blue eyes wide dynamon explained
the counter-gravity helmets it took con-
siderable explanation because the queen
was inclined to disbelieve the whole story
she finaly accepted it however and then
launched into a long series of questions
about the cosmos carrier and about the
state of the earth eventually dynamon

found an opening and started asking ques-
tions  his part

  were anxious to know about you and
your people on saturn he suggested
have you a name or are you addressed
only as queen 

  i am queen diana the little woman
stated the last of my line i am a bol-
ton and the boltons have been rulers of
saturn ever since we came here

  bolton dynamon shouted are you
a descendant of leonard bolton

  yes replied the queen with a de-
lighted smile do they still remember
leonard bolton on earth

  we know that he designed a contrivance
called a space ship but thats all did he
actually build such a ship and is that how
you come to be here so many thousands of
miles from earth

  yes said queen diana proudly its
all down in some books which i will show
you leonard bolton built a space ship
which was big enough to hold ten families
and their belongings there was a ter-
rible war going on and he thought the only
place to find safety was another planet
so the space ship left the earth by means
of a thing called a rocket whatever that
is and they wandered around for years in
space till they finally came into saturns
orbit and the tremendous gravity pulled
the ship right through the light outer crust
into this nether world i dont know how
many years ago that was but we have been
here ever since

  well that is an amazing story said
dynamon and i would like to see those
books you mentioned how incredibly for-
tunate that the space ship broke through
into this nether world where there is an
asmosphere that will support life and it
is pretty miraculous too that the space
ship didnt break up from the force of
hitting the outer crust

  well the books say that it was broken
up somewhat the queen answered but
nobody was hurt and after they unloaded
the ship they took it apart so that they
could use the metal in it for other things
she was eying him admiringly

  and the colony has survived over a
thousand years dynamon mused he
could not help thinking how in comparison
	planet

with the people on earth the survivors oe
boltons expedition were a rather poor lot
they had made no progress at all in the
thousand years mentally or culturally
from all evidences they had on the con-
trary retrogressed at least to a degree
then across his mind flitted a picture of
the hardships these brave souls had to en-
dure in establishing themselves on the new
planet at no time could they have even
hoped to return to earth

  with their limited equipment they had
set out to make the most of their new
world the great caves offered natural
shelter so it was small wonder that they
made their homes in them

  dynamon although a soldier to his finger
tips had none of the haughtiness and
cruelty which are so often found in the
warriors of today quickly his pity for the
colonists turned into admiration and he
turned gently to face queen diana again

  tell me he asked are we the first
strangers you have seen you havent by
any chance been visited by martians have
you 

  martians said the queen what are
they 

  at present they are just about the
worst enemies of human beings dynamon
replied tersely

  no said the queen our only enemies
here are the land-krakens we have been
fighting them for hundreds of years and
we have never been able to exterminate
them because theyre so hard to kill

  land-krakens said dynamon what
sort of creature are they

  they are great crawling monsters
the queen told him they have a dozen
long flexible arms that curl around their
victims and strangle them they lie in
wait for our cows and kill them easily and
now and then they catch a human being
theyre terribly hard to kill even with bul-
lets-they seem to be made of gristle and
jelly

  just as the queen spoke there was a
chorus of shouts outside the cave followed
by three or four sharp reports in rapid
succession the queen stood up quickly
as one of her subjects rushed into the cave

  land-kraken he shouted terble
biggun

stories

without a word the queen picked
up her long skirts and ran to the en-
trance of the cave dynamon and keltry
following close behind an extraordinary
sight met their eyes

   at the foot of the little hill fifty or sixty
shouting men were ringed around a hor-
rible mass of thrashing gray tentacles sev-
eral of the men were pointing their black
rods at the beast

  oh it is a big one the queen cried
our guns will be useless against that thick
hide-the bullets will just skim off
there were several more reports and
smoke curled from the ends of the rods
several long grey tentacles rose up above
the mass and the crowd surged backward
in all directions suddenly one of the
slimy arms streaked downward and out-
ward and a moment later a struggling
screaming human was lifted high in the
air a thrill of horror went through dyna-
mon and keltry clutched his arm

  their ancient fire-arms are useless
she said in a tense whisper perhaps a
voltage bomb-

  but dynamon was already running down
the slope fumbling at the black box at his
hip the concerted groan of dispair from
the crowd suddenly changed to a shout as
the unfortunate human somehow tore loose
from the encircling tentacle and dropped
to the ground just as the land-kraken was
reaching for the doomed man with another
long arm dynamon hurled a voltage bomb
over the heads of the crowd the little
glass ball landed squarely in the middle of
the writhing gray mass there was a
blinding flash and a loud report a con-
vulsive shudder rippled over die gray mon-
ster and its twelve tentacles suddenly went
limp the crowd looked at it in stunned
silence for a second and then raised a
yell of triumph a noisy mob of little
bearded men escorted dynamon back up
the hill to where the beautiful little queen
stood waiting her blue eyes shining

  how marvelous how heroic she
breathed as dynamon came up to her
you killed the kraken with one blow
how did you do it

  well you see queen diana dyna-
mon replied patting the black box these
little voltage bombs have long ago entirely
cave-dwellers of saturn



replaced fire-arms on earth their range
is shorter but they are far more deadly
oh so wonderful  the queen gasped
i am so glad you came you shall marry
me and ill make you king of saturn

  i am most honored and flattered by your
proposal queen diana dynamon smiled
but i am afraid that isnt possible keltty
and i must go back up the shaft and rejoin
our expedition

  oh but you cant said the queen sud-
denly send the girl away if you want-
she waved a careless hand at keltry-but
you must stay here with me forever

dynamon saw keltrys startled eyes
on him and he felt an acute embar-
rassment it was an impossible situation
he could not repress a little glow within
him from the frank approval of the beau-
tiful imperious little queen but at the
same time he knew that he must soon de-
vise some means of making a graceful exit
from her presence his thoughts were in-
terrupted by a sudden cry from the edge
of the surrounding crowd he turned his
head and looked along the base of the cliff
a column of cloaked figures helmeted and
masked were streaming out of the passage-
way to the pit

  its a search party coming after us
cried keltry

  they were twenty or so of the soldiers
from earth and they covered the distance
toward dynamon and keltry in a short
time and forced their way through the
crowd of bearded saturnians the one
in the lead unfastened his oxygen mask
and revealed the spectacled face of
thamon

  thank goodness youre alive said the
scientist fervently we never expected
to find you what a fantastic place this is
you are in the kingdom of the bol-
tons said dynamon and this is queen
diana

  the man behind thamon unmasked re-
vealing the lean dark features of mortoch

  congratulations dynamon said the
chief decurion dryly as he in turn was
presented to the wide-eyed little queen
you certainly picked a sort of paradise to
fall into a paradise i might add pre-
sided over by an angel

  a coy smile crept over the queens face
then died away at mortochs next words

  i bring you grave news dynamon the
chief decurion said there are two mar-
tian carriers in the vicinity we havent
seen them yet but we intercepted a long-
wave conversation between them what do
you intend to do about jit 

  why i think we should go right back
to the surface dynamon replied could
you tell from their conversation whether
they knew that we were on saturn
apparently they knew we were some-
where around said mortoch but hadnt
located us yet

well wed better hurry right on up
then said dynamon so that we can get
back to our carrier before they find it
oh but you cant go said the little
queen in a shrill voice i forbid it

  i wish we could stay queen diana
dynamon answered but theres dangerous
work to be done up on the surface

  but why go to the surface at all the
queen demanded why not stay down
here and keep away from the danger
no queen diana dynamon said
keenly conscious of mortochs lurking
smile duty calls and we must go per-
haps when we have finished our work we
will pay you another visit all right men
here we go

the centurion keltry by his side led
the way back to the entrance to the pit
while the saturnians grouped around their
little queen gaped after them as the lit-
tle force stood in the bottom of the pit ad-
justing their helmets and oxygen masks
preparatory to ascending to the surface
mortoch leaned over to dynamon

  that wasnt such a bad idea of the
beautiful dianas he murmured per-
sonally i wouldnt mind spending a few
safe years down there with her it would
be better than facing those deadly photo-
atomic rays of the martians

  if its safety youre interested in mor-
toch said dynamon dryly well try and
get you as soon as possible to the safety
of the carrier anyway perhaps the mar-
tians are just exploring and didnt come
equipped with the ray

  but as the centurion turned the knob in
	planet

his helmet and shot up through the great
shaft he felt in his heart no great hope
that such indeed would be the case if
the martian carrier were in the vicinity
of saturn it was altogether likely that they
had come prepared to destroy the earth
carrier and wouldcbe equipped with their
best weapon dynamon hoped against
hope that he and the little force would
reach the surface in time to get to their
own carrier whose thick walls the mar-
tians ray could not penetrate after that
it would be a case of maneuvering the car-
rier in such a way as to try to disable the
martians ships

  the humans their gravity repellors
turned up full strength whizzed up the
black shaft at a tremendous rate of speed
even so it seemed hours before a small
gray disc above him warned dynamon that
they were nearing the top he spoke some
words of command into his radio phone
and cut down his upward speed in a few
moments he stepped over the rim of the
shaft into the gray light of the satumian
midday he glanced down into the valley
in the direction of the carrier and felt a
shock of dismay go through him

the gray earth carrier was in the
same place but a half a mile on either
side of it were two flaming red martian
carriers and out on the gray sand far
from any of the ships a furious battle was
going on some twenty tall human figures
were ringed around by a swarm of tiny
globular martians a continuous series of
white flashes showed that the humans were
desperately hurling their voltage bombs but
the encircling martians were keeping well
out of range and a dozen still forms on the
ground showed that the invisible photo-
atomic ray was doing its deadly work

  all too clearly dynamon saw what had
happened in the absence of a command-
ing officer himself or mortoch borion had
unwarily sent a force of soldiers out scout-
ing the martians had swooped down
landed swiftly and cut off the force from
the carrier the humans were desperately
trying to cut through to safety but their
situation looked hopeless

  quickly dynamon turned and faced the
men behind him and held up his hands in

stories

a gesture signifying that no one should
use his radio phone he had determined
to try and help his beleaguered soldiers
down in the valley and the only way that
could successfully be done was to surprise-
attack swiftly on the rear of the martians
he motioned keltry and thamon back into
the pit and then sweeping his arm forward
in a wide arc he plunged down the hill-
side but before he had covered half the
distance to the combat in the valley dyna-
mon realized that his attack was coming
too late the photo-atomic ray was cut-
ting down the little force of humans like
an invisible scythe there were only nine
of them left now and one by one these
were falling a thousand thoughts raced
through dynamons head should he go
ahead with the attack counting on getting
within bombing distance of the martians
unnoticed before they could swing their
photo-atomic ray around or should
he change direction skirting the enemy
and make a run for the carrier sud-
denly his blood froze in his veins as a
voice sounded in his ear phones

  this is suicide dynamon it was
mortochs voice

  its suicide now said dynamon
through clenched teeth you fool you
have given us away

  there was an instant reaction from the
swarming martians in the valley a large
group of them broke away from the com-
bat and rolled over the gray sand toward
dynamons detachment the centurion
halted his men abruptly it was sure an-
nihilation to try and stand in the face of
the oncoming men of mars

 back to the pit dynamon com-
manded its our only chance once we
get down there well decide what to do
later

  the little force just barely made it to
the mouth of the shaft the martians were
coming up rapidly behind them and dyna-
mon could see the big black cones which
produced the invisible ray

the descent down the shaft was rapid
dynamon being the last to land on the
shiny floor immediately he marched his
men through the passageway into the
nether world and detailed two men to
cave-dwellers of saturn	

remain and guard the entrance to the pit

  i dont believe the martians will follow
us down he said if they do we can
easily defend the passageway

  then he turned and singled out the chief
decurion

  mortoch he announced you are un-
der arrest you disobeyed my orders in
regard to using the radio phone and by
doing so you betrayed our presence to the
enemy i will dispose of your case later
mortoch stepped forward a sardonic
gleam in his dark eyes

  and suppose i refuse to be arrested
he said if i had not disobeyed the or-
der you would have led us into certain
death mortoch swept the crowd of sol-
diers with a burning look men i pro-
claim that dynamon is incompetent to com-
mand you henceforth you will take your
orders from me-and you dynamon are
the one who is under arrest

  mortoch dynamon cried you are
out of your mind

  not at all mortoch returned i am
merely assuming the command which
should have been mine to begin with put
your hands up in the air dynamon and
backward march till i tell you to stop and
let nobody else make a move-mortochs
rasping voice rose to a shout-i have in
each hand a voltage bomb which i shall
not hesitate to throw if anybody attempts
to cross my will

  this is madness dynamon cried
hoarsely you cant hope to get away
with this he strode forward angrily

  back roared mortoch and raised his
right hand threateningly

  dynamon staggered back in bewilder-
ment from the soldiers who stood in si-
lence too shocked to make a move help-
less against the voltage bombs in mortochs
hands the centurion stepped slowly back-
ward arms upraised it wras an impossible
situation and for the moment dynamon
felt powerless to do anything about it he
reproached himself bitterly for not being
more wary of mortoch up till now he
had been conscious of the chief ducurions
enmity but he had never thought that the
man would erupt into open mutiny

dynamon threw a swift glance over his
shoulder and saw that he was only two

paces away from one of those curious lu-
minous rocks it was approximately cyl-
indrical in shape six feet wide and perhaps
twenty feet tall dynamon took another
step backward and turned his head to face
mortoch his back was almost touching
the rock now and a desperate plan formed
in his head that was to make a sudden
leap around the rock once behind it and
protected by its mass he would have time
to pull out one of his own voltage bombs
and await mortochs next move

but dynamon had not truly measured
the state of mortochs mind there
was a sudden scream from keltry as mor-
toch with a lightning movement drew back
his right arm and flung the voltage bomb
straight at dynamons chest the little
glass ball sped unerringly across the inter-
vening twenty feet there was no time to
dodge dynamon pressed his back against
the rock and closed his eyes it was the
end

  dynamon felt the little bomb bump his
chest but-wonder of wonders there
was no blinding flash-no explosion there
was just a silvery tinkle as the glass ball
shattered at his feet dynamon opened his
eyes and found that he was still alive an
incredulous shout went up from the horri-
fied crowd and thamon started running to-
ward him

  tridium shouted the scientist you
have discovered tridium

  as in a dream dynamon saw the sol-
diers overpowering mortoch and heard
himself say what do you mean where
is the tridium  he stared about in wonder

  the rock cried thamon excitedly
you touched the rock and were instantly
insulated against the electric charge great
heavens what a discovery every one of
these luminous rocks must be made of
tridium

  dynamon turned around and placed a
hand on the glowing rock instantly he
felt himself enveloped in an extraordinary
transparent aura

  you seel cried thamon and struck
at the rock with his metal rod evidently
it was almost as soft as chalk for several
pieces as big as a mans fist chipped off and
fell to the ground thamon stooped down


planet stories

and picked one of the pieces up and im-
mediately he too stood in a curious
gleaming aura

  its tridium all right i exclaimed the
scientist there can be no doubt about
it we knew it was on saturn and we
knew what its properties were but we
didnt know what it looked like do you
realize what this means dynamon it
means that we may finally have found the
defense against the photo-atomic ray
dynamon felt a little dizzy not only
had he been snatched from what appeared
to be certain death but he had inadver-
tently made a discovery that might save the
people of the world from conquest at the
hands of the martians

  thamon are you quite sure he said
are you quite sure that this will work
against the ray

  no replied thamon promptly i
wont be quite sure until weve tested it
out from a theoretical standpoint this
glowing cloud this aura that surrounds
us as we touch a piece of tridium should
insulate us against the ray but to be ab-
solutely certain somebody will have to ex-
pose himself to the ray someone among
us must go up to the surface holding a
piece of tridium in his hand and face the
martians if he is killed then im wrong
but if he is not killed then the martians
are at our mercy we can walk up to
them untouched and crush their egg-shell
skulls with our bare fists

  i see said dynamon gravely then
one of us must be a heroic experimental
guinea pig

  exactly said thamon

  dynamon looked over the silent group
of soldiers at mortoch shoulders hunched
in the grip of two stalwarts then he
bowed his head in thought for a moment

  men he said finally this is not a
case of calling for volunteers i think
any one of us is brave enough to offer his
life for the good of the rest of the human
beings but i think we should decide who
is to do this dirty work by drawing lots
no

  it was mortoch in his eyes was a wild
hunted look and his voice was hoarse but
there was deep sincerity in his tones
dynamon said the chief decurion

i went off my head with jealousy a min-
ute ago the madness is gone now and
i would give anything if i could undo
what i did you must give me the chance
to redeem myself if i am killed so much
the better for me and if i am not so
much the better for all the human beings
in the world

  dynamon looked long and searchingly at
the decurion finallv he said mortoch

i	cannot deny your appeal take this piece
of tridium and go up the shaft we will
be close behind you to observe the experi-
ment

  just then there was a shout from the
two soldiers who were guarding the pas-
sageway to the pit

  martians they cried they are
coming down on us the shaft is full of
them

  dynamon walked straight toward mor-
toch and placed the piece of tridium in his
hand-

  your ordeal is at hand he said cimply
as in a flash the bright aura transferred
itself to the person of mortoch

the two soldiers guarding the entrance
to the pit were backing away to either
side and throwing voltage bombs into the
passageway as mortoch ran toward them

  stop he shouted never slackening his
pace this is my job get out of range

  he halted six feet away from the mouth
of the passage and raised his arms up in a
gesture of defiance an admiring gasp
went up from the crowd of watching hu-
mans at the tall lean figure bathed in its
luminous glow then a deathly silence
shut down abruptly as four little figures
erupted through the passageway mar-
tians 

  they were scarcely two feet tall with
spindly little bodies and legs but their
heads were more than twice the size of
human heads and looked doubly grotesque
in their combination helmet-masks one
of them was holding a big black cone-the
photo-atomic generator quickly the lit-
tle creature leveled it at mortoch and pulled
a lever on the side an ominous high-
pitched hum filled the air and everyone
knew that the death ray was being poured
in all its deadly violence on mortoch
cave-dwellers of saturn



  thamon was the first to raise his voice
in a shout as mortoch unharmed strode
forward and felled the martian with one
blow of his fist the air rang with human
cheers as mortoch siezed two more scur-
rying martians by the legs-and dashed their
brains out on the ground

  it works thamon yelled hysterically
its tridium were saved

  the scientist was hacking crazily at the
rock with his metal staff and jubilant sol-
diers swarmed around him picking up
pieces of tridium in a few moments the
whole force every man surrounded by the
luminous aura was bolting through the
passageway into the bottom of the pit

  for a short time the martians tried to
put up a battle but with their chief
weapon nullified they were slaughtered by
the dozen and the survivors began flitting
up the shaft in the midst of the turmoil
dynamon kept his wits about him he
knew that in order to realize the full value
of the trklium discovery the martians on
the surface must be kept from learning
about- it he raised his voice in a mighty
shout over the clamor

  masks on up the shaft at full speed
we must not allow a single martian to
reach the surface

  swiftly the earth-soldiers fastened their
masks and took off straight upward each
one of them clung to their precious lumps
of tridium and in a short time the dark
shaft presented an extraordinary spectacle
each of the twenty-odd humans was bathed
in his own ghostly envelope of light and
the fleeing martians looking downward
must have felt as if they were being pur-
sued by a squadron of giant fireflies

  the survivors of the massacre below
had a head start of their pursuers but be-
ing so much lighter in weight their
gravity-repellors could not push them up
through the atmosphere as fast as the hu-
mans could go gradually they were over-
taken and destroyed by dynamons force
-the last martian being caught just at the
upper mouth of the pit

dynamon quickly gathered his men
about him while he took stock of the
situation in the valley the three carriers
were in the same position as they were

before but there were no earth-soldiers
left standing a little circle of fallen bod-
ies offered mute testimony to the hopeless
battle put up by the force of three decuria
which had made that ill-fated sortie from
the carrier now the martians from both
of the red ships-excluding of course the
group that had been cut to pieces in the
pit-were gathered in a body near the
earth carrier dynamon guessed that they
were waiting to see what the earth people
were going to do next they would soon
find out the centurion thought grimly
even though there were probably close to
two hundred of the evil little creatures
down there they would be no match for
the brawny humans insulated against the
photo-atomic ray

  swiftly dynamon formulated a plan of
action his first consideration was to try
and seize both martian carriers if pos-
sible they must be prevented from leaving
the ground and carrying back to mars the
warning that at last the humans had found
a defense against the ray with that in
mind the centurion divided his little force
in two one decuria with its decurion he
put under mortoch and the other he com-
manded himself each group was to strike
boldly at one of the martian ships mon-
toch the nearer one himself the farther
one

  dynamon issued his commands by signs
hoping to remain unnoticed by the enemy
if he refrained from using the radio-phone
but as he led his group off along the hill-
side a sudden activity among the martians
in the valley told him that he had been
sighted they came streaming across the
valley floor toward the heights on a shallow
crescent each wing spreading to perform
an enveloping movement

  what an unpleasant surprise the nasty
little devils are going to get thought dyna-
mon and he switched on his radio-phone

  follow me now on the dead run

  he dug his toes into the yielding gray
sand and ran along the hillside bending
low into the wind it was heavy going but
the humans were able to make faster prog-
ress than their enemies because of their
greater weight dynamon saw that he and
his group were outrunning the martians
and would probably reach their objective


planet stories

sooner two thoughts arose in his mind
to worry him one was that the mar-
tians inside the red ships might lock their
doors and take off before he and mortoch
respectively could reach them the other
was the fear that borion inside the earth-
carrier not knowing of the new defense
against the ray would sally out in a des-
perate attempt to save-as he might think
-the two isolated detachments of humans

  however dynamon reflected those were
eventualities over which he had no control
all he could do under the circumstances
avas pray for good luck

a glance down into the valley told
him that he and his little force were
abreast of the earth-carrier by now with
a half a mile still to go to reath the mar-
tian ship the martians running parallel
were falling behind a little rapping out
a command into his transmitter dynamon
changed his direction slightly and swung
downhill on a direct line with the red ship
at the same time he and his men read-
justed their gravity-control so that their
speed was almost doubled away to their
left the martian horde was dropping be-
hind dynamon gave an involuntary
shout of triumph he and his party was
going to win the race

  as the little knot of speeding humans
approached within a hundred yards of the
martian carrier another cheer broke from
dynamons lips the door at the side of
the carrier swung open and a score of
little creatures carrying the once-dreaded
black cones tumbled out the martians in-
side the ship far from running away were
coming out to fight-mistakingly confident
that the twelve humans were at their
mercy

   quickly dynamon issued orders that two
of his men should immediately penetrate
the inside of the carrier and seize the con-
trol-room while the rest stayed outside
and engaged the martian warriors then
panting for breath but none the less con-
fident the decuria closed in on the mar-
tians

  they were within twenty-five yards of
the dwarf-like little creatures before the
martians discovered that something was
amiss with the photo-atomic ray the

ugly little men hesitated in momentary
dismay and then started to make a dash
for the inside of the carrier but by that
time it was too late

  the twelve humans clothed in their life-
preserving auras swept down on the mar-
tians like avenging angels all the pent-
up hatred against this diabolically cruel
enemy now found release at last the
martian superiority in weapons was
broken dynamon and his men waded im-
placably into the terrified little ogres and
slew them without mercy the whole busi-
ness was over in less than two minutes

  without the loss of a man dynamon
had annihilated the defenders of the car-
rier and two of his soldiers were inside
in possession of the control-room there
remained now the job of handling the
hundred or so martians who were moving
over the gray sand toward his victorious
decuria

  but this force of the enemy had realized
that something was radically wrong they
were no longer running but in fact were
slowing up to a halt about fifty yards
away dynamon swung an arm and began
to walk toward them the black cones
came up pointing all along the long line
of martians dynamons men fanned out
on either side of him walking forward
slowly inexorably

  the line of martians wavered uncer-
tainly and then began to fall back in ter-
rified confusion as the humans remained
unharmed by the ray dynamons voice
crackled in nine sets of ear-phones and
the decuria lunged forward in a moment
they were in the midst of a panic-stricken
mass of scurrying martians again the
soldiers from earth slew pitilessly until
in a short while fifty-odd of the harried
little creatures lay dead the rest were
scattered in headlong flight over the valley

the business was accomplished none
too soon the thing which dynamon
had feared might happen earlier happened
now a force of humans unprotected by
tridium emerged from the big gray car-
rier and hastened toward dynamon a
few minutes earlier and these men would
have been mowed down by the ray the
centurion sighed with relief and ordered
cave-dwellers of saturn



the newcomers back to the cosmos carrier

  the danger was over

  twenty minutes later dynamon had
joined forces again with mortochs detach-
ment and was marching back to the mouth
of the pit where keltry and thamon were
waiting the past hour had seen a com-
plete and sweeping triumph for the hu-
mans mortochs attack on the other
martian ship had been as successful as
dynamons now both of the martian
carriers were captured and their crews
and warriors cut to pieces and all this
had been accomplished with the loss of
but one man one of mortochs soldiers
had fallen and dropped his lump of
tridium the man had instantly died un-
der the photo-atomic ray

  there remained only one more piece of
business to conclude successfully the ex-
pedition to saturn and dynamon set about
it promptly once again he led the way
down the pit to the nether world

  there was great excitement at the bot-
tom of the shaft the saturnians were
disposing of the bodies of the martians
who had fallen in the first onslaught when
mortoch had proven the efficacy of tridium
and as dynamon landed among them
closely followed by thamon keltry and
the soldiers the saturnians crowded around
in an condition bordering on hysteria
they had never before seen martians or
even dreamed of their existence so it was
not to be wondered at that the primitive
humans of the nether world were excited
when the sudden fierce combat broke out
almost in their midst with the greatest
difficulty dynamon quieted them down
enough so that they heard and complied
with his request to be taken to their queen

  queen diana he said directly in
your kingdom you have any quantity-
thousands of tons-of this luminous rock
which we have identified as tridium this
substance is the one thing which can save
the people of the earth from the death -
ray of the martians will you give me
your permission to carry away some of
these rocks back to earth so that our
armies can defend themselves against our
enemies 

  the little queen gave dynamon a long
languorous look

  if you stay here and be my king she
answered at length i will permit your
people to carry away as many of the rocks

as they want

  dynamons heart sank he had hoped
that queen diana had got over that idea
what was he going to do

  well queen diana he said slowly
trying frantically to think of some way out
i cant tell you how flattered i am at
your proposal but i dont see how i can
accept it

  why not the queen demanded im-
periously

dynamon shook his head helplessly
he was trying to think of some tact-
ful way of telling this spoiled little woman
that his heart already belonged to keltry

  well perhaps you have noticed he
began that someone else on this expedi-
tion has a-a claim-er-

  who do you mean the queen inter-
rupted the tall dark man the one
called mortoch

  mortoch said dynamon wonder-
ingly

  yes isnt that what youre trying to
tell me mortoch thats very interest-
ing said the queen dreamily come to
think of it i had noticed that he looked
at me very intensely

  a great light dawned on dynamon
the queen was jumping to a quite dif-
ferent set of conclusions he had tried
to tell her that he was in love with keltry
and she thought he was telling her that
mortoch was in love with her the queen

  i think that is very generous of you
dynamon said the queen with a brilliant
smile you are standing aside in favor of
mortoch because in your eyes his bravery
in facing the martians gives him a greater
claim on my hand

  dynamon nodded wisely

  he is a very handsome man the
queen went on looking off into space
perhaps youre right

  he is just outside said dynamon
rising let me bring him in to you

  before the little queen could say any-
thing more dynamon walked briskly out
to the mouth of the cave and hailed
mortoch

  i remember hearing you say he said
as the chief decurion came up to him
that you wouldnt mind staying here with
queen diana well it seems that you are
to have your wish the queen is deter-
mined to marry one of us and right at
this moment she is inclining toward you
as a husband i think its a fine idea
mortoch turned startled eyes on the
centurion then he began to grin

  is that a command  he asked

  it is dynamon replied

  i could do lots worse said mortoch
although im liable to get homesick now
and then

  dont forget said dynamon youll
be king of saturn or at least of this part
of saturn go on inside now shes wait-
ing for you

  not long afterwards queen diana her
eyes shining appeared at the entrance to
her cave her hand rested lightly on
mortochs arm and she announced to her
people that at last she was taking a hus-
band and giving the nether world of
saturn a king as cheer after cheer went
up from the bearded saturnians dynamon
bent over the queens hand and kissed it
he then received gracious permission to
take away as much tridium as he needed

keltry stood between dynamon and
thamon and the three of them stared
into the bow periscope screens in the con-
trol-room of the carrier borion came
over and joined them

  well there she is said the navigator
fondly there was a time back there on
saturn when i kind of doubted that any of
us would ever see her again

  the chief image in the screens was a
glowing sphere about the size of a mans
head it was earth already the watch-
ers in the control-room could make out
the outlines of the continents

  but at that i guess we got off lightly
continued borion we lost thirtyrnine
men-including mortoch-but just think
what were bringing back weve got
enough tridium in these three carriers to
divide up among ten thousand men i was
afraid we might have trouble with so much
of the stuff-afraid it might affect the
magnets
cave-dwellers of saturn	

  no its a curiously inert substance
said thamon i suppose thats why it can
absorb the terrific shock of the photo-
atomic ray so easily whats the news
from headquarters dynamon

  its pretty sketchy said the centurion
argallum was afraid to say too much for
fear the martians might be able to decode
the message but it looks as if we are
going to be just about in the nick of time
the martian invasion began ten months
ago just about the time we were leaving
saturn even though they came without
warning in thousands of ships our people
managed to beat them off for quite a while
some cities were destroyed but copia
wasnt touched-too well guarded but
then even though our people maintained
and still do maintain superiority in the
air those martian devils found some re-
mote desert spot unguarded and landed
thousands of their men they were all
equipped with the ray of course and our
land forces simply couldnt stand up
against them theyve been driving stead-
ily ever since and right now theyre within
seventy miles of copia

  whew gasped borion

  i should say we are in the nick of
time said keltry

  heavens exclaimed thamon i shud-
der to think what would happen to the
world right now keltry if you hadnt
fallen down that pit

  thats right laughed dynamon

  just then a communications man walked
into the control-room and handed dyna-
mon a message

  he read it avidly

  thats good news the centurion re-
marked looking up from the piece of pa-
per argallum is sending a heavy convoy
to meet us how soon will we be landing
borion 

  well we should hit the top of the
stratosphere in less than an hour the
navigator replied from there on down
-at reduced speed-will probably take an-
other two hours

  in that case said dynamon i think
wed better shut down on all conversation
even argallum doesnt know what were
bringing back-im taking no chances on
having our secret get out to the enemy

he only knows that we are returning with
two captured martian carriers so make
your dispositions borion because in five
minutes im going to order everyone on
all three ships to landing stations

the next three hours were tense ones
for the returning expedition even
though a convoy had been promised dyna-
mon was apprehensive about possible at-
tacks by the martians who he was sure
must know something of what was going
on but as it worked out a perfect cloud
of gray cosmos carriers came out to meet
the voyagers from saturn and dynamon
was able to set his ships down at vanadium
field without mishap

  a heavy guard was thrown around the
precious cargoes and the young centurion
was whisked away to government city

  what did you find the commander-
in-chiefs face was haggard

  we found tridium said dynamon
tons of it we had an opportunity to test
it and it proved to be a complete defense
against the ray

   how difficult is it to get at 

   not difficult at all said dynamon we
brought back enough to equip nearly ten
thousand men

  heaven be praised said argallum
fervendy we might pull out of this situa-
tion yet those devils have been sweep-
ing everything before them we cut off
their communications with our air power
but that didnt stop them theyve been
living off the land and theyre so powerful
that theyve been able to overrun territory
at will

  dynamon glanced at his watch it is
almost noon he said it will take just
one counter-attack to break through their
line and roll it up in both directions if
you throw attack-units forward as fast as
they can be equipped with tridium you
will have the martians in a rout before
sundown

  and it was so

  dynamon stood beside argallum two
hours later on a little knoll sixty miles out
of copia a wide plain stretched before
their eyes and across its width a beaten
discouraged army of humans gave ground
slowly before hordes of tiny malevolent
cave-dwellers of saturn	

creatures from another planet as the two
men watched a fresh column of earth-
soldiers issued forth from a woods in the
center of the plain there was a curious
greenish shimmer surrounding this new
column - a will-o-the-wisp mirage-like
quality-and it advanced without hesita-
tion straight into the serried ranks of the
tejrible martians

great heavens cried argullum

theyre walking right up to them and
not a man is down  look the martians
are reeling back our voltage bombs are
killing them like flies

dynamon turned away from the scene
of carnage with a curious smile he knew
that argallum in his gratitude would prob-
ably want to throw every conceivable honor
and promotion at him for bringing three
carrier loads of tridium back from saturn
he dynamon would very likely become a
world-wide hero and yet he reflected it
was a feat which could never have been
accomplished if it hadnt been for a series
of unrelated incidents if keltry hadnt
stowed away she couldnt have fallen down
the pit thus leading to the discovery of
queen dianas nether world if mortoch
had not rebelled and tried to kill him with
a voltage bomb- if he hadnt happened
to touch the rock with his back-

dynamon turned and looked out on to
the battle field where the victorious earth-
soldiers in their tridium-auras were venge-
fully slaughtering the hideous martians

and he thought of the incident which had
to precede all the other incidents so that
he could bring back the tridium that
was the incident which had occurred hun-
dreds of years before when a man named
leonard bolton had built a space ship
and had traveled to saturn in it breaking
through the burnt-out crust into the nether
world boring the long hole with his
clumsy medieval carrier that was the
hole that keltry had fallen into

dynamon shook his head leonard bol-
ton had built his space ship in the year
 the last year but one of the long
series of frightful wars in which the
divided peoples of the world tried to de-
stroy one another-and very nearly suc-
