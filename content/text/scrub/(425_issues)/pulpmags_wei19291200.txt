n you guess
is mans age

 f you can tell within  years
 author couldnt but he stuck
  hobart bradstreet until he re-
 ed his method of staying young

  d to pride myself on guessing peoples ages
-t was before i met hobart bradstreet whose
i missed by a quarter-century but before
 yon how old he really is let me say this
meeting-up with bradstreet i count the
et day of my life for while we often hear
fflr minds and bodies are about  efficient
at times feel it to be the truth-he knows
furthermore he knows how to overcome it
ive minutes-nd he showed me how

 man offers no such bromides as setting-up
ses deep-breathing or any of those things
now at the outset youll never do he uses a
pie that is the foundation of all chiropractic
pithy mechario-therapy and even osteop-
only he does not touch a hand to you it
aecessary

i reader will grant bradstreets method of
g young worth knowing and using when
he secret

i here is the secret he keeps his spine in trim
 man or woman who thinks spine motion
t make a difference should try it it is easy
h ill tell you how first though you may
ious to learn why a healthy spine puts one
entirely new class physically the spinal
n is a series of tiny bones between which
ids or cushions of cartilage nothing in tha
try activities of us humans stretches the
so it settles day by day until those once
nd resilient pads become thin as a safety-
blade-and just about as hard ones spine
most wonderfully designed shok-absorber
l is then an unyielding column that trans-
very shock straight to the base of the brain
you wonder folks have backaches and head-
 that ones nerves pound toward the end
sard day or that a nervous system may
ically go to pieces for every nerve in ones
connects with the spine which is a sort of
switchboard when the insulation or
ige wears-down and flattens-out the nerves
xposed or even impinged-and there la
e on the line

r for proof that sublaxation of the spine
i most of the ills and ailments which spell
in men or women flex your spine-shake
-and they will disappear youll feel the
nice in ten minutes at least i did its no
to secure complete spinal laxation as brad-
does it but like everything else one must
how no amount of violent exercise will do
t even chopping wood as for walking or
r your spine settles down a bit firmer with
step

bradstreet has evolved from his -year cx-
ce with spinal mechanics a simple boiled-
ormula of just five movements neither takes
than one minute so it means but five minutes
but those movements i never experienced
ompound exhilaration before i was a good
t for the test for i went into it with a dull
che at the end of the second movement i
lit i could actually feel my blood circulating
lird movement in this remarkable sfine-mo-
series brought an amazing feeling of ex-
tion one motion seemed to open and shut
ickbone like a jack-knife
ked about constipation he gave me another
n-a peculiar writhing and twisting move-
-and fifteen minutes later came a complete
ition

art bradstreet frankly gives the full credit of
nspicuous success to these simple secrets of
motion he has traveled about for years con-
g those whose means permitted a specialist
beck and call i met him at the royctoft
east aurora but bradstreet young as he
and feels thinks he has chased around the

    hobart bradstreet the man who defies ags

country long enough he has been prevailed upon
to put his spixe-motion method in form that
makes it now generally available

  i know what these remarkable mechanics of th
spine have done for me i have checked up at least
twenty-five other cases with ail sincerity i veliev
nothing in the whole realm of medici or special-
ism can quicker remake rejuvenate and restore
one i wish you could see bradstreet himself ha
is arrogantly healthy he doesnt seem to have any
nerves yet he puffs incessantly at a black cigar
that would floor some men drinks two cups of
coffee at every meal and i dont believe he aver-
ages seven hours sleep it shows what a sound
nerve-mechanism will do he says a mans power
can and should be unabated up to the age of bo
in every sense and i have had some astonishing
testimony on that score

  would you like to try this remarkable method
of coming back or if young and apparently
normal in your action and feelings do you want
to see your energies just about doubled it is easy
no apparatus is required just bradstreets few
simple instructions made doubly clear by his
photographic poses of the five positions results
come amazingly quick in less than a week you
should have new health new appetite new desire
and new capacities youll feel years lifted off
mind and body this mans method can be tested
without risk if you feel enormously benefited
everything is yours to keep and you have paid for
it all the enormous sum of  knowing some-
thing of the fees this man has been accustomed
to receiving i hope his naming  to the gen-
eral public will have full appreciation

  the  which pays for everything is not sent
in advance nor do you make any payment or de-
posit on delivery requests will be answered in
turn try how it feels to have a full-length spine
and youll henceforth pity men and women whoso
nerves are in a vise

vide necessary instructions send everything postpaid without

lost and alien lie the leas

purfled all with euphrasies
where the lunar unicorn
breasts an amber-pouring mom
risen from hesperian seas
of a main that has no bourn

only things impossible
there in deathless glamor dwell
pegasus and sagittary

trotting part the ferns of faery
succubte and seraphim
tryst among the eedars dim
where the beaded waters brim
white limoniads arise

interlacing arms and tresses
with the sun-dark satyresses
there  aquilonian skies
gryphons questing to and fro
for the gold of long ago

find at eve an aureate star
in the gulf crepuscular

there the hyperboreans

pale with wisdom more than man s
tell the wileful centauresses
half their holocryptie lore

there at noon the tritonesses

all bemused with mandragore
mate with satyrs of the shore   

love could we have only found
the forgotten road that runs
under all the sunken suns
to that time-estranged ground
surely love were proven there
more than long and lone despair
holden and felicitous

love were fortunate to us

and we too might ever dwell
deathless and impossible

in those amber-litten leas

circled all with euphrasies


 all of a sudden the office was very quiet as some-
 times happens for an instant or two and a few
 w words reached me oh he wont dare kick
 the manager was saying hes a pretty weak sister
 mechanically i went on with my work wondering
 vaguely who the weak sister could be a new man

 partment and desks were being
 moved to make room for him a
 minute later i looked up and saw
 the chief clerk standing at my
 side bob he crisply ordered

 corner i want this space for
 the new assistant ive hired

 then he turned and strode away

   i gulped and wilted down into
 my chair i was the weak sis-
 ter and i was actually being
 demoted the new man was be-
 ing hired for my place this
 was my reward for ali my hard
 work-this was how i won out
 by waiting patiently for my turn
 to be promoted i had even con-
 gratulated myself on my close-
 lipped reserved manner--i

 gan to vanish one morning  got up my courage and

the pseudo-science of yesterday is the science of today scientific
thought and conceptions of the universe are changing so rapidly that
the science textbooks in the public schools lag far behind scientific
discovery the imaginative weird-scientific stories in weird tales are pre-
cursors of what scientific speculation may be twenty years from now the
swift-changing conceptions of the universe have fired the imaginations of that
brilliant group of young writers who construct the fascinating weird-scientific
stories in this magazine the vast majority of our readers receive these
stories enthusiastically but a few of you complain that the stories of inter-
stellar and interplanetary travels are so wildly fantastic and impossible that
you can not enjoy them complaint is also made when our writers picture
worlds ruled by strange monsters for you say it is inconceivable that a
world can be run by intelligent beings in the form of gigantic insects or even
stranger monsters we wish to call three books to the attention of these read-
ers two of these books are by charles fort neiv lands and the booh of
ilie damned in these books although fort does not prove incontestably that
beings from other planets are actually visiting our earth at least he piles
up such a mass of evidence to support this proposition that the reader must
admit its possibility the third book maurice maeterlincks la vie des
termites now available in english translation under the title the life of
the white ant shows that these creatures possess tremendous ability scien-
tific achievement and constructive intelligence that would threaten the rule
of man with overthrow except that the white ants are limited by climate the
manner in which they have solved scientific problems that have baffled man
opens up a remarkable field for imaginative speculation

    i have been a constant reader of your magazine for the last four years
writes elmo james of fort pierce florida and i take this opportunity of
thanking you for making it possible it provides a wonderful avenue upon
which i ride away from the dull and drab things of everyday commonplace-
ness i would be completely at a loss if i did not find a story of de grandin
by quinn any more it seems that i know him quite intimately i also like

the stories by eli colter very much i prefer stories of devil-worshipers
and of reincarnations i havent noticed any stories of werewolves lately
whats the matter have some of your readers kicked on that type of
story

    in your august number another masterful writer bassett morgan
looms up as a dangerous rival to the great lovecraft writes e l mengs-
hoel of minneapolis his story demon doom of nyeng sen holds the
readers attention in a real gorilla grip but how shockingly cruel but
then such bestialities perpetrated by so-called civilized beings on the poor
savages are certainly not unheard of however morgans story is written in
an unsurpassingly fascinating way from start to finish-even though one can
not exactly relish such passages in it as must be real delicacies for certain
readers with manifestly sadist tendencies one of them even a woman who
have voiced their requirements in your magazine

    mrs m sherbank of san francisco writes to the eyrie have just
started reading your fascinating magazine and regret to think of all fve
missed before really it is by far the best mystery magazine on the market-
im sure any average human being would agree to that i especially delight
in the outside the universe type of story-it takes one so far away from
daily troubles and routine for a while

    if robert e howard keeps up to the level he has set in skull-face he
will be hailed as the new sax rohmer writes ernest h ormsbee of sel-
kirk new york the story is a sax rohmer story i had to turn back to
the title-page when this installment was half read to convince myself that
the old master of the oriental tale had not returned to us i thoroughly
enjoy interplanetary romances and you have given us several but the
stories that get my undivided support are stories like skull-face-oriental
guile and subtlety fiendish cruelty of the to us twisted minds of the mongol
eastern cunning against western aggressiveness

    here is a suggestion from gaylord bell of mount vernon washington
i and many of my friends wish your publication would conduct a column
wherein questions from the subscribers might be authoritatively answered i
am so full of such quizzes as do wolves really run in packs what
nationality is bram stoker are there any real proofs that once a con-
tinent atlantis actually existed and many others that i feel certain this
column would prove a popular success

    why have you eliminated torture tales entirely asks albert james
cabral of provincetown massachusetts this is a great blow to this great
magazine that is what the cream of weird fiction consists of the prince
of modern story-writers deals with it in his famous novel the ilounds of god
which tells about the inquisition the horror palace of spain yet you dear
friend have taken torture tales out of your magazine please publish some
more tales such as ii w munns the chain-a masterpiece of weird fiction

the old sea-dogs who spent
their evenings seated on the
terrace of the inn which over-
looked the sea had never seen zinzin
arrive in such a condition before his
eyes were popping from his head
and he was as pale as death as soon
as he had had time to drop into a
chair they pressed anxiously around
him

 what is the matter zinzin
what is the matter old fellow
captain michel asked

 zinzin made a sign that he was
still unable to speak but at last he
wiped his forehead

  translated by mildred gleason prochet

    

  i have just come from the police
commissioner he began and he
gave me a most horrible bit of
news

  tell us about it before it becomes
old stuff gaubert exclaimed the
story is sure to change with time  

  oh this doesnt date from yes-
terday zinzin murmured with a
sinister laugh

 then why so much excitement
today

  ill tell you why shortly the
other replied dismally i was mixed
up in it when i was very young it
narrowly missed making me a land-

story if im not fertilizing a crop of

stir in its time they even took the
ease up to the court of assizes
stories of marriages exist by the
legion grouehy old chanlieu re-
marked i know ten myself

  i only know one zinzin replied

with a groan but i warn you that
it is more horrible than all ten of
chaulieus put together

 he sighed heavily again and
lighted his pipe i never told you
anything about it before he spat
out because it seemed such an ut-
terly fantastic affair but today i

  well what is it what is it zin-
zin

  it is a horrible story zinzin
choked

  perhaps chaulieu added quiet-
ly and skeptically

  zinzin cast him a murderous look
in all my life i have only been in
love once he went on and it was
that time it never happened again
because i never met another such
girl her name was olvmpe and
there were a dozen of us who wanted
to marry her

  and here the impossible begins
sneered chaulieu

  twelve i tell you ill give you
their names in a moment and that
doesnt include those who did not
openly propose there wasnt a man
in the whole country who would not
have wanted to she wasnt rich but
she came of good family-and beau-
tiful at the time of which i speak
she was just seventeen years old
her section of the country was noted
for its beautiful women-a big pleas-
ant suburb worth visiting if only to
watch the girls come home from
church on sundays

  well in all the town there was
not one girl fit to tie her shoes and
that meant a lot    listen if you
have ever gone to cagnes perhaps
you have seen renoirs portraits of
young girls    those pictures are
pure fantasy-pictures of flowers
and sunlight not humans well
olympe was like that a ray of sun
and the petals of a rose a dream
but a dream with eyes and a mouth
   enormous childish eyes with
supernatural purity in their gaze
and the mouth of a woman the
mouth alone was of flesh and blood
olympe was like an angel come down
to earth to kiss

  we were all crazy about her she
lived alone with her grandmother
who had taken her from school at
the death of her parents and en-
trusted her to the safe care of the

servant palmire who was the girls
willing slave olympe was still much
of a child often playing with the
country urchins returning home
with armfuls of wild flowers bas-
kets filled with wild strawberries
she would run behind the flocks with
the sheep-dogs when she crossed
them on the road and often scandal-
ized the old women by returning
home at night astride a goat

  in nice weather the old people
would sit outside their doors on
little wooden benches and wait for
her to come she had a wonderful
imagination and told them stories
which she made up as she went
along

tpiie grandmother who in her
day had been the beautiful
madame gratien lived in a big old
house on the place de labbaye the
gardens were closed in by walls and
at the back looked out on the open
country she knew all the elite of
the neighborhood and had main-
tained connections in the city

  the behavior of her granddaugh-
ter had amused her in the beginning
but at last it began to preoccupy her
olympe seemed very thoughtless for
her age    what would happen
when she was alone in the world
madame gratien suddenly decided
to marry her off as soon as possible

  she had already received several
offers for the hand of her grand-
daughter and when it was known
that she no longer discouraged suit-
ors they besieged her on all sides
this flood of admirers was a new
game for olympe finally one sun-
day we wtere all gathered in the liv-
ing-room when the grandmother
gave olympe a little talking-to she
told her that she was beginning to
be very tired and weary with life
and that she would like to see
olympe settled down before she died
olympe greeted this announcement
with tears we thought that the
the mystery of the pour husbands



prospect of the old ladys death sad-
dened her but olympe explained it
differently as though it were gay
to marry she said when we tried to
cheer her up

  we burst out laughing at that
and all swore that her husband
would be perfectly willing to be her
slave

   first of all i do not want to
leave grandmother she said nor
palmire    and secondly i want
to live in our old house 

   agreed agreed we answered in
chorus

   and now said good madame
gratieii  which one are you going to
choose 

   oh well talk of that later said
olympe this is no way to marry
people off youre really not serious
aboitt it grandmother

   for six months youve said the
same thing that youd talk it over
later now its become a joke you
know that i have always done every-
thing you wanted before    come
if you were obliged to choose one of
these gentlemen which would you
take

  olympe suddenly became serious
and we watched her anxiously   
in spite of our apparent acceptance
of the whole thing as a joke we were
dead serious   

  she stood up walked around us
and sized us up from head to foot
with such funny expressions that we
were more than a little embarrassed
if i live to be a thousand ill never
forget that scene what an exam-
ination to be truthful we hardly
dared breathe

  she made us stand lined its up
placing us changing us-advancing a
man to the head of the line and then
after looking him straight in the eyes
sending him back to third or fourth
position the grandmother encour-
aged us from time to time with a
 hold yourselves well gentlemen   

hold yourselves well  be seri-
ous 

  it was funny when one thinks
that we were not all young men
either i well remember the arrival
of the town registrar respectable
monsieur paeifire who for two years
had openly bid for olympes hand
he came late and naturally did not
know what it was all about

 she met him at the door and
placed him dumfounded at the end
of the line he had the last number
you can imagine how we laughed
but you can bet that when he knew
what it was all about he did not laugh
at all

  at last it is done she an-
nounced if i many ill take mon-
sieur delphin first then monsieur hu-
bert then monsieur sabin then my
little zinzin as you see i was number
four then monsieur jacobini   
and she went on down the whole
twelve of us    ill enumerate
them st monsieur delphin a nice
fellow with a great future ahead of

had taken his degree in science was
working for a fellowship in chemistry

weird tales

registrar    yes that makes twelve
we were only twelve that day

qix months later olympe married
number one young delphin we
all went to the wedding-but not to
have a good time i tried to reason
against it but i would have given
anything to be in delphins shoes
the following year however i no
longer envied him he wras dead

  no one knows exactly what he
died of they say that he avas poi-
soned by some laboratory work but
nothing was sure the physician who
attended him dr sabin shook his
head when he was questioned i think
that in reality he thought of only one
thing in short that he had now be-
come number two and that if any-
thing were to happen to the forest
warden who preceded him he might
yet hope for a chance

  it seemed impossible but olympe
had become even lovelier since her
marriage now when she passed in
her widow s weeds she was something
to kneel before and worship but she
did not mourn her dead husband for
long in fact if one can believe old
palmire monsieur delphin was not
excessively gay and for a young hus-
band spent too much time in his lab-
oratories leaving his young wife for
entire days while he searched for
heaven knows what in the bottoms of
his test-tubes

 monsieur huberts turn was
bound to arrive and he did not lose
time in pressing his suit and in prom-
ising her all the gayeties that she had
missed since her first marriage he
was a jolly fellow that hubert fond
of good food an excellent drinker and
hunter as was fitting with a man of
his position and name

  big celebrations and big parties
now took place at olympes she be-
gan to ride horseback and there was
not another like her for fifty miles
around it was a sight to see her hunt
the deer and wild boar nothing

frightened her we had trouble to
keep up with her and afterward she
presided over the banquet with a
sparkle and an ardor that gave us all
fever

  she was more courted than ever
but she made fun of us and kept her
loveliest and gayest smiles for dr
sabin he is number three she ex-
claimed laughing  everyone in turn i

  hey hubert interrupted  i
never felt better in my life 

   and i take care of him replied
the doctor he is the one man whom
im not permitted to kill thank the
fortune hubert which prohibits me
from choosing my victims 

nphis was all very nice but it
-seemed to me that dr sabin
made too much use of his position of
family doctor in order to be familiar
with olympe they were often seen
alone in the park back of the house or
even going for a little outing in the for-
est when hubert called away on busi-
ness or some bachelor party in the neigh-
boring town left olympe for a few
hours she had become the general
topic of conversation in the village
she scandalized the habitues of the
five oclock teas at madame tabu-
reaus the mayors wife or at ma-
dame blancmougins the wife of the
solicitor whose son had received num-
ber eight in the general classing ma-
dame blancmougin never ceased con-
gratulating herself on her sons lucky
escape

    in fact after the death of old ma-
dame clratien which had occurred in
the meantime olympe no longer kept
her desires within any limits and she
frightened many people by the liberty
of those desires hubert made no at-
tempt to restrain her he was amused
and flattered by the number of victims
won by those innocent blue eyes and
that bright mouth which seemed to be
always asking for a-kiss

  he was a good liver that hubert
but not a real lover my palmire
the mystery of the four husbands



would whisper to those who liked to
be informed of all that went on in
the house he certainly loves his food
more than his bed if madame were
not so honest that fact might give
him a bad jolt 

    and so saying she shook her
head on seeing olympe and dr sabin
come in from one of the lessons in
driving those driving-lessons had
started a lot of gossip which was cut
short by a new misfortune in place
de labbaye

  delphin had installed a labora-
tory in an isolated building in a far
comer of the grounds and this hu-
bert had made into a sort of hunting-
pavilion he had furnished it with
his guns his knives his rifles his pis-
tols and had also stored his ammuni-
tion there it was like a little armory
with the exception of the walls which
were decorated with the usual tro-
phies it was a pleasant little spot
covered with climbing vines and flow-
ers and there was a fine view of the
fields and country beyond he often
had lunch served there in order to be
alone with liis wife or friends away
from the ears of the servants

  it was there that hubert was
found one afternoon in august with
a pistol in his hands and a bullet
through his heart

  suicide or accident several
even murmured the word crime   
but it was said so low that no one
heard them

  you can imagine what a stir it
caused an inquest was held the as-
sistant district attorney who was
number eleven managed the affair it
was dr sabin number three who
was called to give his opinion  the
nature of the death he pronounced
it accident the inquest hesitated a
long time between accident and sui-
cide but they finally concluded with
the theory of the accident

   my goodness palmire sighed
when she was besieged by many want-
ing to know what madame had to say

about the death of her husband
what should she say she knew
nothing about it of course she had
lunched in the little pavilion with
monsieur    they both had seemed
very gay she left him at about two-
thirty in order to dress for she was
going to town with dr sabin about
three o clock the gardener heard a shot
and ran to the pavilion he found
monsieur stretched out dead and
now you know as much as we do why
should he have committed suicide
life was beautiful and so was
olympe he had everything to make
him happy and now olympe is cry-
ing her eyes out which is a stupid
thing to do no one is responsible for
an accident and it was his fault for
not being more careful 

  so spoke palmixe the next year
olympe married dr sabin  

  i expected it interrupted chau-
lieu if your blue-eyed angel with
the passionate mouth had to give her-
self to all twelve of those gentlemen
we havent finished and its not going
to be a funny tale

  i didnt promise you a funny
story i told you that it was horrible
olympe did not give herself to all
twelve since i was number four and
im still alive nevertheless i excuse
chaulieu for his remark because in
the village they began to say  theyll
all go shes capable of it

   and why not if it pleases
olympe palmire replied whenever
she heard something of that kind and
she added scratching her long chin
she would be wrong in hesitating
over it as far as the worth of those
men is concerned 

  it was a terrible thing that she
said in the ignorance of a servant
ready to perjure her soul for her mis-
tress

  dr sabin was certainly a cour-
ageous fellow to many into a house-
hold which seemed destined to misfor-
tune some good old woman of the
kind particularly skilful in slipping in a


weird tales

malicious remark between a frown and
a smile remarked however oh noth-
ing will happen to him he knows
what he is doing

  the town was a-buzz with hor-
rible remarks poor doctor lie did
not deserve what was said since he
too died exactly three months to the
day after his wedding he lasted
even a shorter time than the others

  good lord gaubert whistled

  and so it came your turn said
captain michel

  its beginning to be very amus-
ing remarked chaulieu

  but they all stopped joking zinzin
had become terribly pale and his hand
trembled as he put down his glass
he looked with wild eyes at a man
who was approaching the table

  hello exclaimed the captain
heres the police commissioners or-
derly  

  it was he in fact and he bent over
and whispered in zinzins ear

  weve just had a telephone mes-
sage she has been dead ten years
you dont need to worry any longer
and with that he departed

  as for zinzin he staggered into the
captains arms and had to be taken
home

  lets hope he doesnt kick off be-
fore the end of his story said gau-
bert gently

  chaulieu shrugged his shoulders
bah he said he is working for
a climactic effect

  nevertheless we did not know the
end of the story until eight days later
zinzin certainly had been very ill
this time we listened without inter-
rupting him

tt was my turn then number
fours turn but i was still ig-
norant of the fact i was sailingin
the baltic sea when the thing hap-
pened and i did not leam it until
my return ashore i threw myself on
a train for home and  the way met
lieutenant jacobini number five who

had himself returned only a short
while ago

    our trip was not a merry one i
confess that in spite of the certainty
i now had of being able to marry
olympe and in spite of the hope lieu-
tenant jacobini had of soon being
able to cheer up my widow this
double prospect did not fill us with
merriment the house  place de
labbaye seemed less like a place of
joy to us now and more like a tomb

  the first thing i asked jacobini
after he had told me the sinister news
was naturally if he could give me a
few details on the doctors death
how had he died he answered
gloomily that he hadnt the faintest
idea and that no one else had either
but that he more than anyone wanted
to get to the bottom of it that was
the reason for his return

   and you he asked me

   oh i answered as for me you
can understand that i am interested
in the matter at least as much as you
are 

   yes he replied without the
slightest sarcasm i understand
that  it is an even more urgent
matter for you 

   but i went on they must
have called his death by some name 
 not any more of a name than
they gave the death of olympes first
husband they claimed that delphin
was poisoned by some laboratory ex-
periment but the thing was never
proved and as far as dr sabin is
concerned it cant be that

   all these deaths are certainly
very strange tell me jacobini
amit the police interested in this  

   yes our assistant district at-
torney number eleven lias ordered an
investigation i ought to add that
olympe was the first to ask it   
they made an autopsy on the
bodv   

   and

   and found nothing    but
the mystery of the four husbands



that doesnt prove a thing he added
in a tone which struck me

   what do you mean have you
 a suspicion v
  in such matters replied jaco-
 bini it is not permissible to have
 suspicions one must be certain or
 keep still and he kept still

   but all this did not tend to quiet
 my anxiety

    then he died in his bed was
 he ill

    no olympe found him about
five oclock in the afternoon in his
room stretched out on the floor with a
table and chair overturned his
mouth still foaming and his face dis-
torted from horror  it was
proved that he had been in the room
alone from three oclock on and that
the house was completely deserted as
the servants had gone to a near-by
fair 

   and-madame sabin

   she had lunched with him in
 the little pavilion at the end of the
 garden and had remained there to em-
 broider with palmire 

   	  then what was the conclusion of
 the inquest

      that dr sabin died from an at-
 tack of epilepsy

    was he subject to it

    no but it seems that that does
 not always follow

    we were silent a long time then
 i sighed

    we ought to be sincerely sorry
 for olympe i said because other-
 wise it would be too horrible

    yes he replied after thinking
 a moment you are right it would
 be too horrible    she must be
 pitied besides palmire says that
 she is completely crushed no one
 ever sees her now she never goes
 out according to gossip she wants to
 enter a convent  it is natural
 enough that after three unfortunate
 marriages like these she should be sick
 of matrimony-and-and i congrat-
  ulate you he added with a strange

laugh then he went on quickly be-
cause he was an extremely polite fel-
low i hope i havent pained you in
saying that  

   i dont know i answered

  we arrived an hour later we
hadnt forewarned anyone and it was
already late at night we had de-
cided to o directly to the hotel de
bourgogne and i was surprized to
find the solicitors son number eight
waiting for us on the platform i re-
member his name now he was called
juste there is nothing to say about
him except that he was an honest fel-
low and that dr sabin had often
treated him for rheumatism

    i knew that you had landed  he
said to me and that you were taking
this train what hotel are you going
to

   to the bourgogne with lieuten-
ant jaeobini 

  juste had been so preoccupied
with me that he hadnt noticed my
companion he shook him warmly by
the hand and said that he would go
with us

 t was growing more puzzled every

  l moment at the hotel he followed
me to my room and gave me a packet
for which he asked a receipt

     this was intrusted to my honor 
he said with the mission of giving
into your own hands 

  i examined the sealed envelope
quickly and recognized the writing
immediately my name was written
on the outside with the addition to
be delivered after my death

   yes the other replied i have
accomplished my mission and i am
only accountable to him but since i
havent the faintest idea of what is
contained in that letter i want a re-
ceipt to be on the safe side 

    i gave him his receipt

   in giving you this letter i
asked dr sabin said nothing spe-
cial


weird tales

   not a thing he replied he
told me nothing absolutely nothing

  upon which he shook my hand
and took leave of me a bit hurriedly
he seemed free of a great weight i
opened the letter feverishly

 ten minutes later someone
knocked at jacobinis door he was
just about to get into bed and called
out asking who was there as no
one answered him he went to the door
and opened it impatiently a ghost
with a letter in its hands entered his
room this ghost was i and i hadnt
strength enough even to speak he sat
me down took the letter from my
hands locked the door and read

  i will never forget him as he
stood there bent over the lamp the
letter which had plunged me into a
sort of prostration had an entirely dif-
ferent effect on him everything
about him seemed to tighten up while
with me there had been a complete
loosening of my will-power he
frowned heavily his eyebrows were
knitted his chin grew more prom-
inent and a dangerous flame like the
cold steel flash of a sword lit the eyes
intent on reading the document a
document which had been written by
the trembling hand of a man who
knew himself condemned to death

npnis is what dr sabin had writ-
ten the original has long been
in the police files but this is a copy

dear zinzin 

  before marrying olympe i want
you to read this it is a man who is
about to die tvho is writing you i
have been horribly poisoned no one
knotcs it except the guilty one or
guilty ones and me i have not com-
plained for i have got only what i
deserved thanhs to strong drugs
i have been able at times to overcome
the pain which is destroying me and
still to appear human thus i have
been able to see juste without giving
anything away to him nor ivill you

tell him anything unless he too
should want to marry olympe - in
which case you will show him this let-
ter but i hope that this will be the
end of the matter and that after my
death no one will wish to take my
place our place the place of the three
men who have entered this house full
of health arid life and who have dis-
appeared from it carrying with them
the enigma of their triple misfortune

  as far as possible keep scandal from
olympe i have loved her too much
i still love her perhaps no scandal
therefore unless it be absolutely nec-
essary and besides i am certain of
nothing in such a case proof of the
guilt is necessary and i have none i
might be able to accuse her with a
chancc of not making a mistake but
i havent the right and i uill tell
you why you know that after hu-
berts death i returned a verdict of
suicide but hubert did not commit
suicide hubert was murdered

  and i knew the truth at my first
sight of the body by the position of
the pistol in his hand the weapon
had been placed in his hand after his
death i wont go into details but i
could have proved it very easily i
had been called immediately after the
discovery of the body in the hope that
perhaps life still stirred within him
but it was all over next to the corpse
stood olympe in tears before looking
at the woman i had seen the pistol
and had already reached a conclusion
then i looked at the woman you may
have suspected the affectionate ties
that bound us already besides
olympe made no effort to hide the
truth and i had spoken to her about
it more than once looking at her it
seemed to me that her eyes wavered
after catching mine and they left me
the impression of an ardent and silent
plea even today i am sure that i
was not mistaken and i feel a chiu of
horror that woman killed hubert in
order to be mine it was horrible but
i adored her and not only did i not
the mystery op the four husbands



denounce het but without her notic-
ing and for pity of her i slipped the
pistol into the correct position i
made the matter easy for the board of
experts you see zinzin old man
im not hiding anything from you
you understand now why i havent
the right to accuse this woman my
cowardice has made me her accom-
plice

   i think we loved each other like the
damned trying to forget in the em
brace of love a lost paradise between
us there never came a thought of hu-
bert or of delphin one would have
said that olympe had never known
those tivo men but i i was curious
to know how delphin had died and i
began a cunning investigation which
one day they must have noticed from
that day on i am sure my death was
decided

  certain contradictory remarks made
by palmire concerning delphins ex-
periments and the rather mysterious
circumstances of his death led me to
certain clues in which i found the al-
most certainty of olympes guilt in
the poisoning of delphin with pal-
mire as an accomplice i had not said
anything yet to olympe who did not
seem to suspect my thoughts i at-
tempted to keep as hidden as possible
the hideous suspicions but one day
i felt that i had been struck a high
fever a strange uneasiness and dull
pains warned me that i had been poi-
soned i still said nothing because i
wanted to know-to know and i be-
lieved that i had done the necessary
things to save me in time from a drug
which was already attacking the
sources of life-and which i could
not rid myself of

  itoio did they go about il  to
make sure that it was she i ate noth-
ing except what she gave me and we
drank from the same gloss yes but
we did not eat from the same plate
ah what horror    and this is
where the mailer rests today as 
write you this letter  i have just

had an attack which i have concealed
from her is she really ignorant of it
or does she find pleasure in it lord
god and yet my face has changed
in these last weeks and several times
i have pushed her from my arms
still she seems to have noticed noth-
ing oh the monster the two mon-
sters yes two because i have dis-
covered palmire spying on me and the
two of them are always together
nevertheless olympe said to me yes-
terday its funny how men change
after a few weeks of marriage after
a short while they are unrecognizable
they are no longer interesting

  zinzin you will have this letter and
 am going to talk to her but i wont
be telling her anything she doesnt
already know she must believe by
now that i know by whose hands her
first two husbands were killed but i
must tell her that i know that she is
killing the third and that she must
stop there

  ah olympe our olympe  if
you knew zinzin you would under-
stand-and you rvould pardon me   
perhaps after all she is not guilty-
perhaps palmire is responsible per-
haps palmire did it all alone ah my
god if that could be true    this
is an idea which has come to me a
little late-too late    think it
over zinzin i am past thinking now
i suffer too muck    and yet i do
not like to die without knowing if
she could only prove to me that it is
palmire who did it alone i love her
still zinzin

  after this last line the writing was
so disordered and jumbled that it was
difficult to read and the signature
which followed seemed to express the
supreme effort of a man from whom
life is escaping and yet dr sabin
could not have died that day prob-
ably by the feverish use of some med-
icine he was able to suspend his des-
tiny we know that the unfortunate
man did not die until after lunch the
next day   


weird tales

  i made the copy which you have
just read zinzin continued that
same night because lieutenant ja-
cobini demanded the original he had
the right to it since he was going to
take my place i said all the things
that you or anyone would say in such
horrible circumstances but i realized
that his mind was made up and that
there was nothing more to do of
course it was no longer a question of
love for olympe

  	 he had made a vow a vow to pun-
ish her for her crimes he would
force her to confess make her give
herself up and then we would see   

  he did not tell me what we would
see but it was easy enough to under-
stand on catching sight of his fierce
terrible look when he spoke

   dr sabin got his just deserts
he said to me and i do not pity him
but that poor hubert was my friend
and delphin i loved as a younger
brother and i may he responsible for
his death therefore i jacobini am
going to avenge them 

  to accomplish that he decided to
marry olympe

   and if she doesnt want to
marry i asked him

  he laughed a horrible laugh a
woman like her will not refuse a man
like me 

tte was right olympe married

  	- number five and i was best man
for jacobini he insisted upon it
during the ceremony he stood with
his arms crossed at the foot of the
chancel beside his kneeling bride and
looked already like a statue of ven-
geance olympe was no longer the girl
we had all known and loved there
was something strangely funereal in
her beauty and it seemed already to
be bending under the hand of death
she looked like the figures in marble
one sees on tombstones i never ex-
pected to see her again for the next
day i set out to sea

  at every port i threw myself on

the newspapers i opened my mail
with trembling feverish hands no
news reached me of the hideous trag-
edy that i felt must have been hap-
pening at home during my absence
when three months later i returned
my first question was    yes you
have guessed it   

 is nothing changed around
here

      goodness no 

   and how are the jacobinis

   the jacobinis are fine i was
told

  the next day jacobini came to
call on me he knew that i had just
returned he looked exceedingly well
and had prolonged his furlough since
olympe refused to leave the house
even though he hated it at heart i
cant blame her he explained she
believes that if she leaves the house
and this town where she spent such a
happy youth it will look as though
the evil tongues which claim she had
a hand in the death of her three hus-
bands have some cause for their
suspicions 

  i looked at jacobini but he met
my gaze clearly

   i understand your astonish-
ment he said but olympe is not to
be suspected

   so much the better so much the
better lets drop the subject then
 zinzin

   yes jacobini

   i have come to talk to you and
you must listen to me the first thing
i did on returning to the house after
the wedding was to show her dr sa-
bins letter olympe cried but did
not seem in the least astonished

    i had a suspicion of that she
confessed to me everybody thinks
i am a monster i wonder that you
wanted to many me  

    i will tell you why in due
time i replied but for the moment
we are concerned with dr sabins let-
ter

    what can i say she con-
the mystery of the four husbands



tinned bitterly   i am no more guilty
of huberts death of which they sus-
pect me than i am of my first hus-
bands sabin loved me madly and
there were moments when his love
was strangely like hatred he let
drop words from time to time that
made me understand his horrible
thought    and he started an
abominable investigation he ques-
tioned palmire who repeated every-
thingtome i tried to quiet him above
all i wanted to avoid any scandal
i told myself that his state of mind
would pass with time and that as i
had nothing to hide he would end by
understanding that we were all the
victims of a horrible fate then sud-
denly he believed himself poisoned
he did not tell me in the beginning i
myself did not mention the word poi-
son so that nothing definite should
happen between us i did not want
to be forced to call in the police or to
send him from the house but as he
continued to suffer i suggested that
he consult a doctor he did nothing
the day of his death he was under the
influence of a strong drug that made
him delirious he insisted  coming
to the table and as i knew what he
suspected i made a point of drinking
only what he drank and of eating
from the same plate at the dessert
he threw himself at my feet and
begged my pardon for having sus-
pected me he said he knew now that
he was being poisoned by that hor-
rible palmire and he begged me to
aid him in fastening the guilt  her
as i tried naturally to defend her he
left me abruptly and locked himself
in his room you know the rest it
was i who asked for an autopsy 

  lieutenant jacobini stopped

   and that convinced you of her
innocence i asked

   no he answered if olympe
expected something of the nature of
sabins letter i was ready for an ex-
planation such as she gave me with a
few tears thrown into the bargain

my next remark to my bride of an
hour was very abrupt and what
about the tali-tali olympe what
have you done with it   i asked

   she started and turned a death-
ly white oh she moaned so you
think that i poisoned him with tali-
tali

   i took her by the wrist and it
was like holding a hand of marble
listen olympe hubert died of an
accident ill grant that and it doesnt
matter to me but delphin was my
friend and he and dr sabin died the
same death they were both poisoned
by the tali-tali which leaves  trace
it was i who gave the poison to del-
phin that he might analyze it and find
an antidote if possible i brought it
back with me on my last return from
africa and i want to know what has
become of it it is a terrible poison
which the wizards down there give to
the unfortunates who are suspected of
having brought the anger of bad spir-
its on the village its victims are le-
gion  i am responsible for what
it has done in france    what
have you done with the tali-tali
olympe

   olympe looked up at me with
frozen eyes she was no longer cry-
ing   there is no more tali-tali   she
answered

 since when i asked bru-
tally trying to gain control over her

  the tali-tali of which lieutenant jacobini
speaks here is certainly a close relative of the
poison described in andi-e demaisons work in
the diato is written a man was hovering over
the cauldron in which boiled the roots and bark
of the sacred tree at its name the children were
terrified and the adults lost their mind but the
sorcerer who was now pouring rice into the hor-
rible soup had declared that the poison could
only harm those who sucked the marrow from
the bones of their own kind    and this is
the picture of those put to the test the un-
fortunates fell to the ground letting out hoarse
and horrible cries of pain the bodies curled into
a ball like partridges wounded by the hunters
bullet or ducks with their necks cut before life is
lost with the flow of blood the tali-tali of which
lieutenant jacobini speaks produces fulminating
effects if taken in a large dose in other cases
the poisoning may be slow sometimes it takes
twenty-four hours for it to manifest itself in all
its force the victim as happened to dr sabin
secma to have fallen from an epileptic fit

man entering the breakfast room with
a quick affectionate smile cest

exclaimed morblcu i have joy in

to my invitation and accepted a

with a shrill ear-splitting scream it was upon her

you failed to do so when you come
with a sad mouth and laughing eyes
to tell me of your worries say on

  the big irishman emptied his cup
with a gigantic gulp and wrinkled his
weather-tanned forehead like a puz-

zled mastiff beggin yer pardon

weird tales

that kilt young tom calebson last
night  

  hm de grandin spread a bit
of butter on his fish and watched it
slowly dissolve you do refer to the
mishap which occurred on the albe-
marle pike-the unfortunate young
man who died wrhen his ear crashed
against a roadside tree and he went
through fiie windshield

  thats what they say sor

  eh how is that

   th coroners jury returned a ver-
dict o death by misadventure the
detective answered o course it
wmznt anny o my business strictly
speakin to be nosin into things that
didnt concern me but us men on th
force gets that way ye knowr sor-
has to turn over every stone we find
along th road annyhow i thought
id drop round to th morgue an take
a look at th pore lad an give th
autymobile he died in th once-over

fident smile hovering on his lips
yes and then

  well sor ive seen lots o bodies
that s ben kilt in motor accidents an
some o them wras pretty awful but
i never seen nothin like this th
only wounds th  lad had on im was a
big jagged gash in th throat-just
one-an some funny-lookin scratch-
es alongside his neck an- again

he paused as though undecided
whether to continue or not

  cordieu is it a game of patience
we play here de grandin demand-
ed testily get on with your recital
great slow one or i must twist your
neck  

  i	laughed outright at this threat of
the sparrow to chastise the turkey
cock and even costellos gravity gave
way to a grin but he sobered quickly
as he continued well sor onct
when i wtuz servin  in th  phillypines
one o th fellies in our outfit got took
for a ride be th moros on mindanao
they grabbed th  pore chap unawares
sor an took im back in th jungle
for torture he wuz hung up be th

feet wid his throat cut an all th
blood drained from his pore carcass
when we found im thats th way
young calebson looked to me sor-
all empty-like if ye get what i
mean

  parfaitement and-

  yes sor i wuz cornin to that
too i went round to th  garage where
theyd put his car and looked it over
most particlar

  yes de grandins narrow black
brows moved upwrard till they de-
scribed twtin narrow saracenic arches

  no sor th divil of a stain wuz
annywhere except maybe a drop or
two on th floor an a little tiny patch
o dried blood on the seat th front o
th windshield an th hood o th car
wuz clean as th palm o me hand
besides that sor-say did ye ever
see a felly that had been all chawred
up by one o them big cats

at a village inland where a woman had

big blue tigers they have over there-
th brute tore her throat out an

fore th heathens come out wtid drums
an firecrackers an a few guns an

dent his car ought to been wringin
wet wid blood but as i wuz after

  you have said it de grandin
agreed with a vigorous nod this
business it has the smell of herring
on it my friend come let us go
he disposed of the remaining morsel

of fish drained his coffee eup and
rose abruptly

  never fear friend trowbridge
he declared as he thrust his arms
through the sleeves of his topcoat   i
shall return in ample time for ma-
dame heaeotes soiree tonight  but at
present i am consumed with curios-
ity to view this strange young man
who died of a cut throat yet bled not
at all

  i watched them as they strode down
the street beneath the autumn-tinted
leaves the big irish policeman
treading lightly as a dancer for all
his great bulk marched along with a
slight sway from left to right the
lasting souvenir of his years of ser-
vice with the infantry beside him ad-
vancing almost at a run the slight
diminutive frenchman walked with
the sharp jerky quick-step character-
istic of the army of france an odd-
ly assorted couple they were far
apart as the poles in birth upbring-
ing and education yet knit together
by that bond of brotherhood which
unites all bom man-hunters prob-
ably i reflected nothing more than
vague surmise was behind costellos
half-formed suspicions yet were any
evil-doer involved in the business he
would be well advised to put as much
distance between himself and that in-
congruous partnership as the limita-
tions of earth allowed



jules de grandest pirouetted on
gleaming patent-leather-shod toes
like a preening bird consider me
friend trowbridge he commanded
behold and admire am i not su-
perb magnificent parbleu this
night i shall dazzle i shall scintil-
late i shall be the pride of all the
ladies the despair of all the men is
it not so

  to do him justice he was more than
usually ornate though his excursion
with sergeant costello had kept him
from breakfast till a few minutes be-

fore dinner time and he had spent
less than twenty minutes at his toilet
he was arrayed hi a manner to chal-
lenge the reputation of solomon and
his glory about his neck hung the
insignia of the legion of honor  a
row of miniature medals including
the french and belgian war crosses
the medaille militaire and the italian
medal for valor decorated the left
breast of his faultless evening coat
ms little wheat-blond mustache was
waxed to needle sharpness and his
sleek blond hair was brushed and
brilliantined till it fitted flat against
his shapely little head like a skull-
cap of gleaming beige satin

  humph i commented as i sur-
veyed him if youll behave as well
as you look i suppose youll be all
right

  o la id hear him preach he
grinned elfishly as he patted the white
gardenia in his buttonhole with gen-
tle but unqualifiedly approving fin-
gers come let us go i desire to
arrive at madame heacotes before
the refreshments arc entirely exhaust-
ed if you please  he flung his long
military-cut evening coat about him
with the air of a comic-opera conspir-
ator picked up his lustrous top hat
and gold-headed ebony walking-stick
and strode debonairly toward the
door

  just a moment i called as the
desk phone gave a short chattering
ring

 hullo trowbridge donovan
speaking a heavy voice announced
as i picked up the receiver can
you bring that funny little frog
friend of yours over to city hospital
tonight ive got a brand new vari-
ety of nut in the psychopathic ward
here-young girl sane as you or i ap-
parently except for an odd fixation
i think shed interest de grandin
if-

  sorry i cut in de grandin
and i were just going to a shindig at

weird tales

frightful bore but the family are val-
uable patients and-

  aw rats dr donovan inter-
rupted if i had as much money as
you id tell all the tea-pouring old
ladies to go fly kites come on over
this nut is good i tell you put your
toad-eater on the phone maybe he 
listen to reason if you wont

  hslas i am desolate the
frenchman declared as donovan de-
livered his invitation at present
friend trowbridge and i go to make
great whoopee at madame heacotes
-later in the evening if you will be
so kind we shall give ourselves the
pleasure of interviewing your so in-
triguing mademoiselle with the idee
fixe you agree i am delight we
shall be there my friend do not
doubt it

  now let us depart in haste right
away at once before someone else de-
lays us he urged as he hung up the
receiver me i know these cake-
devouring habitues of parties such as
tonights-they will have drunk up
all the punch containing champagne
and rum and left us nothing but lem-
onade unless we hurry let us go  

mrs heacotes was the first for-
mal affair of the autumn and
most of the elite of our little city were
present the men still displaying the
floridness of golf course and moun-
tain trail on their faces sun-tan pain-
fully acquired at fashionable beaches
lying in velvet veneer on the womens
arms and shoulders the big red-
brick house was lit from street to at-
tic and the strains of a stringed or-
chestra mingled with the dissonance
of shrill feminine chatter as we en-
tered gave our wraps into the keep-
ing of a trimly uniformed maid and
proceeded to pay our duty to our
hostess

  famous lion-huntress that she was
mrs watson ileacote had managed
to impound a considerable array of
exotic notables for her home-town
guests to gape at and i noted with a

hidden smile how her large pale eyes
lighted with momentary elation at
sight of de grandins decorations the
little frenchman was quick to under-
stand the situation and chuckled de-
lightedly as we crossed the room
madame he bent over mrs hea-
cotes hand with more than usual cer-
emony believe me i am deeply sen-
sible of the honor you have conferred
on me he lifted her plump well-
manicured fingers to his lips

  what would have been a simper in
anyone less distinguished than mrs
watson iteacote spread over the much
massaged and carefully lifted fea-
tures of harrisonvilles social arbiter
it was sweet of you to come dr de
grandin she assured him do you
know monsieur arif arif pasha
dr jules de grandin-dr trow-
bridge

  the slender sallow-skinned young
man she presented had the small reg-
ular features sleek black hair and
dark slumbrous eyes which made the
late rudolph valentino the idol of a
million women he bowed jerkily
from the hips in continental fashion
and murmured a polite acknowledg-
ment in stilted english

  you are i take it a stranger like
myself in strange company he
asked de grandin as we moved aside
for a trio of newcomers

  further conversation developed
that he was attached to the office of
the turkish consul general at new
york that he had met mrs heaeote in
london the previous summer and
that he would be exceedingly glad
when he might bid his hostess good-
night

  tiens they stare so these ameri-
cans   he complained  now in lon-
don or paris-

  monsoor and modom bera an-
nounced the butler his impressive
full-throated english voice cutting
through the staccato of drawing-room
chatter as the booming of the surf
sounds through the strains of a sea-
side resort band
children of ubasti



  we turned casually to view the
newcomers then kept our eyes at
gaze they were easily the most in-
teresting people in the room ma-
dame bera walked a half-pace before
her husband tall exquisite exotic as
an orchid blooming in a new england
garden tawny hair combed close to
her small head framed a broad white
forehead and under fine dark-brown
brows looked out the most remarkable
eyes i had ever seen widely sepa-
rated the roundness of their shape
gave them an illusion of immensity
which seemed to diminish her face
and their color was a baffling shade
of greenish amber contrasting oddly
with her leonine hair and warm
maize-tan complexion from cheek to
cheek her face was wide tapering to
a pointed chin and the nostrils of her
sensitive aquiline nose flared slightly
like those of an alert feline scenting
hidden danger her evening dress
cut rather higher than the prevail-
ing mode encased her large supple
figure with glove-tightness from
breast to waist then flared outward
to an uneven hem which almost swept
the floor beneath the edge of her
sand-colored chiffon gown her feet
in sandals of gold kid appeaied
absurdly small as she crossed the room
with a lithe easy stride which seemed
pantherine in its effortless grace

  older by two-score years than his
consort monsieur bera yet had some-
thing of the same feline ease of move-
ment which characterized her like
hers too his face was wide from cheek
to cheek pointed at the chin and
adorned with a hawk-beak nose with
unusually wide nostrils unlike his
wifes his eyes were not round but
long inclined to be oblique and half
closed as though to shade them from
the glitter of the electric lights fast-
thinning gray hair was combed back
from his brow in an effort to conceal
a noticeable bald spot on his crani-
um his heavy mustache whiter than
his hair was waxed and tightly

twisted after the style affected by the
former german emperor and a tiny
tuft of white goatee adorned his low-
er lip for the rest he wore a rim-
less stringless monocle in his right
eye and through its polished lens
seemed to view the assemblage with a
sort of sardonic contempt one thing
more in common betwen husband and
wife i noticed as they crossed the
room-the pale white crystal of their
teeth beneath their thin red lips

  ya allah the young turk who
stood between de grandin and me
sunk his fingers into our elbows i
do not like them-they look as though
they belonged to that people

  eh what is it you say de gran-
din demanded in a sharp whisper

  it is nothing sir you would not
understand

  on the contrary monsieur i un-
derstand very well indeed the
frenchman retorted in a tense voice
i dislike to remind you but it has
not been many years since your coun-
try and mine were at war the threat
of a religious uprising induced by
the sublime porte among the tribes-
men of north africa occupied much
thought in our colonial office and i
was sent to tunis to investigate dis-
guised as a pere iilanc-and other
things-i mingled with the natives
it was vile-i had to shave off my
mustaches-but it was instructive i
learned much i learned by example
of the djinns which haunt the ruins of
carthage and of the strange ones who
dwell in tombs a weird terrible folk
without a name-at any rate without
a name which a man may speak aloud
even in the confines of his own
house

  arif pasha regarded de grandin
with a fearful glance you have
seen them he asked in a low breath

  i have heard much of them and
their stigmata have been described to
me the frenchman answered even-
ly   come let us seek introduction to
la belle bera


weird tales

  allah forbid the turk denied
walking hastily away

  the lady proved gracious as she
was beautiful viewed closely her
strange eyes were stranger still for
they had a trick of contracting their
pupils in the light bringing out the
full beauty of their fine irises and
of expanding in shadow until they
seemed black as night too i noted
when she smiled her slow wide smile
all four canine teeth seemed unduly
prominent and sharp this perhaps
accounted for the startling contrast
between her crimson lips and her per-
fect dentition her hands were un-
usual too small and fine they were
with supple slender fingers but ex-
traordinarily broad of palm and the
nails trimmed to points and very
brightly rouged and polished till they
resembled the hennaed finger-tips of a
harem odalisk curved oddly down-
ward over her fingers had they been
longer they would have suggested tal-
ons her voice was a rich heavy con-
tralto and when she spoke slow hesi-
tant english a purring undertone
seemed to run from syllable to syl-
lable

  the odd characteristics which were
somehow exotically attractive in his
wife were intensified to a degree of
unpleasantness in monsieur bera the
over-prominent teeth which lent a
piquant charm to her smile were a de-
formity in his cruel thin-lipped
mouth the overhanging nails which
made her long beautifully formed
hands only more attractive were defi-
nitely claw-like on his skinny fingers
the queer trick of contracting and ex-
panding his pupils in changing lights
gave his narrow watchful eyes a fur-
tive expression unpleasantly remi-
niscent of the eyes of a dope-fiend-or
of a cruel treacherous cat

  i am interested de grandin de-
clared with the frankness which only
he could employ yet not seem dis-
courteous your name madame in-

trigues me greatly bera it is not a
french name yet i heard you an-
nounced as monsieur et madame-

  we are tunisians she replied
with a languid smile which displayed
her crimson lips and ivory teeth to ad-
vantage both my husband and i
were bom and reared in northern
africa we came to this country only
a short time ago

  ah then i am indeed fortunate
de grandin smiled delightedly is
it by any great good fortune that you
reside in this city if so i should
greatly esteem permission to call
and-

  i heard no summons but madame
bera evidently did for with another
smile and a friendly little nod she
turned from de grandin before he
could complete his request and has-
tened to mrs heacotes side

  beard of a little blue man de
grandin made a humorous grimace as
he rejoined the young turk and me
it would seem jules de grandin is
losing his appeal for the sex was
ever the chilled shoulder more effec-
tively presented than by la charmante
bera a moment hence

  come my friends he linked his
hands through our elbows and drew
us toward the farther room women
may smile or women may frown but
champagne punch is always pleasant
to the taste

  we sampled several varieties of
punch discussed an ice and a sur-
prizing array of small sweet cakes
and sandwiches then made our adieux
to our hostess outside young arif
pasha was about to enter his taxi
when de grandin tapped him  the
shoulder  we may see more of each
other anon mon vieux he promised
it may well be that i shall seek your
help  

  the turk met his gaze with a level
look of understanding i shall be
ready when you call he promised
with a nod

tvr donovan held his automatic
lighter to de grandins cigarette
performed a similar service for me
then snapped down the wiek-shield
with a click extinguishing the flame
before striking a fresh one for his own
smoke no use taking unnecessary
chances with a three-on-one light you
know he explained with a sheepish
grin i dont know whether the
same rules that apply to matches
govern these gimcracks but its better
to play safe now about this girl
they brought in today

  it was early this morning-half-
past four or so-when a state con-
stabulary patrol found her wandering
around the woods west of mooreston
with nothing but a nightdress on
they questioned her but could get no
information for most of the time she
didnt speak at all and when she did
it was only to slobber some sort of
meaningless gibberish according to
hoyle they should have taken her to
the state hospital for observation but
theyre pretty full over there and
prefer to handle only regularly com-
mitted cases so the troopers brought
her here and turned her over to the
city police

  frankly the case has my goat
familiar with dementia prsecox are
you doctor he turned question-
ingly to de grandin

  quite the frenchman returned
i have seen many poor ones suffer-
ing from it usually it occurs be-
tween the ages of fifteen and thirty-
five though most cases i have observed
were in the eaily twenties wherever
i have seen it the disease was charac-
terized by states of excitement or de-
pression accompanied by delusions of
aural or visual type most patients
believed they were persecuted or had
been through some harrowing experi-
ence-occasionally they posed gestic-
ulated and grimaced

  just so donovan expelled a
cloud of smoke from his nostrils

youve got it down pat doctor i
thought i had too but im not so
sure now what would be your di-
agnosis if a patient displayed every
sign of ataxic aphasia couldnt utter
a single intelligent word then fell
into a stupor which lasted the better
part of eight hours and woke up with
a case of the horrors this girls
about twenty-three and absolutely
perfect whats more her reflexes
are all right-knee-jerks normal very

sensitive to pain and all that but- 

he looked inquiringly at de grandin

 hm from your statement i
should suggest dementia prsecox it
is well known that such dements
frequently fall into comatose sleeps in
which they suffer nightmares and on
waking are so mentally confused that
they can not distinguish between the
phantoms of their dreams and their
waking surroundings  

  precisely well i had a talk
with this child heard her story then
gave her a big dose of codein in a
glass of milk she slept three hours
with that and woke up seemingly as
normal as you or i but im darned
if she didnt repeat the same story
chapter and verse that she gave me
when she first came out of her stupor
id say she was sane as a judge if it
werent for this delusion she persists
in will you come up and have a
look at her

  donovans patient lay on the neat
white-iron hospital cot staring with
wide frightened eyes at the little ob-
servation-grille in the unlocked door
of her cell even the conventional
high-necked and long-sleeved muslin
bedgown furnlhed by the hospital
could not hide her frail prettiness
with her pale smooth skin her light
short hair and big violet eyes in
which lay a look of perpetual terror
she was like a little frightened child
and a wave of sympathy swept over
me as we entered the room that de
grandin felt the same i could tell by
the kindly smile he gave her as he


weird tales

drew a chair to her bedside and seated
himself he took her thin bine-veined
hand in his and patted it gently
before placing his finger on her pulse

  ive brought a couple of gentle-
men to see you annie   dr donovan
announced as the little frenchman
gazed intently at the tiny gold watch
strapped to the under side of his
wrist comparing its second-hand with
the girls pulsation dr de grandin
is a famous french detective as well
as a doctor hell be glad to hear your
story maybe lie can do something
about it

  a tortured look swept over the
girls small face as he finished you
think im crazy she accused half
rising from her pillow i know you
do and youve brought these men
here to examine me so you can put
me in a madhouse for always oh its
dreadful-im not insane i tell you

rupted hotly and youre not my

one who gets into an asylum must be
crazy and youll send me to a mad-
house and ill reallv go crazy there
well annie-

  my names not annie i tell you

donovan cast a quick wink in my
direction then turned a serious face
to the girl i thought your name
was annie he apologized i must
have been mistaken what is it
ive told you its trula trula
petersen i used to live in paterson
but lost my position there and
couldnt get anything to do so i
came to harrisonville looking for

work and-

  very good friend donovan de
grandin announced relinquishing the

girls wrist but retaining her fingers
in his when first this young lady
came she could not tell her name now
she can bon we make progress her
heart action is strong and good i
think perhaps we shall make much
more progress now mademoiselle
he gave the girl one of his quick
friendly smiles if you will be so
good as to detail your adventures
from the start we shall listen with
closest attention believe me we are
friends and nothing you say shall be
taken as proof of madness

  the girl gave him a pitiful little
smile which was a weak copy of his
own i do believe you sir she re-
turned and ill tell you everything
for i know i can trust you

  when the clareborne silk mills
closed down in paterson i lost my
place as timekeeper most of the
other mills were laying people off and
there was no chance for me to get
another situation im an orphan
with no relatives and i had to get
work right away for i didnt have
more than fifty dollars in bank
after trying several places i came to
harrisonville where nobody knew
me and registered at a domestic ser-
vants agency it was better to be a
housemaid than starve i thought

  the very day i registered a mrs
afrique came looking for a maid and
picked two other girls and me as pos-
sibilities she looked us all over
asked a lot of questions about our
families where we were born and
that sort of thing then chose me be-
cause she said she preferred a maid
without relatives or friends who
wouldnt be wanting to run out every
evening her car was waiting outside
and i had no baggage except my suit-
case so i went along with her
um de grandin murmured
and she took you where

  i dont know

  eh how do you say

  i dont know sir it was a big
foreign car with a closed body and
she told me to sit in the tonneau with
children of ubasti



her instead of up front with the
chauffeur when wed started i
noticed for the first time that the
windows were of frosted glass and i
couldnt see where we went we
must have gone a long way though
for the car seemed traveling very
fast and there were no traffic stops
when we finally stopped we were
under a porte-cochere and we entered
the house directly from the tonneau
so i couldnt get any idea of the sur-
rounding country

  bites surely in the days that
followed you could look about de
grandin persisted

  a look of terror flared in the girls
eyes and her pale lips writhed in a
grimace of hideous fear the days
that followed she echoed with a
thin scream its the days that fol-
lowed that brought me here

  ah do you say so the french-
man demanded sharply

  now were gettin it donovan
whispered in my ear with a low
chuckle go ahead and ask her de
grandin you tell him annie this
is going to be good  

  de grandin and the girl could not
understand his words but his tone
and laugh were obvious oh the
patient availed releasing her hand
from de grandins and putting it to
her eyes oh-youre all making
game of me

  be silent fine the frenchman
commanded savagely parbleu clean-
ing the roadways would be work more
fitting for you than treating the in-
firm of mind do not mind him
mademoiselle he repossessed him-
self of the girls fingers and smoothed
them gently proceed with your
narrative i pray i shall listen and
believe

  for a moment the little patient
shook as with an ague and i could
see her grip on the frenchmans fin-
gers tighten for the lines of her
flexor muscles showed white against
the back of her hand  please please

believe me doctor she begged its
really the truth im telling you they
-they wanted-to-

  eh did they so parbleuv de
grandin replied very good made-
moiselle you escaped them no one
shall hurt you now and no one shall
persecute you jules de grandin
promises it now to proceed

  i was afraid she confessed
terribly afraid from the moment i
got in the car with mrs afrique and
realized that i couldnt look out the
windows id have screamed and tried
to jump out but i was hungry and
out of work besides she was a big
woman and could have overpowered
me without trouble

  when we got to the house i was
still more frightened and mrs
afrique seemed to notice it for she
smiled and took me by the arm ugh
her hands were strong as a mans-
stronger-and when i tried to draw
away she only held me tighter and
sort of chuckled deep down in her
throat-like a big cat purring when
its caught a mouse she half led
half shoved me down a long hall
which was almost bare of furniture
through a door and down a flight of
steps into the basement the next
thing i knew shed pushed me bodily
into a little room no bigger than
this and locked the door

  the door was of solid thick
planks and the only window was a
little barred opening almost up to the
ceiling which i couldnt reach even
when i pushed the bed over and stood
on it this air-hole let in a little light
but didnt give me any chance to see
outside

  i dont know how long i stayed
in that place at first i thought the
window let outdoors but the light
seemed the same strength all the time
so i suppose it really looked out into
the main basement and what i at
first thought weak sunlight was really
reflected from an electric bulb some-
where at any rate i determined to
fight for my freedom the first chance


weird tales

i had for id read stories of white-
slavers who kidnaped girls and i
was sure id fallen into the hands of
some such gang if i only had

    i dont know how they knew when
to do it but they never opened that
door except when i was asleep id
lie awake for hours pretending to be
sleeping so that someone would open
the door and give me a chance to die
fighting but nothing ever happened
then the moment i grew so tired that
 couldnt keep my eyes open another
moment and really fell asleep the
door would be opened my soiled
dishes taken out and a fresh supply of
food brought in id find it there
when i woke the food was good and
plentiful there was always some sort
of meat-veal or young pork i think
it was-and bread and vegetables and
a big vacuum bottle of coffee and an-
other of milk if i hadnt been so
terribly frightened i might have en-
joyed it for id been hungry for a
long time

 vne night i woke with a start at
least i suppose it was night
though there was really  way of
telling i heard voices outside my
door the first id heard since i came
there please please let me go a
girl was pleading sobbingly ive
never done anything to you and ill
do anything-anythin you ask if
youll only let me go

  whoever it was she spoke to an-
swered in a soft gentle purring sort
of voice do not be afraid we seek
only to have a little sport with you
then you are free

  it was a man who spoke i could
tell that by the heavy voice and i
could hear the girl sobbing and plead-
ing in terror till he took her up the
stairs and closed the basement door

  i didnt know what to think id
supposed i was the only prisoner in
the house but now i knew there was
at least one other what were they
doing to her-what would they do to
me when my turn came i kept ask-

ing myself as i lay there trembling
presently i heard some heavy thuds
on the floor right over my head as
though several people were running
about in tennis shoes or bare feet
then there was a scream then more
running then more screams after
that everything was still so still i
could hear my heart beating i lay
there trembling waiting for them to
bring her back but they never did
at last i fell asleep

  dr donovan was chuckling in un-
disguised amusement and i began to
revise my first impressions it was
only too sadly evident that the poor
girl had been through some distress-
ing experience and that her nerves
were badly shaken but the story she
told was so preposterous i was won-
dering seriously if this were not a
case of delusional insanity when de
gran dins sharp comment broke in

  this madame afrique what did
she look like my child

  she was a large woman-tall that
is the petersen girl answered big
and blond with queer-looking brown-
green eyes and odd long nails that
turned down over her finger-tips like

claws she-

  name of an intoxicated pig i was
sure i was certain now i am posi-
tive they are undoubtlesslv one and
the same stupid me why did i not
recognize it at once de grandin
exclaimed say on my child tell
us all i wait with interest

  the girl swallowed twice convulsive-
ly and gave her other hand into de
grandins keeping hold me doc-
tor hold me tight   she begged  im
afraid terribly afraid even now

  i knew something dreadful was
going to happen when lie finally came
for me but i hadnt a thought how
terrible it would be it must have
been three days later judging by the
number of times my food had been
replenished that he came for me i
was sound asleep when i felt someone
shaking me roughly by the shoulder
children of ubasti



get up i was told were going to
let you go-if you can 

  i tried to ask questions to get
him to wait till i put on some
clothes but he fairly dragged me
just as i was from the bed when i
got upstairs i found myself in a big
bare room brightly lighted by a ceil-
ing electric fixture and with only a
few articles of furniture in it-one or
two big chairs several small foot-
stools and a big couch set diagonally
acioss one comer it was night i
could see the rain beating against the
window-pane and hear the wind blow-
ing outside in the sudden unac-
customed light i saw a tall old man
with scant white hair and big white
mustache and queer greenish eyes
held me by the shoulder he was
dressed in a sort of bathrobe or gown
of some dark-colored stuff and his
feet were bare then i saw the
woman mrs afrique she was in a
sort of short nightgown one that
reached only to her knees and like
the man she too was barefooted

    he shoved me to the middle of the
room and all the time the woman
stood there smiling and eyeing me
hungrily

    my wife and i have a little game
we sometimes play with our guests
the old man told me we turn out
the lights and enjoy a little romp of
tag if the guest can get away in the
darkness she is free to do so if she

can not- he stopped and smiled

at me-the crudest smile ive ever
seen

   wh-what happens if she can
not i faltered

  he put out his hand and stroked
my bare arm very nice he mur-
mured nice and tender eh the
woman nodded and licked her red
lips with the tip of her red tongue
and her queer green eyes seemed to
shine as she looked at me

   if the guest can not get away
the man answered with a dreadful
low laugh then looked at the woman
again youve eaten well since you

came here he went on apparently
forgetting what hed started to say
how did you like the meat we
served

  i nodded i didnt know what to
say then why it was very nice
i answered fearing to anger him if i
kept silent

   ye-es he agreed with another
laugh very nice very nice indeed
that meat dear tender young lady-
that meat was the guests who couldnt
get away

  i closed my eyes and thought
hard this couldnt be true i told
myself this was just some dreadful
dream such things couldnt happen
in twentieth century new jersey

  it was a lucky thing for me i
did close my eyes for while i stood
there swaying with nauseated horror
i heard a faint click instantly i
opened my eyes to find the light had
been shut off and i was standing alone
in the center of the great room

    how did you know you were alone
if the light had been shut off the
room was pitch-dark wasnt it dr
donovan demanded

  the girl never turned her head
her terrified eyes remained steadily
pleadingly on de grandins face as
she answered in a choked whisper

  by tlieir eyes

  the woman stood at one end of
the room the man had moved silently
to the other and in the darkness i
could see their eyes like the phos-
phorescent green orbs of wild jungle-
beasts at night the steady green-
gleaming eyes came slowly nearer and
nearer sometimes straight sometimes
circling in the darkness but never for
an instant did they turn from me i
was being stalked like a mouse by
hungry cats-the creatures could see
in the dark

  i said a moment ago it was for-
tunate for me id closed my eyes
thats all that saved me if theyd
been open when the lights went out
id have been completely blinded by
the resulting blackness but as it was


weird tales

when i opened them the room was
just a little lighter than the absolute
darkness of closed eyes the result
was i could see their bodies like mov-
ing blotches of shadow slightly heav-
ier than that of the rest of the room
and could even make out the shapes
of some of the furniture i could see
the dull-gray of the rain-washed win-
dow too

  as i turned in terror from one
creeping shadow-thing to the other
the female let out a low dreadful
wailing cry like the gradually grow-
ing miaul of a hunting cat only deep-
er and louder the he-thing answered
it and it seemed to me there was an
undertone of fiendish half-human
laughter in the horrible caterwaul

  it seemed to me all the forces of
hell were let loose in that great dark
room i heard myself screaming
praying shrieking curses and obsceni-
ties id never realized i even knew
and answering me came the wild in-
human screeches of the two glowing-
eyed things that hunted me

  without realizing what i did i
snatched up a heavy footstool and
hurled it at the nearer pair of eyes
they say a woman cant throw
straight but my shot took effect i
saw the blurred outline of a body
double up with an agonized howl and
go crashing to the floor where it
flopped and contorted like a fish
jerked from the water

  with a shrill ear-splitting scream
the other thing was on me and i
dodged to my knees just in time to
avoid the threshing blow it aimed at
me-i felt my flimsy nightdress rip
to tatters as her long sharp nails
tore through it

  i rolled over and over across the
floor with that she-devil leaping and
springing after me  snatched at an-
other hassock as i rolled and flung it
behind me it tripped her and for a
moment she went to her knees but
her short dress offered no hindrance
to her movements and she was up

and after me howling and screaming
like a beast in another second

  id managed to roll somewhat
nearer the window and as i came in
contact with another stool i grasped
it and hurled it with all my might at
the panes they shattered outward
with a crash and i dived through the
opening the ground was scarcely
six feet below and the rain had
softened it so that it broke my fall
almost like a mattress an instant
after id struck the soft rain-soaked
lawn i was on my feet and running
as no woman ever ran before

  yes and then- de grandin

prompted softly

  the girl shook her slim muslin-
clad shoulders and shuddered like one
waking from a fearsome dream
thats all there is she stated
simply the next thing i knew i
was waking in this bed and dr dono-
van was asking me about myself

nphats letter perfect donovan
l commented exactly the way
she told it twice before what do you
make of it  

  make of it de grandin echoed
almost wonderingly beard of a blue
mouse what can one make of the
truth more than that which it is
already yes cest la verite she
speaks beyond a doubt my friends
i damn think our beauteous madame
bera and her so detestably ugly spouse
have overreached themselves there
is no doubt they and the afriques
are the same couple why should they
not choose that name as a nom de
ruse are they not of tiuiis and is
not tunis in africa but yes
holy smoke donovan emitted a
low whistle you dont mean you
actually believe all this bunk
mats certainement de grandin
replied so firmly do i believe it
that i am willing to stand sponsor
for this young lady immediately if
you will release her on parole to ac-
company friend trowbridge and
me
children of ubasti



  well ill be-oh all right its

girl with a questioning smile

  yes ill go anywhere with him
he trusts me she returned then as
an afterthought and my names

  all right annie get your clothes

office donovan replied with a grin
as he led the way from her cell

  almost before we had entered the
hospital office de grandin was at the
telephone calling police headquar-
ters i would that you give this
message to sergeant costello immedi-
ately he arrives it is dr de grandin

nection was put through request

weird tales

  the little frenchman set down the
phone and his small blue eyes were
sparkling with a light as cold and
hard as polar ice reflecting the aurora
borealis my child he exclaimed
seizing both trula petersens slender
hands in his ic bon dieio has been
very good to you he has delivered
those who hunted and harried you
like a brute beast into the hands of
jules de grandin

  what are you going to do i
asked wondering

   do   his waxed must ache quivered
like the whiskeis of an irritable tom-
cat do parblcu am i one to slap
the face of providence  mille nons i
shall serve them as they deserve no
less may satan fry me in a skillet if
i do not

  a moment later lie was thumbing
through the telephone directory ah
madame heacote he announced
when that lady finally answered his
urgent call i am unhappy i am
miserable i am altogether desolate
at your so charming reception i met
that delightful monsieur and madame
bera and we discovered many friends
iti common of the goodness of their
heart they invited me to call and i
made careful note of their address
now helm like a great stupid-head
i have misplaced it can you-ah a
million thousand thanks

  triomplie he cried a moment
later turning from the phone it
is even as i suspected they are
clever but jules do grandin is
cleverer yes they dwell near moores-
ton their house abuts the albemarle
pike to find them will be a small
task

  trowbridge mon vieux i pray
you have the capable nora mcginnis
that queen among cooks prepare us
a noble dinner this night there is
much to be done and i would do it
with a full stomach meantime i call
that monsieur arif and bid him hast-
en to us it was he who first roused my
suspicions he deserves to be present
when it is finished yes assuredly

 

chortiy before dinner de grandin
 returned from the errand which
had occupied his entire afternoon a
bulky brown-paper parcel clutched
tightly under each arm for half an
hour or more he was busily engaged
in some secret business in his room
and though i was fairly bursting
with the pressure of a hundred ques-
tions he gave me no opportunity to
satisfy my curiosity during dinner

  instead he kept up a running fire of
conversation most of it witty all of
it inconsequential stories of student
life at the sorbonne droll tales of the
war anecdotes of his travels in the
far places of the world-anything but
the slightest reference to the mystery
of monsieur and madame bera he
rattled off like a wound-up phono-
graph

  finally when coffee was served in
the drawing-room he lighted a cigar
stretched his slender patent-leather-
shod feet toward the blazing logs in
the fireplace and regarded trula pet-
ersen and me in turn with his quick
bird-like glance you trust me ma
petite he suddenly asked the girl
oh yes

  tres bon we shall put that trust
to the test before long he smiled
whimsically then

   you have never hunted the tiger
in india i assume

  sir no ive never been any-
where except norway where i was
born and this country where ive
lived since i was ten

   excellent i see i must enlighten
you in india when they would bring
the striped one within gunshot they
tether a little so helpless kid to a
stake the tiger scents a meal ap-
proaches the small goat the white
man waiting gun in hand squeezes
his trigger and-voila a tigerskin
rug for some pretty ladys boudoir
it is all very simple

  i-i dont think i understand
sir the girl faltered but there was a
children of ubasti



telltale widening of her eyes and a
constriction of the muscles of her
throat as she spoke

  very well permit that i explain
in detail anon our good friend arif
pasha will come when all is ready
you will assume the same costume you
wore when they brought you to the
hospital and over it you will put
warm wrappings thereafter friend
trowbridge will drive us to monsieur
boras house and you will descend
clad as you were when you fled
across the lawn you will stagger call-
ing for help unless i am more mis-
taken than i think one or both of
them will sally forth to see who cries
for help in the night then-

  o-o-oh no the girl wailed in a
stifled voice i couldnt do that i
wouldnt go there for all the money
in-

  zut who speaks of money this
is a thing i would have you do for
humanitys sake my child consider
did not you tell me you woke one
night in your prison cell to hear bera
the monster leading another girl to
torture and to death did you not
thereafter hear the stamping of feet
which fled and feet which pursued
and the agonized scream of one who
was caught

  the girl nodded dumbly

  very good suppose i now tell
you four girls were hired by these
beast-people from the same agency
whence you went to their service
that much we know it is a matter of
police record it is also a matter of
record that none of them save you
has ever since been seen how many
other unfortunate ones went the same
sad road is a matter of conjecture but
unless you are willing to do this thing
for me those we seek may escape they
may move to some other place and
play their so infernal games of hide-
and-seek-in-the-dark with only the
good god knows how many other poor
ones

  attend me further little pretty
one the night you escaped by what

was no less than a miracle of the
blessed saints a young man named
thomas calebson-a youth of good
family and position-young attrac-
tive in love with everything to live
for drove his coupe through moores-
ton along the albemarle pike toward
this city where he lived a short dis-
tance from mooreston he was hailed
by a woman a big blond woman who
sought for something in the roadside
woods

  in the kindness of his heart he
offered the woman a ride to harrison-
ville next morning his motor car
was found in collision with a wayside
tree the windshield was smashed to
fragments-i myself saw it-and
through the broken glass the young
mans head protruded his throat
was severed he was dead but no-
where was there any blood neither
on the car nor on his clothing was
there stain yet he had bled to death
also i who am at once a physician
and an observer of facts examined
his poor severed throat such tears
as marred his flesh might have been
made by teeth perchance by claws
by broken glass never the pig-
ignorant jury of the coroner returned
a verdict of death by accident but
sergeant costello of the gendarmerie
and i know better

  what happened in that young
mans car we do not certainly know
but we can surmise much we suspect
by example that a thing which dotes
on human flesh and blood a foul thing
made after the semblance of a woman
had whetted its appetite for a feast
then been disappointed in the moment
of expectation from her lair she
rushed forth in search of her escaped
prey but her search was vain along
comes this unsuspecting young man
into his car the she-fiend gets they
ride together for a time they arrive
at a lonely spot where road and avood-
land and savamp come together there
is a sudden shrill inhuman scream
the glare of green beast-eyes in the
dark the stifling aveight of a body


weird tales

hurled on unsuspecting shoulders and
the rending of shrinking flesh by bes-
tial teeth and claws the car is m
stopped then started it is run for- 
cibly against a tree a head already
almost severed from its body is thrust
through the broken windshield and-
the nameless horror which wears the
guise of woman returns to its den
its lips red from the feast its gorge
replenished  

  de grandin i expostulated
youre laving such things cant
be

  ha can they not parbleuf he
tweaked the ends of his diminutive
blond mustache gazing pensively at
the fire a moment then

  regard me my friend listen pay
attention where if you please is
tunis

  in northwest africa

   precisement and egypt is where
if you please

  in africa of course but-

  but me no buts good friend
both lie on the same dark continent
that dark mother of darksome mys-
teries whose veil no man has ever com-
pletely lifted now attend me in
lower egypt near zagazig are the
great ruins of tell besta they mark
the site of the ancient wicked city of
bubastis own sister to sodom and
gomorrah of accursed memory it
was there in the days of the third
ramoses thirteen hundred years be-
fore the birth of christ that men and
women worshiped the cat-headed one
she who was called ubasti sometimes
known as bast yes with phallic em-
blems and obscenities which would
shock present-day montmartre they
worshiped her today her temples lie
in ruins and only the hardest stones
of her many monuments endure

  ha but there are things more en-
during than granite and brass my
friend the olden legends tell us of
a race apart a race descended from
the loins of this cat-headed one of
bubastis who shared her evil feline
nature even though they wore the

outward semblance of women and of
men the fellaheen of egypt are poor
wretchedly poor and what the bare
necessities of living do not snateh
from them the tax collector does yet
not for all the english gold that clinks
and jingles at shepards hotel in
cairo could one bribe a fellah to ven-
ture into the ruins of tell besta after
sunset no it is a fact i myself have
seen it

  pourquoit because my friend
that cursed spot is glioul-haunted do
not laugh it is no laughing matter
it is so

  the ancient gods are dust and
dust are all their worshipers but
their memory and their evil live after
them the fellaheen will tell you of
strange terrible things which dwell
amid the ruins near zagazig things
formed like human creatures but
which are as your own so magnificent
monsieur poe has said neither man
nor woman nor brute nor human-
they are ghouls yes certainly like
a man or like a woman their faces are
so too are their bodies to some extent
but they see in the dark like her from
whom they are whelped they wear
long nails to seize their prey and have
beast-teeth to tear it and of the flesh
and blood of living men-or dead if
the live be not available-they make
their food and drink

  not only at tell besta are they
found for they are quick to multiply
and their numbers have spread in
the ruined tombs of all northern
africa they make their lairs awaiting
the coming of the unwary traveler
mostly they are nocturnal but they
have been known to spring on- the
lone voyager by day as well the
arabs hate them as a man may hate
a serpent but they fear them also
and speak of them by indirection
that people they call them nor
does one who has traveled in arabia
need ask a second time what the term
connotes

 very good when our friend
arif pasha first showed fright like a
children of ubasti



restive horse in the presence of hid-
den danger at sight of those we know
as monsieur and madame bera i was
astonished such things might be in
darker africa in persia perhaps in
asiatic turkey i told me but in
america-new jersey-non

  however jules de grandin has
the open mind i made it a duty to
meet this so strange couple i ob-
served their queer cat-like eyes i
noticed the odd claw-like nails of
their hands but most of all i watched
the white gleaming teeth and the car-
mine lips of them and listened to the
soft purring intonation of their
words

   these folk are most queer i
tell me they are not like others
that very night we visited the
city hospital and listened to our
little trula tell her fearsome story
what she had to say of those who

to death convinced me of much i
should otherwise not have believed

  came then sergeant costellos re-
port of the four girls hired by this
madame afrique whom now we know
to be madame bera-girls who did
not return to their former haunts
though they had lost their service
places then comes the information
of the strange woman who rode with
the unfortunate young calebson the
night he met death

   jules de grandin i tell me

sters by night-seeing things which

arif pasha was not alone in strange
contrast to the slim dark and
elegant turkish cosmopolite detec-

blue-eyed irish bulk into the drawing-
room grinning rather sheepishly at

ljl senting to the public for the
jl jl first time the following ex-
tracts from the diary of joseph
worth the present writer does not
venture any expression of opinion
upon that unusual document or upon
its still more unusual sequel

  if the diary is accepted as genuine
its implications in the light of what
ensued are almost incredible to twen-
tieth century minds but on the
other hand if it is dismissed as a hoax
or as the product of a deranged
imagination the sequel must appear


in the light of an even more incredible
and inexplicable coincidence

  the only known facts concerning
the case appear in the extract from
the bodmin chronicle which is ap-
pended at the close of worths own
narrative

tolgarth april  -what
strange spell binds me to this pre-
posterous place called polgarth which
is scarcely a dot on the hinterland of
cornwall i do not know save that the
six days which i have spent here have
wrought in me a sensation of content-
the gallows tree



ment and tranquillity such as i have
not known in years of wandering over
the surface of the globe

  there is no beauty in the spot it is
almost repellently bleak and yet for
the first time within my memory the
wanderlust which has burned within
me appears to be at rest perhaps it
is the very bleakness of the region
which attracts me for in all my odys-
sey scenic splendor has never been
my quest

  perhaps in truth there has been no
quest in my ramblings for i have
sought to find nothing rather i have
sought to lose something-and that
something myself

  i have fled in dismay from the most
cosmopolitan centers of the new and
old worlds alike yearning for seclu-
sion and in the forests the deserts
the mountains of four continents i
have cried aloud for distraction and
companionship yet here in this
lonely cornish nook which is neither
metropolis nor absolute wilderness i
feel unaccountably as though i had
come home

  there may be some atavistic expla-
nation of it for i know that my fore-
fathers were english three centuries
ago and they may well have come from
cornwall since i remember a vague
tradition that our surname was once
trewartha which has surely a cor-
nish savor although for generations
it has been shortened to the form
worth

  and perhaps if atavism enters into
it that too may account for the fas-
cination which that tree holds for me
for farther back in the mists of time
not three but eighteen centuries
ago who knows what homage my
tree-worshiping ancestors may have
offered before some such woodland
god

  i had no thought of this in mind
when i first wandered into this cor-
ner of england indeed i can not say
what impulse or whim of chance led
my vagrant footsteps hither unless it
was the craving for a new and strange

environment and my present peace-
ful mood is probably but transient
another week will find me racked once
more with the old agony of unrest
which has tortured my soul for more
years than i can remember

  but at least for the moment i am
at peace here-in a tiny settlement
which is scarcely a hamlet and cer-
tainly far from a village a ram-
shackle old inn where i am dwelling
a dozen scattered cottages and for the
rest a region of rolling moorland the
monotony of which is broken only by
an occasional straggling tree

  for the most part they are just
that-occasional straggling trees but
there is one exception to which i have
alluded and which lingers within my
mind as though i had spent a life-
time beneath its boughs as though my
very cradle had been suspended from
them

  heavens what a tree is that gigan-
tic oak which stands alone upon the
moor it may be a mile and a half
from this spot a monstrous tower-
ing growth gnarled with the age not
of years but of centuries it must have
been old when shakespeare was
young it may have been in its prime
when john signed the charter at
runnymede

  it stands alone towering high above
the stunted landscape like a brob-
dmgnagian in lilliput it would be
striking amid a myriad giants of its
kind in the heart of sherwood forest
here it seems to dominate the entire
countryside not merely by its physi-
cal magnitude but by its majestic
aloof almost contemptuous detach-
ment as it stands as though brood-
ing over a past rooted centuries deep
in history

  i first chanced upon it three nights
ago when strolling in the faint light
of a moon which seemed as barren as
all else in this barren area a light so
faint that even the spreading bulk of
the tree itself cast no shadow the
moon is even fainter tonight other-


weird tales

wise i might almost see the tree from
my window

april -it is unaccountable the
atmosphere of isolation which sur-
rounds that tree i strolled past it
again last night and as i paused be-
neath the tangled canopy woven by its
branches far overhead i seemed al-
most to step from the world of every-
day into another realm-a realm of
the unknown at once perilous and al-
luring i could almost have believed
that the ground whereon i stood was
hallowed-or unhallowed-to some
spirit of the past in such an aura
before such a tree i could easily con-
jure up a vision of ancient druidical
rites and unnamable sacrifices what
tricks the human mind can play upon
itself once given scope

  tonight the moon is still pallid
but it seems that i can faintly dis-
cern that gigantic bulk on the distant
moorland perhaps if the light grows
stronger later i shall see it more
clearly

april -i was not mistaken in
my earlier fancies there is a defi-
nite almost tangible fascination
about that tree for the last forty-
eight hours i seem to have lain under
its spell my thoughts permeated by
its overpowering presence i seemed
to feel it beckoning to me yet i de-
liberately refrained from revisiting it
until tonight in order to taste to the
full the piquant sensation of antici-
pation

  and tonight i sat for almost an
hour beneath its fantastically sprawl-
ing limbs strange that an inani-
mate object should have power to cast
such a spell over one although a
tree in a sense is not inanimate par-
ticularly such a tree indeed con-
trasted with it man himself seems a
puny creature not alone in stature
but in the light of the countless human
generations that such a titan of na-
ture has seen run out their brief span
of life

  if the superstitions of the dark ages
still survived today one might well
conceive of such a living pillar rooted
in the depths of the nether-world
and extended upward half-way to
heaven

  a fantastic fancy of course why
my thoughts should flow along such
channels i do not know but tonight
as i sat beneath that monstrous bole
it almost seemed that its leaves rus
tling far overhead whispered to me
of things beyond the ken of human
mind the sight of human eye of
thoughts and deeds weird unnamable
yet overpoweringly alluring

  i am sure that from my window i
can distinguish the outline of the tree
-as dim as though it were a phantom
figure upon a phantom moor i can
almost hear the whispering of its
leaves-but that of course is stark
imagination

april -i should not have be-
lieved it possible a week ago
that an obsession could so grip a hu-
man mind my thoughts seem to twine
as instinctively around the tree-
for it has become that to me-as does
the mistletoe around another of its
species

  i dreamed of it last night or rath-
er it formed the background of my
dream just as it does for almost every
thought of my waking moments
strangely enough i have seldom
known a dream of such intensity and
yet already its details are fading from
my mind and only the grim outline
remains

  i found myself garbed in quaint
fantastic garments which must i be-
lieve have been those of the restora-
tion or of the early georgian period
mounted on horseback with a pistol
in each hand i was in hiding it
seemed in a thicket and as i listened
for sounds of my pursuers a welter
of foul and furious emotions raged
within my breast

  pursuit came i fled but was over-
taken and tom from my moiuit by a
the callows tree



score of dream hands and then the
tree limned itself upon my conscious-
ness i was being dragged toward it
and such a pall of horror as in my
waking moments i can scarcely con-
ceive fel  over me i shudder even now
in the sane light of day at the vague
recollection of the dark and blasphe-
mous thoughts which coursed madly
through the channels of my brain and
seemed to sear my very soul

  the tree was drawing nearer and
every second the shroud of black ter-
ror enveloped me more closely and the
tempest of unholy frenzy set me quiv-
ering as from the palsy in my un-
seen captors grasp and then sud-
denly i awoke-

  a beam of moonlight fell athwart
my bed and through the open win-
dow in the remote distance i beheld
the shadowy silhouette of the tree its
branches stirring tortuously in the
night breeze-whispering still whis-
pering it seemed

  curious what tricks the light of
day can play as i sit writing this
shortly before noon i can not dis-
tinguish the tree upon the moor it
is probably because the sunlight daz-
zles my eyes i have never yet be-
held the tree by daylight i shall
this afternoon to test whether its
spell is as potent as by night

  a pril -merciful heavens are
the days of witchcraft not yet ex-
tinct 

  i am so shaken by my experience
of yesterday afternoon that i can
scarcely yet marshal my fevered
thoughts to place them upon paper
either i am the victim of a delusion
more incredible than ever conceived
in the pages of fiction or some ac-
cursed black magic stalks the moors of
cornwall in the twentieth century

  yesterday afternoon i set out from
the inn to survey the tree by day-
light it stood i recalled about a
mile and a half distant at the first

crossroad one encountered to the east
-half an hours walk but the road
so rambles and twists that the tree is
unlikely to be visible until one is close
upon it although as i have said it
can be seen in a direct line from my
window on a cloudless night

  i covered the distance leisurely
grappling in my mind with the in-
credible spell which the thing appears
to have cast over me and then as
i reached the crossroads a chill of in-
credulous amazement almost of con-
sternation gripped me

  for the tree was not there

  the moor rolled east and west and
south broken only by a few patches of
scrubby brush the tree had van-
ished as though obliterated by a giant
hand it was not merely that it had
been leveled by ax or saw or up-
rooted by some cataclysm of nature
the earth whereon it had stood was as
smooth and level and unbroken as
though for centuries the tree itself
had simply been wiped out of exist-
ence if indeed it had ever existed

  then indeed for a moment my
brain reeled and tottered on the brink
of chaotic madness such a thing was
unthinkable-and yet it was the
truth

  as i stood numbed with bewilder-
ment a possible explanation suggested
itself could i have mistaken the
spot but a moments reflection con-
vinced me of the futility of that
theory i knew the spot all too well
four times before had i visited it the
first by chance the other three by de-
sign here in the angle formed by
the roadway which i had followed
and a transverse path across the moor
the tree had stood and now the spot
was as smooth and level as the turf be-
neath a tennis roller

  no there could be no mistaking the
location for there was not another
transverse path within a mile and
moreover from this point i could dis-
cern in the distance the inn and my
own window through which i had


weird tales

more than onee gazed upon the
blurred outline of the tree

  as the incredible inexplicable re-
alization seeped slowly through my
reluctant brain i observed an aged
peasant approaching and accosted
him-cautiously for i was not pre-
pared to expose whet must seem my
madness to the world

  can you tell me i asked what
has become of the great oak which
once grew here   

  he surveyed me with incurious yet
non-understanding eyes

  there dont belong to be no oak
tree nor no other tree there sir nor
ever was as i remember he an-
swered

  surely i can not be mistaken i
pressed him i visited this place
nce in the past and i seem to re-
call a large tree growing here

    not in the seventy years that i be-
long to live in these parts sir he
insisted

  with a word of apology and a mut-
tered explanation that i must have
mistaken my direction i left him and
for hours paced the moor in a vain
attempt to fathom the riddle

  vain indeed for to one of two con-
clusions i must come either i had
suffered a delusion when i saw the
tree or i suffered one now when i
could not see it but the peasants
assurance dispelled the latter possibil-
ity and drove me inevitably to a re-
alization that for the last week i must
have labored under some incredible
hypnotic spell

  i have looked from my window to-
night half expecting to see once more
the nebulous blur of the tree that is
not and can never have been a tree
but the sky is overcast with an omi-
nous eloud-pall and naught is visible
on the distant moor and yet-merci-
ful heaven am i indeed on the verge
of madness  i seem even now to hear
the phantom rustling of those leaves
that can have no existence save in the
disorder of my brain

 pril -beyond all question
there is some deviltry afoot upon
these accursed cornish moors some
intangible fiendish force which works
its malevolent purpose through that
tree of hell spawned up from the
very inferno itself

 and yet after what i passed
through last night after that ordeal
which has left me racked not alone
with physical pain but with incredi-
ble and agonizing terror of mind and
soul should i call it an intangible
force i do not know i only know
that at this moment i stand at the
border of a land of unseen unthink-
able horrors from which phantom
hands stretch forth to clutch me and
drag me into their unhallowed depths

  tonight i shall sleep-if indeed i
sleep at all-behind bolted doors and
windows though i doubt whether
such puny artifices can avail against
the forces of evil which have appar-
ently beset me and tomorow i shall
flee from cornwall forever i have
had enough of wandering for one life-
time henceforth any spot which is
sufficiently far removed from this
fiend s pest-hole is a welcome home to
me

  even in this diary which no other
eye than mine shall ever scan i
scarcely dare to set down the thing
that befell me last night for even
now it almost drives me to question
my own sanity have i who ever
scoffed at the supernatural fallen be-
neath the thrall of sorcery as black as
ever flourished in ancient thebes 
in the darkest medieval era

  or will mental obsession auto-hyp-
nosis and somnambulism explain away
my ordeal  no-a thousand times no
as i still feel that rasping knot of
death upon my throat and behold the
gigantic shape of that hell-tree rear-
ing itself from the very pit of perdi-
tion

  i dreamed again last night-and
yet i scarcely dare say what i
dreamed and what was soul-chilling
reality so hectically are the two in-
the gallows tree



tenvoven in a dread pattern of occult
horror

  at least however my dream began
as did that of three nights ago again
attired in the garb of bygone cen-
turies armed and mounted i fled
from i know not what pursuit again i
was overpowered by that horde of
dream figures and again borne across
the moor toward that appalling tree
whose sinister secret i had not fully
grasped before again my brain
seemed to quail beneath the storm of
inchoate fury that seethed within me
as i struggled madly against the hor-
ror yet to come

  now i stood beneath the tree and
my welter of volcanic madness gave
way to a cold stark despair and to a
hell-born hatred as i felt my hands
being bound behind my back and a
noose twining snake-like about my
neck

  another moment and the earth re-
ceded from beneath my feet i dan-
gled in midair and fought chokingly
for breath as that circlet of death
tightened ruthlessly upon my throat
a haze of black oblivion reeled before
my staring eyes and then-

  it must i think have been at that
point that my dream broke off and
grim reality succeeded it for of a sud-
den the noose had vanished from
about my throat and in the reaction
i lay in a sobbing gasping frenzy

  and then came the crowning hor-
ror of reality to climax and eclipse
the horror of my dream as the chill
night wind slowly fanned the fever
from my brow i raised my head
and-

  merciful heavens

  i lay not in my bed in the inn but
upon the very moor at that very spot
at the crossroads and-what diaboli-
cal enchantment lay at the bottom of
it i know not-beside me that ac-
cursed tree of hell once more had
reared itself and in the moonless murk
of night it seemed to spread until it
enveloped the earth with a miasma of
dreadful omen

  at the realization of where i was
and what i saw i screamed aloud
and then i must have swooned for
when i next opened my eyes sun-
light was streaming over the moors
and that appalling towering shape had
vanished like a noxious mist of night

  somehow-i do not recall how-i
must have reeled or staggered like a
sobbing gibbering madman home to
the inn for i remember gaining the
shelter of my room and then collaps-
ing once more a quivering soul-sliak-
en human shell

  not all the gold of the indies could
tempt me to spend another twenty-
four hours in this region of devildom
had i the strength i should flee from
the spot ere nightfall but in my shak-
en condition i can not start until
morning but tonight i shall sleep
with doors and windows bolted and
with a loaded revolver within reach
of my hand and more i shall tie
myself to my bed

  that may be a vain precaution for
gladly though i would believe it i
know in my heart of hearts that it was
not mere somnambulism that led me
to the moor last night

  sometimes in my calmer moments
i have tried to reason that it was and
that all i experienced until daybreak
wras a dream but such self-deception
is futile i am still uncertain of the
exact point at which my dream broke
off and grim reality took up the ordeal
of horror but this i know as a final
and inexorable proof-my throat still
throbs with agonizing pain and it is
encircled by a livid weal-the imprint
of a noose

doom sounded for the bound man in

the ticking of
the clock

by a  h greatraikes

if johnsons mind had been at
all imaginative or attuned to
anything higher than brutal
common sense he would not have sat
with his back to the open french
window that night

  johnson was a man with a good
conceit of himself he prided him-
self especially on his domestic accom-
plishments lie was a born cook and
manager he told his friends and his
hobby was to go down to a little
bungalow of his in the country and
do for himself during the week-
ends usually he had friends with
him to whom he could show off his
culinary art but sometimes he
liked to be alone

  he was a self-made man was john-
son his business that of running
up small flats and letting them to
artizans rent strictly in advance
brought him in a generous income
and it was his nature to boast of his
smart modes of ejection if an un-
happy tenant was not ready with his
weekly payments

  this saturday night he happened
to be alone his son tony had said
he might possibly turn up but had
not done so johnson had just fin-
ished a choice little meal had cleared
the table and settled himself in front
of it meaning to go into some ac-
counts before he went to bed he was
feeling sleepy and particularly com-
fortable and too lazy to begin his
work at once he lighted his pipe


and sat contentedly fingering a fat
pocketbook on the table before him

  the twilight was coming on apace
and johnson was just making up his
mind to light a lamp when he heard
a slight noise behind him

    that you tony   he asked slow-
ly turning his head

  the next moment he felt something
thick and dark thrown over his head
and face while a sickening deadly
essence permeated his every sense
he struggled madly and tried to rise
fell back and collapsed insensible
into the wooden armchair

  when he regained consciousness
he was gagged and bound-strapped
into his seat in a way it was impos-
sible to ease before him facing the
full moon the light from which
streamed in at the window stood a
man

 who was he

  johnson thought he recognized the
face half covered as it was by cap
and muffler but when the other
with an impatient movement flung
aside these wrappings he knew him
at once it was young merril the
cinema musician whom he had
ejected from one of his flats in his
own inimitable way

 but how changed he was the
open face was haggard now and
cynical his deep-set eyes looked
derisive his lips twitched and the
trembling hands were blenched

 do you remember me my
the ticking of the clock



friend he began you can not
answer of course but i see you do
and do you remember the night you
turned us out my sick wife and me-
out into the frost and snow without a
penny you had forgotten it per-
haps but did you think i would for-
get perhaps you did you have
done so many brutal deeds but you
were mistaken this once my friend-
mistaken-this-once  

  the pupils of johnsons eyes had
expanded as he tried with all his
strength to pull back from the face
of the speaker as it approached near-
er and nearer to his with the empha-
sis of the last words for there was
mania written on the pallid counte-
nance and the lurid glare of the wild
eyes was shown up vividly by the
moonlight

  that nights exposure killed my
wife   merril went on hoarsely
standing up again she my only
friend died as much by your hand
as if you had actually shot her her
delicate frame could not stand the
roughing we had to go through
after three weeks of delirium she
died it is for that-for that-that
i have come to balance accounts

  johnsons heart pounded in his
chest his eyes the only means of
expression left him pleaded with his
captor

  oh i like the fear in your eyes
friend they look so beseeching-
like a rabbit caught in a ferreting
net yes i could stand and watch
them for hours for i remember
you know how my wife pleaded with
you and what you said too-every
word of it-is branded on my very
soul    but the time is short and i
must get about my business i have
come to make a little entertainment
for you

  he turned toward the table

  see i am moving your things
dont be alarmed i shall not touch
your money-your one god-but if
i did it would not matter you will

have no need for it again my friend
for i have brought you a present-
something far more interesting than
money-quite a pretty little thing
and such a simple device   

 look i have made the table
clear and now i sweep aside the cloth
that i may arrange my little toy for
you to see it is a clock you notice
just a small american thing with
the hour hand i am connecting this
little piece of wire you can not
make it out but you will when i
explain this wooden box to which
the wire is joined at the other end
contains a little apparatus worked by
electricity and this other wire
emerging from the side of it is con-
nected with that stop on the clock
just under the twelve

  now do you understand ah i
see by your eyes that you guess
when the short hand reaches the
twelve the circuit will be connected
by the stop the electric apparatus
will be set in motion the box my
friend also contains a powerful ex-
plosive   yes after  tonight
you will need no more money for i
have come to show you the same
mercy that you showed my wife

  the man in the chair gave such a
wild leap that it actually made a
faint sound on the floor his limbs
tied at every joint were immovable

  merril chuckled-the gibbering
chuckle of a maniac

  i love to see you writhe friend
he continued in a gloating tone i
love to think of the commotion in
that craven heart of yours but look
the waiting is the worst part after
all and it is  oclock now already
 oclock and you only have to wait
till midnight what is a wait of
three hours to my three weeks of
agony   

 there now i have finished
there is no need of a light that you
may see the time the face of the
clock is luminous  it is the only
light you will have-that and the


weird tales

moon-a mere glow-worm fire to show
you when the end is near no one
will come i have taken care of that
so you will have these three last
hours to yourself    good-bye my
dear friend and in your last mo-
ments think of my wife

  johnsons eyes were blood-shot and
tense with fear but with a derisive
nod the other man turned away he
heard the click of the french window
as it was carefully shut he heard
the crunch of feet on the gravel get-
ting fainter and fainter then-but
for the clock-utter silence

  tick-tick tick-tick tick-tick

ten o clock the hands seemed to
race over the dial as johnson
with straining eyes watched them go
round but there were still two
hours surely someone would come
to release him before that accursed
clock reached midnight there were
neighbors not half a mile away if
he could only move one joint he felt
he could loose himself if he could
only call surely someone would hear
him could he move the chair he
tensed his body and tried it would
not move this way or that it had
been firmly tied to the table legs an
inarticulate sob rose to his throat he
could not utter it through the thick
mass that was in his mouth   

  the shadows gathered darkly in
the corners of the room they were
intensified by the moonlight which

  lay in a silvery patch across the pa-
quet floor the tremulous nose of ai
mouse showed itself for an instant
under the edge of the fender

   tick-ficfc tick-ficfc tick-facfc

  a quarter to 

  the mouse emboldened by the con-
tinued stillness came forward
stealthily into the open ran half-way
toward the chair then overcome by
its own temerity turned and fled
under cover again

  there was a faint tapping at the
window the bound mans heart
gave a sudden leap of hope it was
only the ivy leaves stirred by a ris-
ing night-breeze that fretted against
the window-pane

   tick-jcfc tick-tick tiek-facfc

  five minutes to 

  the form in the chair seemedto
have shrunk into that of an old man
the sweat poured from the grayed
forehead and fell in heavy drops on
the cheeks the eyes bulged from
their sockets

  the mouse fearing nothing now
boldly crossed from fender to chair
running over the left boot of the
bound man as it made for the feast
of crumbs beneath the table

  tick-ic tick-tick tick-tick   

  the glassy eyes of the dead man
gazed with fixed horror at the dial
before them

  the clock stopped

august   those who
happened to be watching the
skies from the middle west and the
east about midnight were startled by
a strange and awe-inspiring spec-
tacle that apparently of a meteor
falling upward-from the earth

  many and weird were the conjec-
tures that appeared in some of the na-
tions newspapers the next morning
however it was the cincinnati com-
mercial tribune which first supplied
the amazing details connected with
the affair the article follows

suictde party hops off for moon

  defy order op withdrawing promoter

  withdrawal under adverse public opin-
ion by the promoter of the eartli-to-moon
hop and his subsequent order to dismantle
the strange device just completed for this
amazing attempt to span planetary space
evidently precipitated a pre-schedule leap
off mother earth by the inventor of the
rocket philip carewe and those associated
with him in a wild scheme of first-hand
lunar study and possible colonization

  attendants at lunken airport were
aroused last night by an automobile pulling
up near the giant rocket the latter had
been conveyed there for its hop-off pre-
paring to investigate they were just in time
to see a gigantic column of flame leap from

                                 


weird tales

the propulsion tubes of this monster ma-
chine as it shot skyward

  so great was the impact of the fiery
column that a crater fifty feet in diameter
and thirty feet deep was formed in the
moist soil softened by the recent unseasonal
rains the chassis of the automobile was
found in the crater melted into a shapeless
mass

  one attendant arthur brockner 
easter avenue was able to describe the
spectacle vividly

  i had just reached the door of the main
hangar a little ahead of the other boys
said brockner when there was a blinding
splash of intense white flame on the field
accompanied by a frightful hissing roar
simultaneously a column of fire shot up
and into the heavens its head soaring on
and on into space

  at a height of what i would put at
some thirty miles it bent in its course
heading directly into the path of the moon
all this happened in less than five minutes

  fascinated we continued to watch the
rockets bright trail until approaching dawn
made this invisible

  how many are in the rocket is a ques-
tion though four members of the group
pledged to go were missing from their
homes whether or not they still are alive
is another question it is possible that one
or more of them were blotted out oblit-
erated by what may have been a premature
blast and which destroyed their car yet
the fact that not the slightest trace of them
was found in the crater would seem to indi-
cate that they had departed with the rocket

  the one member of the original suicide
party who did not go miss ruth llasken of
milford ohio reports that the others tele-
phoned her late last night and importuned
her to join them in their sudden announced
intention of starting for the moon at once
she declined

  further movements of the rocket will be
watched through powerful telescopes the
world over each night as long as the sup-
ply of oxyliydrogen lasts in the large central
tank with which the rocket is equipped for
its fiery propulsion through space observ-
ers with the larger telescopes should be able
to follow its trail anywhere between here
and the moon which is roughly some -
 miles distant now

chapter 

  a pparently oblivious to the excite-
mcnt that possessed his compan-
ions was the young man of the fine
gray eyes who sat staring morosely
out across the dimly lighted lawn a
light breeze ruffled his tousled blond

hair over an intelligent forehead
about a mouth that plainly was de-
signed to express the even good humor
of its owner there now was a certain
grim disappointment

  there were four round the table in
the little garden which they were
wont to frequent since they had been
drawn together in preparation for one
of the weirdest adventures the mind
of man had yet conceived three
males and a girl of rather extraor-
dinary charm the remains of a late
repast lay before them

  the strains of a waltz wafted to
them from a hidden orchestra blend-
ed pleasantly with the soft timbre of
the girls voice as she read from the
evenings times-star though there
was indignation in her tones a be-
coming flush of vexation colored her
rouge-free cheeks and her large hazel
eyes sparkled with mysterious fires

  -is gratifying to learn that promoter

hanley has at last withdrawn from this
criminally impractical venture it had been
hinted by some that in backing the mad
-year-old inventor of the rocket hanley
was actuated by a vain desire to further
advertise himself and incidentally of course
the chewing gum known the world over by
his name this at the sacrifice of the lives
of these irresponsible young daredevils who
would risk practically certain death for a
chance at the  that was to have
been theirs if they should succeed the
money was otherwise to go to their ben-
eficiaries and had already been placed in
escrow to this end

  hanley maintains however that his prize
offer had its inception in a statement by
professor william h peterson of jamaica
who calculated that an ordinary airplane
traveling two hundred miles an hour would
reach the moon in about fifty days-assum-
ing of course that there were air through-
out tire intervening distance through which
the plane could travel

  it is a fact that the moon is so much
nearer to the earth than any other heavenly
body that the naked eye sees it more
plainly than the greatest astronomer sees
the nearest planet through his high-power
telescope the inventor of the rocket had
planned to leap through the vacuum which
an airplane could not travel and to reduce
the airplane-time estimate to approximately
one seventh

  the giant rocket is to be dismantled and
scrapped at once
behind the moon



  well dare-devil partners there
goes a glorious chance to convince a
globeful of doubters and skeptics
the girl continued a great adven-
ture gone wrong

  the tall almost too handsome male
seated beside her placed a strong
tanned hand over her slim but cap-
able-looking one

  never mind beryl old mother
earth doesnt provide so bad a place
after all  

  but she deftly slipped her fingers
free from the grasp of her fiance be-
stowing upon him an enigmatic smile
and addressed him of the tousled
locks across the table

  cheer up phil maybe wed have
backed out on you anyway i know
ruth wasnt any too sure of going
while as for don over there-her boy

friend-

  ill vouch for don any time re-
plied phil i believe in you all for
that matter-though its true that
ruth has been wavering but the rest

of you- an idea appeared to

seize him suddenly look here we
could best the scoffers yet the rocket
is completed as you know-is even
fully stocked with provisions and spe-
cial togs for only on the eve almost
of our departure is our backer afflicted
by this safety-first germ bred by a
lot of calamity howlers hes spent
his money freely for the rocket now
lets give him a run for it anyway
in spite of the pack we can phone
ruth arrange to pick her up on the
way to the airport and hop off before
anyone has a chance to stop us what
do you say   

  his earnest gaze traveled apprais-
ingly from one to the other of them
from beryl claverly gracefully
rounded petite and brown-haired a
self-reliant orphaned business girl of
twenty-two whose ability as a stenog-
rapher she had hoped to employ to
advantage in taking down notes and
typing a record of their adventure-
if they lived to have any beyond the
proposed hop-off into space  to don-

ald armstrong the stocky sandy-
haired good-natured mechanician
who oddly enough had preached to
rural congregations before he had de-
cided that mechanical science held
greater mysteries for him and finally
to john sanderson the stalwart bot-
anist whose talents had been intended
for the study of whatever plant life
the earths satellite might hold would
they see it through now that the deed
confronted them squarely-a leap into
eternity perhaps the idea left even
philip a little breathless despite his
long planning and the steeling of him-
self to this unparalleled adventure

  beryl was the first to speak

  ill telephone ruth she said
getting up but whether she agrees
or not to go with us you can count on
me yes i know-she smiled down
philips protest about their expecting
a lone girl to accompany them-one
poor little girl out there among the
cold stars and mere males and all
that but im going just the same
im old enough to know my mind
and quite as able to take care of my-
self as any male thank you and
thats that

 and you can count on me
quietly put in donald his usually
smiling round face more serious than
beryls

  how about you john

  oh-you can count on me phil
after a moments hesitation

  presently beryl returned

  ruth has reneged as i half ex-
pected she has absorbed that article
in the paper and decided that the idea
was all wrong in the first place ive
a suspicion that she may even try to
have us stopped so lets hurry
leave-takings would merely compli-
cate things-especially for don eh
don

  well-i think youre right about
a sudden leave-taking being best
beryl said that individual after a
brief thoughtful pause come on
gang

ahead the twin beams from the
i-little sedans headlamps swept the
vast landing-field as philip swung the
car skilfully round and brought it to
a quick stop

  a few yards away loomed one of
the strangest machines ever devised
by man a machine in which these in-
trepid would-be pioneers of space ex-
pected to defy the laws of gravitation
to reach and explore that great ex-
panse of lunar landscape which was
turned to earthly view in all phases of
its bleak glory once each month and
behind that face too where no mans
eye had yet seen even from afar

  silently they got out and ap-
iroached the colossal affair which
represented more than a years con-
struction and years of dreaming and
planning before that one hundred
and forty-two feet high and thirty
feet in diameter it towered above
them with its eonic-al peak outlined
against the moons crescent as if eager
to soar away to its destination some-
where in the universe

  this way philip whispered soft-
ly striding toward a narrow ladder
of aluminum woik whose polished out-
lines shone in ghostly relief against
the black shadows

  quietly they mounted between the
five monster propulsion tubes on
which the rocket rested to the man-
holes which opened through the
double floor into the lower chambers
or rather into one of the three tri-
angular chambers that occupied the
lower section of the rocket

  inside philip switched on the
lights avhile donald pulled up the lad-
der and screwed down the heavy
glass-centered hermetic caps over in-
ner and outer manholes

   all ashore those who are going
ashore sang out philip simulating
a sang-froid he was far from feeling
he glanced quickly about at the pale
faces of the others more than half
expecting a general protest even now
that this was carrying a joke too far

and a demand to be let out such a
protest as would likely rout his own
wavering determination to see this
wild adventure through if he had to
go it alone beryls hazel eyes returned
his gaze calmly if a bit widely don-
alds greenish ones watched him spec-
ulatively a hint of humorous appre-
ciation in their depths only the
countenance of the tall god-like john
sanderson betrayed a hint of indeci-
sion

  push off captain said the girl
a slight tremolo in her voice

  the ayes have it phil old fel-
low remarked donald lets go

  philip saw john sanderson take a
short step towaixl him as if to stop
him then halt in apparent indecision
he thought he heard a faint cry from
the outside world in that moment of
death-like silence inside the rockets
sealed interior and wondered whether
their attempted departure had al-
ready been discovered well it was
too late for anyone to interfere now

  hold fast everybody he called
grimly glancing around once more to
see that each one had gripped the
heavy rungs provided for the start
each rung an integral part of a slid-
ing section of the wall and floor
hydraulically balanced to absorb the
major part of the shock of starting
standing on the similarly balanced
platform by the controls he gripped
the levers that directed the machine-
gun-like explosions of oxyhydrogen in
the propulsion tubes which were
shaped like flaring cannon

  there was a muffled roar-a ter-
rific lurch - intense pressure under-
foot-then a numbing reaction as the
hydraulic apparatus slipped back to-
ward normal they were  their way
at last soaring toward the roof of the
universe with increasing velocity as
philip maneuvered the propulsion
controls with extreme caution for
the danger of too great physical shock
was coupled with that of air friction
outside he must guard against heat-
ing the rocket to meteor-like incan-
behind the moon



descence which would result from too
rapid movement through the envelope
of atmosphere that blankets the earth
a hundred miles or more deep

  with the aid of periscope ther-
mometer and altimeter he guided the
great projectile up from the earths
plane to the floor of the vacuum lined
by the air layers rarest outposts be-
hind him donald busied himself
quietly with pressure gages and ox-
ygen control for their air supply also
checking their course as the pull of
the crystal-covered moonlight-sen-
sitive selenium in the rockets cone
began to make itself felt when the
erratic early rush of the machine set-
tled into a more constant and in-
creased speeding toward its objective
released from the danger and resist-
ance of air friction the great projec-
tile was doubling and redoubling its
velocity as the drag of the earths
gravity decreased with the fast-grow-
ing distance intervening from an
estimated initial velocity of a mere
one hundred and fifty miles an hour
they already had attained ten times
that velocity and the peak was by
no means yet reached maximum pro-
pulsion and dwindling gravitation
should according to philips careful
figuring culminate in a velocity of ap-
proximately  miles an hour al-
lowing for cautious manipulation at
both ends of their route and barring
accident they might expect to reach
the moon easily in about a week
there if the rash venture had not
suffered disaster our planets satel-
lite might yet know the neighbor-
liness of interplanetary commerce
provided of course that the moon
were inhabited by thinking creatures

  philips thoughts toyed with these
strange conjectures as he nursed the
rocket to a course and speed of sta-
bility where he could relinquish the
controls for a time sanderson as
well as donald had been drilled in the
intricacies of the rockets control so
that each might stand watch iiow
difficult it seemed to grasp the fact

that they were already a small world
unto themselves soaring between
stars

  presently donald who no longer
found it necessary to adjust gages
and such came over to philip

  want me to relieve you phil

  he did he turned away with a
sigh of relief from the terrific tension
of that first momentous hop-off

  sanderson was staring moodily
through one of the window-like open-
ings through the rockets double shell
-it was between these two shells that
the supplies of water and oxygen
were stored while above them in the
great central chamber was stored that
all-important surplus of gas that must
drive them to the moon and back
beryl had retired into another of the
three compartments within the lower
part of the rockets barrel

  well youre a sky pilot in more
ways than one now don sanderson
remarked as the other took the con-
trols for a minister turned me-
chanic you certainly do fly high

  not nearly so high as we may
fly if we shunt into one of these stray
meteors en route was the prompt
come-back

  philips blood chilled suddenly
derelicts of the sky that was some-
thing he had not counted upon
strange how one might plan for every
seeming emergency and then over-
look entirely something like that
well it was one of the chances they
must take just as a great liner takes
that ten-thousand-to-one chance of
striking some uncharted obstruction
in midocean

noon of saturday the space-

weird tales

nated face was barely visible behind
them lit as its visible hemisphere
was solely by the reflection of the
moons fattening crescent

  the continual driving power of the
explosions through the propulsion
tubes ever accelerating their move-
ment helped them to maintain their
own weight and equilibrium with-
in the rockets chambers in spite of
the weakening pull of the planet they
were leaving so rapidly behind

  but this happy normality was not
to continue indefinitely it was beryl
who first noticed something amiss

  until now every mechanical detail
of the rocket had functioned perfect-
ly the big high-pressure central
chamber of oxyhydrogen gas showed
but slight depletion on the pressure
gage the oxygen air-devitiating sup-
ply and air-purifying apparatus the
water and the supply of condensed
foods the electric heating and light-
ing energy-all were as should be ap-
parently

  sanderson was at the controls for
the time philip checking over their
supplies donald was snatching some
needed rest beryl who had insisted
upon doing a shift like the rest was
prospecting about having lately risen
from a refreshing sleep at first she
had doubted that she could sleep at
all with the roaring of the tubes in
her ears but that din had been re-
duced to a dull muttering with their
passage beyond the atmosphere belt

  it was a different note in this im-
portant muttering of explosions that
she now noticed she had just looked
into one of the peak periscopes to
study again the fascinating image of
the satellite toward which they were
now supposedly rushing at approx-
imately two thousand miles an hour

  but the minor failed to show the
broadening crescent no longer was
the rocket headed toward the moon

  raising her head she listened again
and more intently with a slowly
gathering sense of alarm why were
they no longer pointed directly to-

ward the moon  what connection
had this with that curious change in
the pulsation of the quintet of tubes
beneath the rockets sealed floor she
felt faintly dizzy uncertain on her
feet as one feels after turning round
several times in some childish game
sanderson and philip appeared how-
ever not to have noticed anything
amiss but this might be due to their
both being seated

  phil-john she cried some-
things wrong with me-or with us
listen  

  she saw philip pale and rise un-
steadily to his feet sanderson peered
anxiously into the peak periscope be-
fore him then quickly toward philip
there was panic in his eyes

  were-were off course phil
he said what makes us feel so-

  number five is slowing down
shouted the inventor staggering a
little as his trained ear now led him
toward the pipe-line that fed the fir-
ing-mechanism of the offending tube
were traveling in a circle-like a
pinwheel  

  he reached the clock regulating
device on that tube by which the
terrific gas explosions were regulated
independently as desired and began
feverishly to inspect it

  at that moment all sound of firing
in number five ceased

  it might here be explained that the
reason for individual timing on each
tube was that this arrangement per-
mitted of changing the course of the
rocket by accelerating the explosions
in one two or three tubes on any side
normally however all five tubes were
timed alike for a straight course it
was the pull or attraction of the moon-
sensitive selenium exposed under the
glass covering of the rockets conical
head that had maintained their course
almost automatically ever since philip
had first maneuvered the giant ma-
chine into its original course by means
of the separate timing levers the ces-
sation altogether of the firing in any
tube however meant that they would
behind the moon



be thrown completely and violently
off their course

  simultaneously with the cessation
of firing in number five one wall of
the chamber appeared to tower sud-
denly above them at the same time
drawing them toward it with irresist-
ible force unprepared for this phe-
nomenon philip felt himself thrown
against that wall crashingly

  for a moment he lay there dazed
then he became aware of a soft waim
bundle pressed against him it was
beryl as dazed as he one arm twined
instinctively about his neck a few
feet away sanderson was wriggling to
a sitting posture against the pressing
wall while in the doorway of the
mens quarters opposite donald clung
desperately

  centrifugal force he yelled
were chasing our own tail round
and round he essayed a scared
smile what a treat for our astron-
omer friends at home with the tel-
escopes say weve got to tie into
that clock affair somehow before we
get too woozy or-

  wait cried philip disengaging
himself somewhat reluctantly and as
gently as possible from beryls clasp
he helped her into a more secure
position then he began crawling la-
boriously toward the control by means
of various mercifully handy valve-
handles and other mechanical projec-
tions within reach here and there on
the floor finally he managed to
clutch the railing round the nest of
controls a moment later he had
jerked over the main lever cutting off
the explosions in all five tubes

  in the odd quiet that followed the
centrifugal force which had swung
the inmates of the rocket against the
wall wtas suddenly and disconcerting-
ly lacking with the propulsion of
the tubes lacking also the weakened
pull of the earths gravitation many
thousands of miles away supplied but
little stability to the adventurers in
their movements their weights now
reduced to but a small fraction of nor-

mal they found it extremely difficult
to walk about without bumping their
heads against the wall above them-
wall because the rocket had been
on a swing parallel to the earths sur-
face at the moment philip cut off the
tubes the consequence was that the
rocket was now traveling at a right
angle to its original course-at a
speed of probably a thousand miles an
hour whether the selenium could
overcome this force in time to check
their mad rush so far off course was
a question

  but already philip and donald
were at work upon the offending
mechanism for thirty-five precious
minutes they labored tediously while
beryl and sanderson looked on in
stunned silence everything-the suc-
cess of their adventure their very
lives-depended upon the perfect mas-
tery of all five tubes propulsion for
even if the selenium did eventually
right their course and bring them to
the moon without that perfect control
they would be powerless to break the
terrific force of the rockets fall on
to the moon

  at last the cover of the recalcitrant
mechanism was snapped into place
once more philip and donald ex-
changed breathless glances as the
young inventor paused before trying
the tubes again

  heres luck said philip as with
nerves taut he prepared to throw the
switch that should ignite the gas in
the chambers and set into motion
simultaneously the five powerful driv-
ing-deviees

  four hearts almost ceased beating
for one brief instant then-

  theyre off yelled donald as
the even roar of every tube smote
upon their eardrums

  never had a din sounded more wel-
come to human ears never had hu-
man beings heard sweeter music than
the steady throbbing explosions in the
great vacuous space behind and
around them for one long minute
they waited anxiously for a possible


weird tales

return of the rockets tail-chasing an-
tics-and happily in vain

  with careful precision philip be-
gan to time the explosions on opposite
sides so as to swing the rocket grad-
ually back to its course slowly the
slice of moon swung into full view in
the peak periscope one great peril
had been met and conquered for the
time

chapter 

sunday saw the adventurers speed-
ing steadily across the sky toward
their objective without further mis-
hap beryl had spent several hours
in the typing of a detailed account
of their trip to date in duplicate the
copy was to be dispatched back to-
ward earth by means of a smaller
rocket

  this projectile was to be fired from
a gun that was built into the floor of
one of the three chambers near the
middle of the rocket s circumference
once this miniature rocket was shot
at the earth it was reasonable to be-
lieve that the combined force of its
discharge and subsequent self-propul-
sion and the earths gravitation
would result in the carrying of its
sealed chamber of news to the mil-
lions eagerly awaiting this story as
for the possibilities of radio transmis-
sion even had they been equipped to
send while racing through space that
would have been out of the question
for they had not been able to get more
than a murmur on their ultra-modem
receiving-set from the powerful radio-
casting stations on earth and not
even that murmur could be got now
this precluded the possibility of radio
communication between planets-at
least with present-day equipment

  suppose this ether-mail rocket we
send falls into some gathering of
people said beryl what then

  a mechanically contiolled metal-
parac-hute device is timed to open
gradually so as to retard and reduce
the fall of the aluminum rocket to
almost nothing as it passes through

the progressive strata of atmosphere
round the earth philip explained
 the same action will also release and
expel the unburned reserve of gas so
cutting off the power of the rockets
driving-mechanism this final kin-
dling of the gas together with a quan-
tity of smudge powder will produce
a harmless flare with a heavy smoke
visible either night or day as a signal
and a warning

  the theory sounds fine profes-
sor observed sanderson may i
apply now for position as postmaster-
general of the lunar-earth mails

  he turned his handsome profile
aside toward beryl as if inviting her
applause but she appeared to have
lost interest in the subject

  apply to your hearts content
put in donald try applying some
of your talent now to checking and
maintaining this space-ships course  

  the sealing and firing of the mail
rocket was a ceremony to which they
all had looked forward as eagerly as
children with a new toy it was im-
probable that another one could be
sent with a reasonable chance of its
arriving on earth for they would soon
be so far away that the available
charge in so small a cylinder would
scarcely carry it safely within the
earths pull before it had wandered
into space off to one side perhaps
they did have however one reserve
rocket the dispatching was set for
mid-afternoon-though out here in
space the sun blazed incessantly un-
relentingly out of a black airless
void all but overheating the walls of
the great metal projectile despite the
terrible sub-zero temperature without
their electric heating-apparatus had
therefore been taxed surprizingly
little thus bearing out philips theory
that the thin atmosphere of the moon
-if indeed there was any atmos-
phere on that body-was not unbear-
ably cold during the long lunar day
of approximately  hours

  the slim shining cylinder was at
last fitted into the torpedo-like cham-
behind the moon



her of the firing-deviee and the breech
closed securely would that explo-
sion prove too much for the little
world in which they were preca-
riously voyaging suppose calcula-
tions on the strength of this part of
the rocket proved wrong might not
the touching-off of that fuse mean in-
stant obliteration for them all such
were the thoughts that ran through
philips mind as he hesitated before
pressing the button which woidd flash
the electric spark to the fuse

  a sudden lurch accompanied by a
sharp clap as of thunder-and a thin
shaft of flame streaked earthward

  eagerly they watched its trail
dwindle rapidly in the distance
through the glass floor-well the first
astronomical mail was on its way

  with reasonable luck our mes-
sage should be picked up radiocast
and running under scaie heads in the
leading newspapers the world over
within the next sixty hours said
philip

    wuxtra all about the saps in
the moon rocket    howled donald
in nasal mimicry of a newsboy

  my report observed beryl with
some pride will tell them all about
our loop-the-loop exhibition i guess
ruth will heave an extra sigh of re-
lief that she stayed avhere she is but
i think its just grand really-loops
and all

  atta girl cried philip i nom-
inate you as first-class cheer-leader
and morale-booster of this expedition
here and now  

    seconded   said donald

  carried okeyed and duly record-
edappended philip missing a queer
look from sanderson

chapter 

nphe man-in-the-moon looking from
- out of the eastern half of his face
seemed to smirk sardonically down on
one of the strangest spectacles within
his fifty-odd million years of exist-
ence close by like a mote in his eye

-a mere thousand miles or so away-
hung an infinitesimal speck as if to
taunt him this curious object which
had first appeared in his vision as a
comet with a short but dazzlingly bril-
liant tail had twisted about and was
even now spitting flame directly into
his face

  however he continued to smile for
it was hourly becoming more evident
that this intruder whatever its na-
ture was caught in its own folly
since it was steadily falling toward
him despite its plainly futile efforts
to turn about and flee soon he would
ensnare it in one of the many wrin-
kles or pits in his countenance and see
what manner of thing this was

  but inside the rocket there was
neither consternation nor confusion
the controls functioning perfectly
and the giant conical head now safely
diverted and held away from the
jagged face of the satellite it was but
a matter of a few hours before those
inside might settle upon the queer ter-
rain glaringly outlined in the blazing
sunlight-provided of course all con-
tinued to go well

  cautiously with the explosions
slowed to a minimum in the propul-
sion tubes philip allowed the rocket
to drop closer to the lunar land-
scape-if such the forbidding array
of craters and the jagged ruts that
passed here and there for valleys
could be termed they were now
closer to the moon visually-by the
naked eye-than a twelve-inch tele-
scope brought it on earth this instru-
ment reducing the total intervening
distance to approximately five hundred
miles but the resultant magnifica-
tion of the atmospheric disturbances
distorted telescopic vision from earth
by a good half so that it was equiv-
alent to that of at least one thousand
miles distant yet even at that visual
distance sufficient detail was clear to
have enabled astronomers to map the
lunar surface more accurately than
the most remote regions of their own
globe


weird tales

  has the moon higher mountains
than the earth i wonder said beryl

  our mount everest with 
feet altitude about equals the height
of the liebnitz range over there by
the southern pole-as computed by
the length of the shadows they cast
said philip pointing through one of
the glass-enclosed window-wells

  that makes this range much high-
er proportionately than our own
highest peaks observed donald
for the earth is several times larger
than the moon

  exactly if terrestrial ranges
were similarly proportioned we would
have there peaks ten to fifteen miles
high  

   do you suppose that if the moon
has inhabitants they are correspond-
ingly taller than us beryl queried
anxiously

  there is nothing to guide us in
such a conjecture said philip

  now just suppose professor
put in sanderson emphasizing the
last word faintly and with an odd
glint in his eye just suppose our
beryl here were suddenly to come
upon a moon-being of monstrous stat-
ure and evil intent with several like
monsters at his heels what would
you recommend-or do level the
trusty gat-what

  it had grown increasingly evident
during the last forty-eight hours or
so that the tall botanist was slightly
jealous of the attention beryl gave
philip in their ordinary association
and conversation

  philips reply was drowned by a
shout from donald who was staring
below excitedly through the floor-well

  were dropping into a valley of
fire he shouted pull er up
phil

  four pairs of eyes riveted them-
selves upon the terrain immediately
beneath them which bean to slide off
to one side as philip tilted the rocket
by means of increased propulsion
through two of the tubes on one side
between jagged ridges which formed

a pass from one huge crater to
another a wall of steam or whitish
smoke rose high above the surface in
ragged streamers drifting slowly
eastward in a semi-opaque fog that
made piloting of the rocket exceed-
ingly difficult already the tips of the
hungry white fingers were reaching
above the rocket

  for a few tense moments the rocket
slipped through an enveloping haze
that hid the black star-studded sky
above as effectively as it did the
bright terrain below then abruptly
they were out of it again the stream-
ers behind them silhouetted against
the dark heavens-dark still almost
to the point of blackness because of
the nearly complete absence of atmos-
phere at this height to catch and re-
flect the suns rays

  the rocket now was fast leaving
the mysterious valley behind skim-
ming across the satellites surface
away from its sunrise side with in-
creasing speed philip thought he had
recognized the craters of cyrillus and
catharina back there the misty pass
linking the two

  that didnt look like a fire after
all donald remarked what did
you all think of it gang   

  a volcanic crevasse with steam
and gasses escaping guessed beryl
  what do you think it was phil   

  again that odd look from sander-
son  but she was not conscious of it-
or else chose to ignore it

  i believe its the terrific heat of
the sun beating down through the
rare atmosphere melting and vapor-
izing the snow that collected in the
valley or canyon during the long
lunar night said philip voicing a
theory which they were later to dis-
cover to be a fact it looks as if
were going to have a tough time of it
at noon should we land when those
peaks no longer throw a cooling shad-
ow  

  the sun however lighted but a
half of the moons face at present the
latter being at what we know as half
behind the moon



moon its western half being still
hidden from the adventurers in the
inky lunar night

  it is my guess philip continued
that the moon gets just as hot at
midday as it gets cold at night-if
you get what i mean if we find any
animal life at all well probably find
that it exists mainly in caverns  

  presently a new phenomenon was
observed this time by beryl

  what could those funny light
streaks be radiating from that big
crater over there

  comparing the crater she pointed
out with the maps he had before him
philip identified it as copernicus

  those streaks he smiled have
caused that question to be asked
countless times and no one yet has
been able to explain them satisfac-
torily well drop closer and have a
look and settle this mystery if we
can  

  carefully he let the rocket down
till it was less than five miles above
the level of the lofty crater tops
from this elevation it became evident
that the streaks were giant fissures in
the ground probably rifts brought
about by terrific volcanic upheavals
of the past in the brittle lava surface
a white deposit seemed to have been
blown out of these crevasses since
covering the surface immediately
about them the latter bore out a
theory advanced by professor peter-
son that the streaks were deposits of
pumice or some similar deposit blown
out by surface vents

  it was about an hour later that the
rocket its sidewise travel checked
was slipping along close over the rim
opposite the sunrise side of a crater
at the edge of the daylit area philip
recognized it from the lunar chart as
eratosthenes close by the equator
with several smaller craters about it
this was the region named as the
most alive by certain astronomers
where melting snows apparently
called into existence and watered veg-
etation of a sort which showed in

progressive tones of gray-green with-
in the crater beds or floors hence it
was here that philip hoped to land
the rocket first

  but the first-time landing of a -
ton machine propelled by high-explo-
sive force was to prove far from
simple though philip had expected
to drop the rocket within the cra-
ters rim where the live tones in-
vited this bulls-eye slid off discon-
certingly to one side as he maneu-
vered the rocket

  the jagged rim with its black shad-
ows beyond seemed suddenly to rush
upward a great tooth-like point shot
directly toward them

  frantically philip threw on still
more force in the tubes but the next
instant the rocket was plunged into
a curtain of velvet blackness rent
only by the blinding incandescence of
their fiery tail spurting into the sty-
gian depths beneath them

chapter 

just what followed registered but
vaguely in philips mind he re-
membered the abrupt blotting out of
the siui as he strove to counter their
sidewise fall then a terrific jar shook
the rocket a scream rang in his ears
even as all went blank

  when next he knew consciousness
he looked up to see beryls anxious
face bent over his head which rested
in her lap as she bathed his forehead
in chilled water over her shoulder
he encountered donalds troubled
gaze and beyond the enigmatic
watchfulness of john sanderson

  a sharp pain shot through his head
as he tried to raise it it seemed sur-
prizingly light despite the dizziness
that thwarted the attempt

  easy phil cautioned donald
you bounced your knob against a
control lever when we lit and i dont
mean possibly

  philip suddenly noticed with sink-
ing heart the outer curving side of
the cylindrical chamber overhead


weird tales

  everything seems to be shipshape
phil supplied beryl achieving a
brave smile nothing seriously dam-
aged inside at least even if we did
do a flipflop and land on one side
donalds modesty forbids his telling
you that his own presence of mind in
promptly stopping the firing in the
tubes at the moment we struck doubt-
less saved us all

  at that ill bet we plowed up a
half-mile of lunar landscape san-
derson appended lucky we didnt
bring up against one of those craters
lucky you didnt break your
precious neck retorted donald peev-
ishly well folks wherever we may
be we have arrived anyway black
as a villains heart outside though
cant see a thing

 he moved awkwardly toward a
window-well

  gosh he said i feel kind of
shaky myself

  but in this he had plenty of com-
pany

  philip managed to get to his feet
notwithstanding a terrific throbbing
in his head

  thanks a lot beryl he said
gratefully now well have to try to
find out something definite about our
situation if we can i wonder-say
i feel like a feather by george that
reminds me-one should weigh but a
sixth of his earthly weight here that
makes me weigh about thirty pounds
beryl you dont weigh much more
than a good-size family album
well small packages and good
things are synonymous you know
she reminded him laughing

  intent inspection through the win-
dows proved the accuracy of donalds
statement they couldnt indeed dis-
tinguish any one thing though it was
faintly evident that some sort of
blurred landscape lay without

  turn off the lights don said
philip indicating the main switch
near the others hand

  the rockets interior was plunged
into darkness

  gradually as their eyes adjusted
themselves to the lack of light the
blurred objects outside took on indis-
tinct yet faintly discernible outlines
it seemed at first that the rocket had
come to rest on a floor of white sand

  why its snowing cried beryl
abruptly and look at the size of
those flakes

  those are pancakes not snow-
flakes observed donald peering out
gosh theyre as big as my hand

  the top of a single huge boulder
close beside the rocket was draped in
a mantle of clinging white while
huge feathery flakes settled with ex-
aggerated slowness like a slow-motion
picture what a happy miracle
thought philip as he saw it that the
rocket had not crashed into that xock
head on

  im going out to investigate he
said making for the closet that con-
tained the portable oxygen tanks the
warming suits and glass-vizored res-
piration masks with which the rocket
had been equipped to combat the an-
ticipated rarity of the moons atmos-
phere

  im with you spoke up donald
quickly

 someone should guard the
rocket said philip how about
you this time john and beryl
youd better stay until we sample this
lunar atmosphere  

  some people get all the fun she
pouted

  well be back in a jiffy prom-
ised philip rashly

  the inside manhole was removed
then replaced and screwed tightly
behind them as they slipped into the
well through the now perpendicular
floor there was a tense moment as
the two paused before lifting the outer
manhole from its seat would the
lunar atmosphere prove to be an utter
vacuum causing the natural pressure
within their bodies to explode their
very flesh into puffed monstrosities
would the cold be so intense that the
heavy electrically heated garments
behind the moon



they wore would fail to protect them
even for an instant these were the
doubts that besieged them

  both fears were quickly dispelled
as they lifted the manhole clear no
gripping hand of vacuum seized them
no paralyzing wave of cold seared
them as they leaned out and surveyed
the white landscape though it was ap-
parent that the cold was severe

  on account of the precarious tilt of
the rocket s base they were obliged
to lower themselves feet first with
the aid of a rope which they fastened
to a rung underneath down the
smooth surface between the flaring
tubes which projected from the floor
like giant blunderbusses a distance
of about a dozen feet to the snow-
covered ground owing to the pos-
sibility of a complete lack of atmos-
phere outside the rocket it had not
been practicable to drop the ladder
into position through the manholes
for with both openings uncovered at
one time the precious supply of at-
mosphere within would have been
expelled into a vacuum in one quick
blast

  as they dropped into the white
fluff it rose in a cloud to settle back
slowly to a depth of about two feet
clearly the slight weight of every-
thing on the moon was responsible for
this phenomenon but it also indi-
cated the reassuring presence of a
fairly normal supply of air-or some
other gaseous substitute their own
clumsy movements it struck philip
were something like those of divers
undersea their progress at once
helped and hindered by their reduced
weight in the element round them

  a quick survey of their immediate
surroundings showed further how
lucky had been jtheir escape for
though the rocket had left no percep-
tible path in the lightly settled flakes
through which they pushed knee-deep
without effort its position indicated
the direction it had plowed before
coming to rest - less than four feet
from the large boulder they had ob-

served from inside the carpet of
snow light as it was had doubtless
figured in the miracle of their sliding
fall and stop without shattering the
brittle glass cone at the rockets peak
which philip could see with his flash
was still intact-an added and inex-
plicable miracle

  visibility was limited to less than a
dozen yards only a dull glow from
behind them indicated the lighted
window-wells through the heavy veil
of flakes the moon was in that part
of its orbit where even if the earth
were at zenith in the lunar heavens
instead of low upon the horizon it
would not have been visible to reflect
earthlight on to the moons night
landscape this because the side ot the
earth toward them was its night side
the sun being well beyond it when
however the moon should be approx-
imately between the earth and the 
sun the earth would appear as an im-
mense moon itself lighting its
satellites night terrain with several
times the brilliance of earthly moon-
light as we know it

  the cold which at first they had
not felt so keenly in the excitement of
setting foot upon lunar soil already
was making itself uncomfortably evi-
dent though chiefly through their
masks these were not heated like the
rest of their suits though they were
heavily lined with fur it was appar-
ent that they could accomplish little
under present conditions philip drew
close to donald to grasp his arm and
communicate a suggestion to return to
the rocket

  but in that instant the other sud-
denly gripped his arm tightly point-
ing with his other hand in evident ex-
citement off to where the light from
his flashlight faded into indistinguish-
able grayness

  philip directed the beam of his own
light toward the same spot at first
he could see nothing that might have
aroused donalds excitement then
his flesh tingling at the sight he saw
a convex object like the top of a big


weird tales

ball rising up out of the white fluff
about ten yards away

  slowly eerily this strange object
continued to rise swelling in size as
the loosely packed flakes slid down its
sloping sides until approximately a
fifth of a flattish sphere was revealed
at this point the edge of the object
came into view it was much like a
giant mushroom

  as the edge raised farther the
blackness underneath was penetrated
sufficiently by the glow of their flash-
lights for them to observe a stem-like
affair in the center coming up out of
a great round black well somewhat
smaller in diameter than the cap itself

  for a half minute the pair stood
motionless with amazement then a
blinding white light suddenly envel-
oped them

chapter 

ryhe sun cried donald jerking
off his headgear in wild abandon

  for one long tense second philip
waited for the worst half expecting
to see donalds features convulsed in
sudden gasping for air but the other
only shivered and promptly replaced
the fur lining of the respiration mask
he had pulled off in his joy of seeing
the sunlight again philip glanced up
at the towering rim of the crater
against the suns glare-the crater
whose edge they had fortunately
missed when they fell just beyond into
its long black shadow which was now
slowly shortening in the light of lunar
dawn

  removing his own outer headgear
philip found the atmosphere not un-
pleasant though rare like that on our
own high peaks the cold was not so
intense after all that blazing sun
penetrating the thin rare band of
lunar atmosphere already was mak-
ing itself felt indeed the set-
tling saucer-like flakes had all but
disappeared from the air already
seemingly a product of moisture tem-
porarily stored in the air immediately

around them rather than of any cloud
formation above

  in their astonishment and exhil-
aration at the suns abrupt dawning
philip and donald had momentarily
forgotten the curious object pushing
its way up out of the white blanket
on the ground to their further
amazement and some uneasiness they
now observed more of these caps ris-
ing into view all around them

  at the same time a faint mist began
to fill the air swirling between them
and the caps the feathery snow
seemed to be dissolving into a lazy
white vapor in the sun-much like the
white streamers they had elsewhere
observed from above in the rocket

  the nearest of the caps had ceased
to rise-had come to rest some five
feet above the steaming snows sur-
face it appeared to be formed of
metal or stone or of some com-
position perhaps entirely unknown
to them it measured about twenty-
five feet in diameter

  but stranger still were the creatures
that peered out at them through the
mist between the snow and the rims
of these huge mechanical mushrooms
squat and leaden-gray like their cu-
rious protective contrivances were
their heads immediately conspicuous
for two very large round eyes guilt-
less of eyelids or lashes and like noth-
ing so much as squashed spheres a
repulsive sucker-like aperture an-
swered for a mouth while a sort of
gill protuberance did duty for a nose
of hair on their heads they had none
save such as grows on the back of the
average mans hand the result was
an unsightly bareness of skull that in-
creased their general repulsiveness
for their skin was moist and slithery
-like freshly filled sausage skins in a
butchers window

  philip suppressed a shudder these
were the lunarites with whom they
must deal fear or unchecked loath-
ing would not help their mission then
the thought of the girl inside the
rocket came to-him like a shock and
behind the moon



he shuddered again if these offen-
sive creatures attempted to do her
and them violence-well he would
sell his life as dearly as possible

  the lunarites appeared hesitant to
come forth they continued to stare
owlishly at these visitors from the
heavens from under the protection of
their giant mushrooms curious sibi-
lant thin cries sounded as they ges-
ticulated and pointed with oddly
twisted arms and fingers now at
philip and donald now at the rocket
beyond them

  soon however several generated
sufficient courage to clamber out from
under the more distant caps these
were quickly followed by others a
gray horde rapidly was gathering
now on squat but slender legs that
were like saplings-was moving cau-
tiously curiously closer

  other details about these disquiet-
ing creatures registered indelibly in
philips mind as the gray circle
shrank about them he could already
count more than twenty of the caps
near by through the rising mist which
already was stretching long white
streamers skyward in the dimming
sunlight like those they had encoun-
tered before while in flight from
each of these caps now scrambled an
unending stream of lunarites slight-
ly less than four feet tall they were
with oversized oddly peaked ears-
so proportioned probably to aid their
owners in catching all available sound
in their worlds rare atmosphere it
was this rareness of atmosphere that
doubtless accounted for the ghost-like
quality of the flakes and the white
blanket they had formed which was
evaporating rather than melting

  philip observed too-first in amaze-
ment then with dawning understand-
ing-that these beings were without
clothing other than a narrow sash af-
fair about their flat hips apparently
they were fairly immune to cold
though the rim of the slowly rising
sun had already moderated the tem-
perature enough to make his heavy

garb uncomfortable even with the
electric pads in it turned off it was
evident that his supposition that the
lunar day when cleared of mists near
noon-or even when well advanced
in the -hour day-reached wither-
ing temperatures was correct at least
so far as concerned this region

  	 hadnt we better give these babies
something to think about    suggested
donald a flash of gunpowder up in
the air or something

  he tapped the automatic at his belt
just stand firm said philip it
wont do to let them get the idea that
we are afraid of them nor do we want
to frighten them somehow we must
contrive to win their confidence-if
we can

  he advanced a pace in front of
donald and threw up one hand in a
gesture of greeting to the little gray
men immediately those in front fell
back crowding the others in mild
panic evidently they regarded these
strange beings from out of space with
awe a little flurry of excited twit-
tering and squeaking was heard again

  pointing in the general direction of
the earth philip made a sweeping
gesture back to the moon next point-
ing significantly toward the rocket
looming in the vapor behind him
how he wished it were standing up in
position to take flight again at will in
an emergency a fresh gibbering
here broke out among the nearer
ranks and numbeis of these lunarites
patted the tops of their hairless heads
-probably a sign of understanding

  now what inquired donald
disconcert ingly

  how do i know retorted phil-
ip unfastening his suit about the top

  gosh this lunar sunshine is a fast
worker donald muttered doing the
same

philip was just wondering what he
might offer the lunarites as a good-
will gift - if he could single out a
leader - when as if in answer to a
wish a lunarite who was a good head


weird tales

taller than his fellows appeared from
among them he approached philip
and donald slowly a trifle less gro-
tesque than the others with less flat-
tened head there was a suggestion
of intelligence about him even in those
nearly expressionless unlidded eyes a
shorter lunarite beside him bore on
outstretched hands a flat metallic slab
with what appeared to be some sort
of food heaped on it in an olivc-liued
mound

  it was then that philip noticed
three peculiar twining fingers on
those hands-like thickened fingers of
a vine with which it clutches and
clings to things

  if its something to eat hes got
there i hope its not as slippery as he
looks   whispered donald inelegantly

  presently the creatures halted be-
fore philip the leader evidently se-
lecting him also as a leader by rea-
son of his being taller than donald
and gravely handed philip the slab
then after making signs unmistak-
ably identifying the substance there-
on as food he stepped back a pace and
waited obviously he expected them
to begin eating then and there

  if we refuse to at least nibble on
this theyll probably get sore and blot
us out mourned donald

  but philip merely smiled at the
leader and pointed up again then
shook his head in what he hoped might
be understood in the negative he
could not bring himself to eat that
curious gelatinous substance nor did
he feel that he or donald need risk it
the impression he tried to convey for
the time being wras that they did not
eat at all or at least did not require
any food then

  his signs at last understood appar-
ently there followed a conference of
bewildered astonishment between the
nearest lunarites and their leader
they conversed among themselves in
their strange tongue which sounded
not xuilike the hissing undertone of a
large congregation intoning a prayer

they waved their scrawny warped

arms about excitedly

  presently they seemed to reach an
agreement the others fell back from
around the leader who once more ap-
proached philip this time without the
food offering halting a few feet
away he went through a series of ges-
tures that plainly indicated the de-
sire of himself and fellows that their
visitors from the heavens accompany
them back into the curious pot- ike
affairs sheltered by those raised caps
with insinuating creasings of coun-
tenance which probably did duty for
a smile the leader was inviting them
to descend to the lunarites regular
habitat possibly an underground
metropolis

  the idea was not without appeal
for the adventurers had come to study
this strange globe and might even
have to depend upon these creatures
and their good-will to exist in the end
yet philip hesitated to leave beryl be-
hind would she be safer inside the
rocket until he and donald could re-
turn or would she be better off with
them and should he ask donald or
sanderson to remain on guard in the
rocket-which truly it had been a
mad and terrible mistake to bring
beryl along on this ill-fated trip

  but these considerations were rude-
ly pushed aside by the events that fol-
lowed swiftly removing all need for
a decision then

  even as he pondered beryl and
sanderson slid down the rope from
the rocket without respiration masks
evidently having observed from in-
side his and donalds removal of this
apparatus a rift in the haze showed
them wading through the light melt-
ing snow beryls cheeks were glow-
ing with excitement

  the effect of her appearance upon
the gaping lunarites was galvanic
startling

  there wras an immediate wave of
sibilant utterances as they surged for-
ward round their leader everyone
behind the moon



clamoring for his attention and point-
ing toward beryl observing their un-
wonted attention to her the girl
halted uncertainly and made as if to
run back to the rocket then she
changed her mind and ran over to
philip followed by sanderson

  what is it - oh why are they
acting so - so queerly she cried
trembling within the circle of a pro-
tecting arm he had instinctively
thrown about her

   god knows   he said hoarsely
but he had an idea that her feminine
charms were responsible for the
strange behavior of these creatures
you shouldnt have come out here
yet beryl come wed best be mov-
ing back toward the rocket don-
john-lets get under cover before
this buzzing swarm makes up its mind
to stop us-before its too late some-
things gone wrong

  they had not covered more than a
dozen feet before the swelling gray
pack was after them too late phil-
ip realized that their retreat had pre-
cipitated the very thing he had hoped
to avert had galvanized them into
sudden pursuit with an unexpected
agility the lunarites leaped after and
upon the quartet from all sides

  for a seemingly interminable space
philip fought off a horde of softish
gray little men as they charged upon
him in waves time and time again
his fist connected squarely with the
slithery heads of his assailants they
would give much like mush-filled rub-
ber bags while with a weird whis-
tling gasp that lunarite would slip to
the ground-only to have two imme-
diately take his place and beyond
the seething gray cordon philip could
see others pouring up from the depths

  back to back now he and donald
fought on a valiant but losing battle
for despite their superior strength
as compared to that of the lunarites
it was plainly but a question of time
before the gray horde would have
worn them out overwhelmed them

already sanderson philip saw from
a corner of his eye was buried under
a flailing pile of lunarites and beryl
he suddenly saw with a wave of
wretchedly impotent fury being
borne away struggling bravely by a
half-dozen gray men toward one of
the underground apertures

  all but overpowered by the entwin-
ing fingers and arms he tore himself
loose once more with a hitherto un-
tapped reserve of strength bom of
desperation and berserk rage loth
at first to use his automatic for fear
of irretrievably antagonizing these
beings he now managed to reach and
draw it he gave a yell of hate and
poured a leaden stream into the surg-
ing bodies

  for a few seconds the lunarites fell
back several of their number writhed
hissing in the snow among the others
who had previously been beaten down
to death or insensibility donald fol-
lowing philips lead had emptied his
gun into the horde

  beryl had disappeared

  their respite however was brief
with renewed fury the lunarites were
upon them again an earthy odor of
underground places was in philips
nostrils as he was borne down under
the weight of countless twining musty
bodies he was conscious of a cooling
froth of snow as his face was ground
into the hard soil underneath then
sudden oblivion

chapter 

a peculiar tingling sensation at-
tended philips return to con-
sciousness-like hundreds of needle-
points pressing against his skin all
over lacking the power to open his
eyes for the time he groped blindly
in the space before him then abrupt-
ly his numbed brain wrenched loose
from its mysterious fetters

  at first as his eyelids fluttered
open it seemed to him that he was
floating unsupported in space a


weird tales

strange gray - green luminousness
glowed directly over him like a low-
hanging iridescent cloud then lie
perceived that this was not cloud-like
at all but instead a phosphorescent
ledge of some sort about four feet
above him almost he could reach up
and touch it but he dared not for
fear of some fatal force that might be
connected with it a musty stench
pervaded the air he breathed

  he began to investigate cautiously
feeling about him his fingers came
into contact underneath with a moist
flat surface not unlike wet sand
twisting his head about clumsily for
he was still numb and stiff he saw
that he was lying in a long narrow
chamber whose length on one side-
the side on which he lay-was paral-
leled by the glowing strip overhead
at the other side a black chasm
yawned above and below

  it rather surprized him to find him-
self unbound but he was willing to
accept this favor of fate without ques-
tion for the present his head
throbbed painfully he raised him-
self on his elbows with an effort it
was then he discovered that the
chasms above and below along the
other side of the narrow chamber were
not chasms at all but merely had ap-
peared that way beyond the glow im-
mediately above him lie saw now
too that there was a low dark roof
over the whole just above the irides-
cent ledge while in the shadows
about a yard below the shelf  which
he lay there was a floor

  as he glanced back under the long
glowing roof it seemed to him that
curious protuberances of various sizes
showed above the shelfs surface-not
unlike dark toadstools pushing up

  rough the substance that comprised
it except that here and there in the
dim distance the sizes and shapes
were larger and confused something
pernicious and dread seemed to per-
vade the very air about him-he knew

not what something beyond the lim-
its of his earthly imagination

  ignoring the aching throughout his
body doubtless due to the mauling
he had received at the hands of the
lunarites in his terrific battle with
them he lowered himself slowly over
the edge until his feet touched the
floor

  as he stood up stiffly a familiar
figure groped toward him out of the
gloom startling him sharply for his
nerves were on razor edge

  donald he exclaimed grasping
his friend by the shoulders thank
god youre safe but beryl-what
have they done with her and san-
derson   

  thats what i want to know as
badly as you i was knocked out com-
pletely right after you went down
they must have taken us for a couple
of mushrooms-planting us in this
crazy joint so help me it looks like
a blamed toadstool cavern did you
notice how that queer light up there
seemed to prick your skin bet thats
some invention of these confounded
lunarites that makes things grow
double quick maybe they laid us
out under it to give its strange power
a chance to revive us must take us
for a couple of eggplants

    the thing that concerns me right
now is finding our way out of this
place and reaching beryl and sander-
son before its too late lets try this
way first

  and he led the way down the slen-
der chamber toward its unseen end
or toward what he felt must be an end
of it

  hey had proceeded no more than a
dozen yards when a shadowy form
suddenly loomed before them while
philip was still debating whether or
not to leap upon and throttle this
form first and investigate afterward
the creature hissed a single syllable
that obviously was a command to halt
philip hesitated they might sub-
behind the moon



due this creature quietly and return
the way they had eome in hope of
finding that direction unguarded then
he reflected that that way was no doubt
guarded as well if it led outside
might as well go along with this lu-
narite and try to find out from his
fellows what had been done with
beryl and sanderson

  then another lunarite appeared as
noiselessly as the first and took up a
position in back of them in this
order they followed the other through
a side opening that had escaped their
notice

  presently they emerged into what
philip at first glance took to be out-
doors upon closer observation how-
ever he perceived that they stood in
another cavern but one so vast so
amazing in its proportions that the
walls were all but invisible in the
faintly luminous atmosphere that en-
veloped them like the blue tint of
earthly skies this luminosity was not
perceptible immediately around them
but it could be seen plainly when
looking through distant volumes of
it-a greenish tint about the same
depth as our own blue sky while it
did not have the brilliance of the ledge
in the long chamber they had left be-
hind it was of sufficient intensity to
light the surroundings clearly

  still following their guide with the
second lunarite watchfully bringing
up the rear they passed for some time
through curious gray throngs of lu-
narites along a thoroughfare formed
by squat hexagonal tent-like abodes

  these bimbos must not have any
kids at all remarked donald i
havent seen anything but the one
size-except that taller one that made
the powwow with us when we first
landed among these misbegotten crea-
tures

  i was wondering about the same
thing said philip thoughtfully
heilo-talk about the devil- 

  before a larger and different-hued
tent within a semicircle of attendants

some of whose heights approached
but did not quite reach him stood the
lunarite whom our adventurers had
originally seen by the rocket at the
head of that threatening gray crowd
at any rate he appeared to be the
same one for philip recognized the
colors and the style of his apparel
color seemed to be at a painful pre-
mium in this drab world for there
was no break in the monotonous gray
in everything about all the others in-
cluding their tents with the excep-
tion of several of the attendants
closest to this personage-probably
dignitaries of a sort or possibly his
kin if indeed these queer people
knew such a relationship

  philip and donald were directed to
enter the large abode through a door
covered with a flap made of the same
coarsely woven fiber that philip had
observed was the texture of the walls
of all the tent-like houses along their
way here

  they were preceded inside by the
leader and his attendants the latter
squatting on the floor at the sides and
rear of their chief chairs the lunar-
ites seemed to know nothing about
indeed the adventurers were to learn
that one of the secrets of these crea-
tures maintaining an existence on
this all-but-dead world was their will-
ingness to dispense with anything and
everything that was not absolutely es-
sential to life of luxuries they knew
none nor many of the things we con-
sider essential in our own somewhat
pampered existence

  like the rest the leader squatted
upon the hard dry ground indicating
by gestures that philip and donald
should do likewise

  at a sign from the leader an at-
tendant approached them and began
to sketch with what looked like a
stout twig upon the smooth surface
of the ground before them philip
followed with fascinating gaze the
motions of those gray twisted fingers
which were so much like gnarled vines


weird tales

wrapped round the smaller straighter
twig they held

  displaying surprizing skill as an
artist the lunarite rapidly drew a
recognizable likeness of a woman
which from her familiar earthly
garb philip instantly knew repre-
sented beryl

  the sketch of a man followed the
lunarite pointing from it to philip
another was drawn to represent don-
ald still another followed this by
gestures and sundry hissings in addi-
tion to its added height they recog-
nized as the absent sanderson

  apparently satisfied that their vis-
itors had followed these writings
thus far the lunarites proceeded with
what was clearly a recounting of the
individual adventures of the quartet
following their capture beryl it
seemed had been brought to this very
abode-was a prisoner in the adjoin-
ing room

  sanderson it seemed had been se-
lected as leader of the invaders by
reason of his tallness the latter char-
acteristic the adventurers were to
learn was the one conclusive distinc-
tion by which the lunarites recog-
nized their own leaders and these
leaders autocratic rule hence their
automatic selection of sanderson who
stood six feet one and a half inches
without his shoes-two and one half
inches taller than philip whose near
six feet topped the stocky donald by
a similar margin donald himself
topped the lunarites leader by nearly
a foot

  by reason of the lunarites selec-
tion of sanderson it appeared that
the latter was to be accorded consid-
eration due a visiting dignitary de-
spite the fracas attending their recep-
tion lie was even now being attend-
ed as befitted a leader-so sketched
the busy resourceful artist

  well wouldnt that make your
grandmas chilblains ache mut-
tered donald

  more power to sanderson if it
proves a means of his protecting
beryl from these fiends don

  i guess you are right at that
phil agreed the other doubtfully
but concentrating once more on their
artist-interpreters picture-story

  however it appeared that the story
was at an end informing them that
he was to be their instructor in the
lunar tongue the artist turned and
addressed his leader evidently telling
him that his task of the moment was
completed the leader turned and
gave an order to two of his attendants
these got up quickly one disappear-
ing into the other room the other
passing outside

  almost at once the first attendant
reappeared with him was a girl

     beryl   cried philip striding to-
ward her

  but his path was barred at once
by several attendants

  oh phil she cried dropping
her hands back at her sides resignedly
as she looked at him with beseeching
eyes

  at a gesture from the leader she
sat down on the ground beside the
latter it was at this juncture that
sanderson accompaied by the other
attendant entered

  throwing a glance toward philip
and donald without attempting to
speak to them sanderson stalked over
to where beryl and the leader sat
bowing uncertainly before the latter
he smiled down on her neither spoke
however for the interpreter had come
forward again at a sign from his mas-
ter and now prepared to talk with
sanderson by means of his sketches

  a few minutes of this and sander-
son turned to philip

  phil he said they want me to
say to you that to me as chief of this
expedition they are assigning this
house with you and don as my fel-
low boarders guess theres no use
arguing the leadership point with
them for the present beryl is to
behind the moon



share the place with us she will have
the inner room

  its  k with me said philip
sounds too easy to be true but
well have to be on our guard for their
next move

  the lunarites next move how-
ever was not to come at once as
philip suspected there was a definite
reason behind this temporary change
in treatment by them and their own
apparent freedom what that reason
was and its ultimate climax was yet
to be revealed and that in startling
fashion

chapter 

during the days that followed-or
what the adventurers counted as
days by their watches and a system
of notches cut in a pole inside their
abode-their instruction in the lunar
tongue continued between these
group lessons they walked about the
subterranean domains of the lunarites
at will though never without a spe-
cial escort supplied by the leader
who they learned was known as sari

  that beryls appearance among the
lunar populace elicited nothing more
than a craning of scrawny necks now
and stealthy sidelong glances indi-
cated that the gray men were held in
leash through a fear engendered by
strict orders from their leader that
she be unmolested in any way

  the adventurers had learned to eat
the gray ones food after all this
was by reason of necessity since they
no longer had access to their own food
supply in the rocket permission to
return to it being politely but firmly
denied them the meager emergency
supply they had carried in condensed
form in their pockets soon had been
depleted the lunar menu while mo-
notonous and uninviting in appear-
ance proved to be not so bad after
all it consisted of various root-like
growths on the order of our own
rutabagas yams and such all grown

in these subterranean regions the

disconcerting characteristic of all
these was their almost uniformly gray
color their sole range in tint being
from a light grayish green to a deep
purplish gray for a beverage they
had their choice of a sulfurous water
or a heady wine prepared from one
of the various root foods they stuck
to the water evil-tasting though it
was they grew accustomed to it in
time even to the hard fiber pads that
did duty for beds on the unresisting
ground

  meantime they were finding out
much of interest about their captors
and their means of living they
learned for instance that except for
a comparatively short time following
the rising of the sun and a corre-
spondingly brief time immediately
prior to its setting the lunarites must
shun the outside of their globe be-
cause of the extreme cold that pre-
vailed during the long night but es-
pecially because of the extreme heat
during all but the very beginning and
ending of their equally long day in
this latitude and region at any rate

  as for the vegetation suggested
by the progressive shades within the
crater eratosthenes and other crater
beds as observed from the earth it was
learned that this growth was but that
of rank weedy things-like the scrub
of our own deserts the melting
snows and the periodical vapors did
indeed feed these growths but the
lunarites derived no nourishment
from them they did manage how-
ever under severe hardship to gather
hurriedly immediately after sunris
and just before sunset some of the
weedy growth for weaving the coarse
fabric that comprised the walls of
their abodes and with greater care
and skill they produced a refinement
of this fabric in somewhat softer
weaves for their meager drab gar-
ments

  thus sandersons botanical talents
had little chance for exercise-even


weird tales

had his activities of intrigue offered
that opportunity or inclination

  as a result of the extremes of heat
and cold the lunarites had been
forced to perfect many ingenious de-
vices for existing underground one
of these was the mysteriously con-
trolled electric energy with which
they were able to charge the air
throughout their principal domains
which caused it to glow with the soft
light philip had first observed upon
entering the vast main cavern that
formed the largest single chamber of
these creatures domains though this
huge chamber or cavern they learned
was but one of the many immense ex-
tinct craters that honeycombed the
moons crust these caverns had been
cleared enlarged and linked together
by previous generations

  for machinery and such devices as
the outlet caps at the moons surface
the lunarites used a strange dark plas-
tic substance mined from the deeper
regions and which set to iron-like
hardness when long exposed to the air

  incidentally being well below the
surface the air ia these caverns was
denser than in the rare atmospheric
pressure above therefore it provided
more normal breathing conditions

  among the things that philip most
desired to learn was the purpose of
certain chambers with huge doors that
always remained locked other parts
of these queer domains were open to
the adventurers inspection caverns
containing strange machinery and de-
vices that had to do with the artesian
water supply lighting heat from
vast volcanic depths and so on but
the story behind those ever-bolted
gray doors intrigued philip to his
queries of their interpreter and teach-
er he had obtained but vague replies
this but whetted his curiosity the
more

  there is something beyond those
doors that they have good reason to
conceal from us   he confided to don-
ald

  philip had eaiefully refrained from
discussing anything in beryls hear-
ing that might alarm her and he
and donald had tacitly come to a con-
sidering of these things independently
of sanderson who seemed more inter-
ested in his own prestige with the
lunar dignitaries and in beryl than
in their general welfare and future

  yes and your humble star-dust
twin intends to plumb the dark mys-
tery of those dens or bust pro-
claimed the other

  but how is the question said
philip something tells me that if
we fail to discover their secret before
long none of us may ever have an
opportunity i have a hunch that- 

  cheese it-old eggplant is nigh
warned donald nudging philip as the
figure of azan the interpreter ap-
peared in the doorway of their abode
this caution was not altogether amiss
for azan had in teaching them the
lunar tongue learned much about
their own they could no longer talk
within his acute hearing without re-
serve

  voja-greetings my friends he
squeaked rolling his over-large gourd-
like head grotesquely from side to
side in the lunar fashion of salaam
it is time for our talk again but
already you have learned most of
what i can teach you-you and the
magnificent taller one and his lovely
ward they are-

  here i am azan interrupted
sanderson entering at that moment

  azan wriggled convulsively in
greeting to sandersons six feet plus
while donald and philip looked on
amusedly albeit with a liberal sprink-
ling of sarcasm on the part of the
former

  and the beautiful maiden pur-
sued the lunarite will she be here
presently his wall-eyes gleamed
like those of an octopus

  she sends her excuses azan
said sanderson with a proprietary air
that made philip wonder all at once
behind the moon



why he had ever chosen this man for
a companion on their weird journey
of late sandersons monopoly of
beryls time and attention had begun
to wear  his nerves sharply

  she does not care to listen to mere
words today philip put in firmly
nor do we

  azan looked from him to sander-
son then back again with puzzled
stare philips manner evidently im-
pressed him for he favored him with
careful attention then as for philip
he had suddenly decided that it was
time he had asserted himself and halt-
ed all this foolish parleying which
was getting them nowhere

  harken to me azan he went
on we have been here thirty-five
days and nights-as we reckon them
in our own world more than a day
and a night of yours beryl-the
maiden-needs sunlight open air we
all do we can not live in artificial
light indefinitely as you-can or on the
food that nourishes you tell your
leader this sari that we must get
back to our space-machine that we
must send a message to our planet to
tell them we are safe else others in
countless other machines will follow
us here he might as well make it
strong he would be doubted but the
lunarites could not know for certain
whether he lied it was not beyond
the bounds of lunar imagination that
the friends of these earth-heings might
follow in similar conveyances to
avenge any harm done them

  i will go to tell him my friends
wagged the gray one backing out pre-
cipitately this unexpectedly brusk
reception and philips disturbing
statements had shaken him and upset
his ideas badly

sanderson had looked  in silence
as azan disappeared however he
found his tongue

  now youve done it he growled
why couldnt you have been patient
a little longer jealous because these

people want to treat me like the boss

youll-

  aw give your tonsils a rest
donald interjected there are things
ill bet you havent even guessed
about our little social spell here
thanks to your heavy interest in liv-
ing up to the head-man part our
wriggly visitor who just went out let
slip hints of some queer things once
or twice when you werent present-
things that id say dont make the
outlook exactly attractive from
beryls standpoint

 for instance-

  for instance these squashes are a
hybrid race

  i knew that

  all right maybe you also knew
that their average life span is about
seven years

  seven years why how can they
possibly learn to accomplish the things
they do in so short a time besides

what has that to do-

  just this-oh cripes you tell
him phil im no good at wedging
facts into a wooden head

  its like this john philip ex-
plained first if these beings live
but seven years they must mature
from eight to ten times as rapidly as
we and they learn and do according-
ly out of necessity as well as by in-
stinct besides everything they do is
simplified to the nth degree-not a
single non-essential move  consider-
ation of any kind is countenanced
their language even consists of but
a scant two or three hundred
elemental syllables

  now about the other things
youve noticed of course the pecu-
liar characteristic of their arms and
hands particularly the latter

  like growing things-thick grape-
vines for instance with tendrils at
the end

  youve got the idea and their
legs-shapeless and straight like sap-
lings

 you mean-


weird tales

  -that i believe these creatures

represent a phenomenon totally dif-
ferent from anything we have ever
imagined in our earthly scheme of
animal life they evidently are a liv-
ing breathing and thinking combina-
tion of plant and animal life heaven
knows just how they reproduce but
there is their unique command of at-
mospheric electrical energy - and
those novel growing-beds with that
energy intensified over them im
practically certain now that those cu-
rious shapes were what i glimpsed in
the dim shadows when i regained con-
sciousness in that long chamber they

were not toadstools but-

  god you cant believe that hu-
man beings may be spawned and
grown like-like mushrooms

  i think it possible-in view of
what we observed and with informa-
tion this azan has let slip evidently
too like the common house-fly these
beings reach practically full growth
at the outset which would explain
why we have seen no children

    however what is of vital concern
to us a hellish obsession seems to have
taken hold of them that beryl-you
remember their instinctive and spon-
taneous reaction to her attraction
when she and you stepped out of the
rocket an instinct that has been
held in check since solely by rigid or-
ders from their leader

  why the sam hill couldnt you
have stayed inside a little longer that
time put in donald scowling at
sanderson in anything but a minis-
terial manner the sight of a
woman simply set that mob wild
yes i remember defiantly
what of it

  just this azan has hinted that
the lunarites believe beryl holds the
key to their own release from a strict-
ly tabloid existence-bound by roots
and soil in her presence they scent
some mad possibility not only of in-
creasing their lifes span to some-
thing approaching our own but a

chance to rise above the soil as a fac-
tor in their creation and their hellish
minds have conceived a plan   
nov do you begin to understand the
fate that hovers over her while we
dawdle here

  all three were silent for a time
even sanderson seemed to forget his
egoism in contemplation of the fiend-
ishness of this plan of the creatures
who held them all in their power

  two thoughts were paramount in
philips mind that beryl be kept in
ignorance of this thing and that they
must make a bold move to get her be-
yond the clutches of these fiends how
to achieve the latter was the question
as yet he could think of no practical
plan but he would he must

  all at once he realized that this
girl was more precious to him than
his life-than anything that he loved
her madly strange how love struck
that way-like a bolt of lightning in-
congruously a humorous saying came
to him-something he had heard yeais
ago in a stage farce love grows
and grows-like a vegetable that
was it his love for beryl had been
just growing and growing quietly
unnoticed almost like-a vegetable
and now it had developed with dis-
concerting completeness and abrupt-
ness into unmistakable maturity nur-
tured by the dew of imminent danger

  hitherto he had been conscious only
of a warm liking for beryl attended
by a feeling of jealousy which he had
mentally branded as a foolish unwar-
ranted condition over her tolerance of
sandersons attentions but a full
realization of this terrible danger that
threatened her now had fired his
blood had suddenly fanned that dor-
mant passion of love for her into full
blaze the thought of beryl at the
mercy of these madmen these crea-
tures half of animal half of vegetable
kingdoms made him berserk some-
how some way he must save her he
cursed the feeling of impotence their
situation forced upon him if only
behind the moon



he could conceive a plan any plan
that had even a one-in-a-hundred
chance of success

in his absorption by this problem he
failed to notice sandersons depar-
ture and donalds leaving directly
afterward when he did look up again
with seeing eyes it was to find beryl
contemplating him from the doorway
of her room

  a penny fer them thoughts she
remarked impishly

  that would be over-pricing
them   he answered dully getting up
if i got a genuine idea right now
id be surprized into fits

  as bad as that my but we are
downcast today  paradoxically she
seemed in unusually fine spirits

    please try not to mind my grouch
beryl he said smiling with an ef-
fort he must not let her suspect that
dread danger which hung over her
how beautiful she was that her
loveliness should even be gazed upon
by these half-human monstrosities
maddened him

  she moved toward him came close
and placed a hand on his arm the
nearness of her made his senses reel

  why-you are trembling phil
she said surprized and concerned
are you ill

  he patted her hand reassuringly

  not ill just a passing wave of
vertigo-probably a bit of biliousness
from the long diet of strange food
he lied

  you must not let yourself get
sick she said solicitously after
all we are selfishly depending upon
you for guidance in our predic-
ament she looked up at him with
dazzling trustfulness

  thats just it beryl he groaned
and im a dud i cant forgive my-
self for having brought you along on
this mad adventure

  you had little to do with that i
foiced myself into this expedition for
adventure excitement so i have my-

self to blame-if anyone is to blame
as it is i am satisfied were all in
it together now and together well
find a way out

  she smiled bravely

  youre a brick beryl he said
curbing an impulse to sweep her into
his arms to press her soft pliant body
against him and rain kisses upon those
dear eyes those already-paling but
still-beautiful cheeks those alluring
lips whose rosiness had not yet suc-
cumbed to the lack of sunshine she
swayed against him lightly perhaps
herself a little weak from the enforced
confinement or perhaps impelled by a
force akin to that which he felt the
next moment he was doing the very
things he had been fighting so hard
against

  after a time he released her reluc-
tantly determinedly

 im sorry beryl he began
lamely then no im damned if
i am im glad-glad

  he swept her once more into his
arms and their lips met again as he
held her in a long embrace as if fear-
ful to let her go amidst the dangers
that surrounded them and this time
she returned his kisses

  im glad too phil she whis-
pered a little breathlessly and oh
so happy

  happiness now ah the irony of
things that they should find each
others love at such a time-on the
verge of being separated by one of the
most dreadful schemes ever conceived
by living and thinking beings

  well they should not have her
alive he reached for the automatic
which he had contrived to keep de-
spite the lunarites search

  promise me you will keep this
with you always dear he said in
case of-emergency

  but she handed it back to him

  i have already thought of that 
i carry my own-have ever since we
left mother earth

  good girl he approved putting


weird tales

ms own weapon back into the holster
inside his shirt he had thought to
strap that extra gun next the calf of
his leg before leaving the rocket and
the lunarites had missed it there in
their search but they had not
searched beryls person as they had
his there were two guns in the party
anyway why dame fortune was
actually smiling upon them after all

  he began to take heart with the
knowledge that beryl loved him he
felt at once confidence-and at the
same time more than ever disconcerted
-by the dangers they faced for
now she was more precious than ever
to him

  a sound of running outside startled
him into consciousness again of their
immediate situation

in the valley

  by bertrande harry snell

           i have seen the valley of gibbering men

           down where the soulless dwell

           in the viscous sludge of their fog-damned fen
           a horror-haunted hell

           i have heard the groans of the gruesome ghosts
           that paddle about in the slime

          and watched the dance of the hoary hosts

           in their palsied pantomime

           the rheum-ribbed rocks of the valley walls

          where the green ghoul grasses grow

           hold a horrible lure for the one who falls
           into the pit below

           he gazes up at their slimy sides

           as he lies in his loathsome den

          and he knows that here he forever bides
          in the valley of gibbering men

           hopeless and stricken and rotting they lie

          damned to eternitys end

           retching and wretched they long to die

          cursing the eons they spend
          down in the depths where the vermin crawl

         far from humanitys ken-

   they shudder and shriek when the black gods call

          in the valley of gibbering men
out of the ground it rose like an evil jinnee

they who lived during that
terrible time will never forget
it-twenty-five years ago when
the lights went out

  the youth of today can hardly
realize what a terrible disaster that
was for the people of the middle
twentieth century england and
america as well as the major iia-

electrifying their railroads and scrap-

which did duty on some lines up until

as late as the summer of  a

nomically undesirable the new meth-
od by which it was possible to relay
heat for all purposes at one-third the
cost of illuminating gas swept the
various gas companies into oblivion
even the steamers which plied the
seven seas and the giant planes that
soared the air received the power
that turned their propellers warmed
their cabins and cooked their foods
in much the same fashion as did the
factories the railroads and the pri-
vate homes and the hotels ashore
therefore when electricity ceased to
drive the machines the world stopped
telegraph telephone and wireless
communication ceased country was
cut off from country city from city
and neighborhood from neighborhood
automobiles broke down street-cars
and electric trains refused to run
powerhouses were put out of commis-
sion and at night save for the flick-
ering light of what lanterns candles
and oil lamps could be resurrected
cities towns and hamlets were
smothered in darkness

  i have before me the records of that
time it was ten and eleven oclock
in london paris berlin and other
continental cities when it happened
restaurants theaters hospitals and
private homes were plunged into
darkness mighty thoroughfares that
a moment before had glittered and
glowed with thousands of lights and
wheeling signs became gloomy can-
yons where people at first paused
questioned and later plunged through
in terrified clamor various men who
later wrote their impressions for
newspapers and magazines say that
the thing which shook their nerves
the most was the sudden silence which
prevailed when all traffic ceased-
that and five minutes later the mad-
dened cries and groans and curses of
men and women fighting like wild
beasts to escape from crowded res-
taurants and theaters

  people coursed through the streets
shouting to one another that the
power-houses had been blown up that

an earthquake had shaken them down
the most absurd statements were
made tossed from mouth to mouth
and added to the general bewilder-
ment and panic on the street cor-
ners religious fanatics suddenly
sprang up proclaiming that the end
of the world had come and that the
sinners had better repent of their
sins before it was too late in the
hospitals nurses and doctors found
themselves working under a frightful
handicap gruesome tales are told of
doctors caught in the midst of emer-
gency operations because of the
darkness it was impossible properly to
attend the sick whenever available
candles oil lamps and lanterns were
pressed into service but there were
pitifully few of these to be had and
nowhere to turn for more telephone
wires were dead and automobiles
cars and busses stalled to add to the
horror fire broke out in various
places there was no way of ringing in
an alarm about them and the fire ap-
paratus could not have responded if
there had been so the fires spread
and the people of those neighbor-
hoods where the flames leapt to
heaven at last had light-the light of
their burning homes

  and then in the midst of all this
horror and tumult the denizens of the
dark festering spots of the city crept
forth they swarmed from the filthy
alleys and from the dives of the
professional criminal furtive-eyed
predatory and houses were robbed
men killed and women assaulted the
police were powerless to act their
mobility was gone burglar alarms
did not warn and the city lay like a
giant samson shorn of its strength

  so that night passed not for one
city alone but for hundreds of cities



xhile all this was happening in

v	 the old world chaos gripped the

cities of the united states and can-
ada and as far west as montreal and
chicago the wheels stopped going at
that hour when the workers began
to pour forth from the factories and
shops and when the late shopping
crowds were thronging the trains and
the subways on the surface cars and
on the streets there was of course
 immediate alarm moving-picture
and vaudeville houses opened wide
their doors raised the blinds on their
windows and evacuated their patrons
in good order but underground in
the various tubes and subways it was
a different matter hundreds of cars
bearing thousands of passengers were
stalled in stifling blackness guards
labored heroically to still the rising
hysteria and panic for perhaps
fifteen or twenty minutes-in some
cases as long as half an hour-they
managed to maintain a species of
order but the great pumps and fans
that usually circulated fresh air
through the tunnels were no longer
functioning when the foul air
fogged the lungs the passengers went
mad sobbing and cursing and pray-
ing they fought to escape from the
cars as at the same moment the peo-
ple of berlin paris and london wrere
fighting to escape from restaurants
and theaters they smashed the win-
dows of the coaches and in wriggling
through them impaled the flesh of
their bodies their hands and faces
on jagged slivers of glass they
trampled each other under foot and
flowed in terrified mobs along the
right of way searching madly for
exits in new york alone ten thou-
sand of them perished they bled to
death were crushed or died of heart-
failure and suffocation

  above ground the streets and av-
enues were thronged with millions of
human beings trying to get home on
foot for hours dense crowds of work-
ers shoppers and businessmen filled
the highways and byways here again
panic was caused by the crashing
planes in montreal the royal

dominion air liner edward vii en
route on a non-stop flight from hali-
fax to vancouver with four hundred
passengers fell from a height of three
thousand feet onto windsor station
killing her own passengers and crew
and blotting out the lives of hundreds
of people who were in the station at
the time in new york boston and
chicago where the then new mag-
netic runabouts were making their
initial appearance hundreds of air-
planes plunged to the ground killing
and maiming not only their passen-
gers but the men women and chil-
dren on whom they fell it was
states an eye-witness in a book he
later wrote called the great debacle
a sight fit to appall the stoutest
heart subway exits were disgorging
ghastly mobs of clawing people a
crashing plane had turned a near-by
street into a shambles crowds ran
this way and that shrieking praying
everywhere was panic

  panic indeed yet the records show
that what they could do the police
and fire departments did mounted
policemen were utilized to carry can-
dles and oil lamps to hospitals to
scour the countryside for every avail-
able horse and to ride through the
city in an effort to calm the people
firemen were marched to various
points of vantage with axes and
chemical containers to combat any
fire that might break out but in the
aggregate these precautions amounted
to nothing whole hospitals passed
the night in darkness patients died
by the hundreds the flames of myriad
fires lit up the sky and rumors ran
from mouth to mouth adding to the
terror and chaos

  america screamed the mobs was
being attacked by a foreign power
maybe japan the power-houses had
been rendered useless by a powerful
magnet there had been a terrible
storm down south all south america
was sinking north america would
go next no one knew anything
everyone knew something nothing


weird tales

was too wild or absurd for millions to
believe deprived of their accustomed
sources of information the inhabi-
tants became a prey to their own fan-
cies and the disordered fancies of
others religious fanatics by the
light of huge bonfires preached the
second coming of christ and the de-
struction of the world thousands of
hysterical people prostrated them-
selves on the hard street pavements
babbling weeping praying thou-
sands of others looted wine and
strong drinks from the cellars of
hotels and cafes and reeled drunken
through the streets adding to the din
and the panic nor did daylight bring
much relief

  for some obscure reason all over
europe asia and america during
the hours of daylight the sky was
strangely dulled seemingly the sun
shone with all its usual splendor but
the air was perceptibly darkened
why this should be so not even the
scientists could tell yet even under
the light of what millions of people
on earth believed to be their last day
human wolves came out of their dens
and prowled through the cities sack-
ing stores and private homes blowing
open safes and killing and robbing
with impunity the day that suc-
ceeded the night was more horrible
than the night that preceded the day
because hundreds of thousands of peo-
ple who had slept through the hours
of darkness awoke and joined their
fellows on the streets and because
there is something teirible about a
big city in which no cars run and no
factory whistles blow in which the
machine has died

  and while the cities and the in-
habitants thereof were given over to
madness and destruction tragedy
took its toll of the skies and stalked
the seas the aircraft of the world
were virtually wiped out only those
escaped which were at rest in their
hangars or which by some miracle of
navigation glided safely to earth
hardly a year passes now but that on

some wild mountain peak or in a
gloomy canyon or the heart of the
sahara fragments of those airships
are found nor did ocean-going ves-
sels suffer less in the space of twenty
hours two thousand ships of all
classes and tonnage met with disaster
-disaster that ultimately wiped out
the great firm of lloyds in london
and a host of lesser insurance com-
panies fifteen hundred steamers
vanished never to be heard of more
thirty-five of these being giant pas-
senger boats carrying upward of
twenty thousand passengers of the
other five hundred ships some wrere
dashed to pieces on inhospitable
coasts others drifted ashore and broke
up and the remainder were aban-
doned at sea the fate of the miss-
ing steamers may be partly inferred
from what happened to the olympia
and the orania this is taken from
the account of the second officer of the
former ship

  the night was clear and starry a
heavy sea running we were forging
full speed ahead about two hundred
miles off the irish coast because of
our electrically controlled gyroscope
however the ship was as steady as a
rock a dance was being given in
both the first and second class ball-
rooms the music for them being sup-
plied by the metropolitan dance or-
chestra of london in the third class
theater a television moving-picture
was being shown couples were walk-
ing or sitting on the promenade
decks as though a stiff breeze was
blowing the night was warm from
the bridge i could see the omnia
coming toward us she made a won-
derful sight her port-holes gleaming
tier on tier and her deck lights glow-
ing and winking for all the world
looking like a giant glowworm or a
fabulous trireme doubtless to watch-
ers on her bridge and decks we pre-
sented the same glorious sight because
we were sister ships belonging to the
same line and of the same build and
tonnage all the time she was coming
tiie dancer in the crystal



up i conversed with the first officer
on her bridge by means of our wire-
less phone and it was while in the
midst of this conversation and while
we were still a mile apart and he
was preparing so he said to have
the wheel put over so as to take the
omnia to starboard of us that with-
out warning her lights went out

  hardly crediting my eyes i stared
at the spot where a moment before
she had been what is the matter
with you i called through my
phone but there was no answer and
even as i realized that the phone had
gone dead i was overcome with the
knowledge that my own ship was
plunged in darkness the decks be-
neath me were black i could hear
the voices of passengers calling out
some in jest and others in rising
alarm questioning what had hap-
pened i cant get the engine room
the ship doesnt answer her helm i
said facing the captain who had
clambered to the bridge quick mr
crowley he cried down with you
and turn out the crew put men at
every cabin door and stairway and
keep the passengers off the decks
his voice thundered into the micro-
phone which repeated his words
through loud-speaking devices in
every saloon cabin and on every
deck of the ship-or should have so
repeated them if the instruments had
been functioning there is no need
for alarm a little trouble to the
engines and incidentally to the dyna-
mos has caused the lights to go out
i beg of you to be calm in a half-
hour everything will be fixed but
even as i rushed to obey his orders
even as his crisp voice rang out on
the night air i saw the enormous
dark bulk bearing down on us and
the heart leapt in my throat it was
the orania helpless without guid-
ance as were we ourselves rushing
ahead under the momentum acquired
by her now stilled engines

  she struck us bow on to one side
shearing through steel plates as if

they were so much cheese at that
terrific impact in the dark and the
gloom all order and discipline were
swept away something had hap-
pened to the gyroscopes and the
ships were pitching and tossing
grinding and crashing against each
other our own ship settling by the
head the stem rising

  then ensued a terrible time the
night became hideous with the clamor
of terrified voices maddened passen-
gers fought their ways to the decks
and to the boats crowded boats went
down into the surging waves bow on
or stern first spilling their human
freight into the sea hundreds of
passengers believing that the steam-
ers would at any moment sink leapt
overboard with life-preservers and in
nearly all eases were drowned all
this in the first thirty minutes after
that the panic ebbed it turned into
dull despair the crews of both
steamers what could be rallied of
them began to control the situation

  morning found the orania prac-
tically intact only making water in
her no  compartment the olympia
forward compartments were all
flooded taking her down at the head
but the rear eight still held intact
and as long as they did so she could
not sink if the passengers had from
the beginning remained calm and
tractable hardly a life need have
been lost

  the second officer of the olympia
goes on to point out that both the
giant liners had been thoroughly
equipped with the most modem of
electro-mechanical devices for use
in emergencies that they carried
twin power-receiving engines that
they were electrically steered and
that from the pilot-house and the
bridge communication could be had
and orders and instructions given to
crew and passengers in every part of
the ships it was he points out the
sudden and startling going out of the
lights and the totally unexpected
breakdown of all machinery which


weird tales

precipitated the tragedy and not any
negligence on the part of the officers
and the crews

  such is the story of one marine
disaster but the records are full of
similar accounts hundreds of them
which it is needless to set down here



on the pacific coast especially in
the cities of los angeles and san
francisco better order was main-
tained than in the big cities of the
middle west and the east panic
there was loss of life and damage to
property both from fire and theft
but not on so colossal a scale this
was due to the fact that the author-
ities had several hours of daylight in
which to prepare for darkness and be-
cause in the two cities mentioned
there were no subways to speak of in
the downtown districts clerks and
businessmen were advised to stick to
their offices and stores policemen
mounted and afoot were sent to the
residential districts and to the fac-
tories instead of allowing the work-
ers to scatter they formed them into
groups of twenty deputized anned
and as nearly as possible set to
patrolling the streets of the neighbor-
hoods in which they lived these
prompt measures did much to avert
the worst features of the horrors
which swept new york and chicago
and the cities of europe and asia
but in spite of them the hospitals
knew untold suffering whole city
blocks were destroyed by flames
religious frenzy ran high and mil-
lions of people passed the hours of
darkness in fear and trembling

  i wras twenty-two at that time liv-
ing in altadena which is a suburb
of pasadena about twenty miles from
los angeles and trying to write
that morning i had taken a book and
a lunch and climbed up the old pole
road to the top of mount echo in-
tending to return by the cable car
which for years has operated from the

purple depths of rubio canyon to
the towrering peak i reached the top
of the mountain after a steep climb
ate my lunch on the site of the old
lowe observatory and then became
absorbed in my book

  the first inkling i had that some-
thing was wrong was when the light
darkened its clouding over i
thought looking up but the sky over-
head wras perfectly clear the sun
particularly bright

  not a little disturbed in mind and
thinking i must admit of earth-
quakes i strolled over to where a
group of mexican section workers
under the supervision of a white boss
had been doing some track repairing
the mexicans were gesticulating and
pointing to the cities and the country-
side rolling away far beneath us now
usually on a clear sunny day there
is a haze in the valley and one can
not see for very many miles in any
direction but on this day there was
an unwonted clarity in the air every-
thing on which wre gazed was sharply
etched-no blurring no fogging of
lines the houses stood out starldy
so did the spires of churches and the
domes of public buildings though
it was miles away to the westward the
mighty tower of the los angeles city
hall could be plainly seen the light
had darkened yes but the effect was
that of gazing through slightly tinted
glasses

  what do you think it means i
asked the track boss but before he
could make a reply a mexican cried
out volubly pointing one shaking
hand up the steep ridge which rose
behind us and crossing himself rapid-
ly with the other

  it was an awe-inspiring sight on
which we gazed over mount lowe a
luminous dancing light was growing
i did not know it then but as far
east as denver and omaha and as far
south as st louis and galveston men
saw that light seen from the western
cities of calgary and edmonton in
canada it was a pillar of blue flame
the dancer in the crystal



growing out of the earth and as the
hours passed mounting higher and
higher into the heavens millions of
eyes from all over the united states
and the dominion fearfully and
superstitiously turned toward that
glow as night deepened upon the
pacific coast the inhabitants of south-
ern california saw the sky to the
north of thorn cloven asunder by a
leaping sword no wonder millions
of people thought that the heavens
had opened and christ was coming

  but before night i had descended
the steep slope of mount echo and
walked the trackway into altadena
women and men called to me from
doorways and wanted to know if there
was a forest fire farther back in the
hills i could give them no answer
on lake avenue i saw the automo-
biles street-cars and motor-busses
stranded

  what is the matter i asked a
conductor

  i dont know he said there
isnt any power they say all the
power plants and machinery have
stopped a man rode through from
downtown a few minutes ago and
told us so

  i walked on into pasadena every-
thing was tied up the streets were
jammed with cars and people owing
to the state ordinance which made it
a penal offense for planes to fly over
any californian city-the air routes
were so arranged and the landing-
stations and fields outside the cities
access to them being had by fast
electric trains-the horror of airships
falling on crowded city streets and on
residences was entirely averted peo-
ple spoke however of having seen a
huge air liner and some smaller pleas-
ure planes plunging to earth to the
west of them turning over and over
and afterward i learned that the new
york-los angeles special which had
just taken the air had crashed into
an orchard with a terrible loss of life

  i went no farther than madison
street on colorado boulevard and

turned back it was ominous to look
from the windows and porches of the
big house that night and see the city
black and formless beneath us usual-
ly the horizon to the west and south
was illuminated for thirty miles
around now save for the dull glare
of several fires the darkness was un-
broken

  everything that happened that
night is printed indelibly on my mem-
ory far off like the sound of surf
beating on a rocky shore we could
hear the voice of the mob it rose and
fell rose and fell and once we
heard the crackle of what we took to
be machine-gun fire in the flintridge
district i heard later houses were
sacked and looted some men de-
fending their homes were murdered
and several women badly treated
but in altadena up in the foothills
no one suffered any violence only
once were we alarmed by a procession
marching up lake avenue bearing
torches and chanting hymns it was
a body of religious fanatics holy
rollers men women and children
on their way to mount wilson the
better to wait the advent of jesus
we could hear them shouting and
singing and in the flickering light of
the torches see them frothing at the
mouth they went by and after that
save for a patrol from the sheriffs
office we saw no one until morning

  dawn came but if anything the
tension and terror grew greater all
night the threatening simitar of light
over the mountains had grown taller
and taller-one could see it literally
growing-and the sinister brightness
of it radiated like molten steel nor
did the coming of daylight dim its
radiance

  none of us had slept during the
night none of us had thought of
sleep haggard-faced we greeted the
dawn and with despair in our hearts
realized that the light of day was per-
ceptibly dimmer than it had been the
day before could this actually be
the end of the world were those


weird tales

poor fanatics who had gone by in the
night right and were the heavens
opening as they said these and
more were the thoughts that ran
through my mind then-came the
end

  it was  p m in london  p m
in new york and  oclock a m on
the coast when it happened millions
of people saw the pillar of light
waver for one pregnant moment it
grew red-hot with the crimson red-
ness of heated iron from its lofty
summit jagged forks of lightning
leapt across the heavens and blinded
the sight of those that watched then
it vanished was gone and a few min-
utes after its going the street lights
came on the day brightened tele-
phone bells rang wheels turned and
the twenty or so hours of terror and
anarchy were ended



xhat had been the cause of it all

v	  v one knew learned men puz-
zled their heads over the problem
scientists were baffled for an ad-
equate answer many explanations
were advanced of course but none of
them hold water for a while there
was a tendency on the part of various
governments to suspect one another
of having invented and utilized a
fiendish machine for the undoing of
rival nations however this suspicion
was speedily dropped when it was
realized how world-wide had been the
nature of the disaster dr lemont of
the paris astronomical league ad-
vanced the theory that the spots on
the sun had something to do with the
phenomenon doolittle of the royal
academy of science in london was
of the opinion that the cosmic ray
discovered by millikan in  was
responsible while others not so
highly placed in the world of science
as these two outstanding celebrities
suggested anything from a dark com-
et a falling meteor to disturbances
in the magnetic centers of the earth

the encyclopedia britannica for
 twenty-one years after the dis-
aster which nearly wrecked civiliza-
tion and perhaps the world quotes
the above theories in detail and many
more besides but winds up with the
assertion that nothing authentic as to
the cause of the tragedy of  has
ever been forthcoming this assertion
is not true in the fall of  there
was placed before the royal academy
of science in canada evidence as to
the origin of the great catastrophe
sufficient to call forth an extended in-
vestigation on the part of that body

  though eighteen years have passed
since then the results of that in-
vestigation have never been made pub-
lic i will not speculate as to the
reason for that in the interim a re-
port was made of the matter to the
smithsonian institution in washing-
ton to the royal academy of science
in london and to the paris astro-
nomical league in france-a report
which these learned bodies chose to
ignore and what was the evidence
the royal academy of science in can-
ada investigated

  as i have already stated i was in
california in  and lived through
one phase of the great disaster three
years later-in the summer of 
-having broken into the pages of
some of the better class magazines
with my stories i made a trip to west-
ern canada for the purpose of writing
a series of stories for a western jour-
nal it was there miles from any city
and in the foothills of the rockies
that i met and listened to the story
of the dying recluse he was a young
man i judged not a whit older than
myself but in the last stages of con-
sumption

  i came upon the ranch-house-a
four-room cabin made of split logs and
undressed stone-after a hard days
ride i pitched my tent on the banks
of a tumbling mountain stream about
a quarter of a mile from the house
and gladly accepted the invitation of
the comely young mistress of the place
the dancer in the crystal



to take dinner with them that eve-
ning she was i gleaned the sick
mans sister her husband now ab-
sent rounding rip cattle was proving
up on an adjoining quarter section
having already done so on two others
in his wifes and brother-in-laws
names

  after dinner i sat on the wide ver-
anda with the sick man whose sleep-
ing-porch i surmised it was talking
with him and smoking my pipe

  visitors are raro- out this way
he said and an educated man a
godsend  

  i was surprized to find him a man
of no little education himself

  you went to college i hazarded

  yes mcgill i took my b a
and after that two years of medi-
cine

  over the plains the sun had sunk
in red splendor below the horizon and
the sky was on fire with its reflected
glory nearer in i saw a ragged
black splotch on the billowing earth
burnt-looking charred

  a prairie fire i not so much
questioned as stated

  the invalid propped up on his
couch followed my finger with his
cavernous black eyes

 no he said no that is
where it-was

  it i queried

  yes he replied what the pa-
pers called the pillar of fire

  then i remembered of course the
burnt splotch was the place where the
terrible luminous glow the cleaving
sword i had seen over mount lowe
bad had its source i stared fasci-
nated

  nothing said the man on the
couch will grow there-since then
the soil has no life in it-no life it
is he said faintly like ashes-
black ashes

  silence fell between us for many
minutes the shadows lengthened
and the twilight deepened it was
mournful sitting there in the growing
gloom and i felt relieved when the

woman turned on the light in the sit-
ting-room and its cheerful rays flood-
ed through the open windows and the
doorway finally the invalid said
i was here at the time my sis-
ter and her husband were absent on
a visit to his folks in calgary

  it must have been a stupendous
sight i remarked for want of a bet-
ter thing to say

  it was hell he said thats
how i got this tapping himself on
the chest and bringing on a fit of
coughing the air he gasped
it was hard on the lungs

  his sister came out and gave him
some medicine from a black bottle

  you mustnt talk so much peter
it isnt good for you she admon-
ished

  he waved an impatient hand let
be he said let be what differ-
ence does it make in another day

another wyeek-

  his voice trailed away and then
picked up again on a new sentence

  oh dont pity me dont waste
your pity on the likes of me if ever
a wretch deserved his fate i deserve
mine three years now ive suffered
the tortures of the damned not of
flesh alone but of mind when i
could still walk about it wasnt so
bad but since ive been chained to
this bed ive done nothing but think
think  i think of the great
disaster of the hours of terror and
despair known by millions of people
i think of the thousands and thou-
sands of men womei and children
trapped in subways and theaters
trampled to death butchered mur-
dered i visualize the hospitals full
of the sick and the dying the giant
liners of the air and of the ocean
crashing colliding going down into
the sea and i seem to hear the
screams and the pitiful prayers for
help of the maddened passengers
tell me what fate should befall the
fiend who would loose such wo and
misery on an unsuspecting world
there there i said soothingly


weird tales

thinking him delirious judging his
mind unhinged from too much mor-
bid brooding it was frightful of
course but no one could help what
happened-no one

  but my words did not calm him on
the contrary they added to his excite-
ment that isnt true he gasped
it isnt true no no sister i wont
be still im not raving give me a
drop of brandy-so and bring me the
little cedar box from the cupboard
over there

  she complied with his request
its all written down and put
away in here he said tapping the
box put away in here along with
the third crystal which came home
in the saddle-bag of johns runaway
horse  

  his eyes were like two black coals
fastened on my face

  ive told no one he said tensely
but i cant keep silent any longer
i must speak i must  

  one of his feverish hands gripped
my own dont you understand
he cried im the fiend who caused
the great world disaster god help
me i and one other

  no no he said correctly read-
ing the look on my face im not
crazy im not raving it is gods
truth im telling you and the evi-
dence of it is in this cedar box it
began in montreal when i was going
to mcgill university the under-
professor of physics there was a
young french-canadian by the name

of john cabot he-

  a fit of coughing stopped his voice
his sister gave him a sip of water
peter she pleaded let it go for

tonight tomorrow-

  but he shook his head i may be
dead tomorrow let me talk now
his eyes sought mine did you
ever hear about the meteorite that fell
back in manitoba in 

 no

  nor about the seven crystals that
were found in it

  i dont uemember

  well they were found he said
  seven of them as large as grapefruit
theres nothing remarkable about
finding crystals in a meteorite that
has been done before and since but
those seven crystals were not ordi-
nary ones they were perfectly round-
ed and polished as if by hand nor
was that all at the core of each of
them was a vibrant fluid and in that

fluid was a black spot-

  a spasm of coughing choked his ut-
terance and this time i joined with
his sister in urging him to rest but
desisted when i saw that such ad-
vice and any effort on my part to
withdraw only succeeded in adding
to his painful excitement

  a black spot he gasped that
danced and whirled and was never
still dont try to stop me i must
tell you about it the scientists of
the world were all agog over them
where they asked had the meteor
come from and what were the fluid
and the spot at the center of each
crystal in the course of time
the crystals were sent various places
for observation and study one
went to england another to france
two to washington while the remain-
ing three stayed in canada finally
coming to rest in the museum of nat-
ural science in montreal which as
everyone knows was erected in 
and is now under the jurisdiction of
mcgill university

tt was during my first year at
medical school that i entered the
museum one afternoon almost by ac-
cident the sight of the crystals
newly exhibited fascinated me i
could hardly tear myself away in time
for a lecture

  the next afternoon i came again
i watched the black spots dancing in
their vibrant fluid sometimes they
would whirl in the center of the liquid
with monotonous regularity then
suddenly they would dash at the walls
which held them in and circle them
with inconceivable speed was it y
the dancer in the crystal



imagination or did the specks take on
shape or form were they prisoners
forever beating their heads against
the bars of a cell seeking to be free
engrossed in such thoughts i did not
know that another had entered the
museum until a voice addressed me

   so you have come under their
spell too ross 

    i looked up with a start and recog-
nized john cabot we knew each
other of course because i had stud-
ied under him for two years

   they look so life-like sir i re-
plied  havent you noticed it  

   perhaps he said quietly they
are life

  the thought stirred my imagina-
tion

   you know he went on that
there are scientists who claim life orig-
inally came to the earth from some
other star perhaps from outside the
universe entirely maybe he said it
came even as these crystals came in
a meteor 

  the sick man paused and moistened
his lips with water

  that he said was the begin-
ning of the intimacy which sprang up
between john cabot and me it was
often possible for cabot to take one
of the crystals to his room and then
we would foregather there and pon-
der the mystery of it cabot was a
sound teacher of physics but he was
more than that he was a scientist
who was also a speculative philoso-
pher which meant being something
of a mystic have you ever studied
mysticism no then i cant tell
you about that only from him and
his speculations i struck fire how
can i describe it perhaps gazing
in the crystal hypnotized us both i
dont know as to that only night
and day both of us became eaten with
an overwhelming curiosity

   what do the scientists say is in-
side the crystals i asked cabot

   they dont say he replied
they dont know a message from

mars perhaps or from beyond the
milky way

 from beyond the milky way
whispered the sick man cant you
see what that would mean to our im-
aginations

  he beat the quilt that covered him
with his hand

  it meant he said the forbid-
den we dreamed of doing what the
scientists of america and europe said
they hesitated to do for fear of the
consequences-or for fear of destroy-
ing objects valuable to science we
dreamed of breaking the crystal

  a big moth fluttered into the radius
of light and the dying man followed
it with his eyes thats what we
were cabot and i though we didnt
know it moths trying to reach a
searing flame

  by this time i was engrossed in his
story what then i prompt-
ed

  we stole the crystals perhaps
you read about it at the time

  i shook my head

  well it was in all the papers

  i explained that in those days i had
seldom seen a paper from one weeks
end to another he nodded feebly

  that accounts for it then the
theft caused a sensation in university
circles and both cabot and i were
thoroughly questioned and searched
but we had been too clever the
sick man laughed mirthlessly god
help us too clever what wouldnt
i give now cried peter ross bitterly
if we had been discovered but a
malignant fate ordered otherwise we
were successful during the holidays
i took the crystal home with me
home to these hills and plains later
cabot joined me

  he broke off for a moment as if
exhausted

  i wonder he said after a few
minutes if i can make what we felt
and thought clear to you it wasnt
just idle curiosity that was driving
us no it was more than that out
of the unknown itself had come a

weird tales

meteor with a message for mankind
something stupendous was hidden in
the cores of those crystals yet what
had the scientists of the world done
they had contented themselves with
weighing the crystals looking at them
under a microscope photographing
them writing learned articles about
them and then putting them away
on museum shelves none of them-
not one or so it seemed to us-had
had the courage to open a crystal
their reasons-deadly germs viru-
lent forms of life terrific explosions-
we dismissed as cowardly vaporings
the time had come wc said to investi-
gate more thoroughly god help us  
whispered peter ross we blinded
ourselves to what might be the con-
sequences of our rash experiment
we eased our consciences with the re-
flection that we were safeguarding
humanity from any danger by carry-
ing it out in the wilderness miles
from any city or human habitation
if there were to be any martyrs we
thought egotistically it would be us
alone we had of course no inkling
of the terrible force we were about to
loose

  early in the morning of the day
of the disaster we iode from this plaee
down there to the plains down to
where you saw that charred splotch
we had with us a portable outfit of
chemical instruments it was our in-
tention to smash one of the crystals
catch the fluid in our test-tubes iso-
late the black spot and make an an-
aljsis of it and the liquid later but
we never did he said we never
did

  a cough rattled in his throat

  it was cabot who broke the crys-
tal before noon it was but im not
sure of the time he knew how to do
it he had all the tools necessary the
crystal lay inside a metal container i
tell you there was something uncanny
about it glimmering in the sun the
black spot was whirling madly dash-
ing itself with violence against the

restraining walls as if it sensed that
freedom was near

   look at him said cabot tense-
ly look at him leaping and kicking
what a dancer what a-in a min-
ute now and hell be out of that

  perhaps it was the phrase per-
haps it was the masculine pronoun
used in connection with the black
spot but suddenly i was afraid of the
thing we would do fearful possi-
bilities ran through my mind

   john i cried stepping back
several paces john dont

  but cabot never heard me his
hand went up with the heavy ham-
mer

  poor john nothing warned him
-nothing stayed him

 the blow came down i heard
the tinkling crash then-

   oh my god

  it wtas cabots voice in a shrill
scream of unutterable horror and
agony his bent figure straightened
up and from his hair and his out-
flung arms blue lights crackled and
streamed and all around his body a
column of something shimmered and
shifted and grew so for a moment
he postured then he began to dance
i tell you he began to dance not by
any force or power that resided in his
own limbs but as if he were jerked
or writhed about by an external agent
i saw what that agent was it was
the black spot out of the ground
it rose like an evil jinnee and took on
the form and shape of something
monstrous inhuman horrible it
leapt and whirled and yes though i
couldnt hear it it sang and shouted
it was the nucleus of an increasing
body of light i felt searing heat
scorch my cheeks and burn my throat
with every breath i drew more i
felt that streaming fingers of light
were reaching out at me clutching

  with a sob of fear i turned and
ran cabots horse had broken loose
and was running wildly across the
plains my own was plunging madly
the dancer in the crystal



at the end of its picket rope some-
how i mounted and fled but after
several miles of such flight my horse
put its hoof in a prairie-dog hole and
broke its leg pitching me over its
head

  how long i lay dead to the world
i dont know but the long shadows
were running eastward when i came
to the air was acrid and bitter
with fearful eyes i saw that the day
was unaccountably dark and that the
pillar of fire out on the plains had
grown to immense proportions even
as i gazed on it it grew hour after
hour it grew adding to its circum-
ference and height from the four
corners of the horizon in mighty
arches that dipped to a common cen-
ter flowed infinitesimal particles of
what seemed golden dust i know
now that all the electricity was be-
ing sucked out of the air darkening
the day blackening the night and
rendering all machinery useless but
then i knew only that the pillar of
fire the center to which those parti-
cles cohered was drawing nearer and
nearer to where i lay for i could
barely move my feet seemed like lead
and there was a tight band round my
chest

  perhaps i was delirious out of my
head i do not know but i got on my
feet and walked and walked and
when i couldnt walk i crawled
hours and hours i crawled driven
ahead by a growing horror of the
nightmare that pursued me yet when
i stopped exhausted i was still far
away from the foothills and the pil-
lar of fire was nearer than ever i
could see the monstrous black thing
inside of it dancing and whirling my
god it was reaching out dark
streamers of fire after me it was call-
ing out that it wanted me that it
would have me that nothing this side
of heaven or hell could keep it from
me and as it shot this implacable
message into my senses it grew big-
ger it danced faster and it came
closer

  again i staggeied to my feet and
ran late night found me several
miles below here quenching my thirst
at a spring of water which trickles
from the side of a rock i looked back
and the pillar of fire was now so high
that it lost itself in the heavens all
around me played a livid light a light
that flung the shape of a gigantic
dancing horror this way and that
did i tell you that this light was like
a pillar yes it was like a pillar
whose middle swelled out in a great
arc and i knew that i was doomed
that i could not escape and swoon-
ing horror overcame me and i fell to
the ground and buried my face in my
hands

  hours passed-or was it only
minutes i can not say i could feel
my body writhing twisting every
atom of my flesh was vibrating to an
unnatural rhythm i was crazy yes
out of my head delirious but i swear
to you that i heard john cabot cry-
ing to me imploring for gods sake
break the crystal break the crystal
and i cried back into my huddled
arms not speaking yet screaming it
we broke the crystal god help us
we broke the crystal

  then suddenly it came to me that
he meant the second crystal yes yes
i understood the fiendish thing out
there on the plain was seeking not
me but its counterpart

  the second crystal was in the
knapsack still swung on my back
with insane fury i tore it out of its
padded protected housing and
whirled it over my head filled with
loathing of the terrible thing i flung
it from me as far as the strength of
my arm would permit perhaps
twenty yards away it crashed into a
rock and was shattered to pieces i
saw the slivers of it glint and flash

 then from the spot where it struck
rose a column of light and in the
column of light was a whirling speck
like its predecessor it grew and grew
and as it grew receded from me in


weird tales

the direction of the mightier pillar
whirling and calling how can i tell
you of the weird dance of the evil
ones they sang to each other and i
know the song they sang but  can
not tell it to you because it was not
sung in words

  at what hour they came together
whether it was day or night i do not
know only i saw them merge with
their coming together the terrible
power that was sucking in the worlds
electrical forces to one gigantic cen-
ter became neutralized the heavens
split open as the bolts of lightning
devastated the sky through the
rent firmament i saw a black shape
cleave its way whatever had been in
the two crystals was leaving the
earth was plunging through the
milky way through the incalculable
spaces beyond the reach of our most
powerful telescopes back back  

two days later in a grave beside
the tumbling mountain stream
his brother-in-law and i buried all
that was mortal of peter ross over
his resting-place we piled a great
cairn of rocks so that the spring floods
might not wash his body away nor
coyotes worry the tomb of the dead
when i parted with the bereaved sis-
ter she pressed me to accept the cedar
box

  poor peter she said toward
the last he ran a fever all the time
and was delirious but he wanted you
to have the box and so you must take
it

  i saw that she attached no impor-
tance to his story

  he never mentioned it before
she said he was out of his head

  and so i was inclined to believe un-
til i examined the contents of the box
then i changed my mind if what he
told us had been naught but the re-
sult of morbid brooding and delirium
then he must have been morbid and
delirious for years preceding his
death because the written version of
his story began simply it is nearly
a year now since and was a bare
recital of facts written plainly and
in the manner of a man with no es-
pecial gift for expressing himself in
words nor was that all besides the
manuscript mentioned were revealed
various letters which i perused let-
ters from cabot to ross ross to cab-
ot covering a period of years and
telling of their ideas and plans and
of the theft of the crystals the whole
story save for its denouement could
be pieced together from those letters

  incredible as peter rosss tale had
sounded in the telling wild and in-
coherent though it had been and col-
ored with fever and delirium none
the less it was true and as if to
rout whatever disbelief might be still
lurking in my mind i saw that which
finally led me to place the whole mat-
ter before the royal academy of
science in canada and before vari-
ous other scientific bodies as i have
recorded and which in this latter
day so that mankind may be warned
against the menace imprisoned in the
crystals has made me put everything
down here the crowning evidence of
all for in the bottom of the box
was a round object and when i
picked it up my fascinated eyes were
held by a transparent bubble the size
of an orange with a black spot at its
core dancing dancing

hansen snored on the bed as
i paced the room another
day had passed over london
and again the street lamps glimmered
through the fog their lights affected
me strangely they seemed to beat
solid waves of energy against my
brain they twisted the fog into
strange sinister shapes footlights of
the stage that is the streets of lon-
don how many grisly scenes had they
lighted i pressed my hands hard
against my throbbing temples striv-
ing to bring my thoughts back from
the chaotic labyrinth where they
wandered

  gordon i had not seen since dawn

                                  


weird tales

following the clue of soho  he
had gone forth to arrange a raid
upon the place and he thought it best
that i should remain under cover he
anticipated an attempt upon my life
and again he feared that if i went
searching among the dives i formerly
frequented it would arouse suspicion

  hansen snored on i seated myself
and began to study the turkish shoes
which clothed my feet zuleika had
worn turkish slippers - how she
floated through my waking dreams
gilding prosaic things with her witch-
ery  her face smiled at me from the
fog her eyes shone from the flicker-
ing lamps her phantom footfalls re-
echoed through the misty chambers of
my skull

  they beat an endless tattoo luring
and haunting till it seemed that these
echoes found echoes in the hallway
outside the room where i stood soft
and stealthy a sudden rap at the
door and i started

  hansen slept on as i crossed the
room and flung the door swiftly open
a swirling wisp of fog had invaded
the corridor and through it like a
silver veil i saw her-zuleika stood
before me with her shimmering hair
and her red lips parted and her
great dark eyes

  like a speechless fool i stood and
she glanced quickly down the hallway
and then stepped inside and closed
the door

 gordon she whispered in a
thrilling undertone your friend
the scorpion has him

  hansen had awakened and now sat
gaping stupidly at the strange scene
which met his eyes

  zuleika did not heed him

  and oh steephen she cried
and tears shone in her eyes i have
tried so hard to secure some more
elixir but i could not  

never mind that i finally found
my specch tell me about gordon
he went back to kamonos alone
and hassim and ganra singh took
him captive and brought him to the

masters house tonight assemble a
great host of the people of the scor-
pion for the sacrifice

    sacrifice  a grisly thrill of hor-
ror coursed down my spine was
there no limit to the ghastliness of
this business 

   quick zuleika where is this house
of the masters

  soho  you must summon the
police and send many men to sur-
round it but you must not go your-
self-

  hansen sprang up quivering for
action but i turned to him my brain
was clear now or seemed to be and
racing unnaturally

  wait i turned back to zuleika
when is this sacrifice to take
place  

  at the rising of the moon
that is only a few hours before
dawn time to save him but if we
raid the house theyll kill him before
we can reach them and god only
knows how many diabolical things
guard all approaches

  i do not know zuleika whim-
pered i must go now or the mas-
ter will kill me

  something gave way in my brain
at that something like a flood of
wild and terrible exultation swept
over me

  the master will kill no one i
shouted flinging my arms on high
before ever the east turns red for
dawn the master dies by all things
holy and unholy i swear it

  hansen stared wildly at me and
zuleika shrank back as i turned on
her to my dope-inspired brain had
come a sudden burst of light true
and unerring i knew kathulos was
a mesmerist-that he understood
fully the secret of dominating an-
others mind and soul and i knew
that at last i had hit upon the reason
of his power over the girl mesmer-
ism  as a snake fascinates and draws
to him a bird so the master held
zuleika to him with unseen shackles
so absolute was his rule over her that
skull-face



it held even when she was out of his
sight working over great distances

  there was but one thing which
would break that hold the magnetic
power of some other person whose
control was stronger with her than
kathulos i laid my hands on her
slim little shoulders and made her
face me

  zuleika i said commandingly
here you are safe you shall not re-
turn to kathulos there is no need
of it now you are free  

  but i knew i had failed before i
ever started her eyes held a look of
amazed unreasoning fear and she
twisted timidly in my grasp

  steephen please let me go she
begged   i must-i must  

  i drew her over to the bed and
asked hansen for his handcuffs he
handed them to me wonderingly and
i fastened one cuff to the bed-post
and the other to her slim wrist the
girl whimpered but made no resist-
ance her limpid eyes seeking mine in
mute appeal

  it cut me to the quick to enforce
my will upon her in this apparently
brutal manner but i steeled myself

  zuleika i said tenderly you
are now my prisoner the scorpion
can not blame you for not returning
to him when you are unable to do so
-and before dawn you shall be free
of his rule entirely

  i turned to hansen and spoke in a
tone which admitted of no argument

  remain here just without the
door until i return on no account
allow any strangers to enter-that is
anyone whom you do not personally
know and i charge you on your
honor as a man do not release this
girl no matter what she may say if
neither i nor gordon have returned
by ten oclock tomorrow take her to
this address-that family once were
friends of mine and will take care of
a homeless girl i am going to scot-
land yard

  steephen zuleika wailed you
are going to the masters lair you

will be killed send the police do
not go 

  i bent drew her into my arms felt
her lips against mine then tore my-
self away

the fog plucked at me with ghost-
ly fingers cold as the hands of
dead men as i raced down the street
i had no plan but one was forming
in my mind beginning to seethe in
the stimulated cauldron that was my
brain i halted at the sight of a
policeman pacing his beat and beckon-
ing him to me scribbled a terse note
on a piece of paper torn from a note-
book and handed it to him

  get this to scotland yard its a
matter of life and death and it has to
do with the business of john gor-
don  

  at that name a gloved hand came
up in swift assent but his assurance
of haste died out behind me as i re-
newed my flight the note stated
briefly that gordon was a prisoner at
soho  and advised an immediate
raid in force-advised nay in gor-
dons name commanded it

  my reason for my actions was sim-
ple  i knew that the first noise of the
raid sealed john gordons doom
somehow i first must reach him and
protect or free him before the police
arrived

  the time seemed endless but at
last the grim gaunt outlines of the
house that was soho  rose up before
me a giant ghost in the fog the
hour grew late few people dared the
mists and the dampness as i came to
a halt in the street before this for-
bidding building no lights showed
from the windows either upstairs or
down it seemed deserted but the
lair of the scorpion often seems de-
serted until the silent death strikes
suddenly

  here i halted and a wild thought
struck me one way or another the
drama would be over by dawn to-
night was the climax of my careei
the ultimate top of life tonight i


weird tales

was the strongest link in the strange
chain of events tomorrow it would
not matter whether i lived or died i
drew the flask of elixir from my
pocket and gazed at it enough for
two more days if properly eked out
two more days of life or-i needed
stimulation as i never needed it
before the task in front of me was
one no mere human could hope to ac-
complish if i drank the entire re-
mainder of the elixir i had no idea
as to the duration of its effect but it
would last the night through and
my legs were shaky my mind had
curious periods of utter vacuity
weakness of brain and body assailed
me i raised the flask and with one
draft drained it

  for an instant i thought it was
death never had i taken such an
amount

  sky and world reeled and i felt as
if i would fly into a million vibrating
fragments like the bursting of a globe
of brittle steel like fire like hell-
fire the elixir raced along my veins
and i was a giant monster a super-
man

  turning i strode to the menacing
shadowy doorway i had no plan i
felt the need of none as a drunken
man walks blithely into danger i
strode to the lair of the scorpion
magnificently aware of my superior-
ity imperially confident of my stimu-
lation and sure as the unchanging
stars that the way would open before
me

  oh there never was a superman
like that who knocked commandingly
on the door of soho  that night in
the rain and the fog

  i knocked four times the old signal
that we slaves had used to be ad-
mitted into the idol room at yun
shatus an aperture opened in the
center of the door and slanted eyes
looked warily out they slightly
widened as the owner recognized me
then narrowed wickedly

  you fool  i said angrily dont
you see the mark

  i held my hand to the aperture

  dont you recognize me let me
in curse you

  i think the very boldness of the
trick made for its success surely by
now all the scorpions slaves knew of
stephen costigans rebellion knew
that he was marked for death and
the very fact that i came there in-
viting doom confused the doorman

  the door opened and i entered
the man who had admitted me was a
tall lank chinaman i had known as
a servant of kathulos he closed the
door behind me and i saw we stood
in a sort of vestibule lighted by a
dim lamp whose glowt could not be
seen from the street for the reason
that the windows were heavily cur-
tained the chinaman glowered at
me undecided i looked at him
tensed then suspicion flared in his
eyes and his hand flew to his sleeve
but at the instant i was on him and
his lean neck broke like a rotten
bough between my hands

 eased his corpse to the thickly car-
peted floor and listened no sound
broke the silence stepping as stealth-
ily as a wolf fingers spread like
talons i stole into the next room
this was furnished in oriental style
with couches and rugs and gold-
worked drapery but was empty of
human life i crossed it and went into
the next one light flowed softly from
the censers which wrere swung from
the ceiling and the eastern rugs
deadened the sound of my footfalls
i seemed to be moving through a
castle of enchantment

  every moment i expected a rush of
silent assassins from the doorways or
from behind the curtains or screens
with their writhing dragons utter si-
lence reigned room after room i ex-
plored and at last halted at the foot
of the stairs the inevitable censer
shed an uncertain light but most of
the stairs were veiled in shadows
what horrors awaited me above
skull-face



  but fear and the elixir are stran-
gers and i mounted that stair of lurk-
ing terror as boldly as i had entered
that house of terror the upper rooms
i found to be much like those below
and with them they had this fact in
common they were empty of human
life i sought an attic but there
seemed no door letting into one re-
turning to the first floor i made a
search for an entrance into the base-
ment but again my efforts were fruit-
less the amazing truth was borne in
upon me except for myself and the
dead man who lay sprawled so gro-
tesquely in the outer vestibule there
were no men in that house dead or
living

  i could not understand it had the
house been bare of furniture i should
have reached the natural conclusion
that kathulos had fled-but no signs
of flight met my eye this was un-
natural uncanny i stood in the
great shadowy library and pondered
no i had made no mistake in the
houses even if the broken corpse in
the vestibule were not there to fur-
nish mute testimony everything in
the room pointed toward the presence
of the master there were the arti-
ficial palms the lacquered screen the
tapestries even the idol though now
no incense smoke rose before it about
the walls were ranged long shelves of
books bound in strange and costly
fashion-books in every language in
the world i found from a swift exam-
ination and oh every subject-outre
and bizarre most of them

  remembering the secret passage in
the temple of dreams i investigated
the heavy mahogany table which stood
in the center of the room but noth-
ing resulted a sudden blaze of fury
surged up in me primitive and un-
reasoning i snatched a statuette from
the table and dashed it against the
shelf-covered wall the noise of its
breaking would surely bring the gang
from their hiding-places but the re-
sult was much more startling than
that

  the statuette struck the edge of a
shelf and instantly the whole section
of shelves with their load of books
swung silently outward revealing a
narrow doorway as in the other
secret door a row of steps led down-
ward at another time i would have
shuddered at the thought of descend-
ing with the horrors of that other
tunnel fresh in my mind but in-
flamed as i was by the elixir i strode
forward without an instants hes-
itancy

  since there was no one in the
house they must be somewhere in the
tunnel or in whatever lair to which
the tunnel led i stepped through the
doorway leaving the door open the
police might find it that way and
follow me though somehow i felt as
if mine would be a lone hand from
start to grim finish

  i went down a considerable dis-
tance and then the stair debouched
into a level corridor some twenty feet
wide-a remarkable thing in spite
of the width the ceiling was rather
low and from it hung small curious-
ly shaped lamps which filing a dim
light i stalked hurriedly along the
corridor like old death seeking vic-
tims and as i went i noted the work
of the thing the floor was of great
broad flags and the walls seemed to
be of huge blocks of evenly set stone
this passage was clearly no work of
modern days the slaves of kathulos
never tunneled there some secret
way of mediaeval times i thought-
and after all who knows what cata-
combs lie below london whose secrets
are greater and darker than those of
babylon and rome

  on and on i went and now i knew
that i must be far below the earth
the air was dank and heavy and
cold moisture dripped from the
stones of walls and ceiling from time
to time i saw smaller passages lead-
ing away in the darkness but i deter-
mined to keep to the larger main one

  a ferocious impatience gripped me
i seemed to have been walking for


weird tales

hours and still only dank damp walls
and bare flags and guttering lamps
met my eyes i kept a close watch for
sinister-appearing chests or the like-
saw no such things

  then as i was about to burst into
savage curses another stair loomed up
in the shadows in front of me

	dark fury

   the ringed wolf glared tlie circle round
      through baleful blue-lit eye

   not unforgetful of his debt

  quoth he ill do some damage yet
     or ere my turn to die

-mundy

like a lean wolf i glided up the
stairs some twenty feet up there
was a sort of landing from which
other corridors diverged much like
the lower one by which i had come
the thought came to me that the
earth below london must be honey-
combed with such secret passages one
above the other

  some feet above this landing the
steps halted at a door and here i
hesitated uncertain as to whether i
should chance knocking or not even
as i meditated the door began to
open i shrank back against the wall
flattening myself out as much as
possible the door swung wide and
a moor came through only a glimpse
i had of the room beyond out of the
corner of my eye but my unnaturally
alert senses registered the fact that
the room was empty

  and on the instant before he could
turn i smote the moor a single death-
ly blow behind the angle of the jaw-
bone and he toppled headlong down
the stairs to lie in a crumpled heap
on tlxe landing his limbs tossed gro-
tesquely about

  my left hand caught the door as it
started to slam shut and in an in-
stant i was through and standing in
the room beyond as i had thought
there were no occupants of this room
i crossed it swiftly and entered the
next these rooms were furnished in

a manner before which the furnish-
ings of the soho house paled into in-
significance barbaric terrible un-
holy-these words alone convey some
slight idea of the ghastly sights which
met my eyes skulls bones and com-
plete skeletons formed much of the
decorations if such they were mum-
mies leered from their cases and
mounted reptiles ranged the walls
between these sinister relics hung
african shields of hide and bamboo
crossed with assagais and war dag-
gers here and there reared obscene
idols black and horrific

 and in between and scattered
about among these evidences of sav-
agery and barbarism were vases
screens rugs and hangings of the
highest oriental workmanship a
strange and incongruous effect

  i had passed through two of these
rooms without seeing a human being
when i came to stairs leading up-
ward up these i went several
flights until i came to a door in a
ceiling i wondered if i were still
under the earth surely the first
stairs had let into a house of some
sort i raised the door cautiously
starlight met my eyes and i drew
myself warily up and out there i
halted a broad fiat roof stretched
away on all sides and beyond its rim
on all sides glimmered the lights of
london just what building i was on
i had no idea but that it was a tall
one i could tell for i seemed to be
above most of the lights i saw then
i saw that i was not alone

  over against the shadows of the
ledge that ran around the roofs
edge a great menacing form bulked
in the starlight a pair of eyes
glinted at me with a light not wholly
sane the starlight glanced silver from
a curving length of steel yar khan
the afghan killer fronted me in the
silent shadows

  a fierce wild exultation surged over
me now i could begin to pay the
debt i owed kathulos and all his hell-
ish band the dope fired my veins
skull-face



and sent waves of inhuman power and
dark fury through me a spring and
i was on my feet in a silent deathly
rush

  yar khan was a giant taller and
bulkier than i he held a tulwar
and from the instant i saw him i
knew that he was full of the dope to
the use of which he was addicted-
heroin

  as i came in he swung his heavy
weapon high in air but ere he could
strike i seized his sword wrist in an
iron grip and with my free hand
drove smashing blows into his midriff

  of that hideous battle fought in
silence above the sleeping city with
only the stars to see i remember
little i remember tumbling back and
forth locked in a death embrace i
remember the stiff beard rasping my
flesh as his dope-fired eyes gazed
wildly into mine i remember the
taste of hot blood in my mouth the
tang of fearful exultation in my soul
the onrushing and upsurging of in-
human strength and fury

  god what a sight for a human eye
had anyone looked upon that grim
roof where two human leopards dope
maniacs tore each other to pieces

  i remember his arm breaking like
rotten wood in my grip and the tul-
war falling from his useless hand
handicaped by a broken arm the
end was inevitable and with one wild
uproaring flood of might i rushed
him to the edge of the roof and bent
him backward far out over the ledge
an instant we struggled there then
i tore loose his hold and hurled him
over and one single shriek came up
as he hurtled into the darkness below

  i stood upright arms hurled up
toward the stars a terrible statue of
primordial triumph and down my
breast trickled streams of blood from
the long wounds left by the afghans
frantic nails on neck and face

  then i turned with the craft of
the maniac had no one heard the
sound of that battle my eyes were
on the door through which i had

come but a noise made me turn and
for the first time i noticed a small
affair like a tower jutting up from
the roof there was no window
there but there was a door and even
as i looked that door opened and a
huge black form framed itself in the
light that streamed from within
hassim

  he stepped out on the roof and
closed the door his shoulders hunched
and neck outthrust as he glanced this
way and that i struck him senseless
to the roof with one hate-driven
smash i crouched over him waiting
some sign of returning consciousness
then away in the sky close to the
horizon i saw a faint red tint the
rising of the moon

  where in gods name was gordon
even as i stood undecided a strange
noise reached me it was curiously
like the droning of many bees

  striding in the direction from
which it seemed to come i crossed the
roof and leaned over the ledge a
sight nightmarish and incredible met
my eyes

  some twenty feet below the level
of the roof on which i stood there
was another roof of the same size and
clearly a part of the same building
on one side it was bounded by the
wall on the other three sides a
parapet several feet high took the
place of a ledge

  a great throng of people stood sat
and squatted close-packed on the
roof-and without exception they
were negroes there were hundreds
of them and it wras their low-voiced
conversation which i had heard but
what held my gaze was that upon
which their eyes were fixed

  about the center of the roof rose a
sort of teocalli some ten feet high
almost exactly like those found in
mexico and on which the priests of
the aztecs sacrificed human victims
this allowing for its infinitely
smaller scale was an exact type of
those sacrificial pyramids on the flat
top of it was a curiously carved altar


weird tales

and beside it stood a lank dusky
form whom even the ghastly mask he
wore could not disguise to my gaze-
santiago the haiti voodoo fetish man
on the altar lay john gordon
stripped to the waist and bound
hand and foot but conscious

i reeled back from the roof edge
rent in twain by indecision even
the stimulus of the elixir was not
equal to this then a sound brought
me about to see hassim struggling
dizzily to his knees i reached him
with two long strides and ruthlessly
smashed him down again then i
noticed a queer sort of contrivance
dangling from his girdle i bent and
examined it it was a mask similar
to that worn by santiago then my
mind leaped swift and sudden to a
wild desperate plan which to my
dope-ridden brain seemed not at all
wild or desperate i stepped softly to
the tower and opening the door
peered inward i saw no one who
might need to be silenced but i saw
a long silken robe hanging upon a peg
in the wall the luck of the dope
fiend i snatched it and closed the
door again hassim showed no signs
of consciousness but i gave him an-
other smash on the chin to make sure
and seizing his mask hurried to the
ledge

  a low guttural chant floated up to
me jangling barbaric with an
undertone of maniacal blood-lust the
negroes men and women were sway-
ing back and forth to the wild rhythm
of their death chant on the teocalli
santiago stood like a statue of black
basalt facing the east dagger held
high-a wild and terrible sight naked
as he was save for a wide silken girdle
and that inhuman mask on his face
the moon thrust a red rim above the
eastern horizon and a faint breeze
stirred the great black plumes which
nodded above the voodoo mans mask
the chant of the worshipers dropped
to a low sinister whisper

  i hurriedly slipped on the death

mask gathered the robe close about
me and prepared for the descent i
was prepared to drop the full dis-
tance being sure in the superb con-
fidence of my insanity that i would
land unhurt but as i climbed over
the ledge i found a steel ladder lead-
ing down evidently hassim one of
the voodoo priests intended descend-
ing this way so down i went and
in haste for i knew that the instant
the moons lower rim cleared the citys
skyline that motionless dagger would
descend into gordons breast

  gathering the robe close about me
so as to conceal my white skin i
stepped down upon the roof and
strode forward through rows of black
worshipers who shrank aside to let
me through to the foot of the teo-
calli i stalked and up the stairs that
ran about it until i stood beside the
death altar and marked the dark red
stains upon it gordon lay on his
back his eyes open his face drawn
and haggard but his gaze dauntless
and unflinching

  santiagos eyes blazed at me
through the slits of his mask but i
read no suspicion in his gaze until i
reached forward and took the dagger
from his hand he was too much
astonished to resist and the black
throng fell suddenly silent that he
saw my hand was not that of a negro
it is certain but he was simply
struck speechless with astonishment
moving swiftly i cut gordons bonds
and hauled him erect then santiago
with a shriek leaped upon me-
shrieked again and arms flung high
and pitched headlong from the teocalli
with his own dagger buried to the hilt
in his breast

  then the black worshipers were on
us with a screech and a roar-leaping
on the steps of the teocalli like black
leopards in the moonlight knives
flashing eyes gleaming whitely

  i tore mask and robe from me and
answered gordons exclamation with
a wild laugh i had hoped that by
virtue of my disguise i might get us
skull-face



both safely away but now i was con-
tent to die there at his side

  he tore a great metal ornament
from the altar and as the attackers
came lie wielded this a moment we
held them at bay and then they
flowed over us like a black wave this
to me was valhalla knives stung
me and blackjacks smashed against
me but i laughed and drove my
iron fists in straight steam-hammer
smashes that shattered flesh and bone
i saw gordons crude weapon rise
and fall and each time a man went
down skulls shattered and blood
splashed and the dark fury swept
over me nightmare faces swirled
about me and i was on my knees up
again and the faces crumpled before
my blows through far mists i
seemed to hear a hideous familiar
voice raised in imperious command

  gordon was swept away from me
but from the sounds i knew that the
work of death still went on the stars
reeled through fogs of blood but
hells exaltation was on me and i
reveled in the dark tide of fury until
a darker deeper tide swept over me
and i knew no more

	ancient horror

here now in his triumph where all things
     falter

   stretched out on the spoils that his own
     hand spread

as a god self-slain on his own strange
     altar

   death lies dead

-swinburne

olowly i drifted back into life-
 slowly slowly a mist held me

and in the mist i saw a skull-

  i lay in a steel cage like a captive
wolf and the bars were too strong i
saw even for my strength the cage
seemed to be set in a sort of niche in
the wall and i was looking into a
large room this room was under the
earth for the floor was of stone flags
and the walls and ceilings were com-
posed of gigantic blocks of the same

material shelves ranged the walls
    vv t-

covered with weird appliances ap-
parently of a scientific nature and
more were on the great table that
stood in the center of th room be-
side this sat kathulos

  the sorcerer was clad in a snaky
yellow robe and those hideous hands
and that terrible head were more pro-
nouncedly reptilian than ever he
turned his great yellow eyes toward
me like pools of livid fire and his
parchment-thin lips moved in what
probably passed for a smile

  i staggered erect and gripped the
bars cursing

  gordon curse you where is gor-
don   

  kathulos took a test-tube from the
table eyed it closely and emptied it
into another

  ah my friend awakes he mur-
mured in his voice-the voice of a liv-
ing dead man

  he thrust his hands into his long
sleeves and turned fully to me

  i think in you he said distinct-
ly i have created a frankenstein
monster i made of you a super-
human creature to serve my wishes
and you broke from me you are the
bane of my might worse than gordon
even you have killed valuable ser-
vants and interfered with my plans
however your evil comes to an end
tonight your friend gordon broke
away but he is being hunted through
the tunnels and can not escape

  you he continued with the sin-
cere interest of the scientist are a
most interesting subject your brain
must be formed differently from any
other man that ever lived i will make
a close study of it and add it to my
laboratory how a man with the ap-
parent need of the elixir in his sys-
tem has managed to go on for two
days still stimulated by the last draft
is more than i can understand

  my heart leaped with all his wis-
dom little zuleika had tricked him
and he evidently did not know that
she had filched a flask of the life-giv-
ing stuff from him


weird tales

   the last draft you had from me
 he went on was sufficient only for
 some eight hours i repeat it lias me
 puzzled can you offer any sug-
 gestion 

   i snarled wordlessly he sighed

   as always the barbarian truly
 the proverb speaks jest with the
 wounded tiger and warm the adder
 in your bosom before you seek to lift
 the savage from his savagery 

   he meditated awhile in silence i
 vatched hini uneasily there was
 tdout him a vague and curious differ-
 ence-his long fingers emerging from
 the sleeves drammed on the chair
 arms and some hidden exultation
 strummed at the back of his voice
 lending it unaccustomed vibrancy

   and you might have been a king
of the new regime he said suddenly
aye the new-new and inhumanly
-old

   i	shuddered as his dry cackling
 laugh rasped out

   he bent his head as if listening
 from far off seemed to come a hum of
 guttural voices his lips writhed in
 a smile

   my black children he mur-
 mured they tear my enemy gor-
 don to pieces in the tunnels they
 mr costigan are my real henchmen
 and it was for their edification to-
 night that i laid john gordon on the
 sacrificial stone i would have pre-
 ferred to have made some experi-
 ments with him based on certain
 scientific theories but my children
 must be humored later under my
 tutelage they will outgrow their child-
 ish superstitions and throw aside
 their foolish customs but now they
 must be led gently by the hand

   how do you like these under-the-
 earth corridors mr costigan he
 switched suddenly you thought of
 them-what no doubt that the
 white savages of your middle ages
 built them faugh these tunnels
 are older than your world they were
 brought into being by mighty kings
 too many eons ago for your mind to

grasp when an imperial city
towered where now this crude village
of london stands all trace of that
metropolis has crumbled to dust and
vanished but these corridors were
built by more than human skill-ha
ha of all the teeming thousands
who move daily above them none
knows of their existence save my ser-
vants-and not all of them zuleika
for instance does not know of them
for of late i have begun to doubt her
loyalty and shall doubtless soon make
of her an example

  at that i hurled myself blindly
against the side of the cage a red
wave of hate and fury tossing me in
its grip i seized the bars and
strained until the veins stood out on
my forehead and the muscles bulged
and crackled in my arms and shoul-
ders and the bars bent before my
onslaught-a little but no more and
finally the power flowed from my
limbs and i sank down trembling and
weakened kathulos watched me im-
perturbably

 the bars hold he announced
with something almost like relief in
his tone   frankly i prefer to be on
the opposite side of them you are a
human ape if there was ever one

  he laughed suddenly and wildly

  but why do you seek to oppose
me   he shrieked unexpectedly   why
defy me who am kathulos the sor-
cerer great even in the days of the
old empire today invincible a
magician a scientist among ignorant
savages ha ha

  i	shuddered and sudden blinding
light broke in on me kathulos him-
self was an addict and was fired by
the stuff of his choice what hellish
concoction was strong enough terrible
enough to thrill the master and in-
flame him i do not know nor do i
wish to know of all the uncanny
knowledge that was his i knowing
the man as i did count this the most
weird and grisly

  you you paltry fool he was
ranting his face lit supematurally
skull-face



know yon who i am kathulos of
egypt bah they knew me in the
old days i reigned in the dim misty
sea lands ages and ages before the sea
rose and engulfed the land i died
not as men die the magic draft of
life everlasting was ours i drank
deep and slept long i slept in my
lacquered case my flesh withered
and grew hard my blood dried in my
veins i became as one dead but
still within me bumed the spirit of
life sleeping but anticipating the
awakening the great cities crum-
bled to dust the sea drank the land
the tall shrines and the lofty spires
sank beneath the green waves all
this i knew as i slept as a man knows
in dreams kathulos of egypt
faugh kathulos of atlantis

  i uttered a sudden involuntary cry
this was too grisly for sanity

  aye the magician the sorcerer

  and down the long years of sav-
agery through which the barbaric
races struggled to rise without their
masters the legend came of the day of
empire when one of the old race
would rise up from the sea aye and
lead to victory the black people who
were our slaves in the old days

  these brown and yellow people
what care i for them the blacks
were the slaves of my race and i am
their god today they will obey me
the yellow and the brown peoples are
fools-i make them my tools and the
day will come when my black war-
riors will turn on them and slay at
my word and you you white bar-
barians whose ape-ancestors forever
defied my race and me your doom is
at hand and when i mount my uni-
versal throne the only whites shall be
white slaves

    the day came as prophesied when
my case breaking free from the halls
where it lay-where it had lain when
atlantis was still sovran of the world
-where since her empery it had sunk
into the green fathoms - when my
case i say was smitten by the deep
sea tides and moved and stirred and

thrust aside the clinging seaweed that
masks temples and minarets and
came floating up past the lofty sap-
phire and golden spires up through
the green waters to float upon the
lazy waves of the sea

  then came a white fool carrying
out the destiny of which he was not
aware the men on his ship true be-
lievers knew that the time had come
and i-the air entered my nostrils
and i awoke from the long long sleep
i stirred and moved and lived and
rising in the night i slew the fool that
had lifted me from the ocean and my
servants made obeisance to me and
took me into africa where i abode
awhile and learned new languages and
new ways of a new world and became
strong

  	 the wisdom of your dreary world
-ha ha i who delved deeper in the
mysteries of the old than any man
dared go all that men know today
i know and the knowledge beside that
which i have brought down the cen-
turies is as a grain of sand beside a
mountain you should know some-
thing of that knowledge by it i
lifted you from one hell to plunge
you into a greater you fool here at
my hand is that which would lift you
from this aye would strike from
you the chains whereby i have bound
you

tt e snatched up a golden vial and
shook it before my gaze i eyed
it as men dying in the desert must
eye the distant mirages kathulos
fingered it meditatively his un-
natural excitement seemed to have
passed suddenly and when he spoke
again it was in the passionless meas-
ured tones of the scientist

  that would indeed be an experi-
ment worth while-to free you of the
elixir habit and see if your dope-
riddled body would sustain life nine
times out of ten the victim with the
need and stimulus removed would
die-but you are such a giant of a
brute-


weird tales

  he sighed and set the vial down

  the dreamer opposes the man of
destiny my time is not my own or i
should choose to spend my life pent
in my laboratories carrying out my
experiments but now as in the days
of the old empire when kings sought
my counsel i must work and labor
for the good of the race at large aye
i must toil and sow the seed of glory
against the full coming of the im-
perial days when the seas give up all
their living dead

  i shuddered kathulos laughed
wildly again his fingers began to
drum his chair arms and his face
gleamed with the unnatural light
once more the red visions had begun
to seethe in his skull again

  under the green seas they lie the
ancient masters in their lacquered
cases dead as men reckon death but
only sleeping sleeping through the
long ages as hours awaiting the day
of awakening the old masters the
wise men who foresaw the day when
the sea should gulp the land and who
made ready made ready that they
might rise again in the barbaric days
to come as did i sleeping they lie
ancient kings and grim wizards who
died as men die before atlantis sank
who sleeping sank with her but who
shall arise again

  mine the glory i rose first and
i sought out the site of old cities on
shores that did not sink vanished
long vanished the barbarian tide
swept over them thousands of years
ago as the green waters swept over
their elder sister of the deeps on
some the deserts stretch bare over
some as here young barbarian cities
rise

  he halted suddenly his eyes
sought one of the dark openings that
marked a corridor i think his strange
intuition warned him of some impend-
ing danger but i do not believe that
he had any inkling of how dramatic-
ally our scene would be interrupted

  as he looked swift footsteps sound-
ed and a man appeared suddenly in

the doorway-a man disheveled tat-
tered and bloody john gordon
kathulos sprang erect with a cry and
gordon gasping as from superhuman
exertion brought down the levolver
he held in his hand and fired point-
blank kathulos staggered clapping
his hand to his breast and then grop-
ing wildly reeled to the wall and fell
against it a doorway opened and he
reeled through but as gordon leaped
fiercely across the chamber a blank
stone surface met his gaze which
yielded not to his savage hammerings

  he whirled and ran drunkenly to
the table where lay a bunch of keys
the master had dropped there

     the vial  i shrieked   take the
vial   and he thrust it into his
pocket

  back along the corridor through
which he had come sounded a faint
clamor growing swiftly like a wolf-
pack in full cry a few precious sec-
onds spent with fumbling for the
right key then the cage door swung
open and i sprang out a sight for
the gods we were the two of us
slashed bruised and cut our gar-
ments hanging in tatters-my wounds
had ceased to bleed but now as i
moved they began again and from
the stiffness of my hands i knew that
my knuckles were shattered as for
gordon he was fairly drenched in
blood from crown to foot

tue made off down a passage in

    the opposite direction from the
menacing noise which i knew to be
the black servants of the master in
full pursuit of us neither of us was
in good shape for running but we
did our best where we were going
i had no idea my superhuman
strength had deserted me and i was
going nowr on will-power alone we
switched off into another corridor and
we had not gone twenty steps until
looking back i saw the first of the
black devils round the corner

  a desperate effort increased our
lead a trifle but they had seen us
skull-face



were in full view now and a yell of
fury broke from them to be succeeded
by a more sinister silencc as they bent
all efforts to overhauling us

  there a short distance in front of
us we saw a stair loom suddenly in
the gloom if we might reach that-
but we saw something else

  against the ceiling between us and
the stairs hung a huge thing like an
iron grill with great spikes along the
bottom-a portcullis and even as we
looked without halting in our pant-
ing strides it began to move

  theyre lowering the portcullis
gordon croaked his blood-streaked
face a mask of exhaustion and will

  now the blacks were only ten feet
behind us-now the huge grate gain-
ing momentum with a creak of rusty
unused mechanism rushed down-
ward a final spurt a gasping strain-
ing nightmare of effort-and gordon
sweeping us both along in a wild burst
of pure nerve-strength hurled us
under and through and the grate
crashed behind us

  a moment we lay gasping not heed-
ing the frenzied horde who raved and
screamed on the other side of the
grate so close had that final leap
been that the great spikes in their
descent had tom shreds from our
clothing

  the blacks were thrusting at us with
daggers through the bars but we were
out of reach and it seemed to me that
i was content to lie there and die of
exhaustion but gordon weaved un-
steadily erect and hauled me with
him

  got to get out he croaked got
to warn-scotland yard-honey-
combs in heart of london-high ex-
plosives-arms-ammunition  

  we blundered up the steps and in
front of us i seemed to hear a sound
of metal grating against metal the
stairs ended abruptly on a landing
that terminated in a blank wall
gordon hammered against this and
the inevitable secret doorway opened
light streamed in through the bars

of a sort of grille men in the uniform
of london police were sawing at these
with hacksaws and even as they
greeted us an opening was made
through which wre crawled

  youre hurt sir one of the
men took gordons arm

  my companion shook him off

  theres no time to lose out of
here as quick as we can go

  i saw that we were in a basement
of some sort we hastened up the
steps and out into the early dawn
which was turning the east scarlet
over the tops of smaller houses i saw
in the distance a great gaunt building
on the roof of which i felt instinctive-
ly that wild drama had been enacted
the night before

  that building was leased some
months ago by a mysterious china-
man said gordon following my
gaze office building originally-
the neighborhood deteriorated and the
building stood vacant for some time
the new tenant added several stories
to it but left it apparently empty
had my eye on it for some time

  this was told in gordons jerky
swift manner as we started hurriedly
along the sidewalk i listened me-
chanically like a man in a trance
my vitality was ebbing fast and i
knew that i was going to crumple at
any moment

  the people living in the vicinity
had been reporting strange sights and
noises the man who owned the base-
ment we just left heard queer sounds
emanating from the wall of the base-
ment and called the police about
that time i was racing back and forth
among those cursed corridors like it
hunted rat and i heard the police
banging on the wall i found the
secret door and opened it but found
it barred by a grating it was while
i was telling the astounded policemen
to procure a hacksaw that the pur-
suing negroes whom i had eluded for
the moment came into sight and i
was forced to shut the door and run
for it again by pure luck i founj


weird tales

you and by pure luck managed to
find the way back to the door

 now we must get to scotland
yard if we strike swiftly we may
capture the entire band of devils
whether i killed kathulos or not i do
not know or if he can be killed by
mortal weapons but to the best of
my knowledge all of them are now
in those subterranean corridors

and-

  at that moment the world shook
a brain-shattering roar seemed to
break the sky with its incredible de-
tonation  houses tottered and crashed
to ruins a mighty pillar of smoke
and flame burst from the earth and
on its wings great masses of debris
soared skyward a black fog of smoke
and dust and falling timbers en-
veloped the world a prolonged thun-
der seemed to rumble up from the
center of the earth as of walls and
ceilings falling and amid the uproar
and the screaming i sank down and
knew no more

  	the breaking of the chain

       and like a soul belated

      in heaven and hell unmated

       by cloud and mist abated

         comes out of darkness morn

	-swinburne

there is little need to linger on the
scenes of horror of that terrible
london morning the world is fa-
miliar with and knows most of the
details attendant to the great explo-
sion which wiped out a tenth of that
great city with a resultant loss of
lives and property for such a hap-
pening some reason must needs be
given the tale of the deserted build-
ing got out and many wild stories
were circulated finally to still the
rumors the report was unofficially
given out that this building had been
the rendezvous and secret stronghold
of a gang of international anarchists
who had stored its basement full of
high explosives and who had sup-
posedly ignited these accidentally in
a way there was a good deal to this

tale as you know but the threat that
had lurked there far transcended any
anarchist

  all this was told to me for when i
sank unconscious gordon attribut-
ing my condition to exhaustion and a
need of the hashish to the use of which
he thought i was addicted lifted me
and with the aid of the stunned po-
licemen got me to his rooms before
returning to the scene of the explo-
sion at his rooms he found hansen
and zuleika handcuffed to the bed as
i had left her he released her and
left her to tend to me for all london
was in a terrible turmoil and he was
needed elsewhere

  when i came to myself at last i
looked up into her starry eyes and
lay quiet smiling up at her she sank
down upon my bosom nestling my
head in her arms and covering my
face with her kisses

  steephen she sobbed over and
over as her tears splashed hot on my
face

  i was scarcely strong enough to put
my arms about her but i managed it
and we lay there for a space in
silence except for the girls hard
racking sobs

  zuleika i love you i mur-
mured

  and i love you steephen she
sobbed oh it is so hard to part
now - but im going with you
steephen i cant live without you

  my dear child said john gor-
don entering the room suddenly
costigans not going to die we will
let him have enough hashish to tide
him along and when he is stronger
we will take him off the habit slowly

  you dont understand sahib it
is not hashish steephen must have it
is something which only the master
knew and now that he is dead or is
fled steephen can not get it and must
die  

  gordon shot a quick uncertain
glance at me his fine face was drawn
and haggard his clothes sooty and
skull-face

torn from his work among the debris
of the explosion

  shes right gordon i said
languidly im dying kathulos
killed the hashish-craving with a con-
coction he called the elixir ive been
keeping myself alive  some of the
stuff that zuleika stole from him and
gave mebut i drank it all last night

  i was aware of no craving of any
kind  physical or mental discom-
fort even all my mechanism was
slowing down fast i had passed the
stage where the need of the elixir
would tear and rend me i felt only a
great lassitude and a desire to sleep
and i knew that the moment i closed
my eyes i would die

  a strange dope that elixir i
said with growing languor it burns
and freezes and then at last the crav-
ing kills easily and without torment

  costigan curse it said gordon
desperately you cant go like this
that vial i took from the egyptians
table-what is in it

  the master swore it would free
me of my curse and probably kill me
also i muttered id forgotten
about it let me have it it can 
more than kill me and im dying
now  

  yes quick let me have it ex-
claimed zuleika fiercely springing to
gordons side her hands passionately
outstretched she returned with the
vial which he had taken from his
pocket and knelt beside me holding
it to my lips while she murmured to
me gently and soothingly in her owtn
language

  i drank draining the vial but feel-
ing little interest in the whole mat-
ter my outlook was purely imper-
sonal at such a low ebb was my life
and i can not even remember how the
stuff tasted i only remember feeling
a curious sluggish fire burn faintly
along my veins and the last thing i
saw was zuleika crouching over me
her great eyes fixed with a burning
intensity on me her tense little hand
rested inside her blouse and remem-

bering her vow to take her owrn life it
i died  tried to lift a hand and dis-
arm her tried to tell gordon to take
away the dagger she had hidden in
her garments rut speech and action
failed me and i drifted away into a
curious sea of unconsciousness

  of that period i remember nothing
no sensation fired my sleeping brain
to such an extent as to bridge the
gulf over which i drifted they say i
lay like a dead man for hours scarce-
ly breathing while zuleika hovered
over me never leaving my side an
instant and fighting like a tigress
when anyone tried to coax her away
to rest her chain wtas broken

as  had carried the vision of her
into that dim land of nothingness
so her dear eyes were the first thing
which greeted my returning con-
sciousness i was aware of a greater
weakness than  thought possible for
a man to feel as if i had been an
invalid for months but the life in me
faint though it was was sound and
normal caused by  artificial stimu-
lation i smiled up at my girl and
murmured weakly

  throw away your dagger little
zuleika im going to live

  she screamed and fell on her knees
beside me weeping and laughing at
the same time women are strange
beings of mixed and powerful emo-
tions truly

  gordon entered and grasped the
hand which i could not lift from the
bed

  youre a ease for an ordinary
human physician now costigan he
said even a layman like myself can
tell that for the first time since ive
known you the look in your eyes is
entirely sane you look like a man who
has had a complete nervous break-
down and needs about a year of rest
and quiet great heavens man youve
been through enough outside your
dope experience to last you a life-
time


weird tales

  tell me first said i was
kathulos killed in the explosion

  i dont know answered gordon
somberly apparently the entire
system of subterranean passages was
destroyed i know my last bullet-
the last bullet that was in the revolver
which i wrested from one of my at-
tackers-found its mark in the mas-
ters body but whether he died from
the wound or whether a bullet can
hurt him i do not know and
whether in his death agonies he ig-
nited the tons and tons of high ex-
plosives which were stored in the cor-
ridas or whether the negroes did it
unintentionally we shall never know

  my god costigan did you ever
see -uch a honeycomb and we know
not how many miles in either direc-
tion the passages reached even now
scotland yard men are combing the
subways and basements of the town
for secret openings all known open-
ings such as the one through which
we came and the one in soho  were
blocked by falling walls the office
building was simply  own to atoms
what about the men who raided
soho 

  the door in the library wall had
been closed they found the china-
man you killed but searched the house
without avail lucky for them too
else they had doubtless been in the
tunnels when the explosion came and
perished with the hundreds of negroes
who must have died then

  every negro in london must have
been there  

  i dare say most of them are
voodoo worshipers at heart and the
power the master -wielded was in-
credible they died but what of him
was he blown to atoms by the stuff
which he had secretly stored or
crushed when the stone walls
crumbled and the ceilings came
thundering down   

there is no way to search among
those subterranean ruins i suppose
none whatever when the walls
caved in the tons of earth upheld by

the ceilings also came crashing down
filling the corridors with dirt and
broken stone blocking them forever
and on the surface of the earth the
houses which the vibration shook
down were heaped high in utter ruins
what happened in those terrible cor-
ridors must remain forever a mys-
tery  

ivty tale draws to a close the
- months that followed passed un-
eventfully except for the growing
happiness which to me was paradise
but which would bore you were i to
relate it but one day gordon and i
again discussed the mysterious hap-
penings that had had their being
under the grim hand of the master

  since that day said gordon
  the world has been quiet africa has
subsided and the east seems to have
returned to her ancient sleep there
can be but one answer-living or
dead kathulos was destroyed that
morning when his world crashed
about him

  gordon said i what is the
answer to that greatest of all mys-
teries

  my friend shrugged his shoulders

  i have come to believe that man-
kind eternally hovers on the brinks of
secret oceans of which it knows
nothing races have lived and van-
ished before our race rose out of the
slime of the primitive and it is likely
still others will live upon the earth
after ours has vanished scientists
have long upheld the theory that the
atlanteans possessed a higher civiliza-
tion than our own and on very differ-
ent lines certainly kathulos himself
was proof that our boasted culture
and knowledge were nothing beside
that of whatever fearful civilization
produced him

  his dealings with you alone have
puzzled all the scientific world for
none of them has been able to explain
how he could remove the hashish crav-
hlg stimulate you with a drug so in-
finitely more powerful and then pro-
skull-face



duce another drug which entirely
effaced the effects of the other

  x have him to thank for two
things i said slowly the regain-
ing of my lost manhood-and zuleika
kathulos then is dead as far as any
mortal thing can die but what of
those others-those ancient masters
who still sleep in the sea

  gordon shuddered

  as i said perhaps mankind loiters
on the brink of unthinkable chasms of
horror but a fleet of gunboats is
even now patrolling the oeeans un-
obtrusively with orders to destroy
instantly any strange case that may
be found floating-to destroy it and
its contents and if my word has any
weight with the english government
and the nations of the world the seas
will be so patrolled until doomsday
shall let down the curtain on the races
of today

  at night i dream of them some-
times i muttered sleeping in their
lacquered eases which drip with
strange seaweed far down among the
green surges - where unholy spires
and strange towers rise in the dark
ocean

  we have been face to face with an

ancient horror said gordon somber-
ly with a fear too dark and myste-
rious for the human brain to cope
with fortune has been with us she
may not again favor the sons of men
it is best that wo be ever on our
guard the universe was not made
for humanity alone life takes strange
phases and it is the first instinct of
nature for the different species to
destroy each other no doubt we
seemed as horrible to the master as ho
did to us wo have scarcely tapped
the chest of secrets which nature has
stored and  shudder to thing of
what that chest may hold for the
human race

  thats true said i inwardly re-
joicing at the vigor which was be-
ginning to course through my wasted
veins but men will meet obstacles
as they come as men have always
risen to meet them now i am be-
ginning to know the full worth of life
and love and not all the devils from
all the abysses can hold me

  gordon smiled

  you have it coming to you old
comrade the best thing is to forget
all that dark interlude for in that
course lies light and happiness

room

bensoix

on the bed lay the figure of a man faintly
twitching

hugh lister and his wife
had come down from london
to attend the funeral of his
uncle that strange old hermit of a
man who had lived for the last year
utterly recluse and indeed practically
unseen in the charming georgian
louse and high-walled garden which
at his death had now come into pos-
session of his nephew two bachelor
brothers so hugh remembered had
originally bought the place and for
some years had lived together there
but he knew almost nothing of their
history though he could recollect see-
ing them both as a boy when they
spent the night at his mothers house


in town on their way abroad for some
piece of holiday-travel in which they
annually indulged grim odd-looking
men much alike who quarreled about
the price of their tickets and seemed
considerably to dislike each other
they lived together it appeared
because a joint establishment was
cheaper than two separate houses and
they had a strong community of
tastes in their love of money and
their dislike of other people 

  hughs fugitive recollection had
now after the funeral been rein-
forced and amplified by a talk with
mr hodgkin his uncles solicitor and
he had learned more of these queer
the shuttered room



brothers they had lived entirely
withdrawn from the local life of this
little town of trent horpe no guest
ever crossed their threshold nor did
they set foot at all in the houses of
their neighbors seldom were they
ever seen outside their house and gar-
den and indeed not often within
for their domestic requirements were
provided by a woman who went in
for a few hours every morning to
make their beds and lay their break-
fasts and cook some food for their
dinner but she would be busy in the
kitchen when they came downstairs
and sometimes for days together she
never set eyes on either of them ex-
cept for her the only human being
who for the last four or five years
had had access to any portion of the
premises was the man who had charge
of the furnace in the back yard be-
hind the house which heated the radi-
ators through its rooms and passages
every day throughout the year he
must come in the morning and con-
sult the thermometer which hung in a
shaded nook on a wall there and
should it register below  fahren-
heit the furnace must be lit and
stoked twice during the day before
he paid his final visit at ten oclock
at night and made up a fire that
would keep the house warm till morn-
ing again

  no window ever appeared to be
opened in that hermitage and seldom
cleaned the meals were of the most
frugal an overheated house and com-
plete solitude were all that the broth-
ers asked of life the man and the
woman who looked after their needs
went for their wages every week to
mr hodgkin who also discharged for
the brothers their bills and paid for
them the rates and taxes of the free-
hold house but this dismal frugality
and joylessness was not the consequence
of insufficient means for they each had
an income of five or six hundred a year
of which they spent not half the
rest merely accumulated at the bank
for they made no investments one

or other of them was occasionally
seen in the early morning walking by
the bank of the tidal river that swept
under the hill on which trenthorpe
stood and debouched into the sea a
mile or two away but he would have
returned to the house before nine in
the morning and thereafter appeared
no more

  most of this was news to hugh and
violet then mr hodgkin went on to
speak of an event which they knew
had occurred though the details had
not reached them

  that was the manner of life of
your two uncles mr lister he said
until a year ago when the mysteri-
ous disappearance of the younger
mr henry took place i had just
come downstairs one morning and
was beginning my breakfast when
mr robert whose funeral we have
just attended was announced he
had found the front door of his house
which as you will presently see
when we visit it is secured by a multi-
tude of bolts and locks and chains
standing wide open it had not been
forced from outside for the bolts had
been withdrawn from within he
called to his brother but got no an-
swer and ascending to his room
found that it was empty his bed had
been slept in his instruments of toi-
let had been used but there was no
trace of him anywhere either in the
house or the garden it seemed most
likely therefore that it was he who
had gone out leaving the door wide
but this was so extraordinary a thing
for him to have done that mr robert
instantly came round to tell me about
it it struck me also as so odd that i
rang up the police office search and
enquiries were made and within an
hour a cloth cap which mr robert
identified as belonging to his brother
was found on the bank of the river
where sometimes he walked and next
day his walking-stick was found at
low tide on a sand-shoal a mile farther
down the tide-it was one of the big
spring-tides-had been at the flood


weird tales

about five oclock in the morning on
which he disappeared and assuming
that he left the house soon after that
it must have been running very strong
to the sea and the river was dragged
without result then came further
evidence for a laborer in the town
who had gone out to work at day-
break said that he had seen a man
answering to the description which
was circulated crossing the bridge
above the bank where the cap was
found  

  was it supposed to have been an
accident asked hugh

  there was not sufficient evidence
to make that clear it is possible
that mr henry might have slipped
while walking along the bank for
the ground was very miry on the other
hand mr robert in the statement he
made to the police said that for sev-
eral days his brother had been very
queer in his behavior and possibly it
was suicide but there could of
course be no inquest since the body
was never found death was presumed
after the due legal period and by the
will which both your uncles had made
which was in my keeping and by
which the survivor of the two was
named as the heir of the deceased mr
henrys property passed to his
brother that was completed only a
few days ago previously to that mr
robert as you know had made a fur-
ther will under which you inherit

  mr hodgkin paused a moment but
hugh had no question to put to him
and he continued in the same even
voice

  after mr henrys disappear-
ance he said your surviving uncle
became more recluse than ever and
once only as far as t am aware he
left his house and garden and that
was when he came to see me to make
his will the charwoman continued
to go in every morning but now she
liardly ever saw him ho moved from
the bedroom upstairs next to mr
henrys both of which looked out on
to the garden and occupied a small

room on the ground floor looking out
on to the street and the two bed-
rooms upstairs were locked and the
keys were in his keeping he similar-
ly locked the two corresponding rooms
on the ground floor which look on to
the garden though he used them him-
self and the charwoman left his food
on a small table in the hall outside
and he took it in after she had gone
putting the plates and utensils he had
used in the same place for her to wash
up next day her range in fact was
entirely confined to the kitchen and
your uncles bedroom from which he
had always gone into one of the
locked rooms on the ground floor be-
fore she arrived if he wanted any-
thing ordered for him there would be
a note for her on the table by his bed
stating his requirements so it went
on till last thursday the day of his
death  

  again the lawyer paused

  it is a painful and terrible ac-
count i have to give you mr lister
he said she went to his bedroom as
usual and found him crouching in a
corner of the room and he screamed
out with fright she said when he saw
her and kept crying out no no
have mercy on me henry like a
sensible woman she ran straight for
the doctor and as she went past his
window she heard him still scream-
ing dr soleham was in and came
at once your uncle was still in some
wild access of terror and he slipped
by them and ran out into the street
then quite suddenly he spun round
and collapsed they brought him back
into the house and in a few minutes
it was all over

such was the grim manner in which
hugh lister entered into his in-
heritance it was ail horrible and
mysterious enough but no question
of personal grief or loss came into it
since he was practically a stranger
to these queer relations of his mr
hodgkin went into other business
matters with him there was a con-
the shuttered room



siderable sum of money which was
his also this house and garden of
which the house so the lawyer told
him was in a state of the most hide-
ous dilapidation and disrepair of the
garden he knew nothing for though
it stood in the middle of the little
town its high brick walls screened it
from all scrutiny of the houses round
and the rooms which looked on to it
from the house had long been kept
locked hugh and his wife slept that
night at an inn and next morning
mr hodgkin called to take them over
the property

  pitiable indeed was the neglect into
which this charming and dignified
little mansion had fallen the roof
leaked in a dozen places the mildewed
paper was peeling off the walls the
carpets were rotted by damp and
drip here they were faded by the
sun here they were mere rags and
ribands the casement bars of the
windows were perished the panes so
rusted with dust and spiders webs
that scarce a glimpse of the street
outside could be seen doors sagged
on their hinges a litter of sticks and
straws from the nests of starlings that
had built in the chimneys littered the
hearths pictures had fallen from the
walls and lay in fragments of splin-
tered glass and broken frames on the
floor then there were the four locked
rooms which looked on to the garden
two upstairs and two below to be ex-
plored a bunch of keys was found
in the bedroom below which robert
lister had used and they began their
investigations upstairs starting with
the first door on the landing this was
the room the charwoman told them
which mr henry had occupied and
which had been locked ever since his
disappearance

  the key grated rustily in the
boards but soon the door stood open
and they saw that the room was quite
dark for the windows were shuttered
a little fumbling revealed the fasten-
ings and hugh throwing them open
gave an exclamation of surprize for

the room though long closed and
neglected with sagging ceiling and
damp-stained walls bore all signs of
use the bed-clothes coverlet and
blankets and moldy sheets were still
on the bed half-turned back as if its
occupant had only just left it on the
washstand were sponge and tooth-
brush and beside it on the floor stood
a brass hot-water can green with ver-
digris in the window was a dressing-
table with a looking-glass blurred and
foggy and by it a pair of hair-brushes
and a shaving-brush and a rusty
razor with the dried stain of soap 
the blade there were a couple of
pairs of boots efflorescent with gray
mildew below it the chest of drawers
was full of clothes nothing had been
touched since the morning when
henry lister left it not to return

  violet felt a sudden qualm of mis-
giving coming from she knew not
what secret cell in her brain the
room with its dead air and vanished
occupant was still horribly alive she
moved across to the window with the
notion of throwing it open so that
the wholesome morning breeze could
enter the windows from having been
shuttered were less opaquely coated
with dust than those below and she
saw what lay outside

  hugh look at the garden she
called its a perfect jungle paths
lawn flower-beds all covered with the
wild

  he peered out

  theres a job in front of us
then he said but well take that
after weve been through the house
its a queer room this vi

 the chamber next door was as
queer this was the bedroom said the
charwoman which mr robert had
occupied when the two brothers were
living together in the house at mr
henry s disappearance he had moved
 to the ground floor into the room
which he used until the day of his
death this upper room had been
locked up since then she had not seen
it since the day when mr robert had


weird tales

slept downstairs his bed had been
moved down his wardrobe and his
washing-stand a couple of crazy
chairs alone now stood there and as in
the room next door the shutters were
closed when they entered mr rob-
ert she told them had forbidden her
to go upstairs any more when mr
henry left them three more bed-
rooms all absolutely empty of furni-
ture and a bathroom with brown
stains down the side of the bath below
the taps completed this floor the bed-
rooms had never been furnished at all
as far as she knew and yet for all
the emptiness of this story of the
house it seemed to violet as if some-
thing followed them as they went
downstairs again

  there remained for exploration the
two rooms on the ground-floor which
looked out on to the garden and
which for the last year had always
been kept locked these were scarcely
more fit for human habitation than
the rest the dust lay thick every-
where the carpet was in rags the
windows bleared with dirt one must
have been robert listers dining-
room for there were pieces of crock-
ery and cutlery on the table a glass
and a half-empty bottle of whisky a
jug of water and a salt-cellar and a
few tattered books were scattered on
the floor beside it one window looked
out on to the street and on the wall
at right angles to that a glass-paned
door led out into the garden this
was bolted at top and bottom evi-
dently it had long been in disuse for
entrance and egress and it was with
difficulty that hugh managed to push
the bolts back into their rusty grooves
when that was done he wrenched the
door open and it was good to let a
breath of the sweet untainted air of
outside penetrate into that sick and
deadened atmosphere

  my uncle never went out into the
town you tell me he said to mr
hodgkin and we can see that he
never went into the garden he must

have lived indoors altogether and
indoors he never set foot upstairs
good god its ghastly just these
three rooms with no presence there
except his own enough to drive a
man mad and yet he chose to do
it    whats that

  he turned round as he spoke
wheeling quickly and went out into
the hall outside but there was noth-
ing there a stair perhaps had
creaked or perhaps it was the yellow-
underwing moth that flapped against
the pane that made him thhxk that
there was something astir

the garden into which they now
stepped was as violet had said
a mere jungle of wild and riotous
growth but it was easy to see how de-
lectable a plot it must have been and
to feel what overgrown charms still
lingered there it was spacious for
an enclosed space like this with
streets and houses all round it a lib-
eral acre in extent and defended by
its high brick walls from any intru-
sive eye from no quarter could it be
overlooked so tall was its mellowed
fencing and only the peaks of house-
roofs and their chimneys and the vane
on the church-tower peered above the
copings a broad strip of flower-bed
had once sunned itself along the
house-front bordered by box-hedg-
ing a paved walk led by it and
beyond had been a stietch of lawn up
to the farther wall to the left the
plot had once been divided by a trellis
that now leaned tipsily askew this
way and that with great gaps in it
through which could be seen fruit-
trees now in flower on this spring
afternoon there no doubt had been
the kitchen-garden but now rank
weeds and grasses had triumphed over
everything on lawn and border the
paved walk was plumed with them
and thickly overlaid with mosses
creepers that must once have been
trained up the walls sprawled fallen
across the ground-growths and ten-
drils of degenerated rose-trees thread-
the shuttered room



ed their thorns through the shrubby
clumps of the box-edgings

 the two men pushed across the
lawn through briers and thick grasses
and entanglements but violet said
she had had enough and sat down to
wait for them on a stone bench
crumbled and mossy which stood on
the edge of the paved walk the
charm of the place struggled with the
melancholy disorder of it and she could
imagine it cultivated and cared for
with its beds glowing again with or-
dered jewels its lawn smooth-napped
its paved walks free of the tangle
of growth but there was something
more than this tangle of weeds that
had to be cleared away before peace
could return to it something beyond
mere neglect was amiss with it some-
thing dead but horribly alive was
w-atching her even as in the shuttered
room at the head of the stairs   

  the stone seat faced the sun and
a little dazzled by its brightness
though delighting in the genial
warmth of it after the airless seclu-
sion of the house violet closed her
eyes wondering what it could be that
wrought this strange perturbation
within her hugh and mr hodgkin
had vanished now behind the crazy
trellis their voices no longer came to
her and she felt extraordinarily sun-
dered from the touch of human inter-
course and yet she was not alone
there was some presence not theirs
moving up closer to her and watching
her once she opened her eyes to re-
assure herself that it was only her
imagination thus playing tricks with
her but of course there was nothing
there and again she closed them an
odd drowsiness invaded her and she
saw a shadow come across the red field
of her closed eyelids she thought to
herself that the two men were ap-
proaching her and that it was they
who had come between her and the
sun and she waited for the sound of
their voices or their steps perhaps
hugh thought she was asleep and
meant to give her forty winks or so

if that was in his mind she wished
lie would stand aside for with him
cutting off the sunlight from her the
air had become very cold she gave
a little shiver and opened her eyes
there was no one there

  it was startling she had felt quite
sure there had been someone standing
close in front of her but it certainly
was not hugh nor indeed was there
any sign of a living presence but
there he was stepping over the fallen
trellis and coming quickly toward
her

  violet dear he said isnt the
place utterly enchanting im going
to have all the rags and rubbish
turned out of the house at once and
get it washed and cleaned and re-
newed i shall furnish it too and put
a caretaker in and then well bring
the garden into order again then
when its all habitable we can settle
what we shall do with it let it or
sell it or keep it what extraordinary
odd fellows they must have been liv-
ing in squalor and discomfort and let-
ting everything go to ruin but i
shall restore it all with the money they
saved over it and frankly ive
fallen in love writh the place i want
to keep it terribly

hugh set to work with his usual
volcanic energy to put the place
in order again he and violet took
rooms at the inn near and spent hot
and laborious days in turning out the
dirty raffle that filled the house re-
serving for later examination any
papers that might possibly be of in-
terest all the upholstery was per-
ished  carpets curtains and rugs were
only fit for the fire there were cup-
boards and presses full of threadbare
stuffs moth-eaten blankets and moldy
linen and a clean sweep had to be
made of all these before the cleaning
and redecoration of the house could
begin day after day a bonfire in the
kitchen-garden smoldered and burst
into flames and smoldered again for
little even of the solider furniture was


weird tales

serviceable rickety tables and broken-
seated chairs seemed to have been
sufficient for the uncles after that
the walls must be stripped of their
tom and flapping papers and scraped
of their discolored paint the roof
must be repaired ceilings and fittings
of doors and windows renovated to
violet all this holocaust of moldy
raffles signified something more than
the mere material cleaning-up even
as the opening of windows long-closed
and the admission into the house of
the air and the sun and the wholesome
winds did more than refresh the stale-
ness of its actual atmosphere both
were symbolical outward signs of some
interior purging and yet even when
all was clean and empty ready for its
new furnishing the very essence of
what they had been turning out still
lingered all was not well with the
house in some strange manner the
shadow that had come between her
closed eyes and the sun as she sat on
the garden-bench had entered and
was establishing itself more firmly
day by day

  she knew how fantastic such a
notion was and so though it per-
sisted she could not bring herself to
speak to hugh about it it haunted
the rooms and the passages and
though she got no direct vision of its
presence it was there like some shy
creature wary in hiding itself but yet
wishing to make itself manifest some-
times it seemed malignant sometimes
sad and pitiful most of all it was
perceptible in that pleasant square
room at the top of the stairs which
they had found shuttered where the
bedclothes were turned back as if he
who had slept there had just quitted
itand where the apparatus of a mans
toilet still lay on the dressing-table
the room so the charwoman had told
them occupied by henry lister had
this presence something to do with
him she wondered she felt it also
in the room downstairs occupied after
his disappearance by robert there
she felt it as something fierce or re-

vengeful finally she began to won-
der whether hugh was conscious that
there was something queer in that
room at the head of the stairs for at
first he had intended to make his pri-
vate den there but he had abandoned
that and though the furnishing of the
house was proceeding apace he had
left it empty

it was early in may that the house
was ready to be occupied in a ten-
tative picnicking fashion vans had
been unloading all day a couple of
servants had come down and tonight
hugh and violet were to sleep here
for to be on the premises said hugh
was the surest way of speeding such
tasks as picture-hanging and carpet-
laying the dusk of the evening was
warn and he and violet were sitting
on the stone bench in the garden with
a box of papers between them which
must be looked through before they
could be consigned to the bonfire the
garden was rapidly being tamed the
lami had been scythed in preparation
for the mowing-machine the paved
walk had been cleared of moss and
weeding was going on in the beds

 but the soil is wretched and
sour said hugh as he untied a
bundle of papers that bed by the
house must be dug over deep and a
cartload of rich stuff put in before its
fit for planting hullo a photograph
   why its of the two uncles and
was taken here in the garden theyre
sitting on the stone bench where we
are now before they became hermits
i suppose

  violet looked over his shoulder

 which is uncle robert she
said

  that one on the left the older of
the two the bald one

  and the other the one who dis-
appeared asked violet

  yes

  he looked up quickly as he spoke
and violet following his eye thought
she saw for a moment in the dusk
some figure standing on the paved
the shuttered room



walk twenty yards away but it re-
solved itself into a pale stain on the
wall and a bush immediately below
and she took another glance at the
faded photograph there was a strong
family resemblance between them
she would have guessed that the two
faces rather long-nosed with eyes
very wide apart were those of broth-
ers but they were quite distinguish-
able

  presently hugh came to the end of 
the packet and he took the bulk of
it to toss on to the smoldering bon-
fire the evening was now beginning
to get chilly and when he had gone
she rose and took a turn down the
paved walk the light from the west
glowed dusky-red on the brick front
of the house and glancing idly up at
the window of the room at the head
of the stairs she saw a man standing
there within looking down on her
the glimpse she got of his face was
but brief for almost immediately he
turned away but she had seen enough
to know that it was the face of the
younger of the two brothers at whose
photograph she had just been looking

  for one moment sheer terror
clutched at her the next as if by
some subtle recognition her mind told
her that here was the visible mani-
festation of the presence of which she
had for days been conscious it was
he who had shadowed her closed eye-
lids it was he who as yet unseen had
haunted the house and in especial the
room at the window of which she now
beheld him though the flesh of her
still quaked at the thought that she
had looked on one who had passed be-
yond the dread dim gate it was ter-
ribly interesting and she continued
looking up half dreading half hoping
that she would see him again then
she heard hughs step returning from
his errand

  whats the matter violet he
said youre white your hands are
trembling  

  she pulled herself together

  its nothing she said some-
thing startled me just now

  looking at him she guessed with a
sense of certainty what was in his
mind when he asked her what was the
matter

  hugliie have you seen something
too that-that comes from beyond
she asked

  he shook his head

  no but i know its there he
said and its chiefly in that room at
the top of the stairs thats why ive
done nothing with it have you seen
it was it that which startled you
just now what was it

  she pointed to the window

  there she said a man looked
out on me from the window it was
henry lister his room you know

  they were both looking up now
and even as she spoke the figure ap-
peared there again once more it
turned away and vanished

  for a long moment they met each
others eyes

  violet are you frightened he
said

  im not going to be she said
whatever it is whatever its here
for it cant hurt us i think it wants
us to do something for it    but
hughie why did robert scream out
have mercy avhy did he run from
the house

  hugh had no answer for this

  i shall go in he said at length
and open the door of that room and
see what is there i left it locked i
know dont come with me violet

    but i wish to   she said  i want
to know all that there is to be known
what we have seen means some-
thing

  they went upstairs -together and
paused for a second outside the door
the key was in the lock and hugh
turned it and threw the door wide

  the room was lit by the fading eve-
ning light but clearly visible it was
completely furnished as on the day
when they had first looked into it on


weird tales

the bed there lay the figure of a man
faintly twitching his face was turned
away but with a final movement his
head fell back on the pillows and
they saw who it was the mouth
drooped open the cheeks and fore-
head were of a mottled purple in
color and round the neck was tied a
cord    and then they saw that they
were looking into a perfectly empty
room unfurnished but newly papered
and painted

the deep digging-over of the
flower-bed along the house front
began next morning and an hour
later the gardener came in to tell
hugh what he had found the dig-
ging was resumed under the super-
vision of the police-inspector and the
body when disinterred was removed
to the mortuary the identity was
established at the inquest it was
established also that death had been
due to strangulation for a piece of
rope was still tied round the neck
though there could be no absolute
certainty as to the history of the mur-
der only one reconstruction of it
would fit the facts which were known
namely that henry lister had been
strangled by his brother during the
night preceding his disappearance
and buried in the garden very early
next morning robert lister who in
height and general appearance strong-

ly resembled his brother must have
gone down to the river-bank having
been seen on his way there by the
laborer from the town and left his
cap on the path and thrown the stick
ino the river he must also with a
diabolical cunning have arranged his
brothers room to look as if he had got
up and dressed himself as usual he
then returned and an hour or two
later went to mr hodgkins house
saying that he had found the front
door open and that his brother was
missing no search was made in the
house or garden for the evidence all
pointed to his having dressed and
gone out and met his death in the
river why robert lister in that
seizure of panic which gripped him
just before he died called on his
brother to have mercy on him was no
affair for police investigation but it
seems likely that he saw or thought
he saw some very terrible thing some
strange specter such as was certainly
seen by hugh and violet in the room
at the top of the stairs but that is
conjecture only

  the two brothers now lie side by
side in the cemetery on the hill out-
side trenthorpe it may be added that
in all england there is no more whole-
some or tranquil house than that
which was once the scene of so tragic
a history and of so grim and ghostly
a manifestation
hy come to me with your
worries i asked the old
people rather petulantly
any man could find your daughter
for you and there are many good men
in your own land

  i was irritated

  ever since the time i slew the drag-
on of thorps woods the people of
cornwall thought that all they had to
do in time of trouble was to come to

me for a while i tried to be consid-
erate i really thought at one time
that perhaps it was part of my duties
as overlord of the land to kill ser-
pents destroy giants and in every
way make the country a pleasant and
kindly place to live in to live up to
these high ideals gave me little leisure
to devote to my special studies and
often i was no sooner back from one
adventure and comfortably clad in my

                                 

the headless stump bled a white blood
that shone on the floor of the cave


weird tales

velvets with my nose between the
pages of a book than a fresh demand
made it necessary to put on my armor
again and sally out to rout a few more
robbers or cut the head off another
slithering snake it was hard to be
so disturbed from the reading of a
good book and in wintertime the har-
ness and armor were so cold that only
after some hours of wearing did my
goose-flesh subside and enable ue to
ride my charger with any comfort

  now for some weeks everything in
cornwall had been quiet if there
were any dragons remaining they
thought it best to hide in secret rock
eaves while all the robbers had fled
to wales and brittany and the giants
were all rotting in their gore as far
as my sway extended all was quiet
and i felt that i had well earned a
rest it was cold the roads were deep
in mire the sky overcast my good
steed was comfortable knee-deep in
straw and munching the best grain
my peasants could raise i had large
logs in the fireplace now cushions to
sit on a woolen shawl for my knees
and another for my shoulders old
wine in the glass a joint of meat on
the table and a book in my hand why
should i worry about wrongs done in
wales  lands of the scot  irish

  then after but a few days of com-
fort these old folks came they
brought with them a long parchment
bearing the scrawl and seal of the
king of wales that did not mean
much to me for they were changing
their king every month but it had so
impressed my men that they had
brought the old folks to the door of
my library and when i refused to
see them and ordered them fed and
put out of the castle they raised such
a lamentable cry that from sheer ne-
cessity i gave way to their moans and
ordered them in to tell their story

  they were wet and cold so i gave
them a place by the fire and they
seemed hungry so i ordered meat and
wine brought them and i told them
for the sake of good saint jerome to

fill up and dry up first and then i
would listen to what they came to say
to me thus i gained an extra half
hour of time to read my book and
when i saw this much time slip down
the narrow channel of the sand-glass
and found that in this space of time
i had translated over four lines of
latin i was much cheered and almost
tempted to be civil to the old folks

  the story they told was a familiar
one their daughter had been taken
from them they believed that she was
being held a prisoner in one of the
mountain caves a dozen miles from
their hut what manner of man or
beast had done this foul deed they
knew not there were strange tales
about the things that lived in that
mountain they had been to see the
king of their land and he had asked
in vain among all his knights for one
to rescue the maiden they had all re-
fused to undertake the adventure
then he had thought of writing to me
concerning the wrong done these old
folks and asking me to right it as
they became more excited they raised
their hands and swore that never was
there such a lovely girl as their
daughter nor so pure a one and why
had the saints permitted this terror
to come to her 

  naturally i was sorry for them
yet it seemed to me that i was being
imposed upon and that the knights of
wales ought to attend to their own
giants and dragons so when they
finally came to the end of their tale i
gruffly said

  why come to me with your wor-
ries any man could find your
daughter for you and there are many
good men in your own land  

  at that they cried out that i was
wrong and the woman said over and
over again no other man no other
man no other man which
was all silly nonsense being foolish
and far from the truth

  however it all ended hi my telling
them to go to bed and rest and that
 the morrow i would return with
no other man



them and see what could be done con-
cerning the safety of their daughter
though i doubted if she were yet
alive so sending them off to a good
nights rest i ordered fresh logs put
on the fire and some spiced beer
warmed for my comfort and started
in to read the adventures of a good
knight hercules who was either a bet-
ter fighter or a better liar than i ever
could hope to become and finally i
also sought the warmth of a feather-
bed and disturbed in mind waited
for what the morrow would bring

the next day in a drizzle of rain
- we started for some town in
wales the proper sounding of whose
name i never did learn the old dame
and her man rode slowly ahead on
two sorry nags while behind them i
rode my f avorite st allion

  the woolens and leathers i wore
under my armor had been well
warmed and greased before i stained
but the day was chill and in no time
at all i became depressed over the
cold of the harness on my back so i
tried to pass the time reciting latin
verbs which made the old folks shiver
and cross themselves for that they
thought my mutterings to be impre-
cations and incantations against the
power of the evil one and now and
then my stallion reared in the air and
neighed perhaps for his warm stall
and his hearty meals of grain and
perhaps for other things but i gruf-
fly commanded him to come down to
earth on all fours

  so on we drove for the space of five
days at night we slept where we
could and by day we rode and suf-
fered from the chill of the cold rain
i had some gold with me and so could
pay for the best but even the best
was sorry worst and ever and again
i sighed for my velvets and my fire
good beer and latin manuscripts yet
an end finally came and we arrived
at the house of the old man and his
wife it was raining as we came
there and the sky was dark and low-

ering yet through the gloom i could
see the dark mountains far in the dis-
tance covered with mighty trees and
holding in their mysterious fastnesses
this supposedly lovely daughter and
the unknown monster that had tom
her from her parental home

  when the news of our arrival was
spread through the little town the
neighbors came no doubt to see the
giant-killer and whether they were
disappointed in my looks i wot
not at least they did not say so
however since i had come all this
long five-day journey to accomplish
another wondrous feat of chivalry i
was glad to have these simple folk
to talk to for i wanted to know all
that there was to be known about
the land and the special monsters it
harbored and just how this young
maiden had been taken and what
manner of fiend it was that had done
the deed for i found that such pre-
liminary investigation was of the
greatest value in winning a victory
also i was glad to have some of the
simple folk to carefully dry my annor
andi rub it with lard and oil and also
to nib over my cold muscles a special
holy oil which came to me in a gold
vial from the holy land being part
of the lard boiled from a great saint
during his martyrdom which lard
was very com foiling to me both in a
physical and a religious manner

  all of the men had a different tale
to tell about the monster none had
actually seen it but all agreed that it
was a serpent twenty yards long a
shape like a great unicorn a headless
man a bull with the head of a man
a real dragon like unto those of gobi
or a three-legged giant all agreed
that it was a mighty horrid thing that
could easily kill a man simply by
blowing a flame of fire in his face
the usual weapons were powerless
steel could not cut lance could not
pierce mace would not crush the
more they talked the more peculiar
i felt and the more clearly i saw why
the knights of wales were too busy


weird tales

to attend to this matter it was really
an awkward situation

  yet they were all mightily cheered
over my being there and said re-
peatedly that if any human man could
kill this monster the giant-killer of
cornwall could and i told them i was
sure i could find the maiden and rid
the land of this foul animal be it
man beast or demon and at that
a very old jew bent before me and
humbly thanked me and said that he
would give me fifty gold crowns if
i did so as he was betrothed to this
maiden having purchased her from
her father and that the wedding
would have been consummated by
now had the fiend of the mountains
not taken her

  i looked at the old man his with-
ered face and shrunken frame and
scanty white hair and the more i saw
of him the less i liked him and
thought to myself that perhaps the
girl was better off in the mountain
than in his house in tact i suddenly
grew sick of the whole adventure and
demanded that i be taken to my room
and left to sleep till the morrow and
so they did to me and a restless time
i had missing sorely my feather-bed
as i tossed on a couch of com shucks

  the next morning the entire people
of the town gathered to see me put on
my armor and after that was done
and a quart of beer drunk moodily
for it was poor stuff i sadly
mounted my horse and rode toward
the mountain the priest going ahead
singing a prayer and the old man
and woman on either side my horse
and the old jew running on behind
urging me to be careful and that he
would surely give me my fifty crowns

  the old woman kept repeating
no other man would do it no other
man  

  would be such a fool i added
in a whisper no other man why
a thousand men i had read of would
have been glad to do such a deed-
only i who had cleared my own
country of such monsters was a fool

to do such dirty work for the men of
wales

  and the old man and the priest and
the jew took up her chant no other
man would do it-no other man
yet finally we came to the edge of
the wood and a mile from the side of
the mountain and they paused and
said they would go no further with me
but would go back and wait in prayer
for my safe return

the trees were so close together
that i could not ride my charger
so i got off and tied him to a tree
and then i looked into the wood it
was dark and feyish yet through the
trees came glittering glimmering
gems of sunshine and far away i
heard a thrush sing and a squirrel
chatter in the tree and i knew then
that i was in the enchanted forest
for here was springtime and pleasant
weather it being warm i took a view
of the situation and saw that i could
not fight well with all the steel on me
so back to my horse and there i made
myself comfortable and when i next
wended woodward i had on my wool-
ens and my great sword hung on my
back my shield on one arm a dagger
in my belt and a lovely woods flower
in my right hand

  thus on to the rocks and nearing
them i heard the sound of singing
and the song was about love and roses
and ladies tresses and i marveled at
this and knew that it was magic and
further on i wandered and finally
came to the singer and at that i was
greatly frightened for i knew that
now i was in the midst of a great
mystery and a mighty magic for
this evil beast who had stolen the poor
girl from her parents had in prep-
aration for my arrival changed by
his cunning his so ugly body into that
of a lovely damsel and was waiting
there to deceive me and when i was
unaware to kill me with his poisons
and his powers

  i knew that it was useless to cut
such a being with sword or piereo
no other man



him with dagger his body was so
much air in sueh a conflict weapons
of ordinary use were worthless so
i carefully put off my sword and my
shield and my dagger and holding
the woods flower in my outstretched
hand i elosed in to the conflict

  though thou art a mighty ma-
gician i cried i command you to
give to me the poor little girl you
stole from her parents on ash wed-
nesday give her to me and i will
not harm you but if you persist in
your evil desires i will match my
magic with yours and overcome you

  who are you demanded the
creature and wrhy are you here

  i could tell from the way he talked
that he was impressed by my threat

  i am the overlord of cornwall
cecil the son of james the son of
david the son of john and back even
to saint christopher who loved be-
fore he became a saint for years i
have raled in cornwall you may be
interested in knowing that i am the
one who killed the dragon of thorps
woods i destroyed seven slithering
shimmering snakes in ireland alone
and unaided i destroyed seven moors
who threatened the reputation of one
of our ladies on twenty-three gal-
lows in my land hang bound in
chains and coated with tar twenty-
three bandits whom i caught and
caused to be punished for their
crimes

  i paused to watch the effect of all
this there wtas no doubt that the mis-
creant was impressed so i continued

  so it was that when this poor girl
who by the way was to marry a very
rich man was stolen from her parents
these simple folk appealed to the king
of wales and he pled with his knights
to rescue her but they all refused be-
ing too busy so he sent a special
letter to me and for five days i rode
over the worst roads possible to effect
this great deed i think that you had
better submit quietly and let me re-
store the girl to her parents and to
her future husband because if you

refuse i will have to fight and over-
come you no matter what shape you
may assume

  at that the monster started to cry
she will never go back and marry
that miserable old man it would be
better for her to die  

  i realized at once that this was
simply a part of the deception that
the horrific monster was trying to im-
pose on me with so i grew stem

  she must go back i said harsh-
ly and twirling the woods flower in
my hand to distract his attention i
advanced on him for it wtas my pur-
pose to suddenly spring forward take
him by the throat and squeeze him to
death before he had a chance to
change his form from that of a lovely
woman to his usual one of a dragon
or six-legged scorpion

  the monster looked at me the eyes
he had assumed were blue the face
fair and smooth as a rose petal but his
mouth was a lovely red bow the
body he had taken for a disguise was
fair and under the silken robe
swayed with the seductive curves of
a grecian aphrodite suddenly he
started to cry

 no other man he sobbed
would make me go back and marry

that old jew no other man-

  but by then i had jumped forward
and crushed him in my arms

some days later i came out of the dark
forest my poor charger had eaten
all the grass within his reach had
broken loose but true to his master
had remained near the armor i
slowly put the heavy pieces back on
being minded to thus return to the
town then i mounted and drew the
damsel up in front of me and thus
we slowly rode back to the town

  to my surprize i was mot there by
a great concourse of armed men it
seems that the king of wales and his
knights hearing that i had gone into
the mountains  such a grim adven-
ture had gathered to my rescue and
had i not appeared that day would
q

weird tales

have searched for my bones to give
them christian burial my sudden
arrival made such a search unneces-
sary  so there was nothing to do but
make merry over my return from this
so great adventure and allow the
feasting and merrymaking to take
the place of solemn masses for the
peace of my soul

  at the banquet table i commanded
that the damsel sit next to me and
said that there were very necessary
reasons wthy this should be done then
came the feasting and the talking the
welsh being very brave at both of
such indoor sports the king of
wales told how proud they were to
have the overlord of cornwall take
part in such a glorious adventure the
father of the girl told of his joy and
thanksgiving for her safe return the
aged jew handed me a silk bag with
the fifty gold crowns in it as the re-
ward he had offered and then he
begged the monarch that the wedding
go on while all the world was there
and that he would give fine presents
to every one of the guests but i rose
in my place and said

  i can not let this jew die

  what do you mean asked the
king

  to explain i replied will be a
pleasure to me though i can not do
so without telling of my overcoming
of this great welsh monster in the
mountain cave if in the telling i
seem at times to be boastful you will
pardon my pride for really the deed
was a great deed and well done i do
not want to tell all the details but it
will be necessary for me to do so in
order to show why it is impossible
for the jew to marry her because
he is a good jew and i do not want
him to die

  when i came to the woods i heard
a horrific hissing and knew by the
sound that the monster was trying to
frighten me so leaving my horse i
advanced carefully and as the wood
grew darker i sawr the flashing of
lightning and these flashes came from

the eyes of the dragon finally i
came near enough to see the creature
and you may judge of my surprize
when i tell you that it was a worm
many feet long but instead of feet
like a millipede it had arms and
hands and each hand grasped a weap-
on sharp as a dagger and poisoned
with deadly dragons doom there
were three heads and i might remark
here that a three-headed monster is
not new to me i having killed several
of them in gorkiland but in this case
only one had a face on it the other
two being smooth of features save a
mouth that dripped blood and spittle
it had no sign of fear and rushed on
me and for over an hour i had need
of all my skill defending myself from
its weapons i used as is my wont in
such cases my two-handed sword and
finally succeeded in cutting off one of
the heads it howled mournfully and
ran into its cave

  i rushed after it and was not sur-
prized to find a large cavern well-
lighted with the baleful light from the
monsters eyes also the headless
stump bled a white blood that shone
on the floor of the cave

  the fighting now was hard be-
cause i was constantly stumbling over
the bones of maidens he had pre-
viously ravished and devoured at
last i snipped off another head and
now the monster retreated into a still
smaller cave chained to the wall of
this cavern was the little girl who
had been stolen from her parents and
who would have been destroyed body
and soul at the next full moon had
i not come when i was called for

 the dragon now assumed the
shape of an old magician and breath-
ing harshly asked me to leave him at
peace offering to share the beauty of
the maiden with me if i did so of
course i scorned such a dastardly
offer and calling on him to defend
himself i rushed on him with my
dagger seeing that he was doomed
by the power of his magic he met-
amorphosed himself into a bubble of
no other man



air and vanished down the maidens
throat

  i have brought her back the
monster is still within her waiting
for a chance to eome forth and destroy
all of you good people of wales if
this poor maiden married the jew the
monster would sally forth on the
bridal night and tear him to pieces
if she remains here the whole village
is in danger only is the world safe so
long as he realizes that i am close at
hand to strangle him to death at his
first appearance

  the audience shivered and seemed
stunned by my tale

  finally the king asked what are
your plans and why should you
undergo such a risk to save the life af
a jew or of the simple folks of this
village

    i propose to take the unfortunate
girl with me to cornwall i shall
watch her closely on the trip if the
monster comes from out her i will
at once kill him and return her to the
parents and the jew if he still sulks
in her midgut by the time i reach
cornwall i shall give her rare med-
icines i know of and thus gradually
the monster will die within her i am
a lone man without wife or children
and it is better for me to take this
great risk even if i die for it than
to have all these good people die in
one night of slaughter besides i
know a lot about devils and their man-
ner of action and thus it is best for
me to keep the maiden near me till
this fiend is thoroughly destroyed

  oh kind sir cried the mother
how can we thank you you are
too good to us no other man would
have done all the wondrous things just
for strangers i will feel so safe with
my daughter in your care

  and the jew came up to me on his
knees and humbly handed me a gold
chain and thanked me for saving his
life from a horrible tearing at the
hands of this monster

tow it was late in the afternoon
yet as the day was warm i in-
sisted that i depart for cornwall so
up i got me on my charger and i put
the maiden up in front of me and in
back was a bundle of presents of jew-
els and fine silken stuffs from the king
and his knights and i wore all my
armor save my helmet which i had
tied to my saddle and wore instead a
little velvet cap

  so we said a kindly farewell to all
those people

  the king rode down the road with
me

  art sure dear sibling he asked
as he prepared to leave me art sure
the damsel hath the devil hi her

  certainly i replied very se-
riously

  then she be a true woman he
answered for all women i have ever
met are thus inhabited  

  with this he winked at me and
turning trotted his horse back to the
town w here his company waited on
him

  ruth and i fared on through the
summer afternoon more and more
as the sun lowered in the kindly sky
she leaned heavily against me and
now and then she sighed as she looked
up at me with those blue eyes and
asked dost see aught of the mon-
ster peering from my mouth   

  nay i replied holding her
eloser so that she need not be fright-
ened

  yet i fear me that it cometh out
drive it back my heart

  and so i did with kisses

  how stubborn that devil was how
hard to drive back  so the
maiden was satisfied

  finally she gasped

  no other man she whispered
would have done it as you did

  no other man i echoed

  and once again i drove the devil
back from her mouth

 the inheritors

      by august w derleth

theee is no longer any valid
reason for withholding the
true facts of the tragedy at
hudson heights from the public and
i chronicle these facts now in response
to the pressure of public opinion

  the matter really began with mom-
sens note of the seventh asking me
down for the seventeenth or before if
possible momsen was an odd chap
but always intensely interesting our
mutual interest in archeology had
brought us together some years before
from the first momsen had been in-
terested in old houses a mere in-
terest had developed into a passion
and within the half-year preceding the
note of the seventh i heard from mu-
tual friends that he had finally ac-
quired an old colonial mansion some-
where along the hudson he had
named it aptly enough hudson
heights

  it was at this place that momsen met
me at midday of the seventeenth he
was little changed except that faint
lines had appeared around his mouth
and eyes his hair too was graying
at the temples

    i thought you werent coming old
man id about given up hope he
laughed as he took my suitcase and
again when i explained that i had
been detained at the office i might
have suspected that he said

  he disappeared into another room
with my belongings when he re-
turned i began to question him-
could it be his birthday i daresay
i amused him for he brushed my
questions aside explaining that he
had ealled me down because he


thought me the most reliable of all his
acquaintances for the thing we were
to go through this was a point
gained and i urged him on

  you notice theres a striking lack
of servants he asked

  i nodded i had noticed it and had
intended asking about it in a house
like this and with the money that
momsen made no secret of having the
absence of servants was inexcusable

  every year the servants take off
on the seventeenth of this month
prior to this year even the owners
of the place were out of it on that
day

  why i asked in ill-concealed
wonder

  he shrugged his shoulders on
the seventeenth of february this
place is turned over to the ghost or
ghosts whichever it is only on this
date is the house haunted

  with this he rose refusing to an-
swer my questions and promised to
take the matter up in detail at din-
ner that evening

dusk was coming on when we
seated ourselves at the table in
the old dining-room momsen began
his story without hesitation though
i noticed that he was vaguely discon-
certed by the absence of the servants
for more than once his hand stole out
toward the bell cord as if to ring the
bell in the servants quarters beyond
that he was perfectly at his ease

  the whole thing started in 
on the night of the seventeenth of
february one henrik van damm
then owner of this place much the
the inheritors



same at that time as it is now was
fatally stabbed with a rapier while he
was at table he was stabbed in the
back so the story goes and did not
know who stabbed him nor would
anyone tell him for i understand he
wras cordially hated he cursed all in
the house on that day in the double
breath that remained to him before
he died a great many versions of the
curse got about of course but every-
one seemed to agree that the curse
would pass off only when the oldest
of four generations of the murderers
descendants had been killed

  that much sounds as if it might
have happened doesnt it

  i nodded it struck me then that i
had read of the incident in some old
history of new york but at the mo-
ment i found it impossible to trace my
source

  what follows doesnt sound so
plausible it seems that everyone in
that house on the seventeenth died
within a year-quite naturally how-
ever i understand it was thought
somewhat unusual that all those peo-
ple should die before the following
february but coincidence was not
ruled out some people put the whole
aftermath down to coincidence but
most of the natives candidly professed
the belief that the deaths had oc-
curred through the diabolism of the
dead van damm

  after that the place stood vacant
for a good many years in  a
well-to-do new yorker took the place
remodeled it somewhat and prepared
to live in it in the house this man
found a packet of letters that proved
conclusively that milady van damms
lover had killed the old man it had
been prearranged and on the basis
of the general hatred of old van
damm it was carried out without
even a protest from his wife at any
rate nothing remained to make any-
one hesitate about living in the house
in  on the first seventeenth of
february that he was in the house
the newr owner died the doctors said

that there had been some heart trou-
ble but it got around that there was
a curious burnt mark on the mans
breast a year later the mans son
and heir died in precisely the same
way then the family decamped
and of course the curse and its his-
tory were bruited about once more
on the strength of the letters found
an addition was made to the curse-
that those who lived in the house be-
fore the time of the curse had expired
would inherit the curse and all its
evil but the real inheritors were to
remain the oldest in each of the four
successive generations of the murder-
ers line

  at this point too strong a coinci-
dence to be disregarded enters into
the story you have been aware of
my eccentricities among them the
peculiar and inexplicable dread that
i undergo on the seventeenth of feb-
ruary

  i recollected that momsen had once
said something and said as much he
went on

  well the letters found in 
gave the name of the murderer as
moomsenn which is not entirely like
mine but similar enough to be taken
as an old form of my name that
fact in itself means nothing of course
but when you add to that the knowl-
edge of my grandfathers sudden
death after the birth of his only son
my father and my fathers tragic ac-
cident on the night of my birth the
coincidence begins to take definite
form to top it off i might add that
we know absolutely nothing about our
ancestry beyond my grandfather it
is entirely possible you see that the
lover of milady van damm was a
lineal ancestor of mine-my great-
grandfather most probably

  rot i exclaimed

  in that case he went on without
hesitation he would have been the
first of the inheritors and i will be-
the fourth  

  i ridiculed the suggestion and he
freely accepted the ridicule he con-


weird tales

sidered the ehanee remote and had
only mentioned it as such

  but to go on with the story of the
house he said at last in  it
was again occupied since the region
was saturated with the legends con-
cerning the house it was thought ad-
visable to vacate it on the seven-
teenth of february this was done
regularly until  when the head
of the house excused the servants but
stayed in the building himself to-
gether with his family he was found
dead on the morning of the eight-
eenth doctors again said heart
trouble but no doctor could explain
the burnt mark on the mans breast
after that the house was faithfully
vacated on successive seventeenths of
february

  thus in time the legend got
about that old henrik van damm re-
turns on the night of february sev-
enteenth to kill the head of the house
psychic investigators say that the
house is merely the abode of forces of
evil which manifest themselves on
that particular night and it is true
that no one has ever seen a ghost
here it is my opinion that all this
is a vast coincidence you and i are
up here to prove that statement to-
night-and i hope well do it

  but there are several things that
bother me and one in particular
when i first got into this house some-
thing happened that ive never quite
forgotten in a moment when my
mind was wandexing i got up one
day from the table and walked into
the wall as if to pass through a door
later when i looked over old plans
of the house i found that there had
originally been a door in that place
but that it had been sealed over in


  i said nothing for i frankly did
not know how to take the story it
was considerably outside my ken you
can imagine the reaction of a staid
business man in such a position

  well i said at last im will-
ing to face the ghost if you are

  he nodded and set about clearing
the table

txhat happened after that im
  not certain i know that mom-
sen and i sat and drank of his good
liquor until both of us were feeling
somewhat unnecessarily gay under the
circumstances it all started when
momsen got up from the table and
went to the door he stuck his head
out into the hall then came back to
the table

  i say he said do you smell
anything

  no i answered but even as i
said it a faint whiff of smoke came
to my nostrils

  sulfur isnt it asked mom-
sen

  i agreed with him got any in
the house i asked

  none and nothing that would
smell like that im sure it must
come from outside just notice how
the drapes of that window billow in-
ward-whered that wind eome from
so suddenly

  perhaps the liquors had made both
of us rather hazy the lights seemed
suddenly dim momsen stood op-
posite me his eyes were raised some-
what they were fixed on the window
opening on the terrace i turned
there was nothing there save the
drapes being whipped to and fro by
the wind the atmosphere was heavy
with the odor of some obnoxious drug
that seemed to deaden us a swirling
fog seemed to fill the room momsen
raised an arm suddenly and pointed
look he screamed look
but i could see nothing the air
was cold with a ghastly chill and from
a distance came the sound of feet run-
ning-it was as if they were coming
toward us with the wind that had
arisen from some eldritch source and
was sweeping now through the old
dining-room then there sounded far
away a eiy rising and falling de-
moniac shrill fraught with horror
the inheritors



at the same moment momsen s face
twisted utterly in the dim light that
fell on him he looked grisly the
shadows of his face stood out like great
black holes in his white skin

  look his voice whispered eeri-
ly look

  he flung out his arms as if to wtard
off something then he fell flat on his
face

  at once the eery disturbance was
stopped the rushing whistling wind
avas gone the drapes at the windows
swayed gently there were no sounds
of running feet nor weird cries from
the sky the lights became brighter

  for a moment i stood there trying
to recover myself i remember that
i reached for the decanter of liquor
before i thought of momsen then i
ran to him  the shock has been too
much for him i thought and bent
to pick him tip

  his hand was cold as ice it needed

no expert to tell that he was dead i
turned him over on his back his eyes
were wide and staring-his face was
a picture of abject terror but it
was his breast that attracted my im-
mediate attention ilis dinner coat
and vest were virtually burned away
so that his breast lay exposed just
below the breast-bone was a dark
brownish discoloration as if a long-
dead wound had burned itself to the
surface it looked for all the world
as if the point of a rapier had come
through from the back leaving the
flesh burned in this unholy manner

  the-fourth-inheritor i mur-
mured half beside myself

  even as i said it there came a
whirling breath of ice-cold air that
struck me full in the face passed and
was gone i turned the long drapes
at the window were shuddering but
above the horror of it all i felt a vast
brooding sense of peace

a short iveird-scientijic story

the depths of the lens

         by n r mcfarland



excerpt from the notebook of rob-
ert jamson

the affair started when i was
given a small specimen by a
friend of mine a student of
geology who had found it while search-
ing for odd stones in a pile of river
gravel the small globular crystal-
like rock had caught his eye and he
brought it to me who besides being
a chemist of some note have also
delved rather deeply into geologic re-
searches at first glance the stone re-

sembled nothing so much as a cheap
glass marble but on closer inspection
one found that it actually glowed
with a pale green light and while
its outer shape was perfectly spher-
ical if one contemplated it for very
long one saw things rather monstrous
to one brought up on as much ortho-
dox euclidean geometry as i was
tetrahedrons and other polyhedrons
mingled with decagons and other
polygons one figure seemed always
to merge into another and disappear
giving way to others which were
dissipated in the same way the


weird tales

sides of tiie plane figures and the
edges of the solid ones were not
straight but curving lines that
wavered like lines of smoke and then
changed position if i concentrate
deeply on some other subject how-
ever this fancy can be thrown off and
the globe will seem almost normal
again

  i am perfectly sure knowing what
i do of this stone that it was never
created on this earth it may have
been brought from the far reaches of
interstellar space by a meteor or-
ridiculous thought in one who has
alwav pooh-poohed all such imagina-
tive ideas-it may have been left in
the river-bed by an expedition from a
far world

  be that is it may i now use this
globe as a lens for a new form of
microscope i have invented which
stands before me as i write impelled
by idle curiosity i one day inserted
it in the tube and was surprized by
the result perhaps because of the un-
usual geometrical figures within or
for some other equally peculiar
reason this lens not only magnifies
greatly but gives an examiner the ef-
fect of being on the glass slide instead
of above it when i observe crystals
of any sort through this lens i seem
to be beside towering and geometri-
cally correct buildings in orthorhom-

bic	monoclinic or any other of the
myriad forms of crystals a powdered
chemical seen through it gives one the
effect of being surrounded by immense
boulders or rocks during the course
of some of these experiments i tried
a simple chemical trick every part of
the experiment being carried on under
the lens through a medicine dropper
i dropped the solution i had made up
onto the slide looking through the
eyepiece at the same time i felt that
i had been transported to another
world with that one look

  the ground under my feet was not
earth but a transparent composition
which was hard and brilliant i
seemed to be directly in front of an

immense yellow wave which was bear-
ing straight down on me it swept
on and engulfed me forcing me to
struggle for my life in the oily waves
soon i noticed to my surprize that
the level of the liquid was going down
rapidly and a thick yellow scum was
swirling and twisting in places on the
surface here was a new danger i
thought if i were not careful i should
be drawn into one of those whirl-
pools of scum but even while i was
trying to evade them they ceased to
be scum and even as i watched be-
came vast transparent yellow edifices
which grew larger each second ex-
tending in all directions i gasped in
horror as the corner of a building
grew straight toward me if i did not
move this thing would crush me
under millions of tons of transparent
yellow stone but i could not move
a muscle and like a coward closed my
eyes to wait supinely for the end

  i cant describe the agonies i en-
dured during the moment i waited
with my eyes closed when i opened
them slowly and looked up i saw
the familiar ceiling of my laboratory
with a laugh i came to myself what
a fool i was to be taken in like that
through a mere microscope then i
again bent my eye to the tube and
felt again that sensation of fear the
buildings still towered beside me but
-with what relief  realized that-
they had stopped growing i closed
my eyes again and removed my eye
from the tube i recognized the build-
ings for what they were and laughed
again

  since then i have again and again
done the same experiment i feel the
greatest horror during the time i
have the sensation of being on the
slide but by closing my eyes i am
able to escape from it and become
myself again sometimes i seem bare-
ly to escape from the building in time
and have a terrible effort to close my
eyes since that is the only way to
escape i have found out i feel that
if ever i am unable to close them i
the depths of the lens



sixall be crushed i sometimes think
that perhaps the globe brought an evil
genie with it fiom whatever dark far-
flung star it came from and that he is
trying to imprison me until i am
crushed on that glass slide but that
way lies madness it is impossible
utterly and yet when i think of
those moments of superb horror down
there i wonder

  tonight i am tortured by doubts i
know my conjectures to be impossible
but nevertheless i shall try it and
make sure i shall descend to the bot-
tom again and test out my thoughts
then when the moment comes that the
buildings grow toward me i will not
close my eyes but i will keep them
open and show myself how absurd my
fancies are

  i	have a peculiar feeling which rea-
son also tells me is ridiculous that i
am not coming back from this trip to
the slide when i look through the
microscope it seems that i am really
made smaller and that i am pro-
jected down on the slide though
whether it is the slide or the lens i
am sometimes unable to tell i have
the sensation of being on the slide
but at the same time i seem to be in
the globe perhaps my body goes to
the slide made thousands of times
smaller of course and my soul in the
form of a pink butterfly or something
of that sort to the lens well aside
with idle faxxcies and prepare for the
test i leave this notebook here on the
laboratory table in the event that i
am unable to come back from the
depths of the lens no one will believe
this account and there will be no way
to prove it if i should be crushed
my body would be so small that it

could never be seen under the great
bulk of a crystal-or building

  well i have the solution all mixed
and in the dropper here goes



clipping from the newville banner
august  

university professor disappears

  newville august -university of-
ficials and townspeople both are wondering
about the mysterious disappearance of dr
robert jamson assistant professor of chem-
istry at the university here the brilliant
young doctor was last seen at ten oclock
last night when the janitor of the building
closed up for the evening dr jamson was
engaged in research work at that time and
told the janitor that he would let himself
out since then nothing has been seen of
him a possible explanation was suggested
by a notebook left on his desk but when ex-
amined this proved to contain nothing but
rather wild ramblings one of the psychol-
ogists at the university after examining the
notebook said that the disappearance fur-
nished a remarkable example of the influ-
ence of fear but further than that he would
say nothing

  another curious article on the table was
a new form of microscope believed to have
been invented by dr jamson which had a
peculiar globular lens wliich seemed to glow
with a pale green light no explanation
could be given of this nor of the glass slide
in the microscope it was covered with
orthorhonibic crystals of sulfur of the type
formed in an elementary chemical exper-
iment when sulfur is dissolved in carbon
disulfid and allowed to crystallize out which
it does with great rapidity

  police all over the state are on the look-
out for dr jamson for whose disappearance
university officials could give no motive he
was not known to have any love affairs
and his work was proceeding very satisfac-
torily laboratory assistants however said
that he had grown increasingly moody dur-
ing the last few days ever since he was
given a queer geologic specimen which has
been mentioned as the lens of the micro-
scope
 the stranger from kurdistan

by e hoffmann price

ou claim that demonolatry
went out of existence at the
end of the middle ages that
devil-worship is extinct    no i do
not speak of the yezidis of kurdi-
stan who claim that the evil one is
as worthy of worship as god since
by virtue of the duality of all things
good could not exist without its
antithesis evil i speak rather of a
devil-worship that exists today in
this twentieth century in civilized
christian europe secret hidden yet
nevertheless quite real a worship
based upon a sacrilegious perversion
of the ritual of the church    how
do i know that is aside from the
question suffice it to say that i know
that which i know

so high was the tower of semaxii
that it seemed to caress the very
stars so deep-seated were its founda-
tions that there was more of its
great bulk beneath the ground than
there was above bathed in moon-
light was its crest swathed in seven-
fold veils of darkness was its pon-
derous base old as the pyramids
was this great pile of granite which
took its name frem the ruined city
of equal antiquity sprawled at its
base

      s

  a dark form approached advanc-
ing swiftly through the gloom-
drenched ruins a darkness among
the shadows a phantom that moved
with sinister certitude

  suddenly the shadow halted and
its immobility became a part of the
surrounding darkness other and
lesser forms passed slinking silently
to the cavernous entrance of se-
maxii there vanishing in its obscure
depths and all were unaware of the
form that had regarded them from
its vantage-point

  a cloud parted a ray of moonlight
fought its way through the cim-
merian shadows dissolving all save
one the darkest and this darkest
one it revealed as the tall form of a
man wrapped in a black cape and
wearing a high silk  hat

  another rift in the clouds more
light which now disclosed the fea-
tures as well as the form of the
shadowy stranger haughty features
with a nose like the beak of a bird
of prey the cold pitiless eye of an
aztec idol thin lips drooping in the
shadow of a cynical smile a man
relentless and magnificent in defeat

  the fools have all assembled to
pay tribute to their folly seventy-
seven of them who will tonight adore
their lord a-nd master    and with
the stranger from kurdistan



what rites  it is long since i have
witnessed 

  he paused in his reflections to
count the strokes of a bell whose
sound crept softly across the waste-
lands

  little of my last night remains
however let me waste it well

  so saying he gathered his cape
about him and swiftly strode to the
entrance of the tower

  halt snapped a voice from the
gateway

  the ray of an electric torch bit
the darkness and fell full upon the
strangers face

  halt and give the sign

  who am i to give or you to re-
ceive answered the stranger as if
intoning an incantation or reciting
a fixed formula

  pass on

  and thus the stranger passed the
outer guard of the shrine of de-
monolatry the holy of holies where
satan received the homage of his
vassals past the outer guard was
the stranger but far from the
sanctuary wherein the black mass
was celebrated wherein the lord of
the world wras worshipt with blas-
phemous rites

  a thousand steps of icy granite
winding in endless succession like
the coils of a vast earthworm led to
the foundations of the tower and
at intervals sheeted and hooded
warders halted the stranger and de-
manded sign and password and
each in turn as he received a sign
shrank and dropped his gaze before
the hard inscrutable eye of the
stranger

  dowrn down to the very basements
of the earth and then he found him-
self before a door guarded by two
masked figures garbed in vermilion
again there was an exchange of
signs after which the two vermilion
figures bowred low as the door
opened to admit him to the vaulted

sanctuary where the deni was that
night to be invoked

  the stranger doffed his high hat
then after a courtly bow to the as-
semblage strode up the aisle and
seated himself on one of the brazen
stools that were placed row after
row like the pews of a chapel once
seated he gazed about him taking
stock of his surroundings

  the black altar before him with
its crucifix bearing a hideously cari-
catured christ received but a pass-
ing glance nor was any more at-
tention accorded to the walls and
vaulted coiling whose grotesquely
obscene carvings leered at him
through the acrid smoke-laden air
like the distorted fancies of a per-
verted brain nor yet apparently
did he note the acolyte wrho wras
trimming the black candles at the
altar nor did he seem to wronder that
the floor beneath his feet was
sprinkled with powdered saffron it
was the company itself that he
studied observing with interest the
old roues and young sybarites male
and female the seventy-seven who
had assembled to adore satan their
lord and master

  in the main the seventy-seven
were persons of wealth and distinc-
tion who having tried and found
wanting every field of human en-
deavor and achievement had sought
thrills in the foulness and degrada-
tion of the mediaeval rites of devil-
worship  rakes whose jaded appetites
sought satiation in the orgies that
followed the celebration of the black
mass atheists who deeming passive
atheism an inadequate form of ic-
bcllion found expression in a ritual
whose sacrilege satisfied their icono-
clastic desires

  attendants bearing trays made
their way among the seventy-seven
offering them glasses of wine and
small amber-colored pastils these
last the worshipers either swallowed
or else dissolved ill their wine and
drank


weird tales

the stranger turned to the initiate
who occupied the stool at his
side

  tell me brother the nature of
the rites to be celebrated here to-
night

  the initiate eyed him narrowly as
he sipped his wine

  what do you mean

  why began the stranger bland-
ly i am a foreigner and i fancied
that the ritual here may be different
from what it is in my native land i
must confess he continued that i
am puzzled to see an altar and a cru-
cifix in this shrine devoted to the
worship of the evil one  

  the initiate stared at him in
amazement

  it must be a curious rite that you
witnessed do you not know that we
have a priest who celebrates the

mass and then-

  a priest interrupted the

stranger the mass why-

  surely if not a priest if not a
mass how could the arch-enemy be-
come incarnate in the bread which
we the worshipers of satan defile
and pollute as a tribute to our lord
and master surely you must be a
foreigner from some heathen land
not to know that only an ordained
priest of the church can cause the
miracle of transubstantiation to take
place but tell me who are you
you would be amazed replied
the stranger smiling enigmatically
if you knew who i am

  then before the initiate could
continue his queries a gong sounded
thinly rather as the hiss of a serpent
than as the clang of bronze a panel
of the vault opened admitting the
vermilion-robed misshapen bulk of
the priest following him were nine
acolytes likewise robed in vermilion
and bearing censers fuming with an
oveipoweringly heavy incense as
they marched slowly down the aisle
they raised their voices in a shrill
chant the seventy-seven sank to
their knees heads bowed

  the high priest halted before the
altar bowed solemnly then with
the customary gestures and phrases
went through the ritual of the mass
the kneeling acolytes making the
responses in latin he then
descended to the bottom step of the
altar and began his invocation to
satan

  oriflamme of iniquity thou who
guidest our steps and givest us
strength to endure and courage to
resist receive our petitions and ac-
cept our praise lord of the world
hear the prayers of thy servants
father of pride defend us against
the hvpociisies of the favorites of
god master thy faithful servants
implore thee to bless their iniquities
which destroy soul and conscience
alike power glory and riches they
beg of thee king of the disinherited
son who battles with the inexorable
father all this we ask of thee and
more master of deceptions re-
warder of crime lord of luxurious
vice and monumental sin satan
thee whom we adore just and logical
god

  the high priest rose faced the
altar and crucifix bearing its life-
sized mockery of a caricatured
christ and in shrill malignant ac-
cents cried out his blasphemies
and thou thou in my office as
priest i compel to descend into this
host to become incarnate in this
bread jesus fileher of homage thief
of affection harken from the day
that the virgin gave thee birth thou
hast failed in thy promises the ages
have wept in awaiting thee mute
and fugitive god thou wert to re-
deem mankind and thou hast failed
thou wert to appear in gloiy and
thou liest asleep thou who wert to
intercede for us with the father
hast failed in thy mission lest thy
eternal slumber be disturbed thou
hast forgotten the poor to whom
thou hast preached thou who hast
dared punish by virtue of unheard-
of laws we would hammer upon thy
the stranger from kurdistan



nails bear down upon thy crown of
thorns draw blood anew from thy
dry wounds and this we can do
and this we will do in violating the
repose of thy body profaner of
magnificent vice glutton enamored
of gluttony accursed nazarene idle
king sluggish god

    amen   came the hoarse response
of the seventy-seven through the
stifling incense-laden air

 the priest having once more
ascended the altar steps turned and
with his left hand blessed the wor-
shipers of satan then facing the
crucified one in a solemn but mock-
ing tone he pronounced hoc est
envm corpus meum

  at these words the seventy-seven
crazed as much by the drugged wine
and amber-hued pastils as by the
sacrilegious madness of the cere-
mony groveled upon the saffron-
sprinkled floor howling and moan-
ing overcome by a demoniac frenzy
the priest seized the consecrated
bread spat upon it subjected it to
unmentionable indignities tore it to
pieces which ho offered to the wor-
shipers of satan who crept forward
to receive this mockery of a com-
munion

the first of that mad group of
devil-worshipers rose to his knees
and was about to receive his portion
when there came a startling inter-
ruption

  fools cease this mockery

  it was the strangers voice a voice
whose arrogant note of command
ringing through that vaulted chapel
like the clear cold peal of destruc-
tion silenced the frenzied devotees
so that not a breath was audible the
acolytes stood transfixed at the
altar the high priest alone re-
tained command of himself but even
he was momentarily abashed shrink-
ing before the flaming fierce eye of
the stranger

  yet the priest quickly recovered
himself

  who are you he snarled to
interrupt the sacrifice

  the seventy-seven though still
speechless had recovered from the
complete paralysis that their facul-
ties had suffered they saw the
stranger confronting the high priest
on the altar steps they heard his
voice in reply rich sonorous ma-
jestic

  you the high priest of satan
and ask me who i am i am ahri-
man whom the persians feared i
am malik taus the white peacock
whom men worship in far-off kur-
distan i am lucifer the morning
star i am that satan whom you in-
voked behold i have returned in
mortal form to meet and defy my
adversary

  he pointed to the crucifix then
continued and a worthy adversary
he is nor think that yonder simula-
crum is the christ i have sworn to
overthrow fools besotted beasts
think you that it is serving me to
deride a foe who has held me at bay
these countless ages think you to
serve me by this mummery this
very mass which you have cele-
brated though in derision and in de-
fiance of him acknowledges his
divinity and though in mockery
you have nevertheless accepted him
in taking this bread as his body is
this serving me your lord and mas-

  impostor shrieked the high
priest his face distorted with rage
impostor you claim to be satan

  that high-pitched scream stirred
the seventy-seven from their inertia
aroused them again to their frenzy
gibbering and howling they leapt to
their feet and closed in on the
stranger

  but at that instant a cloak of ele-
mental fire the red blinding flame
of a thousand suns enshrouded sa-
tans form and from it rang that
same clear cold voice fools mad-

xce again in the ruins at the foot
-of the tower of semaxii was the
dark stranger satan as he had re-
vealed himself to his followers he
seemed to be alone yet he was speak-
ing as if with someone facing him

  nazarene he said on that day
wherein i challenged you to meet me
with weapons and on ground of your
own choosing to do battle for the em-
pery of the world i was foolish and
knew not whereof i spoke

  he paused lowered his eyes for a

moment as if to rest them from the
strain of gazing at an awful and in-
tolerable radiance then continued
you they crucified me they would
have torn in pieces their lord and
master both of us they have denied
i wonder whose folly is the greater
yours in seeking to redeem mankind
or mine in striving to make it my
own

  and with these words satan turned
his haughty head bowed and turn-
ing disappeared among the ruins

weird tales

of the town on the north was a
patch of dense second-growth pine
through which the autumn wind
soughed mournfully to the east and
west lay fallow fields evidently reser-
vations awaiting the surveyors stake
and the enthusiastic cultivation of
glib-tongued real estate salesmen the
house itself fronted south on the
albemarle pike on the farther side of
which lay the grove of oak and chest-
nut into which trula had made her
escape

  quiet pour iamour dun rat
mort de grandin besought stop
the motor friend trowbridge at-
tendez mes braves allons au feu

  now my little lovely one with
a courtesy which he might have shown
in assisting a marchioness to shed her
cloak he lifted the overcoat from
trula petersens shivering shoulders
bent quickly and plucked the wool-
lined slippers from her feet then
lifted her in his aims and bore her
across the roadway intervening be-
tween us and the lawn that the gravel
might not bruise her unshod soles
quick toward the house ma petite
he ordered stagger play the
drunken one-cry aloud

  the girl clung trembling to him a
moment but he shook her off and
thrust her almost roughly toward the
house

  there was no simulation in the ter-
ror she showed as she ran unsteadily
aeross the frost-burnt lawn nor was
the deadly fear which sounded in her
wailing thin-edged cry a matter of
acting help help - please help
me she screamed

  excellent tres excellentde
grandin murmured from his covert
behind a rhododendron bush make
ready my friends i damn think they
come

  as he spoke there came a momen-
tary flash of light against the dark
background of the house as though a
baleful fiery eye had winked and
something a bare shade darker than

the surrounding shadows of the night
detached itself from the building and
sped with pitiless quickness toward
the tottering half-swooning girl

  trula saw it even as we did and
wheeled in her tracks with a shriek of
sheer mortal terror save me save
me its he she cried wildly

  half a dozen frenzied flying steps
she took crashed blindly into a
stunted cedar and fell sprawling on
the frosty grass

  a wild triumphant yell a noise
half human half bestial came from
the pursuer with a single long leap
he was on his quarry

  parbleu monsieur le demon we
are well met de grandin shouted
springing from his ambush and level-
ing his sawed-off shotgun

  the dim leaping form seemed to
pause in midair to retrieve itself in
the midst of its spring like a sur-
prized cat for an instant it turned
its eyes on de grandin and they
gleamed out in the night like the glow-
ing orbs of an infuriated leopard
next instant it sprang

  there was a sharp click but no an-
swering bellow of the gun the car-
tridge had missed fire

  secours friend trowbridge je
suis perdu the little frenchman
cried going down under a very ava-
lanche of flailing arms and legs and
as he fought off his assailant i saw the
flare of gleaming green eyes the flash
of cruel white teeth and heard the
hoarse beast-like growl of the thing
that clawed and worried at his fhroat

  nearer than the other two i leaped
to my friends rescue but as i moved
a second shadowy form seemed to
materialize from nothingness beside
me a battle-cry of feline rage shrilled
deafeningly in my ears and a claw-
ing screaming fury launched itself
upon me

  i felt the tough oiled leather of my
wind-breaker rip to shreds beneath
the flailing talons that struck at me
looked for an instant into a pair of
weird tales

round blazing phosphorescent eyes
then went down helpless under the
furious assault

  there is no power nor might nor
majesty save in allah the merciful
the compassionate arif pasha
chanted close beside me in the
glorious name of allah will i take
refuge from satan the stoned the re-
jected a charge of b b shot suf-
ficient to have felled a bear tore
through the clawing thing above me
there was a sharp snapping of metal
and a second blaze of searing light
as the riot-gun roared again

  the ear-piereing scream of my as-
sailant diminished to a growl and the
growl sank to a low piteous moan as
the form above me went limp rolled
from my chest and lay twitching on
the frosted earth beside me

  i fought unsteadily to my knees
and went sick and faint at the warm
stickiness that smeared the front of
my tattered jerkin no need to tell
a doctor the feel of blood he learns it
soon enough in his grisly trade

  costello was battering with the stock
of liis gun at the infernal thing that
clung at de grandins throat for he
dared not fire for fear of striking the
struggling frenchman

  thanks good friend the little
fellow panted wriggling from beneath
his assailant and jumping nimbly to
his feet your help was very wel-
come even though i had already slit

his heart in two with this- he

held aloft the murderous double-
edged hunting-knife with which he
had systematically slashed and stabbed
his opponent from the moment they
grappled

  savagely he tore asunder the black-
silk negligee in which the woman had
been clothed displaying her naked
torso to his light from clavicle to

coarse yellowish hair curled and

the sliot-riddled body over like the

the line of the scapula and extending
well down the thighs

  a hasty examination of the male
creature showed a similar coating but
in its case the hair was coarser and of
an ugly dirty-gray tone like the dis-
colored patch upon the back of an
elderly gorilla

stripped the hair from off their arms
and legs and other places where it
would have made them remarkable
and then they lived the liie of mem-

continued from page 

night into the death of joseph worth 
of new jersey u s a whose body was
found sunday morning on the moor near
the village of polgarth

  medical evidence tended to establish that
worth had evidently died of strangulation
which was borne out by a livid weal such
as might have been caused by a noose en-
circling the mans throat no trace of any
such noose was found however

  mr roscarroll the coroner stated that
suicide under the circumstances would
have been impossible and no motive for
foul play could be assigned as the deceased
had no known enemies and a considerable j
sum of money was found on his person
the jury returned a verdict of death from
strangulation inflicted in a manner un-
known

  further mystery is added to the case by
the fact that the late mr worth had ap-
parently left his room in the polgarth inn
by a window which opens onto a balcony as
his door was locked on the inside a loaded
revolver was found on a table beside the bed
and two strong cords were tied in a pecul-
iar manner to the posts at the foot of the
bed there was no evidence of any strug-
gle and apparently the deceased had left
the room of his own accord although for
an unknown motive

  local antiquarians recall as a singular
coincidence that centuries ago a number of
criminals were hanged from a gigantic oak
known colloquially as the gallows tree
which then stood upon the exact spot where
mr worths body was found but which
was cut down more than one hundred and
fifty years ago

  the last person to meet death there was
the highwayman known as black giles tre-
wartha who was betrayed into the hands of
the law by his brother joseph in  as
he stood beneath the gallows tree tre-
wartha imposed a curse upon his brother
and on any of the latters descendants who
should ever tread cornish soil

bstinate mind which was clearly
fighting against me now

    since i asked delphin to de-
stroy it that was a gift sir which
you should never have made not that
i believe that he died of it but be-
cause it would have been your fault
if he had killed me with it was it
the poison that was closed in the belly
f a mahogany fetish covered with
bizarre signs and curious designs
burned into the wood   

    that was it olympe there is
no possible error you know the tali-
tali well

    yes delphin used this poison
and the barks of the tree which you
brought him to make some exper-
iments which interested me much
more than the rest of his work as a
matter of fact his test-tubes and ap-
paratus amused me in the beginning
but one tires of everything i soon
noticed however that delphin was
not well and i blamed his languor on
the bad air of the laboratory i asked
him to give up his work for a little
while he would not so i asked him
at least to do me the favor of destroy-
ing the tali-tali he answered that
there was nothing to fear because the
tali-tali was only fatal to those who
drank it and that he was certainly not
crazy enough to drink the liquid
which he had already tried out on
chickens and rabbits he was amused
at my childishness but i gave him no
peace until he had destroyed the tali-
tali in front of me and palmire tired
of fighting with me about it he threw
the fetish and the poison into the fire
and it was burned up in a momelit

    how did the poison act in the
fire

    first there was a long green
flame like a sky-rocket and that was
followed by a suffocating vapor which
we ran from as for the fetish itself
it was nothing more than an ember

which flashed a last grimace before
falling into ashes that is all sir and
i have nothing else to tell you but if
it was to hear this that you married
me you might as well have dispensed
with the ceremony i would have
given you the information just the
same and perhaps i would have loved
you afterward but now please leave
this house and never let me see you
again 

  when jacobini reached this point
he stopped and rolled himself a cig-
arette

   and then i asked

   then i left her to question pal-
mire i forced her to tell of the tali-
tali also i attacked her from all
sides shes an ignorant peasant and
she could not have invented the chem-
ical effects which she had seen in the
fire all she said agreed to the letter
with what olympe had told me i
asked her all kinds of questions which
olympe could not have foreseen i
went on into other matters and at the
end of my investigation i went back
to olympe and threw myself on my
knees before her she pardoned me
zinzin because besides being honest
she is also very good

   possible i said but she is not
proud 

as you can well imagine i did not
go to call on them but i saw
jacobini eight days later an awful
anguish was visible on his pale rest-
less face

   zinzin he said to me in a hoarse
voice i think im infected with it
too but perhaps it is only an idea
yes an idea even the thought of
that tali-tali is enough to drive one
mad

  i didnt have time to say a word
he had already gone and i was never
to see him alive again

  and this is the frightful trag-
weird tales



edy which occurred the next day ac-
cording to the police who with help
from the dying jacobini and pal-
mires statements reconstructed the
scene

  at noon jacobini who had not
seen his wife since morning went to
the pavilion he was filled with the
darkest presentiments in spite of the
fact that he tried to free himself of
the idea of poison by trying to believe
that his illness was due to swamp
fevers which he had suffered from in
the tropics

  luncheon was served there and
as jacobini entered a door closed
hurriedly at the end of the room at
the same time he heard furtive steps
and the sound of a box being closed
he ran to the door half opened it
and saw olympe engaged in low con-
versation with palmire she seemed
very much troubled

  at that moment a terrible cramp
seized him in the intestines and he
let the door close having only
strength enough to drop on the sofa
with one hand he had unconsciously
taken hold of olympes work-box
which was badly closed and showed
bits of fine linen jacobinis fingers
clutching at the lid feverishly from
pain opened it and fumbled in the
lace suddenly they struck a hard
object and he stood up haggard and
mad   

  in his hand he held the fetish of
death the horrible phial the hideous
tali-tali which ympe and palmire
had sworn was destroyed burned be-
fore them olympe had lied olympe
had poisoned him as she had poisoned
the other two he was to suffer the
atrocious death which had tortured
his predecessors

    overcoming the agony for a few
minutes jacobini poured what was
left of the poison into a bottle of wine
on the table there was enough left
for a terrible dose and then he
waited for his wife

  she was not long in coming she
idssed him and asked him how he felt

weird tales

this morning lie replied that he
felt much better but that the fever
had not completely left him and that
he was thirsty

   then you must drink something
darling she said

  he did not wait for her to pour
the wine out and filled two glasses
himself

   but you know that the doctors
have forbidden me wine she said
and that i only drink water

  he insisted that she drink with
him in the same glass as they had
often done she turned her head
away he seized her brutally threw
her head back and savagely pinched
her nostrils thus forcing her to drink
as she cried with fear he spoke per-
haps you would have preferred
another glass he said and showed
her the tali-tali

  she cried for help but suddenly
put her hand to her abdomen and was
taken with a horrible cramp at the
same time the pain clutched at him
and they fell together on the sofa
they shrieked together agonized to-
gether clutched and scratched and
bit each other they pulled at each
other like wild beasts they twisted
and writhed contorting themselves in
the same hell

  jacobini had still strength enough
to insult her naming the first victims
you wont kill any more you are
going to die you are going to die
with me

  but the pain was too great it
seemed as though there was hell with-
in him he pulled weapons down
from the walls and he tried to stab
himself with a knife and so end the
horror at one blow but he only suc-
ceeded in making a terrible wound
then lie turned the steel toward
olympe and slit her open from top to
bottom like an animal the room
echoed with her last howl

  possessed by a thousand demons
he smashed her skull pierced her like
a pin-eushion pulled out her eyes and
cut her into pieces she was nothing

weird tales



 more than a bleeding nameless horror
 when the servants rushed into the
 room

   but jacobini did not die until the
 next morning and in his few moments
 of lucidity narrated the hideous de-
 tails of their abominable martyrdom
 the assistant district attorney who at
 one time had hoped to marry her was
 present and he returned home and
 went to bed ill during the night he
 was so delirious that they thought he
 would lose his mind and so add one
 more victim to the list  

 y inzin stopped perspiration beaded
 his temples he let out a sort of
 groan

   the most horrible part he went
 on is the fact that she had done
 nothing  

    oh  the others exclaimed

   yes she was innocent i learned
 that the other day only the other
 day

   palmire had done it all gau-
 bert exclaimed

   as to her said zinzin with a
 terrible laugh the police took her
 and kept her you can well under-
 stand that i did everything in my
 power to have her given full punish-
 ment all she did was to say no and
 to cry about olympe concerning her
 mistress however she gave us ex-
 planations which dumfoiuided us
 they were so utterly stupid or naive
 for example when they asked her
 if your mistress wras innocent she
 would not have told her husband that
 the tali-tali had been destroyed before
 the two of you 

    bah that is simple palmire
 answered we agreed between us to
 say that it had been because there
 were already rumors about and we
 did not want to be suspected besides
 we did not know what had become of
 the tali-tali because we really believed
 that monsieur delphin had burned it
 all the day that he threw a few drops
 in to please madame

   yes she said just that zinzin

went on and she was hissed and
hooted i cried louder than the rest

  and what was she sentenced to
asked chaulieu

  death replied zinzin in a whis-
per

  but they dont execute women

  no    her sentence was changed
to life imprisonment she died in her
cell about ten years ago i learned
that the other day also

   and did she repent  did she con-
fess michel asked

  no zinzin answered looking at
us like a madman and she had noth-
ing to confess    she too was in-
nocent

  good god chaulieu exclaimed

  but then who was guilty gau-
bert asked

  a man who has just died and con-
fessed on his death bed after the
tragedy he left the town and settled
not far from here yes he died the
other day at mourillon that man
had owned some property which
touched the edge of olympes estate
in the far corner where the pavilion
was  

  but who was the man-one of
the twelve

 yes one of the twelve - the
twelfth to be exact he naturally
could not ever hope to marry olympe
because of course she would never go
through with eleven husbands after
such deaths but he eliminated those
who had been happier than he   
and at the end he had fixed it so that
the evidence all pointed to olympe

 do you remember when the
twelfth suitor arrived that day when
we were all lined up in the drawing-
room-the arrival of monsieur paci-
fire the registrar-what fun olympe
made of him and how we had all
laughed when she placed him at the
foot of the line yes we made fun
of monsieur pacifire when he came
into the room well he avenged him-
self that man
