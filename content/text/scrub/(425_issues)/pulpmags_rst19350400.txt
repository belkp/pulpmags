mouth and throat

dont put up with the pain of ordinary sore
throat it can so often be quickly relieved by
gargling with full strength listerine the safe
antiseptic

  after this easy treatment you will be delighted
to find how much better your throat feels that
raw burning constricted sensation is gone

  where the throat is seriously inflamed as the
result of chronic infection of the tonsils call a
competent physician listerine can be of small
help in such cases

  fortunately for mankind however most cases
of sore throat are mild infections heralding the
coming of a cold bacteria multiply in the throat
irritating its membranes then move either up-

ward into the nose or downward to the bronchial
tubes

  doctors know and you undoubtedly realize
the importance of keeping such bacteria under
control-of killing as many as possible before
they move to near-by tissues you can see the
advantage of using listerine notable for its
germ-killing power reductions of bacteria in
the mouth and throat ranging to  have
been noted after the use of this safe antiseptic

  even more interesting is this practical proof
of listerines germ-killing ability those who
gargled with listerine twice a day caught fewer
colds and less severe colds than those who did
not gargle

  listerine to many is that ounce of preven-
tion so useful in combating mankinds greatest
nuisance and mankinds greatest menace-the
common cold keep a bottle of listerine handy
in home and office and use it systematically

find they wanted a straight whis-
key-made the good old-fashioned
way-smooth and pleasing to taste
-and they wanted a low price

and because that was exactly
what crab orchard offered it be-
came americas fasten - selling
straight whiskey anywhere from
broadway to the

men from the surrounding country used to find
a ready market for squirrels if they were plump and

  for quality folk from louisville down through
the cumberland valley and up beyond cincinnati
journeyed to that quiet little town to take the
waters of its famous limestone
spring and enjoy the old-fashioned
southern eatables and drinkables of
its picturesque hotel

  among the gentry who gathered
there were naturally some excellent
judges of bourbon and those criti-

blanket stiffs

    an old tramps life story is told in five
    words lilacs lightning bugs and lavinia

             by dave a martin

author of  the greatest engineer in the world  and  beginners luck 

owie me and the kokomo
kids getting up in society
oldest living charter mem-
n bers of the ancient order

  of blanket stiffs the real
blanket stiff as everybody knows is a
-days-a-year tramp he totes a bed
blanket and uses it wherever night finds
him

  our main problems is rassling with
the three rs-resting rambling and
relaxing right now were riding local
freight in missouri we heard the
brakies on the mop aint so hostile as
on other roads so we shuffle up to a
scissor-bill and asks him about it

   nothing doin he bellows  if
 see you boes climbin into that empty
box car up ahead ill knock your blocks
off while were scramming for the
side-door pullman he mentioned he
shouts after us the bad news  dont
forget to pile out at henrietta an jug-
gle some uh that freight

  them shacks gimme a pain never
think of nothing but work-for some-
body else you just watch i bet me

and the kid fixes him in due time

  when we crawl into that car theres
about twenty leven fuzzy-faced boys
in there already we ask where theyre
going most of em says theyre head-
ing for hell

  thats just about true thousands
of boys with ambition but no jobs are
flipping freight trains today for the
thrill tomorrow thousands of boys
with no ambition and no jobs will be
riding the rattlers as a lifetime habit
shiftlessness gets under the skin and
sticks i know look at me and the
kokomo kid just plain unadulterated
bums

   last real job and pay check i had
says the kid  was over forty years
ago

   thats a long layoff i sigh

   yes he goes on  in  the year
of the pullman strike i was a teleg-
rapher on the old monon and then
the only girl i ever had in my life
pulled the pin i hit the derail and
landed wheels up in a ditch

  that set me to thinking that when




railroad stories

you yank the props out from under
ambition its only a step from the side-
walk to the gutter

   kid says i  ever since the days
of eve in the garden uh eden them
rags an bones an hanks uh hair has
been turning switches an throwing us
fellers onter dead-end sidings to rot an
rust-an its just too bad

   oh not so bad the kid grins  i
sorta like this life yesterday boston
today chi tomorrow maybe van-
couver or san diego pick out your
own weather

   yeh i says an why worry if
its a week from last tuesday or the
thirty-ninth of february

  we was getting philosophical we
do once in a while the kid says
hit the farmhouses in daytime for
a big feed and the haystacks at night
for a big snooze under the stars your
alarm clock at daybreak is a field full
of songbirds get up and dress on a
knee-deep rug of wild flowers jam on
your hat and youre dolled up for the
day

   yeh it aint so bad i agree
 nothing to do but sprawl out an
rest an neighbor with nature no
landlord no taxes no budget no
breach uh promise suits- that re-
minds me of the kids gal and i
change the subject  did your dame
quit cause you hit the skids

   no its the other way round my
pal says gloomily  i hops off the
rails onto the ties cause she pulls her
freight on me

  i nod sympathetically but dont say
a word

   some men are like engines he
says  they run outa sand flues
leaking no steam schedule all shot
back shop for a rebuild or the junk
heap thats where i lit on the scrap
pile

  we got lots a time and nothing spe-
cial to do so he unravels a story

tavinias her name sorrel top

  -l-vand freckle face no blue-ribbon
beauty but suits me to a t on spring-
time evenings after niv days trick
pounding brass for the monon i stroll
out to her home picture twilight in
a country town sweet honeysuckle
trailing over the house yard full of
lilac bloom-her favorite flower

   we sit on the porch in loves young
dream while the fireflies hang their
lanterns among the lilacs a night
hawk whirs overhead a bullfrog or-
chestra in a cat-tail marsh lulls the last
vestige of day life to rest happy
hours

   thats over forty years ago but
i always think of those three like yes-
terday-lilacs lighining bugs and la-
vinia an old tramps blessed trinity

  he paused reminiscently

   speaking of forty years ago and
breezing along in a box car the kid
goes on reminds me of rolling into
sierra blanca one morning about sun-
up cold tired and hungry sierra
blanca is just a depot in the west
texas desert sand sagebrush
stunted wind-swept mesquite reaching
out everyway to the sky line me and
two old-timers get ditched there

   but bo that depot at sierra
blanca is manna in the wilderness its
a real railroad eating-house all trains
of two rail systems stop there for
meals

   our freights just settled on the
siding when a long passenger train
grinds to a stop at the platform a
chink in the depot door is beating a
big brass gong train passengers in
linen dusters are unloading for break-
fast

   the two old-time tramps who was
blanket stiffs



 say mister we dont like that word
 work we aint done a tap o work for
twenty years 

with me follow the crowd into the
beanery through a window i watches
em panhandling the passengers they
come out with toothpicks stuck in their
faces

    did you feed i inquire

    did we feed  they says  kid
if we tip our heads we spill it

   me im just a greenhorn then at
frisking the world for a living when
the rush is over im back in the kitchen
interviewing the chink chef

    you hunglee he wants to know
you likee work chopee wood

   soon im making little ones out of
big ones at the wood pile the two
old-timers are sprawled out close by
for a session of shut-eye

   out of the depot walks a raw-
boned square-jawed hombre under a
church-steeple sombrero port and
starboard hes toting for ballast a
colts forty-five and the grand-daddv
of all bowie knives stuck in his cow-

hair vest i discover a badge that reads
 u s deputy marshal

   the big boy barges alongside the
two tramps and gives em the lowdown
on the free lunch situation in sierra
blanca he talks soft and easy like a
rattler when hes warning

    you fellers can work for your
grub if you want to says he  but
dont pester any more passengers here
-savvy 

   one of the tramps half up-ends
and spits back  say mister mebby
youre runnin this eatin shebang but
you aint runnin us see  an we dont
like that word work we aint done
a tap o work for twenty years

   the second bum chips in after his
pal  yes an twenty years is only


railroad stories

half the tale we aint gonna work for
twenty years more an thats the other
half of it now how dye like that
story

   the big boys got sand on the rail
and never slips a wheel  i aint long
on writin myself he says  but i
reckon ill scribble a little postscript to
that story you two hombres are both
gonna work-an hard work-befo
you git outa here when youre ready
for some physical exercise look me
up an remember about the passen-
gers

   a full week of choring is what i
get out of the place-everything from
whitewashing hen-houses to chamber-
maiding for nanny goats first job is
to pick out all the crooked knotty
tough-to-split sticks from a big wood-
pile this made-to-order heap was for
the two birds whod been resting up for
twenty years

   day by day im getting the
wrinkles out of my filling station while
the two old-timers are on a hunger
strike the marshals got em sewed
up tight in sierra blanca no place
to eat but the depot crews bat and
boot these two bums off the trains
walking out would mean bait for the
buzzards

  on the fifth day the ragged pair
limp into the depot looking for the
marshal and work theyre sore
starved and licked at the end of the
week i get a five-spot and am fixed
for a ride to el paso last thing i see
from the caboose cupola as we slide
down the track from sierra blanca is
those two tramps still making wild ax
swings at hump-backed sticks of
wood

our rattler slows down and jerks
to a stop the car door slides
back the tough brakeman shouts in

   cmon cmon cmon roll outa
there you boes hit the grit hustle
back an tangle with that freight
everybody unloads except me and
the kokomo kid we got the car to
ourselves

  i slip the kid a grin  you dont
spose he meant us too do you

   certainly not the kid says
promptly  you heard him say boes
were blanket stiffs

  that settles it kokomos judgment
on labor questions is fine we edge
over and shut the door

  when were rolling again i says to
the kid not a bad yarn that last
one i cant figure out though why
this lavinia romance of yours jumped
the track an landed in a ditch

  no counters the kid well
maybe you aint good at arithmetic
but speaking of figures reminds me
i sure cut one a while back

  im all set for another story and
sure enough it comes along

   im on a branch railroad up in al-
berta the kid narrates  been fired
off a canadian pacific freight im
drilling down the track eyes on the
fields looking for a scarecrow to swap
clothes with never so near ready for
a nudist colony in all my life

   right in the middle of the track
at a road crossing i find a suit box
it has jiggled out of some wagon in
it is a swell new outfit of sartorial
habiliments-the whole layout from
shoes to stetson i cache this trous-
seau in a thicket of underbrush sos
theyll be safe and the owner can find
em easy

   a week later when i slip back
what do you think i find the fellow
who lost them clothes didnt want em
bad enough to come after em did they
fit and look ritzy say all i was short
of being a sheik was thirty years of
blanket stiffs



life a shave and some hair slicker

  a few miles down the line a kind-
hearted lady gives me a big handout
wrapped in a newspaper i always like
to read the news at lunch-especially
the financial news one item in that
paper was so interesting i saved it
the kid fishes out a grimy tattered
newspaper clipping which he reads

surprising mrs skinner

  crossroads or somewhere between town

  our esteemed fellow citizen of the plum

  because he wanted or needed them but
  to pacify ma skinner this box of new
  regalia was tossed in the wagon for the
  trip home

    mid-stream at the plum creek ford
  a bright idea struck ab he decided to
  tog up in his new outfit and surprise
  ma skinner when he gets home while
  the team was drinking ab stood up on
  the wagon seat and shucked the old
  duds he sang out

    good-by old overall good-by old
  jumper good-by old hat

    he wadded each item up threw it as
  far as he could and watched it disap-
  pear down stream when there was
  nothing else left to discard but a
  pair of polka dot scanties and one set
  of chin whiskers ab reached for the
  new outfit-but the box was gone

   it was two miles from the plum
  creek ford to the skinner farm and the
  frost was on the pumpkin last thurs-
  day ab is ready to bet either potatoes

  or money he holds the two-hoss wagon
  record for that distance

   the ladies aid society of emanuel
  baptist church met at mrs skinners
  last thursday this has gone as far as
  the porch in the breaking-up stage
  when ab flashed past the house minus
  the wagon seat and disappeared be-
  hind the barn like a standing roman
  charioteer in his peek-a-boo costume

    not only was mrs skinner surprised
  at ab but every good sister in the
  ladies aid society had the shock of her
  life   

   believe me pal says the kokomo
kid  i make tall tracks out of that
neck of the woods instead of picking
my freights im grabbing them as they
come what im looking for is dis-
tance how could i plead not guilty
with the evidence covering me like a
show bill on the side of a barn but
i had good luck got caught in a rain-
storm that suit was ninety per cent
cotton when the sun got through
working on it i looked like little lord
fauntleroy with whiskers it was a
dandy disguise all right

our train has bumped to another
stop the door is jerked back
our tough brakie glares in

  hey he barks  whats the
matter with you bums didnt i tell
you to unload an grapple that freight
at henrietta 

   you sure did the kid says cheer-
fully  but we aint heard you call
 henrietta yet

youre riding the sunflower limited 
now when we git down to sibley you
two hit the deck an tie into an armload
of boxes git me

  the door cracks shut and were off
again i says to the kid 

  that yarn about ab is ok but
about you an lavinia  cant under-

stand why two young people hit the
derail when theres life ahead of em
a clear track to happiness an steam
to get some place in the world

   dont shed your shirt the kid re-
plies  well get around to that later
but first id like to tell you about the
time i got caught in a blizzard in mon-
tana

  time is hanging heavy on our hands
so i says  ok shoot the works
the kid begins   i ride into a little
town straggling down a mountain
gulch on the hurricane deck of a
freight mercury doing a steve brodie
to the bottom of the bulb night is
chasing the last streaks of daylight
over the jagged western horizon jack
frost is whistling out of the north a
few snowflakes are falling i drop off
the train and scoot for cover surest
shelter is the town jail i make a bee
line double quick for that

   the jailhouse door is opened by
one of them kind motherly old-fash-
ioned souls like you see pictures of on
maple syrup cans i tell her my
troubles away she patters to get
 pa pa comes in and gives me the
optical once-over he steps up close
and runs practiced hands over my rags
the badge on his vest is level with my
eyes hes a big walloper

    yaint packin a gun are ye he
asks cautiously

    excuse me sheriff says i  you
got me wrong hobo it is not high-
wayman

    yes says he  i know what you
look like but right now we gotta be
extry careful an play safe however
we aint aimin to turn you out in this
weather

   ma is already buzzing about set-
ting out my supper as i stow the
grub away im watching both of em
out of the tail of my eye ma keeps

sniffing and wiping her eyes on her
apron pa is walking the floor nerv-
ously and throwing glances at a tele-
phone on the wall like hes expecting
something i says to myself  dont
know what it is but a cogs slipped
around here

   after the feed im taken out in
the jail and locked up for the night
theres a dozen cells-six on a side
facing a center aisle only light in the
jail is one bulb at the far end of this
aisle a man on a chair is sitting
still as a statue under this lamp he
dont even look up sheriff says noth-
ing and i say less but im thinking
 maybe hes wax works or wooden
ware

   in my cell i can see nothing but
the outline of a cot in the outdoor
gloom filtering in through a small
barred window snow is coming down
heavy now already its a white world
outside the only sound that breaks
the silence is the cheerful tick of an
alarm clock somewhere

   the jail is warm as a pups nest
the bed is good and im at least one
shift short on shut-eye as i drop off
to dreamland i keep thinking  this
calaboose is cuckoo but its ok at
that

   the pound of moving feet wakes
me up i lie still and listen in one
direction its the milling of many feet
and the muffled hum of voices in
another i can pick out the measured
stride of one person on a cement floor
can even count the paces-three and a
turn-three and a turn sounds like
someone walking a cell

  time i dont know my watch
has stopped-at the hock shop five
years ago but i can still catch the
chipper little chatter of the alarm clock
i slide off the bed and peer through
the window the first glimmer of new
blanket stiffs



day is peeping over the rim of a frozen
earth what i see is a picture of
dreary desolation the snow has
stopped falling but a vicious howling
wind is swirling a smother of powdery
flakes through the air straight from the
arctic thats one time at least im
glad to be on the inside looking out

the kokomo kid is telling his
story to the tune of box car wheels
clicking over missouri pacific rail
joints and im all ears as the corn
says im waiting to hear how lavinia
busted a romance

   a shadow flits past my cell door
the kid goes on  pressing close to
the bars i watch it vanish down the
aisle its the sheriff thats all i see
-just one glimpse of the law passing
from the shadows before me into that
slab of light at the end of the corridor
all the rest i hear and thats plenty

   the pacing feet stop a lock
clicks a dry hinge complains on an
opening cell door not a sound then
for seconds but the tick of the clock
finally the voice of the sheriff husky
and shaky

    did you rest good billy

   the voice that answers is firm it
even sounds cheerful  like a baby
sheriff whatever im behind ill catch
up on soon anyhow

    whatll you have for breakfast 
the sheriff wants to know

    nothing this morning thank you
 another brief silence that the
sheriff breaks  ma and me aint slept
a wink the livelong night been settin
right up aginst that telephone every
minute watchin - an hopin - an
prayin for word from the governor
mas out there yet still hangin onto
her faith in divine providence an be-
lief in some last-minute message but
the times gittin mighty short now

    i know it sheriff and im ready
 me im beginning to get a ghastly
suspicion in my mind i hear the rustle
of a paper the clearing of a throat
then the quavery voice of the sheriff
  i-i gotta read you the-the
death warrant billy

   weak and limp i sag against the
cell bars jumping jehosophat id
dropped off in the town for a nights
lodging and landed right on top of a
necktie party i this bozo is going to
stretch hemp and the guy id seen sit-
ting in the aisle was the death watch

   the condemned prisoner is kicking
on the last legal formality  if its all
the same to you sheriff i prefer you
didnt read it

    but i got to its the law

    all right go ahead but you was
in court same as i was and heard the
judge say that on this day at sunrise
you were to hang me by the neck until
i was dead well this is the day and
here we are-waiting for the sunrise
 after a pause the sheriff says
 parsons outside dont you want to
see him a minute billy

    no i guess not if i havent got
it squared with the almighty for my
place in the hereafter no one else can
fix it for me

    mebbe youre right i hope you
are anybody could spot the sorrow
in the sheriffs words  you aint bad
billy youve just made a mistake
we all make em thats life

   another awkward pause then
the officer says  im asking you once
more for the last time wont you tell
me your right name

   its almost dawn now along the
eastern horizon i can see all the chang-
ing colors of the coming sunrise for
a few seconds i hear nothing but the
tick of the clock measuring off the
final minutes of a human life the


railroad stories

doomed man finally shatters the silence

    i cant tell you for publication
sheriff he says  it would break my
old mothers heart but will you do
me a last favor 

    yes if its in my power

    thanks the prisoner says calmly
i cant see the guy but from the way
he talks i imagine theres a look of in-
finite peace on his face  under my
bunk is a package please open this
after im gone in it youll find two
hundred postcards all filled out with
lies about what im doing how fine
im feeling-you know little splotches
of cheerful sunshine theyre all ad-
dressed to my mother send one to
her every month shell never outlast
the pile but i want her to get them as
long as she lives i know youll keep
my secret

   the first rays of the new sun creep
over the rim of the storm-swept world
a beam stabs the shadow in my cell
and when i hear the sheriff it is the
cry of a heart in anguish

    our father in heaven give us
courage give us strength in this dark
hour in this awful place we ask thee
to walk hand in hand with this boy
into life eternal  

   a moment later there comes a
voice inspired its the prisoner sing-
ing clear as a bell a murderer singing
like an angel  jesus lover of my soul
and to this the slow tramp of march-
ing feet like clods hitting a coffin an
iron door clangs then silence a
dead ominous significant hush even
the clock ticks have stopped

this tale sorta gets under my skin
and i tell the kokomo kid  kid
you gimme the gooseflesh that aint
a bad yarn-to have a nightmare on
but i wanta hear about you an la-
vinia

   oh that one  the kid replies
serious as an owl  thats my life
story pardner

   sure i guessed it says i  an
it must be a dandy lets have it
first time since ive known the ko-
komo kid he seems stuck for words
i tell him to drop a little sand on the
rails as he hesitates i can almost see
the door opening on a human heart and
glimpse the romance of a lifetime hid-
den within this storys bound to be a
pippin i keep telling myself finally
like an old lady discovering the end of
her tangled yarn the kid finds himself

   every spring in lilac time he
says kinda slow  i beat my way back
to a little sleepy one-horse town in
indiana round twilight when the
fireflies are coming out and the bull-
frog orchestra in the cat-tail marsh are
tuning their fiddles for the evening con-
cert i meander down the dusty trail
through the jimson weeds to our meet-
ing place

   there in the gloaming we have our
reunion like old times the stone is
half hidden under the lilac bloom but
from the glow of the lightning bugs
lanterns i can read my lifes story in-
scribed on its face lavinia shannon
-born dec th -died aug
nd 

 dont say a word-not for a long
time but i keep thinking of that
line about fools rushing in where
angels fear to tread looks like the
kids run out of talk too first thing
we know the train stops the door slams
back and our tough brakeman roars in
 hey you old blanket stiffs in there
the kid says  i reckon he means
us now

  we shuffle over to the door and
the shack bawls  hit the grit un-
load  beat it no work no ride
blanket stiffs



   coming up says i with a big grin
 what town did you say this is cap
 aint said yet he flings back
 but its courtney

  then the kid cuts in  thanks a lot
for calling us its just the very spot
we want to get off at

  and thats exactly what we did
that brakeman aint so smart bet he
feels cheap when we walk off and
wont ride on his old train any more
what do we care anyhow  be nother
freight along tomorrow or next week
or next summer any time suits us

vanished cargo

back in the early days railroad shippers opened their crates and
boxes of  merchandise  to find nothing inside but rags or old
magazines interesting as the magazines may have been they were
not so valuable as imitation silk stockings or cartons of cigarettes
most ingenious was the removal of an illinois central carload of
sugar shipped from chicago arriving at denver the car was
found quite empty except for a little snow which had sifted through
a crack no one in denver had ordered snow the wires were soon crackling

   wheres the sugar demanded the agent at denver

    in the freight car the chicago man wired back whereupon the denver man
scratched his head and sent for a railroad detective

    the question is said the bull when did it snow

    it hadnt snowed at all in denver the fall had ceased two hours out of chicago
hence the sugar had been removed at or near chicago in the freight yard that was
most likely though the car apparently had not been out of sight of train crews

    the detective went to chicago and looked things over the only place where the
sugar could have been unloaded handily was at the loading platform

     there must be some crooks working for this railroad the bull decided he
found a hammer and tacks which he put in his pocket and wandered around the yard
when no one was looking he pried up tacks and removed an empty card from one
of the cars then he located a car bearing a card for denver he took this card off
and put on the  empty  in its place then he copied down the car number and departed

    some hours later the bull returned and found the  empty  had been shoved up to
the loading platform no guards were around as there was not supposed to be any-
thing valuable in these cars

     this he said  is where the sugar was removed-into trucks he restored the
denver card in the morning a yard crew surprised to find a loaded car at the platform
yanked it off to the denver train the detective watched for changed cards and
eventually landed most of the crooks-jim holden

   uring the summer of 
i tie newspapers had little
m space for anything except war
eli material and every issue was
crammed with casualty lists
war dispatches and propaganda those
printed on july th and th were no ex-
ception it would have taken a careful
reader to discover in most of them news of
what was-and still is-americas greatest
railroad disaster

  it happened sixteen days after the hor-
rible rear-end collision on the michigan
central at ivanhoe ind which was prob-
ably the worlds greatest circus wreck and
the news about which was also played down
either deliberately or because it seemed un-
important just then american railroads had

 	see  when the circus went west in our
 feb  issue

recently come under government control
and although the united states railroad
administration was not to blame in either
case these wrecks were bound to discredit
government operation in the eyes of people
who did not understand

  americas greatest railroad accident
from the standpoint of casualties occurred
on the nashville chattanooga  st louis
ry at nashville tenn early on the morn-
ing of july th  it killed  and
injured  people

  ordinarily the n c  st l was one of
the safest of all railroads just as it is today
but no scheme has ever been devised on the
n c  st l or any other road which
will allow two opposing trains to run on the
same track at the same time and no rule
has been figured out that permits an in-
ferior train to run on a single track when
a superior train is already there

americas greatest rail disaster



  the trains which tried this stunt were
passenger trains nos i and  the latter
was scheduled to leave nashville at  am
whereas no  was due to arrive ten minutes
later ordinarily they met on the double
track between the nashville station and
shops two and a half miles out

  the double track ended at shops thus
if no  was somewhat late in arriving at
nashville it was up to no  to wait at
shops until no  arrived no  was the
superior train

  no  consisted of -- type engine no
 hauling one baggage car five wooden
coaches a steel pullman and a steel under-
frame pullman she was on the way from
memphis to nashville and she passed
bellevue tenn  miles from nashville
at  am  minutes late

  meanwhile train no  had left nash-
ville at  am seven minutes late be-
fore leaving conductor eubank and engi-
neer kennedy had received orders about
a meet with another train farther out
added to this order was a notation from
dispatcher phillips to the effect that no

	was pulling train no  this was to
help the enginemen and trainmen to identi-
fy no 

  eubank read the order and the notation
to kennedy and both commented on it
kennedys words were that  number one
was some late this morning both men
then knew that they probably would have
to stop and wait for no  at shops where
the double track ended as we have pointed
out usually the two trains met between
shops and nashville on double track this
morning of course the chances were that
no  would be too late to get to shops
before the opposing train arrived

  no  consisted of engine no  sister
of the  a mail-baggage car a baggage
car and six coaches all wooden

while his train was on the double
track eubank was busy collecting
tickets he had showed the order with the
information about no  to his porter and
flagman and had told them to watch out
for no  naturally with engineer fire-

man porter and flagman looking for the
opposing train he felt he was safe in devot-
ing his entire time to collecting tickets

  however flagman st clair hardly knew
what it was all about he was making his
first trip as passenger flagman before this
he had made only two trips on freight and
although conductor eubank handed him
the orders he didnt understand and saw
nothing in them about which to give a
second thought he later testified that eu-
bank had not spoken about no 

  while they were running between shops
and nashville a switch engine hauling
about  cars in the opposite direction
passed them st clair saw them but paid
no attention to them eubank busy collect-
ing tickets also caught a flash of them as
they went by he thought they were no

	and went back to work it was now up to
the men in the engine cab to stop and wait
for the other train

  but the men in the engine cab for some
never-to-be-determined reason did not
they kept on going and accelerating no

	in her flight raced onto the single
track

  an interlocking plant was located at
shops operator johnson looked out the
window at  am and saw no  pass
by running about  mph puzzled he
looked at the train sheet to see whether or
not no  had arrived yet it had not

  immediately the towerman called dis-
patcher phillips horror-stricken phillips
ordered him to try to stop no  the
towerman sounded an emergency air whistle
in a desperate effort to attract the train
crews attention but they did not hear it
or if they did they did not heed it

  the two trains were rushing at each
other with nothing to stop them on ac-
count of curves a slight grade rather dense
woodland and an overhead bridge it was
impossible for the engineers to see each
others trains until it was too late there
was nothing left except to call out the
wrecker and phone for ambulances

  both trains were traveling between 
and  miles an hour they met at c
am on a curve two miles out of shops


railroad stories

and they came upon each other so suddenly
that engineer lloyd of train no i did
not have time to make a brake application
at any rate that was the impression of
conductor tucker of no i who lived to
tell about the crash kennedy barely man-
aged to flip over his brake lever but there
wasnt time for the air to act

  no is engine the  was tossed off
the track her boiler stripped as clean as if
she had been through a back shop the
baggage car behind her was crushed when
it was finally jacked up by the wrecking
crew thirty persons only one of them
alive were taken from underneath the
next three cars were gouged out shattered
and tossed aside in a terrible fashion while
the last four cars remained on the rails

  as for no  its engine the  was
also totally demolished the next five cars
were ripped and torn and tossed aside but
the last three were not derailed and were
only slightly damaged

  who was to blame for this americas
greatest rail disaster obviously you say

engineer kennedy and conductor eubank
as well as other members of no s crew
that is true for the two men in charge of
the train were primarily responsible

  but there were other factors in the wreck
while they do not lessen the responsibility
of these two men they tell why they acted
as most human beings would under the cir-
cumstances

first of all granted that conductor
eubank should have made sure his train
did not run onto the single track until no
 had passed you must admit he thought
he was doing so for a long time he had
been taking the word of his porter or flag-
man for it and did not see anything wrong
in the practice not only that but conduc-
tor riggle who alternated with eubank on
the run was in the habit of doing the same
thing and although he himself stated he
 never permitted his train to pass shops
before no  arrived he did  depend
upon the flagman porter and engine crew
to identify no 

                                                                           th st w oodside l  n y

americas greatest rail disaster



  thus the accident might have happened
with any other n c  st l conductor on
no  it was only eubanks bad luck that
put him where he was

  secondly engineers on outgoing trains
had been in the habit of merely taking the
operators word at shops that superior
trains had arrived the result was that two
months before the wreck the superintendent
had issued the following bulletin

   understand some engineers on out-
  bound trains are passing the shops
  without any definite information as to
  whether superior trains have arrived
  other than to ask operator at shops
  tower this must be discontinued

    superior trains must either be regis-
  tered before the northbound trains de-
  part or be identified by some member
  of the crew of the superior train or
  meet the superior train between nash-
  ville and the shops or have an order
  at the shops stating that the superior
  train has arrived

   note - see that train dispatchers
  understand this and have the orders
  ready at the shops so they can be
  handed to the outbound trains

  read it over carefully and you will see
that if it had been obeyed there would have
been no accident then why wasnt it
obeyed the answer is simple there was
no way of obeying it the proper officials
had never seen to it that orders were issued
and delivered to outbound crews at shops
the outbound trains were given no orders
so they interpreted rule  standard on
all american roads as loosely as they chose

to rule  simply states that a train
 must not leave its initial station on any
division or a junction or pass from double
to single track until it has been ascertained
whether all trains due which are superior
or of the same class have arrived or left
it was up to the operating officers to make
provisions for the proper observation of the
rule and they did not

  in the opinion of the interstate com-
merce commission the accident could have
been prevented if rules such as those on the
bulletin had been enforced or if there had
been a manual block system on the single-
track line north of shops it also pointed
out that the loss of life would have been
far less if steel equipment had been used

  both engineers and firemen went to their
death at the time of the crash so did two
other railroad men and  passengers ex-
actly  were injured but nine of them
died later a large percentage of the vic-
tims were men on their way to work in a
nearby powder plant supplying world war
munitions

  thus the nashville casualty list eclipsed
even the frightful wreck of  at chats-
worth  which will be taken up in a
future issue and the catastrophe of 
at ashtabula o described in this magazine
last september although the famous poem
about the chatsworth wreck states that a
hundred lives were lost this figure is a
poetic exaggeration the wreck at nash-
ville tops the grim but now almost station-

 yes sir it takes a guy like conductor anderson
 to show an official how to railroad

f all the conductors i

to have a trainmaster tip
his hat to in meeting however train-

he thinks buck is the cleverest orc
that ever bossed a train or slipped a

of the finer points of railroading

  in the first place it was the season
for forest fires and in the second place
the trainmen were going to have their
annual ball at pineville being the so-
cial event of the season our whole
crew planned to go this dance is set
for friday so on thursday me and my
partner and buck all go down to the
yard office to tell the yardmaster we
want to lay off the slave driver lis-

   nobody lays off today he growls

ones who can lay off are those who
want to go to their own funerals or
look for another job we got four ex-
tra trains coming in the next twenty-
four hours and need all the regular
men we have

   but you got lots of extra men
buck protests  where are they 

   laying off grins the yardmaster
 why shouldnt they be  their an-
nual ball is tomorrow night

   some of them are fighting a brush
fire over in the woods says my part-
ner  buttons  brown  theyll be
too tired to dance very much

  why he is called buttons is because
his clothes have so many fancy ones
he is sweet on a pretty little blonde
named mabel down at the half moon
cafe who deals grub and conversation
simultaneously and who has more suit-
ors than a telephone girl has wrong
numbers

   but fire or no fire i got to lay
off buttons groans  i promised
mabel to take her to the ball shed
never forgive me and if i dont take
her sniffles will bet hes at the bot-
tom of this lay-off stunt

  sniffles walker is a train dispatcher
the only real rival buttons has his
nickname comes from the fact he has
asthma the year around and hay fever
in the fall but for them drawbacks
sniffles would probably have had a
walkaway as he has a better position
and bigger pay check then too he
is good-looking and a fancy dresser

  personally im not strong for snif-
fles hes too stuck up and ambitious
like the other local officials and would-
be officials sniffles dont like anybody
that is a friend of slippery bucks
and competing writh a common brake-
man for a girl certainly hurts his pride

   looks like our wrork is cut out for
us buck opines with a frown as he

squints at the line-up on the board
 were first out tonight well catch
seventy-one with a chance to come
back on the manifest tomorrow if we
dont have too much bad luck well
scratch in for the dance

   that jonah run hasnt been in on
time for months buttons reminds
him  itd be just our luck not to get
in at all tomorrow night

   well weve got a fighting chance
says buck  the manifest will be on
time tomorrow if i have anything to
say about it you know me boys

  we do he wasnt called slippery
for nothing me and buttons cheer up
a little as we leave the yard office and
mosey on toward the beanery theres
a scent of pine smoke in the air but
the fire has been brought under con-
trol by now and we think nothing of
it as we amble along who do we
bump into there but sniffles walker

  sniffles grins  too bad you cant
attend the dance tomorrow night
brown it is going to be a great af-
fair 

buttons comes right back at him

lenges

done any boasting or betting worse
yet hell be on duty tomorrow the
same hours we are a few delays easy
for him to explain and our cause is
lost buttons should have let well
enough alone


railroad stories

well slippery buck anderson
calls the turn sniffles did know
something train no  is two hours
late that night and we dont get out
until eight oclock  lazy lon  bol-
ton is our engineer buck hands him
the orders and a little advice

  twist that pigs tail lon got to
be in coldwater by two oclock so we
can come back on the manifest on time
if we miss the ball ill run you ten
miles for punishment well do our
stuff you do yours

  lazy lon looks sorrowful he hates
exercise  always in a hurry he
complains  and just for a dance
i wouldnt walk across the street to be
greta garbos dancing partner more
fun to sit and rest

   your resting days are over if we
miss the dance buck warns  now
highball take it out of here

  lazy lon does but the breaks are
against us maybe sniffles has framed
it with the night dispatcher to delay
us all possible i dont know the
fact is its  am when we arrive
there

  not so good buck admits
 however the manifest is on time
if we leave here by eleven-thirty we
can make it

  but we dont leave coldwater at

 am because the manifest does
not arrive until almost noon on top
of that lazy lon comes to report
theyve taken away our good engine
and were getting an old slide-valve
saturated hog that wouldnt run down
hill unless pushed

   well never get in now lon
groans

   wed better buck says mean-
ingly

  lons face grows long but he dont
argue just before our train pulls in
the switch engine grabs the caboose

and goes into the rip track to couple
onto four cars of gasoline that evi-
dently are there for repairs

   four hot boxes with rough jour-
nals and flat wheels chuckles the en-
gine foreman when buck asks for in-
formation  mr sniffles walker act-
ing chief dispatcher today thought you
boys ought to have something to worry
about and work with on the trip

   i told him they wouldnt run with-
out new wheels protests the rip track
boss who comes up then  but he says
to turn em loose

  buck snorts like he always does
when he is getting peeved its a dirty
trick on the part of sniffles and to be
expected that train dispatcher is out
to win the twenty-dollar bet with but-
tons brown and also take mabel to the
dance

   looks like were whipped says i
 even with good luck we couldnt
make it in now

  weve got to make it buck re-
torts grimly  and we will sniffles
thinks he has pulled something cute
ill show him what cuteness really is
were a long way from being
whipped

   and that gasoline will run hot i
go on gloomily  all well do today
is brass cars and fight hot boxes

   we will worry about the hot boxes
when we have them buck smiles
 now run along to the head end ive
work to do

im at the engine when buck shows
up with the orders lazy lon reads
them and whistles off kind of mourn-
ful like hes a long time getting the
train under way a pretty good sign
it is heavy with tonnage

   eighteen hundred tons buck ad-
mits when i mention it  sniffles
couldnt see any difference between a
slippery bucks ballroom run



slide-valve saturated engine and a su-
perheater as far as tonnage was con-
cerned good thing we got a level
road to kingston

  i agree with him but after that
comes hills galore we probably will
have to double the hills with that ton-
nage im not very cheerful as i climb
into the cupola to watch the train but
in spite of a heavy train weve moving
right along laziness dont keep lon
from being a real hogger

  going through the first town i smell
oily waste smoking its on one of the
gasoline cars

   hot box i yell down to buck
 on gasoline

   fine he calls back  well look
into it at fountain

  thats where were meeting a pas-
senger train buttons catches the ca-
boose at the switch to inform us we
got another hot box on a car of mer-
chandise up ahead by the time i get
the switch closed and join them but-
tons has the jack and bar and brass
and everything ready

   you boys fix the merchandise car
buck orders  ill look after the hot
box back here when youre ready
highball maybe youd better take the
water cooler to put on the box when
brassed

  personally my idea would have been
to put the cooler on the gasoline since
its a heavier load however no brake-
man ever got anywhere arguing with
his conductor i say as much to but-
tons who agrees with me

   and he knows what hes doing
buttons continues  you can bet on
that

  im hoping so we get the car
brassed long before the passenger train
shows up the forty minutes delay
there sure puts a damper on buttons
disposition as we pull out i load the

equipment but not before noticing that
smoke is still pouring out of the hot
box on the car of gasoline

   box seems pretty hot i hint to
buck  how was the brass

   bad buck smiles  and itll be
worse by the time we get to kingston
so will the other four journals-or i
miss my guess

  buck is right every one of those
gasoline cars has a hot box singing a
tune by the time theyve gone ten miles
and the black fog they send back over
the caboose almost chokes me but i
dont get fidgety till one of them starts
throwing sparks and fire clear off the
right-of-way every moment im ex-
pecting a journal to burn off and put
us in the ditch im sure relieved when
we stop at kingston for water

  buck doesnt seem at all bothered
 pretty good he mutters after
examining the four cars  they wont
run set them out on the house track
now setting out cars for hot boxes
in them days was like handing in your
resignation-unless you had good
reasons and we dont have good
reasons not with plenty of brasses and
packing dope on the caboose im
thinking buck is mighty foolish i
know it when the operator comes out

   you cant set those cars out
there he tells buck  i was talking
to the dispatcher and he says for you
not to dare set out any cars for hot
boxes but to brass them and run them
regardless of delays

   you tell the dispatcher im run-
ning this train buck says  and any
explanation needed ill make to the
proper officials in the accustomed
way

nerve sure it was nerve buck
had that to give away off goes the
brass pounder pretty soon he is back
 i told the chief what you said


railroad stories

slippery hes reporting everything to
hackett and fanning theyre over
at kline you wont be so smart when
they pay you a call and dont think
im going to alibi for you

   ive got a sack plumb full of alibis
of my own buck declares  high-
ball

  at the next station we get a mes-
-vsage from fanning demanding to
know why we set out the gasoline cars
instead of putting new brasses in buck
replies that we have used all our avail-
able brasses

  thats a lie the first one i ever knew
buck to tell but under the circum-
stances i dont hold it against h i m
and yet-

   suppose fanning and the super
come snooping around the caboose at
kline i ask nervously  if they find
we got brasses theyll fire us all

   i dont think so buck laughs
the official mind works only one way
thats why im always two jumps
ahead of them i know what theyll
do before they do themselves fanning
and hackett will ask to see the used
brasses we took out of the cars not
the new ones we have

   but weve got only one i protest

  thats the one from the merchan-
dise

   youre mistaken buck corrects
me with a queer little smile  we got
five used brasses that size youll find
them in a gunnysack in the oil cellar
i traded for them at coldwater the
storekeeper there is a good friend of
mine if sniffles hopes to keep us from
the dance tonight hes got to think up
something better than hanging a lot of
bad ordered cars on us

  talk about shocks i just about pass
out at this move of bucks but he
told the truth after all the used

brasses are in a gunnysack in the oil
cellar just as he said no wonder they
call him slippery buck

   oh i exclaim after a look at the
brasses  i thought-

   you thought i lied buck inter-
rupts  only fools lie the good gen-
eral plans his battles before theyre
fought not after the fighting starts
that silences me completely feel-
ing better i climb back into the cupola
there is a smoke haze in the air like
a forest fire but that dont disturb us
none with a lighter train lazy lon
is shaking right along toward kline
were in fair shape and have a good
chance of going into pineville on time

  then we stop at kline the first fel-
lows i see are superintendent hack-
ett and trainmaster fanning waiting
for us one look at buck and they go
into action

   anderson hackett says all hos-
tile like  why did you set out those
cars of gasoline after being told not
to by the chief dispatcher

   safety first buck replies non-
chalantly  dangerous to run jour-
nals are rough brassing them is a
waste of time money and energy until
new wheels are put in

   but you didnt brass them hack-
ett barks  you were not delayed long
enough anywhere to brass any cars
 forty minutes at fountain while
waiting for the passenger train buck
reminds him  used all our good
brasses right there angels can do no
more mr hackett

   youre a long ways from being an
angel the super snorts  but youre
mighty close to being without a job
anderson this is one time you hang
yourself you say you brassed five
cars at fountain very welf i accept
your statement may i ask you to
show me the five used brasses
slippery bucks ballroom run



  the look on his face says as plain
as words that he thinks he has buck
fanning is the same way

  why certainly buck turns to
me  would you mind getting the
sack we keep the used brasses in and
showing them to mr hackett

  i do hacketts face is a study when
he sees the used brasses however
hes not satisfied something tells the
super hes being tricked i guess he
finally has to give up after he checks
the size stamped on the used brasses
the way he storms out of ths hack
does my heart good fanning stays be-
hind

   i dont know the answer ander-
son fanning grunts sourly  but
ill never believe you brassed any five
cars in forty minutes

   i didnt buck confesses cheer-
fully  my brakemen do that work
fast men eh the tm grunts
 ill remember that in the future
dont let me see any delay reports from
you after this with more than eight
minutes for the brassing of any cars

buck promises  now you will
excuse me he says  i want to
get my train moving were taking in
the trainmens ball tonight at pine-
ville

   if you do youll have to fly there
fanning smiles  therell be no mov-
ing out of here for three hours or
more maybe you dont know it but
there was a forest fire here and-
bucks jaw sags  a forest fire
yes now that you mention it-

   yes says the tm  pretty bad
one too it caught the yard office and
depot here and darned near burned
them down most of our records and
instruments were destroyed the fire
was finally put out though

   so i see but what does that do

to my train buck wants to know

   nothing fanning replies with a
cunning twinkle in his eyes  only
itll be three hours before communica-
tion with the dispatcher can be re-
stored we have decided to tie you
up until then

  honestly i believe fanning was
glad the depot and yard office were
burned since it gave him a chance to
hook buck

   i dont suppose a train has ever
been moved without a dispatcher
buck sneers  im number seventy-
two a second class train-

   and inferior by direction to nine-
ty-nine which has not yet arrived
fanning interrupts  have you any
more brilliant ideas

   theyd be wasted buck sighs

   your sarcasm is not wanted an-
derson  fanning retorts angrily i
dont have to look to you for any in-
formation concerning the movement of
trains there is no way to get you out
of here mr hackett and i have dis-
cussed every possible way out of the
situation and found none therefore
you are tied up and you cant tell me
anything

   im not going to try buck
yawns  if i did youd probably block
any move i might make

  fanning blows up  no railroad
official would block any legitimate and
safe method anderson he snarls
shaking his fist at buck  youre slip-
pery i admit but this is one situation
you wont be able to slip out of if you
do ill buy you a box of cigars ill
do more than that ill tip my hat to
you every time we meet from now on
in recognition that youre a better rail-
road man than i am

  the conductors eyes glisten like
they do when hes ready to pull a fast
one but he doesnt say a word what


railroad stories

buck has in mind is beyond me any-
way he thinks too fast for most folks

  i trail him to the engine where but-
tons is close to tears motioning but-
tons to come along he cuts across the
tracks to where a grocery store is back
where the depot used to be fanning is
watching us and laughing while talk-
ing to hackett buck just smiles as i
tell him this and he goes into the store

   want to use your phone for a long
distance call to pineville buck tells
the storekeeper  ill pay the charges
 sorry replies the storekeeper
 but the wires are down forest fire
you know the tkp railroad su-
perintendent and trainmaster tried to
reach a dispatcher there they wanted
to get orders for a train

  buck looks stumped plain to see he
hadnt expected hackett and fanning
to think of a move like that no won-
der they were laughing at us buck
looks at the phone and frowns

  thats one on me he admits
 and perley is a closed station
perley is a little town four miles
from kline nothing there but a gen-
eral store with the postoffice of
course a dispatchers phone is kept
there in the blockhouse on the siding
where a conductor can get orders in
a case of emergency if we had been
there buck could have called and got
orders i said as much

   that idea has already occurred to
me buck says  the question is
how are we going to get over there
 i can walk buttons offers eag-
erly  take a red flag and go ahead
you can follow it will be slow-

   too slow buck objects  i can
do better than that wonder if we can
hire an automobile and driver to take
you over

 we got a light delivery truck
speaks up the storekeeper  my boy

will drive you for a dollar he often
takes drummers over there

   get him buck orders  now to
see if i can get the postmaster and
perley

he gets the postoffice only the
postmaster happens to be a she
instead of a he buck says its just to
make sure the phone is working and
hangs up then he tells buttons to get
his red flag and torpedoes off the
engine

   go to perley buck says  and
call me from there as soon as you ar-
rive then go out to flag and well
come right over hold everything till
we get there ill be waiting right here
whats your phone number mr store-
man 

   forty-four replies the store-
keeper  and heres my boy with the
truck

  buttons loses no time obeying buck
twelve minutes after the truck leaves
kline the brakeman is calling from
perley buck pays for all calls and
we hike to the engine on a dead run

  lazy lon blinks as buck outlines the
situation  does hackett and fanning
know about this the engineer asks

   no buck says a move like
this would be too deep for their offi-
cial minds since its not in the rule
book anyway you got a flag ahead
for protection thats all youre inter-
ested in now shake out of here

  lon shakes out me and buck catch
the caboose on the fly once we get to
perley buck hurries to the phone to
call the dispatcher right now that
smart boy wants to know how the hell
we got over there

   you wouldnt understand if i told
you buck answers  give me or-
ders to get out of here and make it
speedy
slippery bucks ballroom run



  the only answer buck gets to this
is silence im willing to bet sniffles
will hold us there as long as he can
just for spite it looks like it for the
next moment or two then suddenly
the dispatchers voice comes trembling
over the line

   copy order

   shoot buck begs  im wait-
ing

  while slippery buck is copying the
order i go out and give lazy lon the
signal to back up so buck wont have
so far to walk to deliver the orders
the engine is opposite the blockhouse
when buck comes out

   the world is ours he chuckles
shaking orders at me we meet nine-
ty-riine at redtown and hold the main
line explain that if you can and you
get the box of cigars fanning is buy-
ing for me

   i cant i reply but ill bet
hes got a good reason

  he has we learn that later its the
same reason which keeps us from be-
ing delayed any more from then on
six oclock sees us in the yards at pine-
ville ten minutes later were in the
yard office no sooner do we light
there than the yardmaster hands us a
message its from hackett over
bucks shoulder i read as follows

    take condr anderson and crew out
  of service have them report my office
  tomorrow ten am for investigation

  i sigh  now what do you sup-
pose he has on his mind i ask buck
we didnt overlook anything did
we

   not a thing buck smiles  ive
checked every move and theyre all
foolproof dont you go to worrying
and let it spoil your good time at the
dance tonight come on lets go home
buttons is already there ill bet

    uck is all wrong buttons is at
the beanery where cute little ma-
bel is giving him the wager money and
a glad hand

   up in the dispatchers office sniffles
is looking out the window like hes lost
his best friend hes lost more than
that only we dont know it at the
time

  just a moment anderson i bel-
lows a voice just then  want to talk
to you

  me and buck stop the next mo-
ment i almost swallow my chewing to-
bacco when i see nobody else but old
bulger bascom the general manager
of the tkp waddling toward us
the way hes chewing on his fat cigar
shows hes on the warpath i take one
look and move on far enough to be out
of the way

   ah says buck  glad to see
you mr bascom

  never mind the fibs barks bas-
com taking the cigar out of his mouth
and pointing it at buck  what do
you mean by worrying my officials like
you do and scaring them half to death
by your wild stunts

  the gm grunted before the con-
ductor could reply he went on  and
how in the hell did you get out of
kline today without orders or even a
clearance 

   by railroading buck replies and
goes into details

  old bascom puts the cigar back in
his mouth and glares at buck  and
who told you it was good railroading
he snorts loudly  one of your own
ideas 

   the idea is not new buck admits
modestly  an old conductor used
practically the same method in moving
his train the fast mail out of town
under similar circumstances the dif-
ference is he had to use a horse and


railroad stories

follow it over to the next town while
i used an auto and phones they made
a trainmaster out of him buck added
slyly  hes a general manager now

   well im not making any train-
master out of you bascom declares
 god knows you give me enough trou-
ble as a conductor id be in a hell of
a fix with an official that knew as much
as i did what i ought to do is fire
you

   mr hackett has already done
that says buck  we got the mes-
sage at the yard office

  tear it up bascom explodes
 when youre fired im going to have
the pleasure of doing it myself you
scalawag but it wont be for doing
a damn good job of railroading now
run along or youll be late for the
dance

  with which he shoos buck away like
an old woman herding chickens by
the twinkle in his eyes i know were
not losing our jobs honestly the old
gent acted like he was kind of proud
of buck and his stunt

   i think i understand why we got
orders at perley without being de-
layed buck muses as he joins me
 bascom was in the office at the time
and ill bet sniffles got a bawling out
he will never forget

  sniffles got more than that as we
learned later he got notice from bas-
com that hed never become a chief dis-
patcher or any other kind of official
and a few months after that sniffles
walker left the tkp to take a job
with another road

h yes we went to the trainmens
ball that night it was the usual
big success buttons is so happy he
cant talk mabel promises that night
to be mrs brown for life so far she
has kept her word

   and i owe it all to you buck
buttons chokes his thanks  ill never
forget what youve done for me
buttons isnt the only one who was
never to forget fanning is another
he buys the box of cigars for buck
the next day when buck meets him on
the street and reminds him of it fan-
ning buys with bad grace and then
starts off only to have buck call him
back

   youve forgotten something else
buck reminds him at the same time
touching the brim of his hat  re-
member

  fanning glares for just a second at
buck then he grins his hand goes
up to his hat the trainmaster is -a
better sport than i thought hed be

                                                                    r

 hogheads dying request

ahoghead on his deathbed lay

his life was ebbing fast away

his friends around him closely pressed
to hear the hoggers last request

he said  before i bid adieu

one last request ill make of you

before i soar beyond the stars
just hook me on to ninety cars

 oh let me on that engine there

just see how rough i can handle air

oh let me at some water tank

make a big-hole stop and give a yank

then from the corner of my eye
ill watch the pieces as they fly

then ill calmly softly sit me down

and watch the dust-clouds settle round

 oh let me pull a drawbar out

and take my can with its long snout

and get me down upon the ground
and take my time to oil around

	r	

 then far behind in that red caboose
 ill hear the conductor turning loose
 a few pet names as in days of yore
 ive heard a thousand times before

  oh just once more before im dead

 let me stand the conductor on his head
 let me see him crawl from beneath the
 wreck

 with a window sash hung round his neck

  and you dear friends ill have to thank
 if youll let me die at the water tank
 within my ears that familiar sound

 the tallowpot pulling the tank spout
   down

 oh let the train with drawbar down

 have all the crossings blocked in town
 and when they chain those cars together

 i hope itll be in sloppy weather

  and when at last in the grave im laid
 let it be in the cool of the water tank
 shade

 and put within my lifeless hand

 a monkey wrench and the old oil can

 a marble slab i do not crave

 just mark the head of my lonely grave
 with a drawbar pointing toward the skies
 showing the spot where this hogger lies

 then fainter grew the hoggers tone

 his friends around him began to groan
 his mind was wandering far away
 perhaps to some other bygone day-

 when he as a hogger of great renown
 was turning cabooses upside down
 perhaps his mind was wandering back
 to a drawbar close beside the track

 while he was trying to start the train
 and was doing his best to break the
 chain

 then his face lit up in joyful light

 and his soul prepared to take its flight

 his friends called to him in sad refrain
 he smiled and said ive broken the
 chain

 then closing his eyes he said no more

 he was  doubling the hill  to the other
    shore	-henry mcnamara

highway robbery

by george l phillips

merican standard of living
still said to be despite
depression the highest in
world an american citi-
can buy more with what
he gets than anyone with a similar job in
any other country the big reason for
taxing articles imported from other coun-
tries is to prevent poorly paid foreign la-
bor from underselling better paid ameri-
can labor who would thus be forced out
of their jobs the same principle applies
in our own competition when the de-
pression came cut-throat competition whit-
tled wages down in many industries one
of the first acts of the roosevelt adminis-
tration was to recognize that fact it es-
tablished through the n r a uniform
minimum wages for industry

  such has been the theory and such has
been the policy-for every industry except
transportation in this industry trucks
busses and waterways are allowed to get
away with plenty when it comes to pay-
ing their employees-even more than they
get away with plenty in the matters of
regulation and taxation the railroads
however pay good wages fixed by negotia-
tion with tfie management under provi-
sions carefully legalized

  the government has done nothing to
protect railroad wages from competition of
other transportation workers all of whom
work for a fraction of railroad wages and
some of whom get practically nothing in-
deed the n r a itself approved oj mini-

mum transportation wages which are far
below the standard of railroad wages per-
haps we cant blame this state of affairs
entirely on the government it may not
have had time to go into the matter prob-
ably it will act on it as soon as it can
what you can do about it ill tell you in
a minute or two

  to be fair and honest i will admit that
the truck bus and waterway people prob-
ably pay good wages to some people darn
good wages in fact can you guess who
these people are well they are the boys
down in washington hanging around and
making it their well-paid jobs to see that
congress and the administration appreci-
ate their industries and there are plenty
of them too they are rewarded for eco-
nomically wasteful work in behalf of an
industry which itself represents waste in
transportation

  official figures on the pitiful wages paid
to motor transport labor are pretty scanty
just now but you yourself can look around
and see how pitiful they really are why
even the motor wage scales compiled al-
most two years ago by the bureau of la-
bor statistics showed the average inter-city
bus driver received less than  cents an
hour and worked more than  hours a
week and the average inter-city truck
driver worked more than  hours a week
for  the point here is that these fig-
ures do not include the railroads and the
nations worst enemies-the wage chiselers
who operate independently the fly-by-

zen
highway robbery



three more were added to s highway injury list when this greyhound bus running
late between boston and buffalo slid down a hill in syracuse n y over a bridge and into
a creek the bus started skidding when the driver swerved out of the way of a giant
tractor-trailer last year was the red-letter year for u s highway accidents almost a
hundred were killed and more than two thousand five hundred were injured on the

average every single day of the year

nighters who load their ramshackle trucks
and busses far beyond capacity the high-
way robbers who have brought the travel
standards of america down to those of a
hundred years ago and the living stand-
ards of their employees below those of
good civilized horses

  is this an exaggeration not at all i
know of one truck outfit that doesnt pay
wages it simply gives a man his  board
and room  and what a board and room
in return for  hours or more a day of
back-breaking brain-splitting labor talk
about highway robbery i know of one
cut-rate bus company which in freighting
its passengers from new york to chicago
in  hours or more provides them with
the worst experience of a lifetime and
dumps them out exhausted and demoral-
ized mentally and physically last jan-
uary th  passengers on a through
new york city-chicago bus were over-

come and one was killed by carbon mon-
oxide gas from the exhaust when the bus
was only a dozen miles out of its terminal
these are extreme examples but they are
examples of the things which bleed our
transportation system the most and which
cost more in the long run than railroads

p ven the reputable truck and bus
 companies pay miserable wages when
compared to those of railroad men they
admit it indeed they defend their posi-
tion they claim that if they paid the
railroad wage scale theyd be forced out
of business i ask you gentlemen aint
that just too bad why if the trucks
and busses represent transportation prog-
ress as they claim they do they should be
able to pay twice as much as the railroads
pay especially in view of the fact they
arent charged anywhere near enough for
the roads they run on

            courtesy kentucky railroad employees and citizen leagues  s utb st louisville ky
 when a railroad line is abandoned the community served by it no longer receives the
 benefit of hiah railroad wages it gets only highway wages amounting to a quarter as much

                                                                  r

  get me right on this i dont exactly
favor equal wages for highway and rail-
road men not under present conditions
anyway the type of men who operate
our trains cannot be compared with the
average run of fellows to whom bus and
truck owners entrust their vehicles

  nevertheless the difference should not
be as great as it is the coolie even
though he may not be as good a man as
an american worker could still put the
american out of a job if he were allowed
to compete suppose american automobile
manufacturers imported enough coolies to
man their plants and paid them half the
wages they pay americans automobiles
would cost about a third as much as they
do but wouldnt we howl then lets
howl about the coolie system right here at
home in the transportation business

  a man who takes a heavy bus or truck
out on public highways at passenger train
speeds has a tremendous responsibility he
ought to be experienced fit and as good
in his work as railroad men are in theirs
his hours and rest are as much the publics
business as are the hours and rest of rail-
road employees no matter how you look
at it it is as much the duty of the govern-
ment to do something about this as it has
been the governments right to set stand-
ards for railroad labor

  these standards must be screwed to all
commercial highway traffic they must be
screwed tight to prevent chiseling of
course a farmer hauling his own produce
and so on can be exempted but the truck

engaged in inter-city haulage is a commer-
cial enterprise whether the opjyrator works
for another man or hauls his own goods
and the same requirements for qualifica-
tions hours of duty and wages should
hold

  dont think for a second that this will
come about naturally as it did in the rail-
road game there are too many men out
of work for bus and truck employees to
strike for more pay and less hours they
probably wouldnt get to first base the
only way they can be helped is by outside
intervention

  competitors of railroads have been able
to turn the transportation clock backwards
because they have not been checked on
three counts i they have not been regu-
lated as railroads have been   they have
not been taxed nearly enough to pay for
their expense in road construction and
maintenance  they have not been re-
quired to maintain working conditions and
wages anywhere near equal to those main-
tained by the railroads for comparable
work and the greatest of the three so
far as you and i are concerned is the last

  get in touch with your senators and
congressmen and tell them about the new
highway robbery dont be afraid to ex-
press yourself if you are a railroad man
your whole future depends upon what the
government will do about it if you are
just an ordinary citizen you cant afford
to let wage standards in the transportation
business slip once they are down yours
will come down too

v-lnch drivers she later became central vermont no 

 the west may brag about some crooked pikes but the brattleboro  whitehall up
 in vermont had them all beat this little road was at the time three foot gage
 it was only  miles long and  miles of them consisted of curves you could ride 
 hours from one end of the line to the other and still you wouldnt be a long way from
 where you started

     the rails were  pounds to the yard and the road bed especially during the spring
 was mud and more mud the bridges were a tribute to the engineers of the civil war
 period early in  i made a trip over this pike and the last bridge we passed over
 collapsed just as the rear car cleared on many trips previous it was not uncommon
 to watch the ties drop from the bridges and splash far below in the little river that fol-
 lowed the railroad most of its length

     despite its shortness the line enjoyed quite a business until a few years ago even
 if most of the trains consisted of wreckers half a dozen derails a day were not at all
 unusual one trip i made took  hours to complete the journey we left derry headed
 for brattleboro the latter our terminal it was snowing hard and our engine was
 having a tough time getting along through the hills with our six cars and buggy as
 we approached the  cork screw  curve all drivers and the tender trucks sank into
 the snowy ground

     the dispatcher was notified he said wed have to stay there or try to re-rail the
 engine ourselves as the wrecker was also on the ground just north of brattleboro
 great news to the crew but with much cursing we began to re-rail the little engine

     after struggling six hours we had the mill half way on but had to quit and shovel
 snow into the tank as the water was low i shoveled snow before but this time i
 thought id never get enough into the tank i bet the crew must have spent all night
 trying to fill the tank up we finally succeeded in getting her on and with enough
 snow melted in the tank to carry us to the nearest water plug we started

    at windhall we had to pick up a car of lumber the car stood on a spur track
 that dropped down a steep incline toward a saw mill the engineer backed down o k
 but the little goat couldnt get the car up out of there finally we decided to leave
 the car

     that being settled i gave the engineer a go ahead signal but he didnt go far
 the engine failed to get up herself without engine we were licked the fireman
 dumped the fire the crew walked back to the station and notified the dispatcher of
 our mess we were greeted with orders to tie up as best we could and relief would
 come through in the afternoon the snow got so deep during the day that the road
 was tied up the next day it was three days later when we reached brattleboro-

ne of the strangest rail-
roads in the world is a
narrow-gage pike a mile
long at benton harbor
michigan owned and op-
erated by the house of david the
house of david is a religious cult
known to the public largely because its
men wear long hair and beards after
the fashion of galileans in the days of
christ a safety-razor salesman in
that colony would starve to death

  the road has eight locomotives all
were built in the h of d machine
shops twenty years ago and are still
running these engines are as near
like standard-gage power as they can
be made even including air brakes bell
and steam whistle all are steamers
and burn coal

  nos i   and  are -- types
while the others are --s each
of the -- types weighs about
 pounds and each of the others
about  each carries  pounds
of steam but instead of the single large
headlight used a few years ago she now
has two electric lights

  the track is fifteen-inch gage and
runs over two high bridges and
through fifty acres of beautiful park
and orchards real little rails track
spikes and oak ties are used with guard
rails on all curves crossings are pro-
tected with gates manned by long-whis-
kered railroaders there are about a
mile of main line tracks and a mile of
sidetracks leading to the roundhotise
etc this is a real miniature round-
house with the number of each engine
over her stall

  trains consist of eight cars apiece
except the work trains which like those
on the big roads have as many flats
and other cars as are needed the
trains are used also to haul members
of the colony to work and to clean up
rubbish around the park

   usually boys are employed as en-
gineers as they are popular among
children who patronize the road
writes r b white of drayton plains
michigan who supplied some of the
facts in this article  however when
the conductor came for my ticket i
found he had enough  seniority  on his
chin to work for any railroad

  white who is a section foreman on
the grand trunk railway asked one
of the h of d rails if he could get a
job on their pike believe it or not
the man felt whites chin and shook
his head  no

  the streak o rust is only one of
many enterprises which the house of
david conducts this cult acquired
more than  acres of land city
blocks docks boats factories and
many buildings totally valued at mil-
lions of dollars at one time in addi-
tion to the railroad they owned and
operated a street car line between ben-
ton harbor and st joseph and two
steam vessels besides raising garden
produce and selling it in the open mar-
ket making and selling many useful
articles

  the colony is really a little city in
itself-an industrious and self-sustain-
ing community its founder  king
benjamin  purnell was born in ken-
tucky in  ruled for twenty-four

this group in benton harbor numbered
more than  men women and chil-
dren-in addition to a multitude of
others said to have been scattered
throughout the world-but this total
has dwindled considerably since the
leaders death

  king ben claimed that he himself
was without sin and would live for-
ever and promised immortality to his
devotees members of the sect some
of them wealthy turned over all their
property to the house of david and
agreed to work without money in re-
turn for food shelter and clothing sup-
plied by the management

religion members pledge themselves
not to drink alcoholic liquor nor smoke
tobacco nor even eat meat their
favorite hobbies are music and base-

ball teams have made extensive tours

of the country and attracted much
comment

 king ben was known as the
 seventh messenger angel of the
king of god at first he announced
that the day of resurrection would be
the longest day in june  but
when june  came and went with-
out any blowing of celestial trumpets
he explained his prophecy by saying
 a day is as a thousand years in the
sight of the lord

  the  messenger angel  lived in a
palatial mansion which he called  shi-
loh  and was reputed to have had
numerous girl attendants in fact he
got into legal difficulties for this rea-
son there was a sensational exposure
of the colony in the courts some years
ago and king ben himself went into
hiding but in other respects he was
a born leader a brilliant organizer he
taught that everyone should practice
some form of creative activity as

one writer said in the new york times
of april  

  a man must have a remarkable
personality to induce some  men
and women to take their families to
him sign away all their property and
live as serfs    benjamin is dominant
magnetic almost hypnotic

  for years after purnells death his
mummified body lay in state in an
upper front room in the  house of
diamonds watched over by faithful
devotees looking for the glorious day
of his resurrection possibly the body
is still there it is said to have been
treated with a special process which

makes it hard as stone and was
wrapped in white linen set off with
gold and diamonds

  rumor whispers that nearly a mil-
lion dollars in jewelry is hidden in that
upper-story room with the body
guarded by armed men whether this
is truth or legend is hard to say at
any rate the mysterious colony at ben-
ton harbor is well worth a visit its
quite a thrill to ride on the h of d
railroad and the cost is only  cents

big roads the conductor will punch
your ticket twice and give it back to
you as a souvenir

solving a wyoming mystery

ne of the toughest stretches on the u p used to be through
a valley in southern wyoming called the  hole in the wall

here hung out professional bad men-specialists in cattle rustling
safe-blowing train wrecking etc train robberies became so fre-
quent that in  the u p sent for timothy t keliher a former
nebraska sheriff made him their chief special agent and said

 robberies must stop take what men and equipment you need
and go to it

   keliher went to cheyenne picked a posse of ten they were
all fancy shots-could hit the ace of spades flung in the air and
so on three of them were the best trailers in the west keliher
commandeered an old passenger coach and converted it into a rolling arsenal at one
end were quarters in which the men ate and slept at the other end was a stable for
their ponies he arranged that the pursuit car should have right of way over all other
trains and stood ready to take after bandits on a moments notice

   one night the wires began burning up from green river outlaws held up pump-
ing station at williams shot pumper through the arm and smashed a switch so as to
wreck train pumper left as dead crawled to a phone and called green river halting
train long enough to get switch fixed up

    keliher appropriated a locomotive he and his men highballed west it was their
first call at williams a parched desert spot near green river they found nobody
for the pumper had been taken to a hospital near the smashed switch keliher found
a trail of blood leading to the phone inside the pump station he picked two of his
best man-hunters sent one three miles to the north the other three to the south
these men slowly spiralled in toward the pump station moving in opposite directions

     no tracks they both reported

    that gave keliher a hunch he told his men to get in the car and the locomotive
pulled them back to green river at the hospital he found the pumper doing well
and apparently pleased with the attention he was getting

   you were alone out at williams werent you he asked kindly the pumper
looked at keliher suspiciously admitted he was ive heard said the chief that
a man who was lonesome enough would do anything-even shoot himself-to get a little
notice how about it

   the pumper looked suddenly very tired and disappointed  yeah he admitted
the bandit story was pure fiction--jim holden

helpful hints on locomotive photography

uring the last four years

c   and especially the past few
ny jf months members have been
 sending us a lot of interesting

 - engine photos most of them

are surprisingly good despite the fact they
were probably taken with small inexpensive
hand cameras however weve noticed
that many of them were made from nega-
tives which obviously could produce bet-
ter prints than the ones we saw that many
pictures would have been improved if they
had been given longer exposures or if the
camera diaphragm had been stopped
down to insure sharp focus and the ex-
posure made still longer here then are
a few simple rules to observe

  	get your engine straight in the
finder make sure it isnt tipped to one
side a good way to do this is to notice
the upright lines of the cab and tender and
see to it that they are parallel with the
sides of the finder

  	focus properly if your camera has
a focusing rack and stop down if it is
equipped with a stopping device stop-
ping down is closing of the eye of the
camera so that the opening is smaller and
less light enters this of course means
longer exposure but sharper negatives



  	give plenty of exposure especially
if you stop down try to take your
engine pictures on a sunny day and even
then give them more time than you would
ordinary subjects if necessary buy or
make a tripod or camera stand so that if
you have to you can take exposures of
more than  second never give more
if you are holding the camera after you
have stopped down a little experimenting
will soon enable you to determine when
you have enough exposure

  	try to develop your own negatives
and print your own pictures if you cant
do the former at least print your own
once you get the hang of it-and anybody
can-your prints will be sharper and
cleaner will last longer and will cost about
one-fifth as much as commercial prints

  	keep your lens clean

  among the hundreds of members who
take good pictures we picked a couple who
have been sending us unusually good prints
they are robert graham  union st
st paul minn and wesley krambeck
herington kan both use ordinary cam-
eras but each has produced prints which
were far ahead of many professional
 company  photographs we asked them
to tell us something of their photographic
international engine picture club



technique and they responded with a lot
of useful information if you have any
trouble with your pictures it will help you
mr krambeck for example says

   i always try to take front side views
that is a broadside with a little of the front
end too i get as close as i can but am
careful that i have the whole engine in the
picture my camera is a plain box camera
with a single lens of the same speed as all
box cameras editors note about fi
it uses size  film - x -
it has no attachments and there isnt any-
thing unusual fancy or modern about it
as i have had it for over ten years i keep
the lens very clean at all times while
the shutter has no variation of speeds with
the use of fast film i have taken a number
of pictures in cloudy or bad weather which
might be considered good or fair some-
times i can get a moving engine if i stand
to the front and it isnt moving too fast

   i use agfa ansco plenachrome film ex-
clusively i have found it far superior to
others in locomotive picture taking for it
is not only a very fine grained film but it
produces clear sharp contrasty negatives
the last quality is very important in en-
gine pictures

   after i became interested in taking
locomotives i soon found that having my
developing and printing done was going to
be extremely expensive then too all
pictures which commercial photographers
had made for me faded or turned brown
within two years so i decided to do my
own printing but continued to have my
films developed by commercial photog-
raphers for about three years after i
started doing my own printing however
i had a great deal of trouble getting good
work on the films they would develop
them in old solutions which gives the
same results as exposing a film and then
letting it lie around for several months be-
fore developing scratch them and tear
little chunks of emulsion off and would
not wash them clean i got such unsatis-
factory results i decided to do my own
film developing also

   i develop in the bath room after dark

for a dark room lamp i use merely a drop
cord from the ceiling socket with a -watt
red bulb however to make sure the film
does not absorb any of the red rays from
the lamp i place a cardboard shade over
the lamp on the side toward the film
plenachrome film is very  fast so i use
just barely enough red light to see at all
for the developer and fixing bath i use a
couple of small bowls or enameled pans

   to develop the exposed film i unroll
it run it up and down a few times in clear
water to soften the film make it easy to
handle and do away with air bubbles
after that i take the film to the developer
and run it up and down through that solu-
tion about four minutes then i put it
back into the water and quickly rinse the
developer off next i run the film up and
down through the fixing bath for at least
 minutes i work the film up and down
in it not less than twice as long as it took
to develop it

   after the film is fixed i wash it to
avoid wasting a lot of water and to save
myself time i had a small galvanized tin
tank made it cost  is  wide 
long and - deep it will accommo-
date two rolls of films at one time i do
not have to touch the films until they are
completely washed this eliminates the
possibility of scratching although i wash
them at least six times and let them soak
two minutes between washings before drain-
ing and running fresh water into the tank

  i made a film drying frame out of yard-
sticks bolting them together and carving
a long slot in each stick at one end of the
frame after the films are washed i clip
them to this drying frame with clothes
pins fastening both top and bottom of the
film to the rack leaving no slack in the
film then i stand the rack up against the
wall so the films will be hanging ends up
and down and let them dry overnight
they turn out exceptionally clean and
smooth with no dirt or water spots

   for developing plenachrome film i use
ansco m q tube powders a c tube
makes  ounces of developer merely by dis-
solving in water and is enough to develop


railroad stories

two rolls of films a number of other de-
velopers can be used satisfactorily too

  my printing equipment consists of a
medium-sized box lined with white paper
and equipped with a -watt electric lamp
a printing frame with adjustable mask a
small tin dark room lamp which i equipped
with an electric lamp -watt white lamp
behind red glass one small enameled pan
for developer a good-sized dish for clear
water and an ordinary dish for fixing bath

   for developer i use eastman m q
tubes for fixing bath kodak fixing powder
as the temperature of the developer varies
according to weather conditions i always
test a picture or two when starting in order
to judge the approximate exposure required
after that i expose  or  then run them
through the developer and repeat until
through i time the exposure by counting
in my mind rather than by a watch i try
to give just enough exposure so the picture
will come out steadily and will be fully
developed in about a minute and a half

   after the picture reaches a certain
point i take it out of the developer letting
the developer drain from it back into the
pan and hold it up to the red lamp until
it gets exactly where i want it then i
quickly rinse it in clear water and place it
in the fixing bath where it remains not
less than  minutes if i underexpose
and the picture comes out too slow or over-
expose and it comes out too fast i throw
it away i now have my system down to a
point where i can almost without fail judge
the exact exposure with a tube of m q
developer by draining the developer from
the picture back into the pan i can make
from  to  pictures per tube

   i use eastman azo f no  papers
exclusively for all engine pictures this is
a slow hard paper and intended for flat
negatives however i have found it satis-
factory for all since it produces black and
white effects this is very important in
getting good engine pictures if a negative
is so dense that printing on no  paper
will produce chalky effects i use no 
paper as i have found the no  tends to
produce greenish effects

   after the pictures are properly fixed i
wash them at least  different times per-
mitting them to soak at least two or three
minutes between washings

   when they are washed i place them on
the  ferro  plates and lay a cloth over
them running a print roller lightly over the
cloth to take up excess moisture then re-
move the cloth and roll them with the print
roller i use a small  inch roller as it
enables me to give each picture proper at-
tention

   in hot weather i try to keep my solu-
tions as cool as i can but often i have to
cut down the exposure to conform to the
increase in developer temperature this is
against the rules but i have good results

   although i print  to  pictures in
an evening my system of using a fairly
slow light hard papers and allowing de-
veloper sufficient time to act on the papers
by proper exposure is not as fast as it
might be however i prefer to take a
little more time and get good results than
to hurry and get poorer results

   i buy my supplies in fairly large
quantities the cost for developing each
roll of film averages about c per roll for
making each print approximately ic per
picture including cost of light water etc

  weve seen at least  of mr kram-
becks better prints and they are equal if
not superior to many we ourselves have
taken with cameras equipped with sharp
anastigmatic lenses the big secrets of
mr krambecks work we believe are his
careful photography in plenty of sunlight
developing his own films and printing his
own on hard paper to provide contrast and
bring out detail note how what he says
fits in with the advice of mr graham

   i have an ordinary eastman  size
kodak with an f lens the great ma-
jority of my pictures are taken with fn in
good sunlight and f or f are used as
needed i nearly always use a speed of
 second although in cases of poor sun-
light or where the sun is too low in the
afternoon i sometimes use  second
the  and  speeds are only for
moving trains i use a focus of  feet
international engine picture club



northern pacific no  and rock island no  snapped by robert graham in the twin cities

   i keep my lens clean a railroad yard
is not the cleanest place there is and with
smoke and soot in the air a lens is bound
to become dirty i not only wipe off both
sides of the lens every time a film is re-
placed but carry the kodak around closed
opening it only when a picture is to be
taken in taking a picture i hold as still
as i possibly can and hold my breath as
the picture is snapped i have never used
a tripod although with a speed of iio i
like to steady the kodak against some ob-
ject if convenient editors note- most
people cannot hold still longer than 
second

   as for film i always use agfa plena-
chrome i do not say it is best as i have
taken many good pictures with others but

i believe agfa is much better for engine
pictures since it shows up detail and has
more contrast

   i do not develop my own film as i
have a photographer upon whom i can de-
pend but i make all my own prints
using eastman m-q developer and kodak
fixing powder in printing i try to under-
expose very slightly rather than overexpose
as this causes the picture to come out more
slowly in the developer and gives a better
opportunity to catch it at just the proper
time i use azo f no  paper it brings
out detail better than a softer paper and
detail is the big thing in engine pictures

   one more item the position of the sun
i take many photos in summertime from
 to  a m and from  to  p m when


railroad stories

the sun is lower and shines on the wheels
and under parts at noon the are all-
buried in shade the same is true even
when slightly cloudy when it is very
cloudy i dont take engine pictures

   good clear air is important the ac-
companying print of n p  was taken
late one afternoon when the sun shone after
a heavy wind and rain storm which had
cleared the air

 actual happenings told by eye witnesses

red rails

h

onolulu to moscow-
job hunting my friends
said it was a crazy idea
when i arrived in mos-
cow and found there were
jobs galore with salaries for office
workers ranging from  to 
rubles a month i was jubilant when
i discovered these ruble salaries were
equal in buying power to  to
 in american money i departed
but the trip to moscow from the east
was fascinating

information about rail travel in
communist siberia was meagre i
bought a ticket anyway to moscow via
manchuria and siberia russia is a
classless nation and so the various
price levels for railway travel are
called categories about the only dif-
ferences between first and second are
a wash basin which first has and
second has not and the price which is
 more for first the cost of the
eleven-day -mile train journey
from dairen to moscow second cate-

the main line of the trans-siberian railroad where it swings around the southern end ot
baikal the worlds deepest lake see map on pages  and 


railroad stories

gory was  it is now consider-
ably higher

  i	sailed from shanghai on a small
japanese steamer down the whangpoo
river and up the china coast to
dairen where i transferred to the
south manchuria railway owned and
operated by the japanese government

  traffic on the train out of dairen
was heavy coaches were literally
stuffed with passengers and baggage
all available racks were overhanging
with personal luggage corridors were
blocked and even the joint washroom
for men and women contained surplus
hand bags there was no provision
made for free transportation of heavy
personal baggage and the passengers
crowded the cars with
hand luggage

 i	found myself
sharing a small com-
partment with two
russians and a jap-
anese - all men plus
nine hand bags and
suitcases the situa-
tion seemed impossible

armed with a ten-yen
note i hunted up the
japanese conductor

   please can you
give me a separate
compartment t aksan
dannasan i said add-
ing a couple of words
of japanese i knew to
make him understand
there were too many
men i fingered the
banknote

  he looked at it  i am very sorry
for you madam but there is not a
vacant compartment he replied in per-
fect english bowing politely

   then please change me to a com-
partment with women in it i pleaded

miss neill james
author of  red

   oku-san arimasen said he bow-
ing again  there are no women
the situation was bad but not as
bad as it could be i was shortly to dis-
cover a young russian visited a com-
patriot in my compartment upon
learning that he had no place to sit or
sleep he was promptly invited to share
half a berth in my compartment so
we slept five in this small four-berth
compartment three russian men a
japanese and one american girl the
window was tightly closed and the door
locked

  one luxury i did not properly ap-
preciate at the time was that my berth
had the privacy of a curtain this was
the only train on this eventful trans-
asia trip where i was
to enjoy such luxury

  immediately after
breakfast the next
morning we arrived in
changchun or hsin-
king as the japanese
have now renamed this
chinese city a lone-
some little town squat-
ting in the midst of a
broad expanse of well
tilled plains

  the traveler in asia
who must change
trains has to be alert
because throughout
manchuria and siberia
there is a passion for
changing names of
age-old towns in
manchuria the chinese
names are not liked by
the japanese so they have changed the
names of important towns in siberia
the most important of the old tsarist
towns dating from the sixteenth cen-
tury have been renamed by the present
communist rulers

true tales of the rails



when the -mile turk-sib turkestan branch line of the trans-siberian was completed
a few years ago natives for miles around came to the celebration

i was alarmed to read an account
of the deliberate wreckage of this
train by bandits who robbed the
passengers took many prisoners and
held them for ransom i had heard of an
old chinese custom that prescribes the
pouring of liquid cement into the ears
of too alert captives in order that they
cannot hear what concerns them very
much

  the chinese eastern railway cuts a
russian pathway across the whole of
north manchuria it is along this rail-
way that bandits are most active
chinese farmers have been forbidden
to plant kaoling a tall grain within a
half mile of the right-of-way as it af-
fords excellent ambush for roving
bandits who periodically wreck and
plunder trains on this line

  the passenger train on the run from

harbin to manchouli the last man-
churian outpost before entering rus-
sian territory carries an armed guard
of thirty or more japanese soldiers a
dozen or more soldiers with fixed bayo-
nets picket the train as it stands in the
station a precaution against a sudden
raid of bandits the schedule is so
arranged that the train makes the most
dangerous part of the journey during
daylight hours

  near the town of hailar with its
typical chinese architecture the rail-
road crosses the great khingan range
at the pass it goes through a tunnel
nearly two miles long over the western
arch of which is a russian inscription
to the pacific ocean true it is
more than a thousand miles to the
ocean but the pass leads there

  the chinese eastern connects with

true tales of the rails



from pageant of chinese history by e seeger

longmans oreen t co n y city

when famine comes to manchuria

it when spring
thaws came the
huge sleepers floated
and held the rails
above water al-
though trains could
not be run across the
lake until it froze
again

 the line around
the lake which now
winds in and out and
through and over
the spurs of the al-
tai mountains was
five years in the
building lack of
double-tracking and
this unfinished sec-
tion proved a great handicap to russia
during her war with japan early in
the century but the soviets are rapidly
overcoming this handicap and soon the
double-tracking of the entire trans-
siberian line will be completed

we had a six-hour wait in man-
chouli for the russian train and
in the meantime the eastbound de
luxe arrived from moscow i talked
with two american business men who
got off the train as we stood on the
platform enjoying the warm spring
sun a railway official approached us

   the trunk it is yours  he said to
the tall american

  yes the trunk it is mine why
he mocked the collector

  to his companion he said  bet you
five bucks he wants more money

  the official fumbled with a mass of
papers you go to harbin yes

   yes replied the american

   ah then you must pay ten dollars
for the trunk

   all right brother that damn
trunk has already cost me a fortune

so whats ten dollars more he said
peeling a ten spot from a roll of bills

   it must weigh at least a ton i
observed

   oh yeah  it weighs less than two
hundred pounds they make you pay
through the nose for every pound
he got out a note book and did some
rapid calculation  look here burt
by the time we reach shanghai this
trunk will be worth its weight in gold
it will have cost me a hundred and
fifty-five dollars to bring it from lon-
don

 an engineer whose watch is always
xon the dot would go mad chasing
the time on a siberian train although
there is a difference of seven hours
between moscow and vladivostok the
train carries moscow time and the
faces of the clocks carry numerals from
i to  my train arrived in man-
chouli at  am local time and was
scheduled to depart the same morning
at  am moscow time which was 
noon local time it was an hour and
a half late getting started and so it

really left at  which was  by
my time

  some stations carry local time but
the various local time stations do not
coordinate their clocks on the other
hand some stations carry moscow time
only it was quite a shock to be eating
dinner at what i thought was about
 pm and then glance out the window
at the station clock and find it past
midnight though the sun was still
shining brightly again some sta-
tions have a large clock at each end of
the platform one with local time and
the other moscow time

  the trans-siberian railway is as far
north as labrador in this latitude
in summertime it is dark only about
three hours out of the twenty-four
therefore the sun was not much help
to a confused passenger finally i
abandoned the struggle let my watch
run down and ate when i got hungry

  when we left manchouli and entered
siberia we left the railway guard at
the border apparently the russians
had not the japanese fear of bandits

  i had just settled myself in a two-
berth second category compartment
with an englishwoman as a traveling
companion when the  car-comrade 
he was the porter but no one called
him that appeared with steaming
glasses of hot tea or tchai as it is
called in russian he presided over
a samovar in the first-category end of
our car and assisted by the comrade
in the second-category end they served
hot tchai throughout the journey

without charge this luxury was only
for first-category passengers and
second category in the upper brackets

  the government provides for one
and all alike without cost an ample
supply of kipyalitok or boiling hot
water at each station the faucet has
a sign above it in large letters and as
soon as the train stops at a station
passengers seize tea pots and there is
a wild dash for kipyahtok another
scramble ensues when having ignored
the all aboard signal and the whistle
the train actually begins to move and
several passengers with kettles of boil-
ing water try to make the high steps of
the cars

  the tall blue-eyed car-comrade with
unusual red hair who spoke german
and russian but no english in addi-
tion to having charge of the samovar
took care of the compartments swept
dusted wiped the polished woodwork
of the corridor and kept all windows
securely shut as a side line he carried
on a secret illegal business which will
entitle him to a long residence in
siberia when and if he is discovered

  there is a great scarcity of sweets
in siberia and the car-comrade was a
sugar-bootlegger he was doing a
great favor to these sugar-starved
pioneers and incidentally making a
profit for himself

  at stations siberiaks rushed in
whispered saxar having the rubles
ready exact change the comrade
looked around making sure they were
unobserved opened a secret panel gave

impossible a dollar and seventy-

refused it

  i looked around eggs were one

black bread one ruble a loaf and a

was about to peel and eat an orange
i changed my mind and offered it to
the peasant who willingly traded the
pint of milk for it

although we kept the same

drew a pretty girl to mind the rear end
of the train her uniform was a dark
cotton skirt uniform woolen coat and
visored cap which she often discarded
for a bright kerchief wound attractive-

    although railroading in siberia is
certainly a man-sized job many women
are engaged in the profession large
section crews of women engaged in
loading and unloading handcars when
transporting a loaded handcar as many
women as could cluster about pushed
it while the forewoman marched well
ahead carrying a staff with an insigne
on it which she planted in the middle
of the track when they stopped to un-
load they put real zest in their labor
and when the handcar was well under
way they threw back their heads and


railroad stories

chanted as if marching into battle

  all the workers were not young and
enthusiastic however some were
middle-aged women with shawls about
their heads who went stolidly about
the business of clearing the track of
weeds laying ties carrying long steel
rails or spading out drains when a
heavy telephone post was to be moved
as many women as could cluster about
lifted it and marched off down the
track to the new location

  transportation has lagged for rus-
sia has been engrossed in building up
her heavy industries there is an
acute shortage of rolling stock and
the demand for space on the train al-
ways exceeds the supply therefore the
peasants bring their worldly posses-
sions sleep in the station and patiently
hope for a seat on the next train and
the next it is the unpleasant duty of
the woman gate-keeper to keep them
back she stands sentinel-like near
the locked gate key in her pocket often
engaging in heated arguments with
would-be passengers

  to the traveler who crosses siberia
in spring it is a rich agricultural land
of limitless green plains and beautiful
flowers but to countless thousands
unhappy russians siberia is still
siberia a land of living death in
mid-siberia the express stopped for
half an hour at a station at which an
emigrant train stood the long train
was composed of ordinary box cars
stuffed with men women and children
thirty or forty being crowded into each
freight car where they lived the floor
of the car was covered with straw

  a russian engineer explained to me
they were  deprived  people that is
people who were unsympathetic with
the present regime or peasants who re-
fused to turn over their little farms to
the government for this they were

sentenced to labor in siberia i had
never before seen such poverty men
women and children were in rags and
barefooted out of the thousand  de-
prived there were possibly not two
dozen pairs of boots they shivered
in line waiting to get buckets full of
hot boiled grain with a few fish on top

  later the same day we met two
trains of prisoners their quarters
were duplicates of the  deprived 
train except the box car doors were
securely padlocked and soldiers
picketed the train as it stood in the
station at each end of the box car
was a barred opening just wide enough
for three faces to peep out the
prisoners locked behind the bars were
far more cheerful than the  deprived
who were moved about freely

  formerly prisoners were chained to-
gether and made to walk the three
thousand miles into exile which
usually took a year or more of steady
plodding only the hardy survived

  during mid-afternoon of the day we
were to arrive in moscow my destina-
tion there was great activity aboard
passengers were shushed into corridors
while compartments were whisked and
dusted at one station just before
reaching moscow squads of scrub
women swarmed aboard and mopped
the floors and wiped the woodwork
other squads of women armed with
ladders and buckets assaulted the out-
side of the train windows were
washed and polished men and women
busied themselves oiling inspecting
brakes and looking for hot boxes

  a clean linen hand towel and a bar
of soap were placed in the lavatories-
luxuries we had not enjoyed before on
the trip the comrades slicked them-
selves up and we made an impressive
entrance into moscow just twenty
minutes late
true tales of the rails



beef tallow and limburger

by highball john burns

n bygone days before cylin-
  der or valve oil came into
  general use with the lu-
  bricator beef tallow was
  used to oil valves and cylin-
  ders on wood-burning engines

  i first noticed its use in the year
 tallow came to the roundhouse
oil-room in large oak barrels in zero
weather we had to chop it out with an
ax the store-room clerk would knock
in the barrel head if the tallow was
fresh he would keep it in the oil-room
and weigh it out to the  tallowpots 
firemen as they called for it

  but in hot weather when the tallow
was good and ripe with the barrel full
of fat wigglers which gave off a most
offensive odor the clerk would roll it
outdoors and invite us to help our-
selves

 take all you can use he would
say  for you certainly wont get any
more until that barrel is empty

 so mr engineer and mr tallowpot
would have to hang a clothes-pin on
the end of their noses every time they
gave the old wood-burners valves and
cylinders a shot of that over-ripe
tallow through the tallow cups how-
ever it was great stuff to start a fire
and many a pound of spoiled tallow
went into the firebox

  my old friend rube shosser hogger
on a yard goat for whom i fired more
than forty years ago liked a can of
beer with his lunch often this lunch
consisted of limburger cheese sand-
wiches of rye bread which he brought
from home in a paper bag and stored
in his seatbox

  the night engineer baldy taylor
kept clothes in the same seatbox along
with a tobacco sack full of asafetida
which he claimed acted as a disin-
fectant when baldy got home each
morning his wife would not give him
breakfast until he took a bath and
changed his clothes she maintained he
had been sleeping in a stock car with a
bunch of dead hogs

  finally mrs taylors protests be-
came so vehement that rube had to
keep his limburger cheese in the tool-
box rubes regular fireboy was up to
the limburger racket and would stick
his head out of the cab window for
fresh air one day the regular fireboy
laid off and rube drew a green kid to
fire his engine while the hogger was
washing down his limburger and rye
with a can of beer the new firebov
sang out  hey rube we musta got
another can of that damn rotten tallow
again

speaking of unpleasant odors re-
minds me of the bright summer
morning about thirty years ago when
engineer jimmy gleason and i brought
a live skunk to chicago on the pilot of
his pet ten-wheeler jimmy gleason
wasnt his real name any more than
rube shosser was the other hoggers
name but the facts are all true

  jimmy had the milk shake  run a
six-car mixed train that stopped at
every country station and crossroads to
pick up milk cans and occasionally a
crate of chickens i was firing at the
time we saw the white-striped pussycat
on front of the engine we cussed it


railroad stories

closed the cab windows and headed for
town

  into grand central depot we rolled
and made an impressive stop right be-
side an outbound baltimore  ohio
limited cooks and waiters quickly
closed the windows and made menac-
ing gestures at us

  we had forgotten about the skunk
and wondered what was wrong jimmy
dropped down to the depot platform to
give his high-wheeler the once-over to
see if she had brought all her drivers
and the side-rods to town with her
there he found the ill-smelling animal
sitting pretty on the pilot crossbeams
his head sticking out between the
beams

  disgusted jimmy grabbed up a
handful of track ballast and threw it
at the creature this hurt mr skunks

feelings so badly that he turned on the
fireworks and perfumed things proper
then he scrambled out from under the
pilot and made a bee line for the b 

o	dining car where he parked himself
on a car truck the station master
coming on the scene gave the hogger
 hail columbia

  jimmy promptly disclaimed owner-
ship of the skunk  if the b  o
boys want him and feel like making a
pet out of him said jimmy magnani-
mously why thats all right with me
with that he climbed back on the
ten-wheeler and rang his bell and the
hostler backed our engine out of the
depot trainshed we never learned
what the b  o boys finally did about
that skunk if any old-timer who re-
members how this incident ended i
wish he would tell me about it

the boomer trail

  stories about boomers out
t with trains going down
sbodys mountain  mph
only one good brake to hold
cars are sumpn what the
brothers that doesnt happen
more on anybodys pike and
that hero of the throttle stuff i ask you gentle-
men did you ever see a hero of the throttle i
know a lot of throttle jerkers here and there
around the country but none were heroes

  anyway i started out to be one of these heroes
but the brass hats put up a job on me for every
time i looked for a job firing i always landed
one as a shack and so i never got my name in
the newspapers by having a couple of nice wrecks
etc nobody ever hears of a conductor or brake-
man having thrills and adventures they only sit
in the doghouse and spell out the words of old
newspapers

  all the boomers arent out west either there
are plenty of em right in new york city phila-
delphia baltimore or almost any old place stand
on sands st in brooklyn some nice evening or
sunday and you will see men who were real
boomers from  to  jeff red and high-
ball w-all are there around the white-tiled eat-
ing house under the elevated

  go up to th st on the lexington subway
but its elevated up there so go down the steps
cross the street look in a  coffee pot  window
and if you know your boomers you will see a
couple here that havent been parted in 
years i know because i have worked all around
with them there are two boomers in philly who
drive a truck to new york every night two
more are on the trolleys another is a doorman
for a movie theater dressed up like a german
general still another is a yard office janitor

  the eastern boomers greatest fault was get-
ting hungry or dry brothers i could make you
shed salty tears if id tell you how some boomers
starved and how long some of em went without
drinks but i wont make you feel bad now

  the runaway trains werent all out west either
one time i was working out of albany n y
on the old west shore we were coming down
the hill into albany when the old eagle-eye began
to roll the crummy around says the con  they
got away from that long necked so-an-so we
hit the deck grabbed our clubs and started over
 cars of coal we met the head man and we
wound em up two men to a club but still we
went faster the fireboy came out to help i
rubbed my rabbits foot and hoped the yard-
master would have the mair line clear
the boomer trail	

  but we began to slow when we reached it and
the hump-backed old hog stopped with her nose
near the new d  h building i grabbed the
club from the con and went ahead to visit with
the long-necked engineer the whole crew was
there in time to see the hero hogger he was
shaking and his face was white as paper he
couldnt talk so we talked to him we later
found out the air was frozen five cars back

  next day the trainmaster called it quite an ad-
venture adventure hell i told myself if that
was an adventure i didnt want any more

  the hired hands on the west shore had a lot
of other names for it some of them not so nice
in the old days it had a bunch of cars trucks
ties etc and a flock of low-wheeled hogs that
could haul  cars if the cars were empty when
a crew was called they took overcoats summer
underwear and whatever else they could carry
along with a grub basket that held enough to last
a month if they left weehawken on the first
of the month they usually wired back from kings-
ton on the th to see if the family was well and
if the cat had kittens yet with plenty of good
breaks they would hold the main at ravena on
account of plugged yard about the time the oldest
boy was ready for high school it was  miles
from weehawken to ravena

  some years ago i made the
voyage to weehawken and saw the
trainmaster after a lot of sassy
cracks about railroad tramps he
gave me a fistful of blanks to fill
out and remarked i had worked
there  times in the last five years
but he was a liar as i remember it was only 

  i made a lot of scratches on the papers that
nobody could read and the clerk shoved them
through a hole in the wall ill bet it led to a
garbage can on the other side it just as well
might have

  i was called for  am but we hadnt got into
the weehawken tunnel before we stopped for two
hours because a couple cars of cinders and a flat
were on the ground finally we got going and
made cornwall where the new york ontario 
western switched off our main line and ducked
over the mountains somewhere

  when we got to the water plug at cornwall

we were four times back that is four trains were
lined up to get a drink ahead of us and the train
in front of us was an o  w it started stopped
and waited an hour i finally got impatient and
hiked over to see what was up the o  w
train was on the ground it was three hours-
almost  pm-before they discovered a big hook
and got her on again we had made  miles in
 hours hows that brothers

  our pig was no  or  and she was an
awful lawnmower at newburgh she began to
clinker and she finally stalled on a little hump
when finally we arrived at kingston we were
just in time to meet the dogcatcher seventeen
hours to go  miles

  we had long trains too out east way back
in igio when the mohawk crews of the n y
c were called the engine crew was called an hour
ahead of the trainmen who caught the crummy
as it went by the yard office in west albany
when the head end men were over in schenectady
someplace but no kiddin gents in the fall and
winter when the grain rush was on it was some-
thing to write about to the boys up at devils
lake on the g n a man had to be some
relation to the th assistant vice president to lay
off why the trains were so close that the front
brakeman lived in the caboose of the train ahead
of his

  as for the pennsy did any of you
brothers ever leave west philly
with all the cars the pennsy ever
owned or borrowed and try to get
some place youre the rat hole
artist and you have a rotten old
hog that could hardly pull herself you take turns
with the hogger and head man to keep enough
fog to work the gun let alone enough to hau a
heavy train you make frankford in about two
hours and frankford is not even out of the city
you follow the tramps ahead over crossovers and
back dodging the hot shots twenty-seven hours
later you arrive at jersey city- hours for 
miles no wonder the boys went over to fight
the kaiser it was easy compared to fighting the
freights at that time nope brothers railroading

longhorn lannigan



  longhorn reached again for the
whistle cord then he turned to thumb
his nose at the brakeman on the car
behind laughed when the boomer
thumbed back and renewed his song
the east switch crashed adobe huts
and a station spun behind his right
ear the chapelle mesa swirled out
of sight as the freight took the curve
and raced for the bridge and the cut
beyond

   look out squint were goin to
hit em

   squint didnt ask what they were go-
ing to hit a dozen times since he had
gone firing for longhorn he had heard

  over the bridge and through the cut
the consolidation rocked and rolled
ahead lay the straight stretch leading
away to the west longhorn shielded
his eyes from the western glare un-
der the sun a moving mass of white
and crimson loomed in the track ahead

  he sprang to his feet his hand
shot up to the whistle cord he
screeched into the rocking deck

that warning half a dozen times they
had plowed head-on into a herd of
longhorn cattle but none knew better
than he that if one of those steers ever
tried to retaliate by falling flat into the
track instead of hurtling sidewise it
would pile him and longhorn and a
freight hog and a string of box cars all
over the right-of-way

   he flung his scoop to the deck bat-
ting his glazed eyes he leaped to the
left gangway stood ready to jump if
this should be the time
railroad stories

  the whistle howled cattle spilled
down the embankment they boiled
over each other on the right-of-way

  but one lone bull refused to budge
squarely in the middle of the track he
stood head down tail up front feet
catching hunks of ballast and sending
them high into the air even above
the roar of the train his rumbling
challenge drifted into the cab

  longhorn did not try to stop it was
no use before the brakeman could
have set a single brake the engine was
upon the defiant brute the pilot
caught him between the knees his
bulk shot backward over the pointed
nose lammed into the smoke box and
hung poised for a split second he
rolled fell flat on his back and the
last longhorn saw of him he was lying
there longhorn grabbed his throttle
and roared on going to rowe for the
pacific mail

that bull turned the trail for
longhorn lannigan a year ago
a lincoln terril had come as superin-
tendent to establish discipline and en-
force the new rules on the division

  longhorn hated rules thats why
he had quit school and run away from
home before he was twelve when
terril had come lannigan had begun
trying to make a joke out of the new
rule book and a monkey out of the
new official

  his pranks had not been serious
there was for instance the day he had
stopped his engine under the office win-
dow and in defiance of rule g had
fished from his hip pocket a flask
turned it up taken a long pull wiped
his mouth and slipped the bottle back
into the pocket a second later he had
looked up had caught the eye of the
new super and had almost fallen off
his seat in mock consternation

  of course the trick had worked a
lincoln terril had not been used to
longhorns kind he had stormed
down the stairs leaped into the gang-
way angrily demanding  that damned
bottle with an air of injured in-
nocence longhorn had fished from his
hip a flask which was filled with
colored water and spiked with sugar
cloves and cinnamon

   jist a little substitoot mr ter-
ril he had said softly

  aware that he had bit the official
had bounded from the cab and returned
to his office grinning lannigan had
fished the real thing from behind the
seat box and taken one to the one
and only abraham lincoln terril
may he live and learn

  terril had lived and learned lan-
nigan had lived but he hadnt learned
at the end of a year he was still the
same playful kid who had come over
raton pass with the tunnel in 
he still firmly reckoned that wit
courage and the ability to run an
engine would keep him on the job when
the rule book boys had passed into his-
tory but he didnt know that homely
division super nor the men behind
hirti

  the new rule book required reports
-work reports time reports reports
on stock killed by the engine hitting
longhorns had given lannigan his
nickname rumor said he had killed
more cattle than any engineer on the di-
vision yet not one report of such acci-
dent had he turned into the office

  terril began demanding reports at
the end of the year there was a quar-
ter-inch of  please-explain-why  car-
bons in longhorns file and a week
ago terril had had him on the carpet
and had warned him that one more
failure to furnish required reports
would lead to serious consequences

 longhorn muttered a damn or two
then a smile flooded his devil-may-care
countenance with a flip of the wrist
he turned the manila sheet over held it
against the wall fished a two-inch stub
of pencil from under a half-pint bottle
on his hip and scribbled

  mr abraham lincoln terril
  deer mr terril

    i sides wiped the bull i might of

  gered youd know it anyhow and which

  longhorn lannigan
  p s plese excus this unformal re-
  port as i have not got the blank handy

  a thin smile wrinkling the corners
of his audacious mouth lannigan
sealed his report and slipped it
through the slit marked supt mail

he was called for a westbound
drag at  next morning the
fresh grin cracked into a chuckle as he
recalled the joke he had played on the
super the grin withered when he
read the first message he picked up in
rowe

   to c  e x west co opr rowe
     turn at glorieta-alt

 longhorn had expected to go to

wallace he read the other message

   to engr lannigan co opr rowe
     please report this office tomorrow

     	a m-alt

   when a high hat turns a crew to
git a man on the carpet lannigan
muttered his face sober now  he must
be on the warpath he wadded the
message up and stuffed it into his
pocket  oh well i been on the rug

before an terrils been on the war-
path before what the heck

  at three minutes of eight longhorn
sauntered into terrils office partly
because he was longhorn lannigan
partly because he figured he would get
five days and catch a freight out to
rowe he wore hiking breeches high-
topped boots and a corduroy cap he
also carried a fishing rod and a fancy
creel which he set in plain sight of the
official

  terril was signing letters his jaw
went down

   going fishing lannigan

   yes sir

   sit down lannigan if youve got
time terril jerked a bony thumb
toward the vacant chair

  longhorn sat terril flipped the let-
ters aside picked up a letter opener and
gouged it into a blue blotter his flat-
tened nose was distended for a second
but the spasm passed

   lannigan the voice was like
the pelt of sleet on a tin roof  lan-
nigan why didnt you report that steer
you killed down by bernal sunday

   why didnt i report that mr
terril i thought i mailed the report
las night

   that was not a report lannigan
that was an insult

   well-

   lannigan i want to know why in
open defiance of rules and in spite of
the fact that youve been warned a
dozen times to report stock you hit you
still refuse to do so why didnt you
report killing that steer

  longhorn squirmed he didnt dare
tell why he racked his brains for an
excuse for something in the death of
that-ah wait a minute worry left
his innocent eyes and the audacious
smile came back

   well suh mr terril yuh see it
longhorn lannigan



was like this when i seen that bull in
the track i thought vve was going to
kill him when we sloughed into him
i thought for a minute we had killed
him but do you know what that bull
done 

the official did not reply the
engineer had not expected him to
longhorn continued

   well suh mr terril when we hit
that bull he come right up on our pilot
set there for a minute an loped off to
one side an landed flat on his back an
the last i seen of him he was wavin
all four legs i supposed that he was
all right

  stop thundered terril you
cant stand there an lie to me i know
why you did it you think because
you can run an engine and get by with
the girls that you can also bluff and
bully the officials of this company
lannigan im telling you for the last
time you cant

   youve brought your fishin outfit

way out of this like youve done be-
fore take it and get out im giving
you thirty days to fish and think it over

the audacious grin left longhorns
face

   dont you think mr terril that
-that thirty days is pretty stiff

   dont argue with me lannigan

know why i dont ive had you in
this office twice a month for a year

ing

  longhorn went fishing he rode the
freight to rowe then went far up to-

ward the headwaters of cow creek
here for  days he lived in an open-
faced camp tramping hills and
streams prospecting fishing thinking
it over

broken rules

on july first longhorn returned to
work he scuffled with the girls
swapped yarns with the boys wise-
cracked about the joke book and the
brass hats because they could not
see behind the audacious smile the
boys thought  days had not tamed
him only clerks who now found
neatly made reports where before had
been blotches suspected what had hap-
pened  before the rest had time to dis-
cover it the crash had come

  july fourth a big excursion to
santa fe special trains from trini-
dad raton las vegas and albuquer-
que were run into the capital

  longhorn caught the trinidad train
that was a treat he made his days
pay he had a good time he met new
people

  the main line of the santa fe rail-
way never got into santa fe it passed
through lamy  miles southwest of
las vegas and an -mile branch ran
from lamy into santa fe when the
crews put away their trains in santa
fe that morning they joined the
merrymakers in the narrow streets

  longhorn met a beanery queen
whom he had known at trinidad while
he worked on the raton tunnel he
paired up with her squint and the
brakeman picked a couple of girls from
denver who had come with the trini-
dad crowd


railroad stories

  an hour before its setting the sun
slid into a bank of cloud hanging over
the jemez mountains the crews went
to prepare trains for the return trip
while longhorn oiled the no 
the brakeman came to the engine with
him were two girls from denver he
called squint aside and the four went
into a huddle when they emerged
squint approached the engineer the
girls were with him

  the fireman said  longhorn i
want you to meet a couple uh my
friends miss sanders mr lannigan
miss frazier mr lannigan

  puzzled longhorn acknowledged
the introductions in the past neither
squint nor the other boys had gone
far to introduce him to their lady
friends because when he was there he
was usually first out with the women

   longhorn squint whispered
 the ladies would like to ride the en-
gine with us tonight reckon we could
carry em

  longhorn wiped the spout of his oil
can with a fistful of waste hauling
ladies was strictly forbidden by rules
he had hauled plenty of them still-
 i dunno about that squint
 yuh see the ol man   

   i havent saw you paying much at-
tention to the ol man in the past big
boy

  longhorn winced

   but this is a excursion train
squint suppose the brass hats are-
 brass hats wont ride this train
assured the brakeman  theyll all
stay here till the last dogs made into
chili of course if any of em should
get on well tip you off

   oh pleathe mithter lannigan
little miss frazier was speaking ear-
nestly  weve never been on an en-
gine we do tho want to wide with
you tonight the boyth have been

telling uth what a wonderful engi-
neer-

  longhorn was weakening he
looked at his watch

   squint said  itll be all right lan-
nigan like red says if anybody gets
on he can give us a tip

  red went back to load passengers
the girls stood by the driving gear
their soft eyes pleaded

   all right longhorn said well
take a chance you girls ride the coach
to lamy thats eighteen miles itll
be dark when we get there we head
out on the main line for water you
just skeedaddle off the blind side and
come to the engine if the coasts clear
well take you into las vegas is that
all right

   it was

when they reached lamy the
cloud from the jemez had
swooped up to obscure the heavens
lightning darted over the mesas
ominous rumbling thunder quivered
through the canyons and echoed from
the rimrock

  the girls were in the head car
when longhorn spotted his engine at
the water plug they elbowed their way
out sneaked up the dark side of the
train longhorn urged them to return
to the coach he told them it was go-
ing to rain and warned them they
would ruin their dresses but they held
him to his promise

  gene frazier had black hair spar-
kling eyes a lisping tongue leaving
lamy she came to the right side of the
cab to help  mithter lannigan wun
the engine

  the storm struck

  little miss frazier was scared she
would never have admitted it but
longhorn could feel the quiver of her
body close to his on the narrow seat
longhorn lannigan



  he had ridden engine cabs through
worse storms than this still he could
not shake the feeling that something
was going to happen

  as they roared up through canon-
cito he fished a half-pint out of his
grip smiling he offered the flask to
the frazier girl

   better take a little bracer to chase
away the jitters he said

  she gasped  oh mithter lan-
nigan i couldnt do that

 longhorn chuckled he took a
swallow and returned the flask to his

grip

  those excursion trains owned the
railroad that night the dispatcher
put everything in the hole for them
with a clear track a fast schedule and
two ladies in the cab both scared wit-
less it would have been the chance of a
lifetime for a grandstand run

  but longhorn resisted the tempta-
tion taking chances on a train packed
with human beings was something he
did not do

  it was  when they topped the
glorietas the storm raged in the
lonely pass the pusher engine cut
off though the girls gladly would
have returned now to the coach the
storm would not let them with an
uneasiness foreign to his soul long-
horn let the train roll out of glorieta
and start down the mountainside to-
ward rowe

  through the closed front window he
could not see beyond his pilot he
moved gene frazier forward she
cowered close to the cab frame to give
him room he crowded into the seat
behind her opened the side window
and thrust his head out into the dark-
ness

  to relieve the girls terror long-
horn wisecracked he had her blow
the whistle for curve and crossing but

every inch of the way he was alert

  they descended the grade in safety
the tension lessened longhorn let
the engine out through the foothills
they raced along the track where to-
day block signals lift sentinel arms to
guard each train in its passage they
stormed along toward bernal

  longhorn began to breathe more
easily but he did not relax his vigi-
lance he peered ever into the pouring
rain he chuckled when he passed the
place where he had killed the last long-
horn bull then his eye grew grave
when he recalled how a lincoln terril
had warned him for the last time

there was no hog law on the
railroads in the eighties crews
did not quit when they had worked
sixteen hours during the rushes they
worked as long as there were trains to
be moved and engines to move them
with they made trip after trip over
the road sometimes sixty hours on
end sometimes even more they went
until it was humanly impossible for
them to stay awake even though their
own lives and the lives of others de-
pended upon vigilance

  around holidays and pay days the
pinch came boozers marked off
sick drifters drew time and left
town the burden of traffic fell upon
men who made railroading a profes-
sion

  the santa fe reaching out for pa-
cific coast connections had built
through nogales and connected
through the sonora railway to guav-
mas on the coast of the gulf of cali-
fornia that year a drought had
started a cattle rush out of mexico

  the rush hit the santa fe about the
time longhorn returned to the job
every crew on the division was work-
ing overtime and when the excursion


railroad stories

took four crews out of service the
pressure was increased for those who
had to work the freights

  at noon of the fourth jimmie kane
was in wallace he and his crew went
to bed in the caboose at  p m
they were called for a drag north

   surely we dont have to turn
again exclaimed jimmie we
turned night before last in vegas we
turned here yesterday we turned in
vegas again last night were dead on
our feet cant stay awake another
night

   quit yuhr crabbin barked the
caller  yuhre on the railroad now if
yuh want to sleep go back to the
farm

  at  p m they left wallace
they staggered up to lamy got coal
and water and a bite to eat they left
lamy at  two hours ahead of the
trinidad special they crawled up
through canoncito and doubled into
glorieta

  with only four cars of air next the
engine the trainmen had to decorate
-to ride on top and hold the train with
brake clubs every one of them went
high keeping those cars under control
in the face of the rising storm half-
way down the storm struck them the
downpour soaked them to the skin

  leaving ribera the hind man re-
turned to the caboose he and jimmie
dried out a little and went into the
dog house to watch their train

   well head in over at bernal and
let the percession by said jimmie

   i hope we git stuck there till noon
tomorrow crabbed the brakeman
 if they wont let us sleep in terminal
maybe we can get some shut-eye on
a side track

  windy hung his lantern on the hook
outside and fell back on the cushion
jimmie yawned and opened the side

window so the wind would blow into
his face and keep him awake

   it was pleasant in the cupola rain-
 drops beat a lullaby on the roof soon
 both men were sleeping they were
 aroused when the engineer whistled for
 bernal rules required trainmen to
 be on top of trains  ascending and de-
 scending all grades approaching sta-
 tions and water tanks and heading
 into and out of sidings

  they knew the rule when the
whistle sounded windy sat up like a
sleep walker and reached for his lan-
tern

   set down kid jimmie said
thickly  no use decoratin here
hogheadll handle em with his air
that was true the siding was
nearly level there would be no
brakes to set windy did not need
much urging he dropped back on the
cushions he did not intend to go back
to sleep until he had closed the switch
but the warmth and the rain were lull-
ing soon both he and the conductor
were sleeping

   the engineer pulled slowly into sid-
 ing he did not stop the train until
 it was in the clear jimmie and the
 brakeman were so dead they did not
 know when their caboose ran over the
 points the switch target threw
 flickering streams of red along the
 main line the switch was standing
 open with the wall of falling water
 hiding the warning gleam behind an
  impenetrable curtain

   in their cupola the two men slept
 on minutes passed a sound came
 out of the night jimmie snapped
 awake he did not know what had
 disturbed him he sat up and rubbed
 his eyes the sound came again it
 was the rain-soaked whistle of the no
  blowing a crossing blast jimmy
 grabbed windy by the shoulder
longhorn lannigan



  did you shut that switch he
screeched  did you shut that
switch 

  windy came from dreamland he
tried to claw open the cupola window
to get his lantern the conductor
leaped to the floor caught up the red
light as he went out the back door

  he raced for the open switch he
was late when he was halfway to it
the glimmer of the headlight brolfe
through the wall of falling water the
trinidad special was into them

ionghorn whistled for bernal
-he was working no  wide
open he let gene frazier blow for
the crossing he watched for the
green light of the west switch no
green was showing he tightened his
grip on the brake valve the splotch
of red flashed out of the night he
twisted the valve and grabbed the
whistle cord

  the girl saw the still splotch of red
flick out of the rain with the moving
one of jimmie kanes lantern beyond
it the signal meant nothing to her
longhorn leaped to his feet and set the
brakes in emergency he caught the
whistle cord but she only laughed he
jerked his head left and shouted to his
fireman

  jump squint were into some-
body 

  even then miss frazier thought he
was joking was trying to scare
her and when he caught her in his
arms to shield her from the impending
crash she fought him like a tigress un-
til the engine hit the open switch

  the engine split the switch and
spilled all over two tracks the head
coach nosed it along crawled atop the
boiler and stopped right side up with
its nose tilted toward the dripping sky

  the passengers were shaken and

bruised and battered no one was
killed the two girls in the cab got off
with scarcely a scratch squint suf-
fered a twisted ankle and a broken
nose longhorn came out with a
wrenched back a broken arm and some
broken ribs

  of course terril held court he
fixed the blame for the wreck on jim-
mie kane and the hind brakeman and
fired both of them he secured state-
ments from passengers whod taken
two men and two girls out of the cab
he secured statements also from miss
frazier and miss sanders but both
had poor memories neither of them
remembered exactly how she had got
into the cab of the engine

  if lannigan had not been on the
carpet before the super might have let
the matter drop or someone might at
least have tipped off the boys as to
what the girls had told he did
neither as soon as squint was able
to come down terril had him in the
office

   schrader the prince said tartly
 i want to know why you and lan-
nigan had those two women in the cab
with you the night of that bernal
wreck

   what women  the fireman was
perfectly innocent

   you know what women terril
was positive

   why i dont remember nothing

   listen schrader if youre de-
liberately lying to me quit it if
youve forgotten let me refresh your
memory when train x no 
turned over that night there were in
the cab with you and lannigan a miss
emma sanders and a miss gene
frazier i know they were there be-
cause i have statements from pas-
sengers who helped remove them and
i also have statements from them


railroad stories

  he forgot to tell squint the girls did
not seem to recall how they had got in
the cab certain the cat was out of the
bag squint told the truth since it
was his first time on the rug he got
thirty days and a hot lecture

it was october before lannigan
was able to go to the office he
knew when he went that his days were
done gone was the audacious smile
from his face

  terril shook hands with him
ushered him in shut the door and said
 sit down lannigan

  terril leaned back in the swivel
chair on his face was no leer of
triumph no bluster only the calm de-
termination of a man whose will must
be obeyed

   lannigan he said  on the night
of july fourth you and schrader
carried a couple of women with you
from lamy to bernal

  did they tell you mr terril

   they did not have to tell
longhorn said  yessir mr terril
we hauled them

  longhorn did not try to blame
squint and the brakeman he played
with his cap scratched a red scar on
his forehead watched scattered snow-
flakes terril clasped his bony hands
on the desk

   is an answer necessary mr ter-
ril he finally asked

   not from you lannigan i know
why you did it terril thrust his
scowling face into the sober one of the
engineer  i had you in this office
three days before and told you that if
you deliberately violated another rule
of this company you were through
carrying those two girls happened to
be the first violation that came handy
the first thing that came into your
head you did it to show me

   no suh mr terril that wasnt
why i did it longhorn crossed his
legs terril leaned back in the chair
 then why did you do it
longhorn was silent many seconds
he considered trying to explain that
he had done it under protest that the
boys had reminded him of previous
violations of which he had been guilty
he decided not to instead he said
 i have no reason i care to give mr
terril

   all right lannigan the official
removed a yellow sheet from a clip in
the file it was a clearance a service
letter it gave the details of long-
horns employment on the new mexico
division in the place headed rea-
son for leaving service were four
words  discharged for insubordi-
nate conduct

  longhorn read it he flipped the
letter back on the desk

   ill never be able to get a job on
that service letter mr terril

   you should have thought of that a
year ago lannigan i warned you
you refused to listen but i hope you
find a job and act like a man when you
get it

  longhorn looked at the official and
said  me too mr terril

  then he limped slowly up sixth
street and with the heaviest heart
he had carried in his life he rode the
cushions eastward

down glorieta hill

a lincoln terril finished or-
 ganizing the division he did a
good job of it so he went west to
organize another division
longhorn lannigan



  longhorn went east he fired for
the missouri pacific for the memphis
route for the iron mountain for the

i	c months grew into years he
remained nowhere long enough to re-
ceive promotion

  always the santa fe was calling
maybe it was the lure of spring in the
glorietas maybe it was the mystic
atmosphere of new mexico with the
sunshine glistening on its towering
peaks

  months after terril had been called
west lannigan returned to las vegas
and asked for a job the new officials
did not know him the master
mechanic put him on firing

  by this time the board lineup had
changed men had come men had
gone men had been promoted long-
horn made three trips before he met a
single man who had been here when he
had gone then he was called on a
january night to go west with squint
schrader when he swung up the
steps squint gulped and swallowed as
if he had seen a ghost

  well well if it aint ol long-
horn back on the job he greeted

   yep longhorn took the ex-
tended hand  plugged nickels an
wooden-legged chickens always comes
home

  longhorn shook the grates and
spread the coal squint oiled around
and came back to the cab the bitter
cold of the mountain night stabbed
through the gangway they pulled
down the storm curtains and reminded
each other of other nights they had
worked together squints laugh was
loud his nose was red

   gene an mes often talked about
yuh longhorn he cackled

  gene the name struck long-
horn with a ring of familiarity

   yeah gene surely you remem-

ber the little girl we hauled from lamy
the night of the bernal wreck

   oh sure is she-

   shes mrs squint schrader the
engineer crowed

   the devil she is

   yessir weve often wondered
whatever became of you gene shes
said lotsa times that if it hadnt of been
for you pullin her outa that hole she
probably have been smashed like a pan-
cake between the cab wall and the re-
verse lever

  conductor red waters came with
the orders he was painting the air
blue

   whats the matter now red 
squint asked  did somebody put a
icicle down the back uh yore neck

   its these here damn indians that
white horse john an his squaws
come down here wantin to ride this
freight to wallace they couldnt
possibly wait till mornin an ride a
passenger train thats jist like a in-
dian

  red kept raving squint told him
longhorn lannigan had returned to
the mountain red shook hands

t t was dark when they left las ve-
gas ice daggers pointed down-
ward from the water tank and fierce
winds whipped blown snow through
cuts and sifted it between switches

  longhorn had never entirely re-
covered from his injuries at bernal
his broken arm was stiff his kinked
back was still aching when bad
weather brought rheumatism to his in-
jured joints he often had trouble to
feed the firebox

  that night was a grilling one
squint was not an engineer he was
a hog-mauler longhorn had always
known he would be he let the john-
son bar into the corner and literally


railroad stories

beat hell out of her on every grade

  more than once lannigan looked at
the man he had taught to fire an en-
gine squint slumped in the seat now
nodding now whistling to keep awake
not one time did he offer to take a turn
on the scoop as longhorn had used to
do before their positions had been re-
versed lannigan ached to get hold of
the throttle to take those sags on a run
that would put them over the humps
without dragging but he didnt open
his mouth he let squint schrader
run the engine in his own way

  frost whiskers on the steel rails
made them like glass the drivers had
no traction they struck the hard pull
longhorn had his fire thick on the
grates it was not thick enough the
engine stumbled lost her footing her
fire went to her front end and out her
smokestack squint cursed and yelled
the needle fell back and the drivers
slipped again the train stopped
they had to take the train into glorieta
in two pieces

  when they came up the hill with the
rear end squint went into the caboose
for a cup of hot coffee before starting
down the long slide into lamy long-
horn went with him

  wrapped in blankets white horse
john and his squaw were curled up on
bunks lusty snores filled the way-
car the squaws right cheek was ex-
posed longhorn grinned yanked a
straw out of the broom and tickled her

  the squaw turned stupid eyes to
stare up at the men lannigan was
busy emptying a tin cup she covered
her cheek with the blanket grunted
disgustedly reversed and snored again

  red waters looked at the returned
pilgrim

   i see yuh aint changed a helluva
lot longhorn he commented

   some longhorn replied softly

  the crew emptied the coffee pot be-
cause it was cold because there was a
bitter drag ahead of them red brought
a bottle from the locker squint had
partaken before leaving las vegas
he helped empty the bottle

   i dont begrudge yuh the licker
squint but yuh better tap that kinda
light red said  theres a lot of
slick steel between here an lamy

   keep yuh mittens on ol bean
this boy knows when hes got
enough

  probably he did probably it would
have made no difference if he had not
even smelled a cork the rails were
slick and with the added load of com-
pany coal which they took off the
storage track they had more tons than
one crew should have taken down
glorieta hill on a winters night

longhorns heavy work was
 done he watched squint with
critical eye the engineer did not
start a train down glorieta as long-
horn would have done he let the
speed climb five miles an hour eight
ten

 out on the cars the brakemen
worked with hickory clubs the two
men in the engine could see their lights
as they leaped cars covered with ice
and snow their progress was slow
they were stiff with cold every
wheel they touched froze to their mit-
tens and stiffened their fingers

  squint was wide awake he knew
what he was doing he watched lan-
terns and telegraph poles he looked
at his watch longhorn would have
used air but he was not running the
engine

  when they were doing twelve miles
an hour squint made his first brake
application it did not seem to affect
the speed of the train he released
longhorn lannigan



and made another ordinarily this
would have done the work the grip
of a few air brakes added to that of
the hand brakes the men had set would
have checked the momentum

  tonight the drag kept right on
the drivers were skidding longhorn
could feel them he looked at the air
gage squint used sand to break the
ice coating and stop the skid he was
getting nervous he released the
brakes again

  they were off for but a brief in-
terval in that interval the train
picked up to twenty miles an hour
squint sloughed the air again the

they were running awayl he
aroused white horse john

wheels locked and skidded squint
left his throttle and crossed to the fire-
mans platform he was blinking and
looking foolishly at longhorn

   whut-whuts the matter with
this damn outfit he queried

   ice on the rails my boy the fire-
man answered shortly  didnt you
know it was there 


railroad stories

  squint re-crossed the cab grabbed
his whistle and began calling for
brakes

  back in the caboose red waters
had set the brake and viciously cursed
the fool who would let a train get the
edge on him on glorieta on a night like
this he went inside and started out
the front door intending to go high
and help the brakemen then he re-
membered he was carrying passengers
he aroused white horse john and
the squaw the indian sat up and
blinked he did not understand what
was wrong

  red listened to the wheels there
was no check to their threatening
clickety-click he returned to the plat-
form and tightened the brake another
notch now he knew they were run-
ning away down glorieta

  then he thought of a plan he ran
out the rear door and released the ca-
boose brake the wheels were free
instead of holding back the caboose
now was shoving the runaway down
the grade

  red waters ran through the ca-
boose and out the front door he tried
to lift the pin which held the caboose
to the car ahead it was in a cramp
and he could not budge it

  a freight caboose had a brake wheel
at either end red cracked his head
on the front one when he raised up
he set his club into it and twisted the
brakes took hold the slack went out
when the brake was set or released
the pin was clamped in the drawhead
he released the brake and tried to grab
the pin when the slack was going in
but was not quick enough

  he stood looking down at it he
could not wait all night to cut off that
caboose if he intended to do it at all
he must do it now

  in the caboose was a length of wire

he ran inside jerked up the lid of the
locker brought out the wire fashioned
a hook out of it wrapped the hook
around the pin when the brake was set
held the wire in one hand and released
the brake the trick worked the pin
came out the caboose was free from
the train

  red set the brake and stopped the
caboose but the train rolled down the
mountain the brakemen saw the
marker lights drift back into the night
and fade out behind a curve they
cursed red waters for deserting them
cursed and went on setting brakes
which did not hold

  in the cab the fireman watched trees
and fence posts pick up speed the
engineer kept an eye on his gauges
but the speed had gone up the brake
pressure down longhorn went
quietly into the deck and laid five
scoops of coal

  squint schrader slipped off the seat-
box his knees were quaking his
teeth chattered

   were-were runnin away he
quavered

  longhorn smiled grimly  are
we 

  squint staggered back to his seat
he did not remain in it he came back
into the deck he grabbed longhorn
by the sleeve and cried frenziedly

   we gotta jump man we gotta git
offa here this outfits goin in the
ditch theyre gone longhorn all
hell couldnt stop em im gettin off
before its too late ive got a wife to
think of

  the engineer made for the gang-
way he did not take time to get his
grip he watched the ground swim in
under the headlight when they
emerged from the next cut he was on
the icy steps the last longhorn saw
of him he was rolling into a snowdrift
longhorn lannigan



ionghorn knew there was slim
chance of stopping the drag now
it had too much headway he watched
the sparks moving atop cars where
brakemen were at their posts the fire
flying from wheels where brakes were
burning them

  they crashed down apache canyon
on the left was the mountain wall on
the right was the canyon filled with
snow ahead lay miles of frosted
steel and the curve and the cut above
canoncito a sharp curve and a deep
cut with a bridge beyond

   there thought lannigan  is the
place this hogll turn a handspring with
forty freight cars after her

  right-left careened the engine
right-left-r i g h t her siderods
flashed against the snow

  her headlight threw shadows down
the steel and beyond the steel on the
mountain wall there in the night lay
the curve and the cut and the bridge

  longhorn pulled his head inside and
closed the window his left hand
flipped the brake valve released it to
get a new grip they were sliding
again he worked the reverse lever
now flanges bit the frosted rail
they were running free

  there was a scream like the death
cry of the damned the engine lurched
far to the right longhorn gripped
his arm rest and applied the brakes

  fire flowed from the wheels the
momentum was checked they raced
through canoncito streaked down the
narrow valley

  the telegraph poles were swimming
now instead of leaping the ties were
no longer a blur a white-faced brake-
man slid into the deck and backed up
to the firebox he said i thought
shoren hell we was gone that time

 we was answered longhorn
 but we come back

  the brakeman missed squint  did
the hoghead jump he queried

   nope longhorn flashed back
 he fell off

  yeah the brakeman tossed a
couple of scoops of coal into the fire-
box  the caboose fell off the hind
end too

  the two men laughed longhorn
used his air once more and brought
the engine to a perfect stop under the
tank spout at lamy

the crew deadheaded back to las
vegas again the super held an
investigation again squint schrader
went in first he tried to alibi

   i have a wife he said

  the official watched him coldly

   there comes a time mr schrader
when an engineer must forget his wife
and remember only that he has duty
what other reasons have you you
must have let that train get the bulge
on you

   the track was slick squint said
for the dozenth time  the track was
slick and the brakes refused to hold

   but the fireman made them hold
there must have been some other
reason

   i guess  lost my head admitted
squint

   an engineer can never lose his
head the super told him  this com-
pany needs men who keep their heads
and use them to think with

  squint had no other alibi the super
told him he was through so far as run-
ning was concerned suggested he
might stay on firing if he so desired
and squint stayed on

  longhorn was the next upon the
mat the super did not ask him how
the train had run away

   mr lannigan he said instead
 your conduct last night deserves


railroad stories

commendation our records show that
once you ran an engine here the of-
fence for which you were discharged
has doubtless been atoned and we need
men like you if you do not object
well mark you on the engineers board
and let you go on running

  longhorns eyes glistened he
nodded his head and exclaimed
 thank you sir i know of nothin
id like better

  for many months lannigan ran his
engine off the extra board he was the
same old longhorn frolicking and
pranking his way through life except
that now he ran his engine by the book
no one would have thought that years
had flown

  squint schrader fired a turn for pop
wendell in the passenger pool he
grew morose and black and bitter he
whined and crabbed about his dirty
deal and blamed  op longhorn damn
him for his own demotion he rea-
soned that had longhorn jumped as he
himself had done and let the train and
engine take brakemen to their death in
the cold of the mountain night his own
misjudgment might not have been dis-
covered

  meantime a lincoln terril made
good in the west representatives of
boston capitalists saw possibilities in
him they took him from his humbler
post and made him a king in the rail-
road world a king on the lines of the
santa fe

the king and his subject

one evening late in summer lanni-
gan was called for pop wendells
turn to take out the pacific express he

met squint at the engine the fireman
merely grunted  howdy

  longhorn laughed and said  im
fine ol timer hows the wife and
how are you

  squint shrugged made up his fire
and stared gloomily over the yards

  when longhorn backed into the
standing train he saw a familiar figure
by the depot it was a figure which had
haunted his dreams for many moons-
the slender black-clad figure of a lin-
coln terril the new king of the road
something made longhorns heart skip
a beat or two

  soon the trainmaster came bustling
over

   youve got a private car behind to-
night lannigan he said  mr ter-
ril and a party of high officials are
riding dont shake em up too much
longhorn said  all right ill han-
dle em like they was settin eggs that
failed to hatch

  the superintendent was steering the
party through the terminal while the
passengers ate the brass hats went to
the roundhouse and returned to the
train before they reached the engine
terril said  by the way whos pull-
ing us tonight

   a chap by the name of lannigan
informed the super

  lannigan terril didnt wiggle
a lash he came down by the engine
longhorn had finished oiling he was
standing beside the steps with the oil-
can in the left hand his gauntlets under
his left arm his red bandana flapping
in the wind and his right fist full of
flimsies

  terril stopped lannigan looked up
except that years had deepened the
sockets of his eyes the king had not
changed he turned piercing eyes upon
his serf

   are you back here running an en-
longhorn

lannigan



gine lannigan he asked incredu-
lously

  yessir mr terril you know what
they say about plugged nickels an
wooden-legged chickens-

  the official cut in

   i thought i fired you before i left
here

 longhorn fingered his watch the
boston capitalists very discreetly
turned their heads and began talking
about new mexico climate the super
lifted an uneasy voice

  lannigan came back to us quite a
while ago mr terril we hired him
firing we promoted him for an act
of superior courage and cool-headed-
ness he is rapidly proving himself
one of our most trustworthy and
capable men

  terril let out a snort and walked to-
ward the rear the matter would prob-
ably have ended there had it not been
for the trouble two hours later

mountain railroading had al-
ways been hazardous ever
since trains had been running mechan-
ical and human failures had brought
them together in head-on or rear-end
collisions whose disastrous results have
been surpassed only by the terrible mas-
sacre of humans in automobile acci-
dents today

  in order to prevent collision to keep
wo trains from getting into the same
territory at the same time various de-
vices had been invented one of them
as nearly foolproof as anything before
the modern automatic block and train
control was the  staff system
dangerous track in this case only
on the mountainous districts was di-
vided into convenient units or blocks
at each end of the block was a machine

 	the staff system was installed on glorieta in
 

constructed to hold a number of
 staffs

  when the two machines governing a
block were in  balance there was a
red signal at each end of the block so
that no train could enter it a train
coming to the one end of the block
would call for the signal the operator
would then call the operator at the
other end and ask for the staff that
operator would insert his key in his
own machine and the first operator
then would remove one staff from his
machine and by running it through the
 clearance box clear the signal for
the train to proceed

  as the train went by the operator
would hand the removed staff to the en-
gineer the engineer would carry it
to the other end of the block and de-
liver it to the other operator who
would insert the staff in its proper
groove and the machines again would
be  in balance so that another staff
could be removed from either one

  if anything happened to the staff
no train could proceed in either direc-
tion until the signal maintainer came
and balanced the machineby transfer-
ring staffs from one to the other-ex-
cept by going through a lot of red tape
for this reason losing a staff was al-
most as serious as staging a head-on
collision

  there was a staff block from glori-
eta to canoncito and another from
canoncito to lamy each with its
tower staff machines and its operator

it was dark when the reached
glorieta longhorn came up the
mountain whistling for the block the
operator called canoncito and asked
for the staff because the train was the
pacific express on time and hauling
royalty of the road he got it without
delay


railroad stories

  he gave it to longhorn on a con-
traption similar to the order hoop
longhorn looped the hoop over the
handle of his injector where it could
not fall off he always put it there
because it was absolutely safe the
only way it could get off was for the
engine to turn upside down or for
someone to remove it

  the crew made the brake test long-
horn started down the mountain on
which not long ago he had won his pro-
motion when he made his first brake
application going out of glorieta a
brake hanger on the tank truck broke
and dropped a brake beam he
stopped

  he did not look to see whether the
staff was still on the injector handle
he lighted his torch climbed out of the
cab crawled under the tank with some
wrenches and a hammer to take off the
beam

  squint put in a light fire and went
out to hold the torch for longhorn
soon the conductor the porter the
super and terril came over to see what
was causing the delay they watched
critically

  the engine began to pop lannigan
had already mashed two fingers and
caught an eyeful of iron rust he was
ready to explode he bellowed

   for gosh sake schrader get up
there an choke that damn thing off

  squint went into the cab he had
not mashed any fingers but he had not
forgotten that he had once run an en-
gine he was surly and there was an
angry flush on his smudged face he
went up the steps talking to himself

   ol longhorn damn him  thinks
hes smart-bawling out at a guy like
that when the brass hats is listenin ill
git even with him sometime

  he worked his injector to put cold
water into the boiler he opened the

door of the firebox to check the fire
as he raised up he saw the staff hang-
ing before him

  a cunning gleam came into his eyes
he did not take time to even think
what he was doing but acted from im-
pulse his little eyes darted over the
cab and his hand went up when he
left the cab the staff was not on the
injector

  longhorn removed the brakebeam
cut out the tank brake and went on
down the hill he did not miss the staff
until he was running into canoncito

  then he shouted across the cab
 squint have you seen that staff
there was a tremor of uneasiness in his
clear voice

  squint started answered  staff
hellno have you lost it 

  longhorn made no accusations the
next block was cleared for him the
operator was trying to hand up the
staff longhorn did not take it he
stopped even with the tower the op-
erator wanted to know what was hold-
ing him lannigan rummaged through
his tool box seat box around the deck
and platform the staff was not there

by this time lights were gleaming
beside the train conductor porter
super and terril were coming long-
horn crossed to the firemans side
again squint was rolling a cigarette
his hand was shaking longhorn
grabbed him by the arm

   squint he barked  you threw
that staff into the firebox

  youre a damn liar the fireman
shot back  you lost it

longhorn did not hit him but re-
moved his hand from the firemans
arm  dont try to fool me schrader
he said  ive known you too long
squint laughed harshly

   go tell that to old man terril he
longhorn lannigan



taunted  hell believe you hes a
friend of yourn

   i dont take my dirty linen to any
office to get it washed the engineer
said evenly  i wash it myself im
goin to start right here an now
squint shot a glance at the coal pick
hanging on the cab frame

   hogheads has fell out of winders
for sayin less than that to their fire-
men he muttered

   this hoghead wont because in the
first place this fireman aint got the
guts to push him an in the second
you know youve been told the truth
under the window lights were danc-
ing the conductor was demanding
 what on earths wrong over here 
whats the matter with you lanni-

  

gan

  the officials arrived they were an-
noyed longhorn descended from his
cab the others gathered about him
terril was getting madder every
minute

   ive lost the staff lannigan an-
nounced

   lost what terril blew up

   i said id lost the staff

 for once longhorn did not know
exactly what to do there were too
many brass hats present he started
toward the office because since he had
returned to work the first thing he did
when anything happened was to tell the
dispatcher about it

  terril stopped him

   wait a minute lannigan long-
horn recalled that tone he had heard
it only once and that was the day ter-
ril had fired him  is this some new
kind of joke youve invented you
couldnt lose a thing as big as that staff
without knowing it

   do you think i threw it away
lannigan asked

   it would be just about like you

lannigan terril was fuming  you
think because youve got back on this
job after i fired you off it youre put-
ting one over on the officials

 this was too much longhorn
clenched two fists and bristled up to the
man who had discharged him years ago
and now threatened to have the process
repeated

   mr terril he said  ive come
back to this job and railroaded by the
book ive risked my neck trying to
keep your infernal trains on the track
and keep them on time if you aim to
rawhide me the rest of my life because
you got it in for me years ago you can
take your damn job and your damn
railroad-

  he told terril in words of one syl-
lable what he could do with both job
and railroad

  four railroaders gasped never in
their railroad experience had they
heard a serf say such things to a king
as lannigan said to terril

  the super turned to his superior

   im sorry mr terril he said
 ill see after this immediately i as-
sure you that such insolence shall not
remain unpunished

  terril had no reply he walked back
to the rear

in the office the engineer wrote and
signed two messages the first in-
formed the dispatcher that the staff re-
ceived by him at glorieta had been lost
the second read  hereby resign posi-
tion as engineer effective end of trip
the superintendent was waiting for
him when he came from the office

   lannigan what happened to that
staff he asked

  the engineer smiled bitterly  how
do i know sir i didnt swallow it i
didnt throw it out of the window i
didnt burn it


railroad stories

  the super considered that statement
then he started toward the engine
lannigan was beside him when they
were halfway there the official stopped

   lannigan he queried  why did
you tear into mr terril tonight

   i dunno sir i reckon i jist got
steamed up an had to pop off

   of course you know the only thing
i can do now is-

   fire me  ive saved you the
trouble and remorse of havin to do
that i jist got done resignin

   quitting us right here

   nope unless you fire me and call
another engineer to take this train on
in im running it to albuquerque
the super swallowed a lump in his
throat despite popular belief railway
officials who handle men successfully
are human superintendent george
fletcher handled them successfully

  longhorn swung heavily into his
cab squint was whistling he did not
look around and longhorn did not
speak the engineer slipped into his
place and the express left canoncito

  while the argument had gone on
the local freight had stopped at the
cerillos platform los cerillos was a
coal mining town eighteen miles below
lamy its merchants did a thriving
business and local freight for it was
heavy

  the local crew unloaded a couple of
tons of merchandise and twenty barrels
of kerosene that night juan lopez
who drove a span of gray mules to a
dray wagon commenced hauling it
away

  because the local was behind time
and because there was no  rule g  on
the dray wagon juan was in a bad
humor he loaded the first lot of mer-
chandise and dark though it was
crossed the tracks and left it in its
owners warehouse he drove the

wagon over the tracks and loaded the
bed full of kerosene barrels

ionghorn left canoncito making
-up time back in the private car
however terril was not talkative he
did not speak to the boston capitalists
who quit asking what was the matter
with the railroad and began wondering
what had built a fire under this engineer
and started him whipping the train
around curves at a forty-mile clip

  when they were halfway to lamy
terril went to sit beside the super-
intendent

   did lannigan find his staff he
asked significantly

  no sir

   what do you suppose he did with
it

   i dont suppose he did anything
with it

  forty telegraph poles strode through
the light shining from the car window
briefly fletcher sketched the incidents
which had led to lannigans promo-
tion  schrader he added  has
always resented lannigan he is fir-
ing the engine tonight

  terril nodded why dont you ask
lannigan 

  if lannigan knows hell never
tell

  terril shook his head  no thats
the trouble with that nut

  the whistle was blowing for lamy
the two officials arose and started to
the platform  lannigan wired his
resignation from canoncito informed
the super  says hes done railroad-
ing

  terril said nothing he looked at
fletcher and a gleam came into his
hard eyes at lamy he left the car
and started toward the engine one of
the boston men called to him he
turned back in answer to the call
longhorn lannigan



while he talked to them he looked at
the flaring torch over by the engine
where longhorn was oiling

  while the crew took water the yard
goat cut three pullman cars in ahead
of the private car on the rear of the
train they were loaded with  big
bugs  who had come in off the santa
fe branch from a sight-seeing trip in
the ancient capital the extra cars
made the train an unusually long one

  longhorn lost no time getting out
of the lamy yard he moved quickly
down the grade toward cerillos be-
fore he was out of sight of green
switchlights he had the varnish whip-
ping along at a thirty-mile clip that
was not fast the track was solid
and the brakes were good

  he kept thinking bitterly that this
was his last trip on the santa fe in-
wardly he cursed squint schrader for
trying to frame him he cursed a
lincoln terril for a hard-headed fool
then he cursed himself for letting his
tongue break loose and talk him out of
a good job

  he whistled for the milepost for los
cerillos looked at his watch reached
for the whistle cord and held it down
long and viciously

  los cerillos was a flagstop for the
express when there were passengers
for the west the operator signaled with
a lantern when the conductor had
passengers to unload he signaled with
the cord

  tonight there were neither long-
horn watched the order board was 
red the operator came out with a
white lantern he gave longhorn a
highball a signal that he was to go
through and catch the order on the run

judging he was running a trifle
fast for the fireman to pick up the
order longhorn used his brakes he

cut his speed without a word squint
crossed the deck and went down the
step to grab the order longhorn was
watching the track it was clear he
kicked off the brakes and notched the
throttle then he leaned out of the
window to watch squint the fireman
was on the bottom step holding to the
grabiron with his left hand and his
right outstretched to scoop up the
order

  the engineer did not have his eyes
off the track for more than a few sec-
onds but during that few seconds a
change had come a team of white
mules pulling a dray wagon had swung
in from behind the building and started
over the crossing

  longhorn grabbed for the whistle
instinctively he yelled  look out
squint instinctively also he flipped
the wrist of his hand on the brake
valve

  in the wagon juan lopez lashed
white mules they jumped and jerked
the wagon into the track juan was
making the sign of the cross and mut-
tering

  then he and his helper left the
wagon in a headlong plunge they
struck in the cindersbut did not get up

  barrels filled with kerosene hurtled
into the pilot and the smoke box
wooden staves cracked like match
sticks the oil swished back over the
engine rained through the cab win-
dows

  it did not wet squint schrader be-
cause squint instead of grabbing the
order jumped off the engine and rolled
into the depot

  there came an explosive puff
fumes from the liquid reached the fire-
box the mass ignited as the cab
went over the crossing a terrific burst
of fire came up from the ground
threatening to lick up the wooden
	railroad stories

 lannigan stumbled into the gangway burning
 gas scorched his lunge and choked him

coaches as they pushed ahead into it

   instantly from pilot to tail hose
 the engine was a mass of billowing
 roaring red with black smoke pouring
 from it lannigans clothing was
 already he had set the brakes
 what more could any engineer do

he reeled back from his window
and stumbled into the gangway
to get down the steps
he reached the gangway a
thought flashed into his scorched brain
with the brakes set the train was com-
ing quickly to a stop before the last
car had run by the crossing it would
cease to move it would halt squarely
that pool of liquid hell those
wooden cars would catch on fire be-
fore their occupants could get out they
would burn

annigan turned back from the
gangway he groped for his plat-
in that cab filled with fire and
smoke he could see nothing burning
gas scorched his lungs and choked him

 but his hand found the brake valve
 it was burning hot he flipped it to
 he found the throttle and
 it the brakes came off the
 exhaust barked speed picked up

   sounds grew dull and everything
began fading into distance even the
pain was fading the light was gone
in the darkness his fumbling hand
moved unconsciously working with the
brakes the train came to a stop

   the last wheel rolled through the
fiery crossing from coaches from
sleepers from the private car pas-
sengers came stumbling officials piled
off the rear platform and ran back to
the crossing

   a lincoln terril hatless coatless
 was in the lead he watched blazes
 shooting higher than the housetops
 he watched figures running around it
longhorn lannigan



he saw squint schrader he did not
see the familiar figure of lannigan

  the official ran to the fireman and
grabbed him by the arm  wheres
your engineer he shouted

   i dunno squint groaned  i
guess hes still in the engine

  terril turned the fireman loose he
shot one quick look toward the engine
occasional bursts of flames were still
whipping from pilot or gangway he
called to the excited superintendent
 come on george weve got to go
find lannigan hes on the engine
they found him he lay where he
had plunged out of the gangway

for months longhorn lannigan
was swathed in bandages there
was a question whether or not he would
live and then whether or not he would
see finally came the day when the
test was to be made in the topeka
hospital

  it would be a damned shame
terril said huskily to his wife that
morning  if that boy should come out

of this blind hes the kind of man
this railroad needs

  dead quiet reigned in the darkened
room where the test was to be made
a lincoln terril and a superintendent
named george fletcher were there
when the bandage came off longhorn
blinked into the subdued light

   what do you see lannigan 
queried one of the doctors

  i-aint right shore doc long-
horn drawled  maybe im jist dream-
in but it seems to me i see ol terril
standing back there by the door

  a lincoln terril burst out with a
merry laugh and came striding for-
ward

   you ornery cuss he was barking
joyously  are you right sure it aint
a longhorn bull givin you a highball 
or a couple of good looking dames
wantin to ride in vegas

  and when longhorn new bandages
hiding the world he longed to see re-
turned to await patiently until his eyes
grew strong he knew he had found a
friend in the man who had tamed him

  does france have fastest long-distance train

the sud south express of the paris-orleans-midi railways of france is said to
be the first and only regularly scheduled steam train to travel more than  miles
at an average speed of over  miles per hour including stops thus giving it the dis-
tinction of being the worlds fastest this express recently has been scheduled to run
 miles between paris and bordeaux in  minutes with only  stops en route the
stretch between poitiers and angoulene has a time card calling for a -mile run in
 minutes-which is said to be the first  mph run on a regular french schedule

    other french trains also are going in for higher speed for instance the -mile
non-stop run between nancy and paris on the est is now being made in  minutes
it is the first time in which a french train has been carded at more than  miles an
hour for a non-stop run exceeding  miles

   in great britain the l n e r london-edinburgh  flying scotsman  is a
strong contender for long-distance speed honors as was the great westerns  cornish
riviera  until its time was beaten by the  scotsman several american trains also
claim the title

    in germany the  flying hamburger  made a trial run of  miles between berlin
and cologne in i hours an average of  mph actual traveling speed was vi
mph and highest speed reached was  this was exceeded in america by the union
pacific streamlined m- which recently ran  miles between los angeles and
chicago in  hours at an average of about  mph attaining a speed of  over
short stretches however these two were only trial runs

railroad stories

take a good look at the speed queen of american rails shes one of the new gals who
got the jump on the gas buggies by daily hauling the chicago  north westerns  
between chicago and the twin cities  miles in  hours flat notice her new disc-type
-in drivers which enable her to hit  miles an hour  with the greatest of ease and
which can carry her over a hundred read more about her and her sisters on page 

what is meant by i pulling up the reverse the reverse lever does not only change the di

lever  dropping it down to the last	rection of movement by shifting the valves bu

notch and  down in the comer-h s	at the same time regulates the amount of steam

oconomowoc wis	entering the cylinders when a locomotive is
by the light of the lantern



 arting or traveling at slow speed upgrade with
 load more steam must be admitted to the cyl-
 inders than is either possible or necessary at higher
 peeds this means the valve admitting steam
 o the working end of the cylinder must stay open
 onger during the piston stroke hence the engi-
 neer increases the valve  travel  by pushing the
 reverse lever down toward the end or to the end of
 the quadrant the notched piece of metal on which
 the reverse lever moves as soon as the load is
 under way less steam is needed and the reverse
 lever is adjusted toward the center of the quadrant
 in fact this must be done to attain any speed
 for as the pistons move faster the boiler cannot
 take care of their demand for steam unless not so
 much is admitted to the cylinders moreover
 when less is admitted more use is made of steams
 expansive power and thus the locomotive operates
 more efficiently in your question then nos 
 and  mean practically the same thing and no 
 designates the act of decreasing the amount of
 steam entering the cylinders by hooking the re-
 erse lever  up toward center

cg-the front end throttle is simply a throttle located

	in the front end or smoke box of a locomotive rather
than in the steam dome some are placed entirely within
the front end others are in a housing which sticks up either
ahead of or behind the smoke stack you can tell front-end
throttles easily by noting the throttle lever along the engi-
neers side of the boiler

  	low pressure cylinders of compound locomotives vary
in size depending on size and kind of locomotive thus it
is impossible to tell you  how big the piston is in a low
pressure cylinder how high is a building

hold  gals water and  gals oil oil
is being used for fuel merely to eliminate operating
stops but the engines are changed at milwaukee

  the train covers  miles between st paul
ind chicago in  hrs flat actually averaging 
mph for purposes of advertising however the
cnw says it makes  miles in  minutes-
which it does if running time alone is considered
originally the cnw intended to haul  cars in
the train but now carries  on the first trip
the train covered the  miles between wyeville
and eau claire in  mins averaging  mph
and hitting more than  mpb at times

  the train is distinctly a triumph for both steam
power and the cnw which despite the fact that
it is purchasing neither steam nor diesel streamlined
trains has got the jump on and is prepared to
meet further competition of both the burlington
and the milwaukee who will make the run in
fl hrs as soon as their new trains are completed
the burlingtons trains will be diesel-powered

natives such as these were very much to the taste of the lions which infested uganda
and when they constructed the uganda railway their biggest job was to defend themselves

against the savage man-eaters

 into the dark continent

by charles frederick carter

former trainman author of  hill against harriman etc

were building an iron trail
ai through the jungles of british
ffj east africa roger kent-
coverdale chief engineer of
the uganda railway was talk-
ing to j h patterson engineer of construc-
tion who had just arrived from england
on a march day in 

  the scene was in the brand new club in
the brand new port of kilindini built to
order for the terminus of the uganda rail-
way on the indian ocean the two men
had settled back to enjoy such comfort as
the stifling heat permitted with a ghost
of a smile kent-coverdale remarked

 i would like to offer a word of caution

old chap in this savage country less than
a hundred miles south of the equator-
with its wild men wild beasts deadly in-
sects disease famine and thirst-you never
dare overlook things that may seem trifles
to a newcomer for example did you hear
what knocked out your predecessor

   no said patterson

   a chigger explained his superior  a
bally little tick-a trifling insect that seems
to strangers not worth noticing chiggers
burrow under mens toenails and cause ab-
scesses the infected toe wras neglected one
day too long in this fearful damp heat and
the foot had to be amputated

  patterson straightened up


railroad stories

such raids as this were all a part of the days
work in the construction of the uganda railway

   tick bites are not trifles the other
man went on  thats just a sample of
what youll be up against constantly in-
sects cause a lot of trouble work beyond
railhead has been held up for a month
by the flies

  patterson raised an eyebrow  are you
pulling my leg he asked in british slang

   no indeed kent-coverdale assured
him  tsetse flies have killed off all trans-
port animals we have been able to send
forward-horses mules donkeys bullocks
camels they are deadly to human beings
also because they transmit germs of sleep-
ing sickness which has carried off upward
of two hundred thousand natives in the
last five years now we are entirely with-
out means of transportation beyond the
end of track the first and most important

problem you must solve-or help to
solve-is how to raise the fly blockade

   of course the railroad will be built
somehow in spite of all obstacles pat-
terson insisted  englands honor is at
stake

   yes i know kid the chief  this
line is the only railroad i know of that is
being laid for sentimental reasons youve
heard the story by agreement of the
great powers at the brussels conference
july   england undertook to build
a railroad through east africa from the
indian ocean to victoria nyanza this
lake is really an inland sea with an area
of  square miles-more than half the
size of england you
know why were do-
ing this job
into the dark continent



   yes said the newcomer  we could
keep arab slave raiders out of this coun-
try by using the combined facilities of rail
and lake transportation this would just
about be a death blow to slavery which
has become a stench in the nostrils of civ-
ilization but about the matter of trans-
portation couldnt we get enough native
porters to carry the absolutely necessary
supplies beyond the end of track

  the chief shook his head

   the natives here wont work they
have never felt the need of labor nature
provides so everything has to be done by
hindu coolies imported under contract

coolies are useless as porters not strong
enough

  patterson had a bright idea

   ive heard a lot about swahilis he
said  those sturdy fellows from up-coun-
try on whom explorers and big game hunt-
ers depend lets try them
kent-coverdale assented

   and why not cable back home for
some steam lorries suggested patterson
the chief agreed to this also

in due time patterson ventured out in
the blazing sun protected by cawn-
pore helmet and spine pad he made a tour


railroad stories

to inspect arrangements for receiving sup-
plies and forwarding them to the front

  through the new port of kilindini they
had to import not only all railway ma-
terials but every pound of food for euro-
peans and hindus food for the former
came from england and food for the hin-
dus came from india 

  patterson went up the line to the end
of track at tsavo river  miles from
kilindini this river was to be crossed
by the largest bridge on the line beyond
it all operations were still blocked by tsetse
flies among which no domestic animals
could live

  to raise the fly blockade pending ar-
rival of the swahili porters patterson put
all available men at work building a tem-
porary bridge strong enough to carry a
locomotive and a few cars across to the
other side to move up supplies so that
grading could be resumed

  that done the new engineer of construc-
tion scouted around the vicinity for ma-
terial for the stone bridge piers

  it had been planned to bring stone from
the coast - a long haul that would tax
transportation facilities needed for other
uses but patterson found right at hand
the stone he needed and put men to work
quarrying and dressing it soon three
thousand coolies were busy along the line
for a distance of eight miles

  when it became known that stone ma-
sons were to get forty rupees a month as
compared with fifteen rupees the laborers
received the whole force suddenly discov-
ered they were skilled stone masons

  upon learning this would not do many
of them shammed illness to avoid work
and schemed revenge they lured pat-
terson to a lonely spot for the purpose of
murdering him the englishman was sur-
rounded by a mob which began jostling
him about if he had fallen they would
probably have torn him to pieces realiz-
ing what was up patterson climbed a rock
and addressed them

   if you kill me a lot of you will be
hanged he warned  then as the work
must go on a new boss will be sent he

may be much harder on you than i have
been get back to your jobsl

  patterson was a man of few words he
was lean and sinewy with a stern expres-
sion that counted for much with these peo-
ple his six feet two inches of stature
towering far over the puny coolies also had
its effect

  what happened that evening did more
than anything else to alter the coolie atti-
tude toward their english boss about
midnight the camp was in an uproar in-
vestigating patterson found that a lion
had walked into a tent in which a dozen
coolies were asleep and had carried off un-
gan singh their foreman

  ungan singh called out  choro let
go but mr lion seized the luckless
man by the neck and killed him then
picking him up as a cat carries a mouse
the lion stalked off to its partner in the
jungle and ate poor ungan singh with
sickening noises plainly heard in camp

next morning patterson with a party
followed the trail to the spot where
the body had been eaten only the head
remained dead eyes were staring wide
open with a fixed look of horror

  that night gun in hand patterson sat
in a tree near the tent hoping the man-
eaters would return

  after dark the lions could be heard roar-
ing in the distance then followed deep
silence for lions do not roar when hunting
two hours later wild screams and a babble
of voices in a different section of camp an-
nounced that the man-eaters had claimed
another victim

  being almost the only european in
camp patterson was looked up to by the
coolies for protection but as he had im-
portant duties which kept him busy dur-
ing daylight the englishman could not de-
vote all his nights to lion hunting

  the next evening patterson had a goat
tied for bait in front of the tent from which
the latest victim had been dragged he
himself sat in a tree over it

  but all in vain about midnight screams
from a distant part of camp told him that
into the dark continent



the congo isnt within hollering distance of uganda but operating conditions are much the
same the fireman of this  mixed  train running through the congo is getting a little
help from his less ritzy passengers in fueling up his hump-backed hog

the man-eaters had made another human
kill in a camp scattered for eight miles
through the jungle it was only by chance
that patterson could guess where the next
attack would come

  the man-eaters were entirely without
fear boldly they walked past huge fires
kept burning to frighten them away guns
fired in their direction after they had made
their kill did not disturb their horrid feast

  then all the workers were concentrated
in one huge camp protected by a boma of
thorn bushes so thick and high that the
railroad builders hoped it would turn even
a determined lion but it didnt no
wonder the hindus came to believe the
man-eaters were devils

  one night patterson and dr brock the
medical officer posted themselves in a box
car on the siding the lower half of the
door was closed

  this did not suit patterson he wanted
to lie under the car where he thought he

  would have a better chance for a shot
fortunately dr brock persuaded him to
stay inside the car

  soon they heard an animal approaching
stealthily after a few seconds of dead
silence the king of beasts with a blood-
curdling roar leaped at the half-open door

  both men fired together neither scored
a hit but the flash of their guns caused the
lion to swerve and strike the side of the
car instead of landing within mr lion
retreated into the jungle and did not return

  a few days later district officer white-
head a noted lion hunter arranged to come
up and try his luck his train was late
whitehead accompanied by abdullah a
sergeant of railroad police set out in the
darkness for pattersons camp

  as they were passing through a cut a
lion sprang on whiteheads back tearing
off his clothes with one swipe of a huge
paw but whitehead managed to fire his
carbine the flash caused the lion to turn


railroad stories

  attention to abdullah with another
spring he knocked down the sergeant
killed him and carried him off white-
head terribly frightened passed the night
in a tree

t length came the swahili porters who
had been sent for and with their help
operations were extended somewhat por-
ters were not enough something more
was needed

  after long delay and much cabling pat-
terson received the steam lorries he had or-
dered the day he landed but no water
could be spared for their boilers so they
were soon abandoned this of course
was before the day of modern motor trucks

  the railroad was now entering on a long
stretch of desert keeping the men sup-
plied with drinking water was a difficult
problem after the track was laid loco-
motives were provided with extra large
tenders for additional water and a water
car was coupled in behind the tenders so
bad was the water that locomotive boilers
had to be washed out every night

  as the railroad was a british govern-
ment job nothing could be allowed to hin-
der or delay it patterson cabled for more
coolies until he had ten thousand of them
scattered along the works

  his detour of tsavo river bridge fur-
nished the key to a solution of transport
difficulties whenever an unusually diffi-
cult stretch was encountered as many men
as could be used effectively were put on it
at the same time a  shoo-fly  temporary
track was laid around it

  in crossing the great rift valley supplies
were lowered down a cableway  feet
long while the road was being built down
a very steep mountain side swahili por-
ters did the rest by such expedients the
work was kept going on a wide front as
the isolated bits of grade were completed
and connected up the main line was moved
forward over temporary bridges when nec-
essary the shoo-flies were taken up and
moved ahead

patterson was here there and every-
where always with a gun bearer at his

elbow for man-eating lions were always at
the back of his mind for nearly nine
months he carried on an almost nightly
campaign against the beasts without once
catching sight of them

  this strain of hard work in a trying cli-
mate with sleepless nights was beginning
to tell on him the engineer became so
thin and haggard that he facetiously re-
marked

   im safe from the lions because im
too lean and scrawny to be good eating

  one night a lion sprang into the car of
ryall superintendent of police which
stood on a siding carried him off and ate
him

  patterson decided on a new plan a hut
was built in two compartments of ties and
steel rails bolted together one end was
like a rat trap with a door of steel rails
arranged to drop when a lion stepped on a
treadle within as a lure four sepoy sol-
diers were placed in the other compartment
behind a grille of steel rails

  being utterly fearless a lion walked into
the trap the first night the steel door
fell with a fearful clatter mr lion roared
and charged around trying to get out

  instead of shooting the beast as they
had been told the sepoys became panic-
stricken and fired wildly their bullets
whined close to patterson and superin-
tendent farquharson at right angles to the
trap they kept on firing recklessly until
they shot away a bar of the gate where-
upon the animal escaped

  by this time the coolies were frightened
so badly that they resigned in a body tak-
ing possession of trains bound for the coast
and departing-all but a few skilled men
who cowered in the boma refusing to work
and sleeping in treetops

  the lions had held up the uganda rail-
way all work was stopped for three
weeks

one night the lions killed a donkey in
camp and ate part of it thinking
they would return to their kill as is their
habit patterson had four poles set in the
earth ten feet from the donkey the tops

                             	r
into the dark continent



were lashed together and a board was tied
on for a seat

  on this crazy machan patterson gun in
hand posted himself at dusk he did not
have to wait long until he heard the
stealthy approach of a lion

  soon he realized to his horror that the
lion was stalking him around and around
it circled making up its mind to spring
but keeping out of sight

  at last he caught a glimpse of the beast
and fired with a roar the monster sprang
away followed by a second bullet which
brought another roar after that silence

  the shots aroused the camp patterson
called out that he had shot the lion this
brought a group of men cautiously carry-
ing lights and making as much noise as
possible they found the lion stone dead
less than a hundred yards from the machan
crouched as if for a spring it measured
nine feet ten inches in length eight men
carried it to camp

   mabaraki savior chanted the coo-
lies as they bore patterson in triumph
around the animals body half their trou-
bles were ended one pair of lions evi-
dently had caused most of their losses

  a few nights later the surviving man-eat-
er tried to get a right-of-way inspector who
wyas sitting on the veranda of his iron
shanty it failed but ate a couple of goats
on the spot

  next night patterson posted himself in
an iron shanty near by with a loophole
covering three live goats for bait tied to a
section of steel rail just before dawn a
lion dragged away all three goats and the
rail patterson fired but only killed one
of the goats

  in the morning the lion was found still
eating a goat a machan was built near
by on which the engineer took his post in
the evening with his native gun bearer
who watched while the worn-out english-
man slept patterson was aroused by a
touch on his arm

   lionl  whispered the gun bearer

  patterson could see the outline of a lion
under the machan he fired both barrels
of his gun the beast went down in an

     	r

instant it was up and bounding off roaring
at each leap

  following a blood-stained trail next
morning patterson and a party were soon
stopped by a growl the monster was
glaring at them a few yards ahead

  patterson fired and hit the lion
charged a second shot knocked it down
but instantly the beast was up and charg-
ing when patterson put out his hand for
his carbine it wasnt there his gun bearer
had climbed a tree

  fortunately a shot had broken one of
the animals hind legs and patterson bare-
ly had time to swing himself up out of
reach the lion growling turned back
then patterson getting his carbine fired
his shot killed the savage man-eater

  the hindus who months before had
sought to murder patterson now could not
do enough for him they gave him an
elaborate silver bowl and a long poem in
hindustani telling the story of his cam-
paign against the man-eaters

but this was only one of the vexatious
problems in building the uganda rail-
way after the man-eaters came fever

  in one gang of  men  were down
with fever at one time on another occa-
sion a roundhouse foreman and ten out of
eleven engine drivers were stricken to-
gether patterson himself took out a loco-
motive one trip in order to prevent stop-
page of work on an important job

  difficulties of engineering and construc-
tion were great the country is very moun-
tainous it was up one range and down
another all the way on an extremely
crooked alignment made necessary to hold
the grade down to two per cent which was
all the little locomotive could climb with a
paying load one range was crossed at an
altitude of  feet another at 

  at last the job was finished the first
locomotive entered port florence on vic-
toria nyanza  miles from kilindini
the day after christmas  then en-
gineer patterson started back to england
where he could forget all about man-eating
lions and tsetse flies and fever

  the mysterious adventures of k c jones
  or fiction is stranger than truth

  by bozo texino

nwansas city jnes

slowly arose from the
ground shook his clothing
j free of cinders and
clenched his fist at the tail
lights of the  mountain bullet now
vanishing around a curve

  a passer-by would have guessed that
k c jones had been ejected from the
rocky route freight train by an un-
friendly brakeman such indeed was
the case for k c was on the bum
a typical charlie tyler fiction hero
his overalls were ragged his cheeks
unshaven and his blue eyes peered out
from a face made lean and cavernous
by hunger

  two years before k c jones had
been the best damned hoghead on the
mountain division of the rocky route
railroad-even better than old dave
morrow in layngs story  riders of
the iron trail one night the
boomer op at big top who had been
drinking too freely fell asleep on the
job but woke just in time to throw a
red board in k cs face a hundred
yards ahead of his pilot the lights of a
crummy twinkled in the murk

 for one terrible moment fear
clutched at k cs heart then he
made a characteristic john johns stop
flattening all the wheels with a sweep
of his brawny arm k c wiped the
clock and then joined the birds-which
means applied the emergency brake
and jumped the next instant his 

plowed into the caboose like a buzz saw
eating through alabama pine un-
fortunately for k cs peace of mind
his fireman stayed in the cab and died
 a-scalded to death by the steam as
the poet says

  brass hats placed the blame square-
ly upon the shoulders of the flagman of
one train who was killed and the
hogger of the other k c jones who
failed to show up for the investigation
they did not know-and never would
know-that the lightning slinger at
big top had failed to hang out the red
until it was too late k c would not
tell them for the op was k cs own
father working under a flag just as
they do in frank l packard yarns
and nobody else could tell because no-
body else was in on the secret

  thus it happened that the mighty
k c jones branded as yellow took
the long and weary boomer trail that
led from winnipeg to the gulf and
from portland maine to portland
oregon

  it had been hard to leave the rocky
route hard also to quit the throttle
of the  mountain bullet to which he
had been promoted just before the
wreck at big top harder still to go
away from highland mary the gen-
eral managers daughter without even
clearing himself of a stigma which
filled her limpid eyes with tears of
shame and disappointment

   some day ill come back he mut-




railroad stories

tered grimly his eyes narrowing to
slits like the villain in a  boomer
bill  hayes story

  little did he know how near he was
to fulfillment of his dream that night
he was thrown out of a side-door pull-
man on the  mountain bullet for
like a weary wanderer lured by the
lights in the window k c jones had
drifted back to big top and the road
he loved so well

  the ex-hogger arrived at the right
time near the signal tower stood a
gold train headed by the  ready
to highball gold bullion to the new
orleans mint which was badly needed
to meet the demands of inflationists

  the general manager and his daugh-
ter were riding this train highland
mary had been spending a vacation in
california at glendale home town of
the famous charles w tyler and was
returning to her job as telegraph opera-
tor in new orleans k c was trying
to figure out where hed go next when
he suddenly saw highland and her
dad board the private car he didnt
know where they were going but de-
cided hed go there too

  climbing into the cab k c showed
his brotherhood card and international
engine picture club button to the
hogger and asked

   hows chances of riding this here
gold special to new orleans

   nothin doin the hogger replied
sourly  this train is loaded down
with guards an gumshoes an the

g	m is on board we have nothin
but an express car passenger coach
an the g ms private car so theres
no place for a boomer to ride

  k c threatened for a while and
then he calmed down thinking of the
beautiful highland mary

  before k cs smash-up at big top
the general manager had transferred

his daughter from the mountain di-
vision to new orleans he didnt like
the way k c steered highland around
the dance hall floor at the employees
dances he thought k c was rough-
handling her he wanted her to dance
with the downtown cake-eaters but he
found out k c had highland backed
into the siding with both switches
spiked down

kc jones slid out of the cab of
 the  and walked back on
the firemans side of the special he
unlatched the door on the  possum
belly  under the private car where he
intended to ride if he couldnt ride any-
where else hed read of the tricks
tried by that fellow in  beginners
luck by dave martin and k c de-
cided to follow suit

  k c had procured a pair of dark
sun glasses from the five and dime
store for twenty cents which he put
on as a disguise knowing that high-
land mary was on this train nothing
could hold him back if there was any-
thing he loved more than engines and
engine pictures it was this snappy little
redhead with eyes like scotch heather
and an old man tighter than any scot
ever hoped to be

  glancing around cautiously k c
saw the conductor coming with orders
the con was a slick fellow they
nicknamed him  slippery buck after
one of jimmy earps fiction characters
k c crawled into the possum belly
pulled the door shut peeped out and
when the con stopped there to trim his
lantern wick read the following train
order

engine  extra big top to new

  orleans with rights over all trains

  rights over everything k c sighed
and groaned what wouldnt he give
rights over everything	

to sit at the throttle of the 
with an order like that in his overalls
pocket 

  a moment later slippery was bawl-
ing out  all abo-o-o-ard  and the
special was on her way no 
was pulling an express car loaded with
the gold and a flock of gumshoes carry-
ing sawed-off shotguns also a coach
containing some more gumshoes and
the train crew

  the rear car was the general man-
agers private buggy under which the
mighty k c jones was riding as un-
invited guest k c had spread out
some waste for a mattress with a nice
soft coupler knuckle as pillow thus
his berth was made down for the
record run

  for it would be a record run he
knew while on the bum he had heard
from other members of the unwashed
fraternity that the huge shipment for
the new orleans mint had been split
two ways half of it was going by the
iron trail and the other half by the
tailspin airways a plane loaded with
the precious bullion was to make a test
trip and whichever form of transpor-
tation was first to reach new orleans
with the gold would be awarded a big
government contract

  the aviation outfit claimed they
could easily beat the streak of rust
that is if fair weather prevailed and
if they didnt have to make a forced
landing on a mountain top or down in
the desert where gila monsters fight
the rattlers and according to western
fiction writers the country is infested
with bandits train robbers rustlers and
crooked sheriffs

  these thoughts were driving the
cobwebs out of k cs brain as the
gold special was humming along the
twin ribbons of steel the boomer en-
gineer kicked off the inside top board

of the possum belly so hed have more
air while crossing the sun-scorched
desert and for observation purposes
hed have to lay low though when-
ever the train stopped so no one could
see him he hoped no snoopers were
laying for him for he had read about
that trainmaster in hilkers  christ-
mas test and knew how t ms
acted

  up above him on the brass hats
private chariot highland mary had
just gone out on the back porch for a
breath of air when-

z-z-zp the brakes went into
emergency it developed that the
engineer had seen a pile of black
creosoted ties on the track just like
the hogheads do in railroad fiction but
alas this wasnt fiction it was the
actual thing a band of train robbers
led by the notorious james jesse ii
lay hidden in a ravine they turned
a machine gun loose on the steel cab

  the special ground to a stop her
engine crew had to lie down to get out
of the range of bullets tattooing a de-
sign on the side of the j then
the rat-tat-tat ceased

    wonder what the dirty villains are
up to now k c murmured breath-
lessly still keeping out of sight

  he soon learned j j ii himself
and his chief lieutenant alkali ike
rushed forward covered the engine
crew with pocket-size cannons and
hog-tied them k c darted out of
his place of concealment grabbed an
armful of fusees and climbed onto the
pilot of the  from this vantage
point he lighted one fusee after another
and hurled them at the highwaymen

  by this time the guards and gum-
shoes had come to life sallying forth
they captured the bold bad bandits
bound them securely and threw them


railroad stories

from this vantage point ho lighted
one fusee after another and hurled
them at the highwaymen

into the gold car to take back to new
orleans and collect the reward money
the gold was saved-for a while any-
how

  k c untied the poor hoghead and
tallowpot and to them he thundered
 back up a little get a good start and
plow them ties off the track

  with that the redoubtable k c
jones crawled back to his berth under
the g ms car and the train was
under way again bearing eastward its
cargo of precious yellow metal

  highland mary standing on the
observation end her auburn hair flut-
tering in the breeze saw her hero and

recognized him at once her
heart pounded like an air pump
on a ioo-car freight train it did
not matter to her now that a
wicked gang had tried to rob the
nice gold special nothing mat-
tered only k c jones

highland was so excited she
scarcely slept a wink that night she
simply had to devise some means of
communicating with the man riding di-
rectly underneath her bedroom then
came a flash of inspiration the girl re-
membered that she and k c had
learned the morse code while playing
as kids together way back in griff
crawfords home town of wellington
kansas griff himself had taught them
the dot-and-dash system this recol-
lection gave her an idea early next
morning grabbing a broom highland
tapped a message on the floor with
the tip of the handle

  k c jones awoke from an unre-
rights over everything



freshing sleep brushed the sand from
his clothing and bed looked around for
his razor and toothbrush and dis-
covered he had forgotten to bring them
along he felt like a bum in a don
waters story overhead he heard a
iap-tap-tap

  he listened again came the tap-
ping the old familiar morse code
picking up a bolt he responded to
highlands message by pounding on
the bottom of the floor thus com-
munication was established it pro-
vided the answer to a very urgent ques-
tion k c had been asking himself 

   when do we eat

  up above highland told george
the negro reporter to serve breakfast
in her room this he did as soon
as he had deposited the meal on her
table and left the room highland tip-
toed over to the door and locked it
she put the food into a basket added
a monkey wrench as ballast tied a
string to the handle and cautiously
lowered it out of her window in front
of k cs door then she telegraphed
k c with her broom handle

  well sir as silent slim roach
would say talk about manna coming
right down out of heaven k c
reached out for that basket like it was
an answer to prayer and wrapped him-
self around the food in no time at all
while the gold special continued to
burn up the rails in the direction of
new orleans

  after he had finished the nourishing
breakfast highland pulled the basket
back into her room and everything was
jake k c amused himself by watch-
ing the wheels of the private car raise
off the inside rail in rounding curves
he couldnt figure why he was hated
by highlands father

  of course he knew from reading the
fiction in railroad stories that a

grouchy official usually didnt have
much time for a boomer courting his
daughter he was aware that hard-
shell higgins for instance who owned
the happy valley line didnt want
goldenrod to marry the engine picture
kid even though hardshell and the
kid had one thing in common both
being engine picture fiends but the
kid was a boomer when he began
courting goldenrod whereas k c was
not at least not at first

  the general manager of the rocky
route railroad had not only fired k

c	from that pike but had blacklisted
him on every job he had gotten since
and all because k c had protected his
fathers good name at the time of the
wreck at big top

  reclining in the possum belly and
ruminating on these things as they sped
along the shining rails k c vowed
that at the end of this run hed clear
his own name without spilling the
beans on his father yes sir hed re-
deem himself just like fiction heroes
did in the yarns wrritten by searle b
faires the ex-op up in winnipeg

black clouds milling around in
the heavens reminded him of box
cars rolling down a train yard lead in
a hump yard they were all loads-
not an empty in the heavens light-
ning flashed thunder boomed

   something is bound to happen
he muttered grimly  whenever e
s dellinger is about to reach a crisis in
one of his novelettes the lightning
flashes and the thunder booms just like
were having now

  sure enough it did happen while
watching the black clouds the boomer
ex-hogger spied an airplane flying low
over the gold special evidently the
birdman was afraid of the storm
looking closer he recognized the plane


railroad stories

as belonging to the rocky routes
deadly rival she was the tailspin
airway craft that was flying the other
half of the gold bullion

   i wonder what brother dellinger
would do in a case like this k c
asked himself  or brandhorst or
don livingston or any of the other
boys who grind out railroad fiction

  k c opened the door of his possum
belly and about that time the brakes
went into emergency if the car wheels
hadnt been flattened before theyd cer-
tainly be that way now they looked
like emery wheels they were throwing
out so many sparks it reminded k c
of john johns in all his glory

  the cause was soon apparent their
train had run into a washout alarmed
k c felt water flowing into his berth
if he didnt get out soon hed be
drowned he did get out and started
swimming to the engine

  finding the cab deserted he released
the brakes put the johnson bar in re-
verse motion opened the throttle and
started backing out of flood water
water had put out the fire so k c
took out a fusee lighted it and soon
had plenty of heat in the s fire-
box

  the engine crew re-appeared rather
sheepishly and took charge of their
iron horse they had jumped at see-
ing water on the track

   no hoghead or tallowpot in a g a
lathrop story would have deserted
k c thought sadly but again re-
minded himself that this was not litera-
ture but real life

  at any rate the crew thanked k c
as he scrammed back to his berth and
they got going again highland had
been watching the whole affair her
scotch-heather eyes glowed with pride
in k c jones

  the gold special backed up and de-

toured over the southwestern to el
pazo as they were backing up they
saw wreckage of the tailspin plane
heaped upon the ground the bullion
being transferred to a road hog truck
evidently the foes of the rocky route
railroad were going to try to mush it
through on the old spanish trail

  at that juncture highland lowered
down to k c two well-cooked
t-bone steaks some choice vegetables
a generous cut of cactus pie and a quart
of milk the disappearence of these
viands caused porter george to con-
gratulate highland on the improve-
ment in her appetite she didnt seem
despondent any more either un-
doubtedly the trip to california had
done her a world of good

  this news greatly pleased her old
man except that being scotch he be-
gan figuring up the cost of additional
food

  if she keeps on eating this way i
wont have any money to pay income
tax the g m remarked glumly  we
sure cant afford to let the airplane and
truck interests get that fat contract
after receiving orders to go over
the southwestern he ambled over to
the engineer and instructed him

   lay back the ears of the  and
pull the bridle off the roads yours
hearing this k c wept inwardly
he wished the general manager were
whispering these greetings into his own
greasy ears instead of to that dumb
hoghead if only given a chance just
a little break hed show them plenty
of speed-speed that would put to
shame even the fast runs in john johns
stories

  when the train slowed up in passing
through albuquerque e s dellinger
was at the station to see her go by he
highballed the hoghead with a wad of
rights over everything



paper one sheet was whisked out of
his hand by the breeze and right into
the lap of kansas city jones

  k c looked at it curiously it
proved to be a page from dellingers
latest novelette  harvey house girl
he read the page thinking all the
while of his own highland mary

  on on they went the truck carry-
ing the gold bullion tried to beat the
 to a crossing-as motorists often
do-but ran into the side of the train
and almost knocked the possum belly
from the bottom of the g ms car

  just like a lousy truck driver
k c exclaimed wrathfully no won-
der earle davis attacked those buz-
zards in a recent railroad story

the truck was badly wrecked how-
ever and the gold was transferred to
a fast motorboat in the rio river the
rio at this point parallels the railroad
track for  miles

  k c chuckled  heres where we
gain on the motorboat

  even with a dumb hogger in the cab
the  picked up speed and reached
el pazo only thirty minutes late there
she fueled up for a new dash for the
new orleans mint over the rocky
route railroad

  after making a couple hundred
miles the special train ran into a land-
slide k c put on his dark glasses
emerged from his berth and found the
reason for the  defugalty as cupid
childs would say there was a pile of
rocks on the track around it were
gathered slippery buck the conductor
and highland and her old man and a
couple of railroad dicks

aside


railroad stories

asked not recognizing jones in the
dark glasses

   write to light of the lantern de-
partment one of the gumshoes sug-
gested acidly

  the mighty k c gave the smart
alec a scornful look without a word
he picked up the rocks one by one and
tossed them lightly from the right-of-
way highlands eyes misted with tears
of admiration at this noble deed

  while all this was taking place the
gold cargo was being transferred from
the motorboat to a fast passenger bus
evidently the road hog bus lines
were going to show the railroad some
fast running it was a fight to the
finish 

the special and the bus arrived at
the quaint old town of santone
about the same time both were fueled
up changed crews and left about the
same time-just as though they had
somewhere to go and were eager to get
there

  the riding time between santone
and hewston wasnt going to be very
long the way the   was dancing
with sand in k cs eyes after crews
had been changed at hewston k c
rode the blinds out of town here they
had got the punkest hoghead of the
entire trip he let the bus get ahead
of him k c could have died of
ignominy

  climbing on top of the fuel tank
he listened to the exhaust anybody
could tell the hogger didnt know how
to get speed out of the  k c
saw the bus drive up on a highway
crossing ahead of them and stall on the
main iron the hoghead big-holed the
brake valve then he leaped out the
right side of the cab and the tallowpot
out the left

  the bus driver finally got his motor

started he slid off the track in low
gear just as the special whizzed by
k c ran down in the cab threw the
johnson bar ahead snatched the throt-
tle wide open and started releasing the
brakes in a few minutes he was pass-
ing the road hogs prize buggy

  however he was kept busy firing
the engine and running it too he
didnt have any orders as the hoghead
who had jumped took them along with
him all k c knew was he had rights
over all trains and they had better be
in the clear what more could any
engineer ask for

  meanwhile back in the train the
conductor knew well from the way
they skyrocketed along that they were
now making the best time in the history
of the road but he sauntered over to
the engine climbing down the ladder
on the fuel oil tank he only saw one
man in the cab this man was neither
the hoghead nor tallowpot he was sup-
posed to have to him the famous
k c jones was a total stranger and
he asked

   how come  wheres my engine
crew

   they jumped off back yonder when
they thought they were going to hit
the bus k c explained nonchalantly

   that crew was no good anyway
stormed the conductor  my flagman
santa fe cactus is an ex-oil-burning
fireman off the old horny toad ill
send him over to fire for you and may-
be we can beat the bus to new
orleans

  as soon as  santa fe  cactus ar-
rived and had everything lined up
k c whistled for a jerkwater town
highland highballed him the speed-
ometer on the  only registered up
to  miles an hour k c had the
pointer against  and nobody knew
how much faster he was going
rights over everything

 

  the irate general manager now had
something up in his neck and it wasnt
his adams apple when a locomotive
runs about  miles an hour faster
than its geared up to run it gets to
crow-hopping or nose-diving the
 was doing both she was just
about shaking the lead out of the coun-
ter-balances in her drivers

ahead of them was a tremendous
t light like an oil field aflame as
they approached k c saw it was a
forest fire he slowed down and
stopped at the edge of the woodland

  the g m gave orders to back up
and wait until the fire burned out but
after backing about a quarter of a mile
he saw the fire was burning across the
track behind them they were trapped
by the fire with nothing to do but go
ahead so they highballed k c

   wonder what a bill hayes hero
would do in a case like this he mused

  they hit the fire ahead going 
miles an hour k c turned on the
cold water squirt hose spraying the in-
side walls of the cab the steel cab
was so hot it would fry the cold water
like a hot stove if hell should ever
run short on heat the inside of this
engine cab would make a fine annex

  the gg was making  per when
k c saw live coals igniting fuel oil
that had sloshed out on top of the fuel
oil tank he took the squirt hose and
kept this fire put out as fast as the wind
blew it from the tall tree tops

  if the fuel oil tank should catch fire
theyd all perish worse than that the
precious gold they were hauling would
melt and run away

  while k c was keeping the cab
cooled off and putting out the fire on
top of the tank santa fe was over-
come with heat the horny toad
veteran lay on his back in the deck

when he come to his uniform was
three sizes too small

  k c had been whistling all along
trying to get a highball out of high-
land mary he wanted to see if every-
thing was all right back there

  it was the train crew guards and
gumshoes had crowded into the private
car because it was air-cooled the
cooling machinery did its best trying to
keep the car at  degrees but finally
gave up in despair and the tempera-
ture rose to  highland mary was
talking to the conductor

  if dad who hates k c so bad
could run this railroad like k c runs
an engine she said  he wouldnt
have to be borrowing monev from the
r f c

  k c was now heading into new
orleans terminal in a whirlwind of
glory finally he stopped the train
the race was won he collapsed on
the seat-box and was taken off the en-
gine put in an ambulance highland
gave orders to take him to her home

  a couple of days later the bus finally
limped in with its quota of gold but
the rocky route railroad had already
got the contract incidentally the gum-
shoes received reward money for the
bandits they had caught in the ravine

  after k c got better pretty red-
headed highland mary informed her
father that she was going to marry
him- even if we both have to go on
the tramp for the rest of our lives
she declared firmly

 the g ms heart melted he
reached out a long arm pulled high-
land over to him and said 

   daughter you wont exactly be on
the tramp but kansas city jones will
be the new traveling engineer i have
re-instated him with full seniority
rights we need a hoghead like him
on the rocky route railroad

   to old bill danforth skipper on
   the gulf lines every hobo was a

damnhobo

 by e s dellinger

ex-brakeman mop and frisco author of  harvey house girl etc

ld bill danforth gulf
lines freight conductor
hated hoboes worse than
hell hates holy water
he had been hating
them for more years than most men
on the creeping shadows division
could remember

  it happened like this on a dark
night forty years ago he spiked down
into a boxcar load of them to collect
it was his right-if he was big enough
bill had always thought he was big
enough this time he wasnt instead
of digging up they broke his jaws
knocked out his teeth caved in his
skull and kicked him off for dead

  when he returned to work a year
later he declared w a r on the hobo
kingdom it was not new this war be-
tween bum and brakeman it had been
going on ever since the first rail was
laid and wheels run over it to most
men it is a game to bill danforth
it was a mania

  the night was never so dark nor the

wind so wild nor the tops so slick
with glare ice but that at sight of a
moving shadow he would tear out of
his warm caboose risk death vowing
death to the  damnhoboes

  forty years he boasted that the
 damnhobo  didnt live who could
ride his train - and made good the
boast men predicted he would come
to grief would fall off a reeling
freight or tackle another gang who
refused to run and as the years
passed and hate for hoboes made him
the meanest conductor who ever quilled
a wheel report more than one dis-
gruntled brakeman secretly hoped it
would be soon

  while the home guards predicted
the finger of fate fixed upon terry
obrien red-headed freckled a hobo
kid from god knows where terry
rode the blind of no  into blaisdell
and jumped off into the arms of a pair
of railroad bulls

  they kicked his back and slapped his
front and headed him for the hoose-


damnhobo



gow but fate had other plans as
they passed the yard office big bill
sears division superintendent looked
the kid over grinned a couple of times
and made a brakeman out of him

  danforth pawed the air and tore up
the cinders

  if you ever call that scum for my
crew he raved  therell be a damn-
hobo in the hospital an a callboy in
the hearse

  for three years terry was not called
on danforths crew he never knew
why then one night he danced with
danforths betty she fanned his
cheek with perfumed breath and whis-
pered the wish that  poor daddy
could get just one good brakeman who
knew what to do and did it

  until now terry had never spoken
to the old hobo chaser had he spoken
now fate might have been thwarted in
its unerring purpose he didnt

  three days after the ball the rear
end job on old bills crew was  ad-
vertised in fact both jobs on old
bills crew had stayed  advertised 
most of the time for forty years ig-
noring friendly tips terry remem-
bered only the wistful wish of blue-
eyed betty and signed for the run he
got it

it was september midnight lay on
the land of creeping shadows bit-
ing east wind tamped dense wraiths
of fog among acres of freight cars in
the blaisdell yards

  his heart rapping his slats at a hun-
dred a minute terry hurried through
fog and darkness answering his first
call to brake behind for old bill on
no 

  out of the fog grew a yellow light
filtering through dingy unwashed
windows it fell in blurred oblongs on
the wet red walls of a freight car

terry swore he had come early to-
night expecting to be first in the ca-
boose old bill danforth was already
there

  a hundred and eighty pounds of
 good brakeman  fell up the forward
platform the caboose swayed terry
flung open the door

  the shriveled conductor skull cap
on bald pate was at the homemade
table back to the door he did not
turn terry stopped wondering if the
old man were hard of hearing but
he slipped his gauntlet from his
bronzed hand and strode forward

   names obrien he said  ter-
ry obrien

  old bill glowered fiercely up his
sagging saucer-shaped jaws tightened
on silver wires his gold teeth clacked
and his eyes gleamed over horn-
rimmed spectacles

   the hell it is

  terrys grin froze he did not with-
draw the hand he stood gulping and
staring at a conductor who refused to
shake maybe danforth did not under-
stand

   ive jist signed up for this run
mr danforth he explained

  old bill kept looking at the hand
as if he would spit in it neither of
them moved or spoke for a second
then

   what the hell do you expect me
to do give yuh a dollar

   give me a-give me a-give me
a-dollar

   yes i jist heard theyd signed a
damnhobo on my crew thought may-
be-

  understanding came to terry long
ago he had forgotten how he had come
into blaisdell on the blind

  beneath him the caboose was reel-
ing he took a step forward fist
drawn at one blow he could have


railroad stories

driven the sneering shriveled face
through the way-car wall

   you-you damned old son- he
hushed abruptly

  danforth leered at him

   finish it you overgrown lobster
go right ahead ive heard it before
its the only epithet a damnhobo
knows

  terry did not finish it he was re-
calling a night at the trainmens ball
and a perfumed breath fanning his
cheek and a wistful voice whispering
 i do wish daddy had a good
brakeman one who-

  the big fists relaxed fell to his
sides

   listen mr danforth he croaked
 ive signed up for this run i aim
to stay with it

   like hell you will screeched
danforth  like hell youll stay  the
hobo dont live who can ride my train
much less ride my cupola an read my
orders why you impudent upstart
im goin straight to the office i aint
goin to move a wheel till they give
me a brakeman instid of a damnhobo
he surged past terry and stum-
bled through the fog toward the yard
office roaring threats and curses

  terry fully expected him to bring
another brakeman to the caboose when
their train pulled by the yard office
he didnt neither that night nor for
many nights to come

terry scrubbed dirty floors
washed dingy windows and put in
new seat cushions old bill did not
seem to notice in utter silence he
would swing up the platform make out
his reports climb into the cupola to
smoke and watch his train he never
spoke another word to his new brake-
man until that night at creeping
shadows

  the creeping shadows country is
wild its rugged mountains are clad
in gnarled oak and hickory and black-
jack its steep-walled valleys are mat-
ted with dogwood and thorn bush and
wild grape and virginia creeper

  under the tangled mass rattlers sing
and copperheads hiss and cotton-
mouths crawl in black ooze and slime
through its darkened giens wild deer
slink in the dawn down its game trails
panthers scream in the darkness and
men wilder than these seek refuge from
a law which they have outraged

  its denizens had fought the coming
of rail and civilization they hated it
because it interfered with their lib-
erty and license they missed no flim-
sy pretext to strike at the steel and the
men who ran it more than once big
bill sears had cautioned danforth

   chase hoboes if you will but not
in the creeping shadows

  about a month after terry came on
the car danforths crew caught a drag
out of fort jones for the south they
had sixty cars empty boxes and flats
with loads of coal and lumber and
scrap iron sandwiched between in the
late afternoon they climbed the grade
past black mountain crawled through
the long tunnel and wound down the
grade toward the town of creeping
shadows

  it was dark when they stopped at
the tank a drizzle was falling terry
hit the cinders he carried a hickory
club and a skeleton frame lantern he
was going to look over his train

  a second behind him old bill dan-
forth hit the cinders he carried a
hickory club and a skeleton frame lan-
tern he was going to hunt hoboes
terry walked rapidly flashing his lan-
tern under the cars watching for
broken wheels and dragging brake
beams he saw two pairs of shoes on
damnhobo



the opposite side he did not stop to
investigate he kept on going until
he met his head brakeman thirty cars
from the caboose they exchanged a
word of greeting

   howre they runnin  asked
terry

   ok returned the buddy
 howre you an bill gittin along

   still arguin grinned terry

  the two brakemen crossed the train
and started toward their respective sta-
tions terry recalled the two pairs
of shoes he had seen he kept looking
for their owners he did not see them
even with where they had been he
heard voices in an empty boxcar

   you git the hell off this train an
stay off danforth was saying  we
aint hauling no damnhobo on trains i
run

   you cant kick me off you shriv-
eled sardine another voice was bel-
lowing  ill cut out yore yaller liver
an feed it to the buzzards

  you git off  old bill screeched
 the hobo dont live who can ride my
train i

  terry went back to the caboose
ever since he had been on the job he
had looked after the train and let dan-
forth chase the hoboes

  he caught the caboose as it came
by and waited on the platform as
usual until the conductor caught on
the caboose ran past the place where
he had heard the argument he looked
out no light was in sight he began
to grow uneasy maybe danforth had
found his match maybe- he dropped
to the bottom step intending to take
one more look and then pull the air
as he hit the step he heard the con-
ductor yell

  git outa my way dammit im
cornin up

  terry fell back on the platform old

bill caught the railing and swung up
beside him the guards of the skele-
ton frame lantern were broken the
brake club had blood on it old bill
had a missing tooth and a black eye

the conductor volunteered no in-
formation terry asked no ques-
tions he got the spare lantern out of
the locker lighted it and adjusted the
wick old bill set the broken one in
the floor for him to put away jotted
down the time on the delay sheet and
climbed to the cupola to smoke and
watch the train he rode into blais-
dell without speaking

 this was on friday evening on
tuesday night they caught the kansas
city merchandise they were standing
side by side on the rear platform when
they pulled by the office

  big bill sears swung up the plat-
form he carried a flint rock with a
scrap of cheap white paper tied to it
he was chewing the end of a dead
cigar he squinted at danforth

  have you been chasin hoboes
down around creepin shadders late-
ly he rasped

  danforth looked at sears then at
terry

   yeah he responded in surprise
 i kicked off a couple there last week
has this damnhobo been-

 you big fool roared sears
 read that he thrust rock and
paper into danforths hand  it was
tossed into my window last night
danforth held the paper to his lan-
tern his face was a poker mask
when he had finished he returned the
paper to sears sears gave it to terry

u ar going to have a nuther rek

  it is going to be a big rek i am going
  to kill a oornducter an git even with
  ur railrod he cant beet me up an
  thro me offn a dam tran an live to brag
  about it


railroad stories

  in the place for signature was the
crudely drawn picture of a coiled
rattlesnake

  terry looked at it curiously he
did not need to ask whose it was elec-
tric chairs of three states had waited
long for  the rattler he handed
the message to sears sears turned on
the conductor

   i told you to lay off that creepin
shadders gang he boomed  looks
like youre headed hellward on a drag
where there aint no air

 danforth said nothing sears
dropped off the two men went into
the caboose to read orders and watch
their train

the next days were uneasy ones
railroad men often looked over
their shoulders the creeping shad-
ows had struck before rumors soon
flitted about that it was striking again
around the outlaw capital trainmen
clung close to cab and cupola peered
cautiously into dark corners and
breathed more easily when dawn came

  old bill danforth went about his
business as if nothing had happened
he did not speak to terry he chased
hoboes as relentlessly as ever terry
marveled at the old mans callous un-
concern

  sunday night they were called out
of blaisdell on no  at  a fierce
storm was brewing over the creeping
shadows hills pink lightning flared in
the purple heavens the head brake-
man laid off sick terry had a hunch
that he too should lay off sick he
did not play his hunch but took the
call

  he went to the yards and checked
their train next the caboose were two
cars of merchandise for the mines at
southport where rails plunge through
the creeping shadows tunnel that

was nothing new every sunday night
for years the merchandise had short
loads for southport

  ahead of the southport cars were
seven loads for the iron mountain con-
nection in fort jones terry looked
at them only to see that the hand brakes
were released and the hoses coupled

  ahead of them was a system box
for joplin he looked twice at it and
looked again it had big red cards on
the side and ends terry knew that car
was a load of dynamite for the mines
he had often ridden trains hauling
high explosives but in this one he saw
possibilities which sent goose-pimples
trickling like cold sweat down his spine
he laughed shortly and went on

  the two ahead were machinery and
ore the third was a flat-bottomed coal
car on this car the brake was set
terry climbed up to release it it was
loaded to a depth of eighteen inches
with lengths of gas pipe in the rear
end was a pile of straw where hoboes
had had a bed

  danforth was late to work he
looked old and tired for the first time
in five weeks he appeared to remem-
ber he had a hind brakeman without
looking at terry he asked in an apolo-
getic tone

   have you got a gun

  terry laughed mirthlessly

   hell no i aint no bull im a
brakeman

  with a shrug old bill went to the
office he caught the caboose as it
pulled by and handed terry the orders
one of them informed him that no 
would run three hours late from blais-
dell to fort jones no  was the  fly-
ing bee crack train of the system

  terry remembered that superin-
tendent sears was taking a general
manager and some lesser officials north
on the train tonight he read the
damnhobo



order looked at his watch glanced at
the time card and reckoned mentally
that they would let the bee by them at
creeping shadows if all went well

  they did not let the bee by at creep-
ing shadows the order board was
out the engineer took the train up
the main line while danforth went
into the office terry looked around
his train on the opposite side even
with the car of pipe he saw three pairs
of shoes they were heavy shoes he
did not stop to investigate

  at the middle of the train he met
chink summers the head brakeman
and turned back toward the caboose
it was raining now and the lightning
which earlier had flared and shimmered
came no more when he got to the
pipe car the shoes were not there he
looked all about no one was in sight

  soon the train pulled away from the
tank terry caught the caboose the
door was open he remembered dis-
tinctly that he had closed it he looked
within on the floor was a piece of
cheap white paper tied to flint rock he
picked up the paper and read the crude
scrawl

    i strik to nit damn yor sol

  in the place for the signature was
the crude drawing of a coiled rattle-
snake

terry gripped the flint rock and
ran to the rear door he did not
expect to see danforths lantern he
was mistaken as he went out the
door danforth swung up the rear plat-
form he had a single sheet of green
tissue and a yellow message slip he
handed them to terry

  scarcely realizing what he did ter-
ry grabbed them and shoved his paper
into danforths hand

   read that he chattered

  the old man held the white sheet
to the light read the scrawl and tossed
it contemptuously off into the darkness
to hell with em he muttered
they remained on the platform until
they had passed the switch the reg-
ular wham-wham-zvham of the ex-
haust on the helper engine coupled to
their caboose rang in their ears fi-
nally terry went inside and read his
order

    order no  annulled no  en-
  gine  run four hours late blaisdell
  to fort jones

  then he read the message

    to c  e no  stay at southport
  for no  acct black mountain blocked
  with cars

  he hooked both order and message
and climbed into the cupola old bill
was already on the other side they
watched the headlight of the helper
play over the tops of the reeling cars
not a moving shadow showed

  all the way up the hill terry kept
wondering about that last warning he
shuddered every time he remembered
that he had to do some switching at
southport

  they headed into the mile-long pass-
ing track at the top of the creeping
shadows mountain from the south
end of this passing track a two-mile
spur swung east around the mountain
to the southport mines

  ordinarily the crew took the south-
port cars over with the helper engine
tonight the helper was returning im-
mediately to creeping shadows for
no  when it cleared chink sum-
mers brought the road engine down the
main line and headed it in against the
caboose

  terry cut off two cars and the ca-
boose turned them into the mine track


railroad stories

and rode away around the mountain
old bill did not go with them he
stayed with the train the last terry
saw of his lantern he was heading to-
ward the deserted office to deposit way-
bills in the box at sight of the speck
of light flitting through the darkness
terry shivered

  rules required crews to place the
two mine cars at the platform for un-
loading but when terry and chink
arrived they found both the platform
spur and the mine spur full of cars
after a paint-scorching essay on the
dumbness of officials who made
through freight crews spot short loads
terry did the only thing he could do
he coupled into the cars at the plat-
form and backed down to southport
with three of them these three he
shoved into the passing track a quar-
ter mile below where he had left the
rear end of his standing train

he did not return to the mines with
the engine he sent chink he
set brakes on two of the cars he had
brought out and sat on a wet roof to
wait rain pattered on the tin the
engine slipped from sight he looked
toward the north the only thing vis-
ible in the sea of blackness was the
green gleam of a switchlight far up
the line there was no white light in
sight

   wonder where that grouchy old
devil is he muttered  ought to be
back by this time

  he whistled a strain of  blue dan-
ube that made him think of betty
danforth he cursed at the last dance
betty had lifted a tip-tilted nose and
refused to dance with him

  he looked at the watch it was
 no  would soon be leaving
creeping shadows he remembered
the three pairs of shoes he had seen

beside his train he looked toward the
east old bills lantern was not
showing

   why dont that old devil come
back he asked himself

  he started toward the office but
first extinguished his light then he
lighted it again set it on the ground
and crossing the main track slipped
northward

  nearing the train he heard a drunk-
en voice boasting

   cant do zhat to me ill shom
beat me up an kick me offn their
damn trains

  terry stopped his pulses quick-
ened he was not a hero he was a
brakeman while he hesitated whether
to fight or run he heard another sound
it was like a snake hissing in the grass
it was up by the car of dynamite

  listening he heard the whoo-ee of
a slackening train piston the clank of
releasing shoes and another hiss

   the damn yahoos he thought
 lettin brakes off this train

  instinct told him  the rattler  had
struck had disposed of danforth
how he did not know but his brain
manufactured pictures they were not
pleasant they sent sympathy for the
old man surging into his heart

  terry quit thinking about danforth
remembered there was to be a  big
rek and eased into shadows to wait

  with that methodical precision
which follows careful planning two
men were releasing brakes they
talked guardedly

  terry was puzzled with his train
hanging over the hump it would not
move if they kicked off all the brakes
still before the men reached him the
cars between which he stood began
moving

  for a second he could not figure
what had happened then he recalled
damnhobo



a hoarse voice groaned as terry swung his brake club

that the helper engine had left the
slack  bunched when he had cut off
the mine cars he had easily lifted the
pin the gang had lifted another pin
had turned loose a cut of cars with
brakes off and a straight shot back
down the grade into the face of no 
while he moved with quickening ears
he heard the drunken voice saying glee-
fully 

   thash all right boys theyre
helln gone now

the cars were gathering speed
their crawl had changed to a walk
the walk would soon change to a run
he reached for a side ladder intend-
ing to go high and set brakes he
changed his mind at his first step
on a running board they would hear
him

  he eased from between the men
were close six feet away was the
glowing tip of a cigarette he won-
dered what they had done with dan-
forth the cars moved faster terry
fingered the club watched the glow-
ing tip hurled himself and struck

  the club connected a hoarse voice
groaned a body fell two others
leaped back a hogleg spat its boom
echoed against the rain drenched
mountain a shot clipped terrys
sleeve

  darkness silence and cars slipping
down the grade one gone another
going

  then there were three shots the
last one was close terry fixed the
spurt of flame-fixed it and struck
again his club connected a second
body slumped a stream of orange
stabbed from a gun a body hurtled
toward him struck him in the middle
took him down beneath it for the
shadow of seconds the world was
black a hand found terrys throat
beneath the hand was a pinpoint of
cold steel


railroad stories

  terry seized the wrist of the knife
hand and bent it back wrecker and
trainman came together the one was
drunk the other was sober terrys
big fist found a face lashed once
twice down went the wrecker terry
was upon him lifted him flung him
hard into the cinders

  wheels clack-clacked over rusty
rails panting trembling until he could
scarcely stand terry caught the ladder
on it he remembered his club with-
out the club he would be helpless he
rolled off to find it

  groping in darkness he fell over a
body but he lit a match found the
club turned back to where the cars had
been they were not there from to-
ward the switch came the dull thump
of rolling wheels

  terry struck out after them he
caught a coupling lever he swung left
out of the track found die ladder and
swung on the coal car loaded with pipe
the brake wheel was at the other end
of the car he stumbled over the pipe
running for the brake

  in the end of the car his foot struck
soft flesh lighting another match he
saw old bill danforth lying in the
straw in front of the pipe bound and
gagged

  forgetting the three cars he had left
standing by the switch terry dropped
down beside danforth he jerked the
gag from the disfigured mouth old
bill began cursing and spitting

   damnhoboes throwed me in here
to take a ride did they wait till i
git my hands-

   weve got to git outa here an
work interrupted terry sharply
 theyve let brakes off these cars an
turned em loose in the face of num-
ber eight an that car of dynamites
in the cut

  terry slashed cords off bound

ankles danforth scrambled to his feet
he was in the bottom of the car ahead
of the pipe

there was a sickening jolt terry
plunged head first into the car wall
danforth uttered a piercing cry for
a second terry could not think what
had happened he thought the dyna-
mite had exploded then he recalled
the cars left standing above the switch
the death wagon had crashed into
them he hoped they had hit the ditch
they hadnt

  now bill was yelling

   my feet he cried  its got my
feet 

  terry struck another match what
he saw made him turn sick the col-
lision had shifted the load of pipe the
uneven ends had hurtled forward like
an irregular wall of spears catching
danforths legs fixing him to the end
of the car like a moth on a cork pad

  for seconds he forgot that a dozen
cars were loose on creeping shadows
mountain forgot that in one of them
was sufficient high explosive to blow
cars into atoms forgot that no 
carrying sleeping hundreds and big
bill sears the best friend he ever
knew would come roaring up that
grade and meet them head on

  he worked with danforth he could
do nothing only by unloading the
hundreds of lengths of pipe could the
conductor be released

  the ominous clack of outlaw wheels
finally stirred him collision had
slowed the death wagon of the wreck-
ers but three brakes on a dozen cars
would not hold them already the head
car had split the switch and was roll-
ing in to the main line picking up
speed with every turn of its wheels

 terry seized danforth by the
shoulder
damnhobo



   listen he commanded trying to
smother the quake in his own voice
 you drop down on this pipe and take
it easy im goin to leave yuh

   figgered yuh would sneered
danforth damnhoboes you an
them too they fixed up their death
cart youre goin to jump off an-
 but i aint goin to jump terry
called back

   you aint goin to-

  the old man hushed his breathing
quickened terry hunted for the club
it was under many lengths of pipe
it took time to get it threatening
clack-clack - clackety-clack quickened
like the throb of a warming motor

  danforths breathing was labored
the brakeman could hear it as he
fished for the club

  you might as well jump the
hoarse voice was almost human  yuh
cant do nothin theyll be runnin
fifty an hour before you get half your
brakes set get off an let em go
yeah terry was tugging at the
hickory club  jump an let em slough
into number eight

   i-i aint never done nothin to
you but bawl yuh out kid croaked
danforth

   youre tellin me

  the brakeman came up with the
club floundered by the conductor
climbed from the car set its brake and
started for the next one

  there was not a ray of light noth-
ing but the incessant swish of the driz-
zle and the menacing grumble of
wheels with their ever shortening
clk-clk-clkiy-clk and the screech and
groan of flanges bending main line
switch points

  when terry groped around the end
of that car wall caught the grabiron
and swung out into space he knew he
was rolling the dice of death against

heavy odds up he went like a mon-
key the scream of wheels grew
louder cars lurched and rolled the
brakeman sucked his breath through
clenched teeth he found the brake
wheel at the forward end and iron
shoes on iron wheels groaned like dy-
ing things

  with foot and club he felt for the
roof ahead no roof was there only
a black yawning gulf the car he rode
was a high one the next ahead was
a coal car loaded with ore down the
ladder meant precious seconds seconds
on whose loss might hang victory or
defeat in his flight with grade and ton-
nage he took the shorter way

one instant he teetered over the
wet board the next he plunged
down into the darkness below him
were rough rocks fresh from mines
his feet struck them and his knees
buckled down he went face first
bruising lips nose forehead he got
up and went on

  another brake he set and still oth-
ers forty miles an hour-on track
carded fifteen the thought was stag-
gering

  you cant do it whispered a
voice  theyre out of control that
car of dynamite theyre going to hit
unload now jump join the birds

  to right and left wet earth was
speeding by with the gentle rain fall-
ing on it on the wet earth lay life
and safety on the speeding cars lay
danger maybe death

   taint your fault whispered the
voice  didnt danforth bring it on
himself didnt danforth call you a
damnhobo let him go serves him
right

  but terry did not jump

  from out of the blackness a green
light gleamed green-safety terrys


railroad stories

hard eyes glistened the block signal
semaphore a mile from southport was
green no  was not within the block

  the first car shot by it the green
light flicked yellow the yellow changed
to red

  other brakes other miles the
scream of wheels grew louder the
speed quickened from forty to fifty
and another green signal at fifty
miles an hour the cars reeled out over
the creeping shadows trestle two
hundred feet below black water swirled
around concrete pillars surged and
raced on down the gorge

  at forty miles an hour the green
switchlight at older leaped toward him
the block signal was a ball of gold
no  was on the hill

  the cars crashed down the main line
between the switches a frightened op-
erator yelled up from the platform
yelled and dashed inside to call a dis-
patcher the lower head block leaped
into view it was gleaming red by it
the outlaw cars reeled recklessly rac-
ing around curves shooting through
limestone cliffs rumbling over high
trestles

  all brakes were now set they were
cutting the speed now trembling until
he could scarcely stand terry was
going back over them twisting each
one notch by notch fifteen miles an
hour then ten at every curve he lis-
tened felt waited for the crash

  ten miles an hour then eight from
down the hill a soft glow lighted the
forest the blare of an exhaust min-
gled with the clatter of brake wheels

  the exhaust stopped suddenly as if
a giant hand had choked it a whistle
screamed at five miles an hour the
outlaw cars staggered into the arms of
the oncoming passenger train rattled
banged boomed and stopped dead
still and from them terry obrien

hurried down to report to a blasphem-
ous engine crew

  in the dripping darkness willing
hands extricated bill danforth from
the trap of death he explained pro-
fusely and profanely how the damn-
hoboes had crowned him bound him
and put him in here for a ride and how
 my brakeman  had come in the nick
of time

   best damn brakeman that ever
swung a light that boy is he bragged
 why if it hadnt of been for him-
a red-faced hoghead nudged a
brassbound conductor a division su-
perintendent grinned knowingly a
confused brakeman flushed like a high
school kid with his first date

in the gathering twilight he sat with
betty danforth by a white cot in
the company hospital old bill with
injured legs encased in splint and
bandage picked nervously at the covers

  they talked about the five thousand
reward for the rattler and how close
the call had been that morning and
bill said again what a jewel  my
brakeman  was betty laid a hand on
terrys sleeve and turned glistening
eyes upon him

   i knew you were a good brake-
man she whispered

   yeah terry flushed

    sure i knew it the first time i laid
eyes on you thats why i wanted you
to take this job with-

  danforth quit picking at the covers
lifted himself to an elbow glowered
at his daughter then at terry

   what-whats that he screeched
 you wanted him to take-

  betty nodded  sure  you never
had had a good brakeman daddy

   yuh see mr danforth terry
explained  she didnt know i was a

  dispatcher billy gregg was no gridiron hero but
  he tried football tactics on the presidents special

by griff crawford

santa fe train dispatcher wellington kan author of  other stories in this magazine

illy gregg walked out
into the hall from the dis-
patchers office glad the
nights work was done it
seemed to him that railroads
always tried themselves in the hours
between midnight and eight oclock in
the morning

   and tonight he growled think-
ing of the hours to come on his next
trick  ill have the football special on
top of everything else

  that was a sore spot with billy-
football in his pocket at this very
minute was a perfectly good engage-
ment ring which had set him back close
to two hundred bucks it had been re-



turned to him by the fickle miss irene
apperson trainmasters stenographer
she had suddenly been smitten by one
 pug  winston who had made a few
touchdowns and the sport page with
his picture

   when you get your picture in the
paper bill-ee she had said  ill give
you another chance

  and billy gregg had almost sworn
openly he had checked himself in
time  if i could go down the field
with a half dozen yahoos hanging to
my hips and get my mug in the daily
disappointment along with prize bulls
premium dogs and the like id be a
whizz ye-ah


railroad stories

  ye-ah irene had echoed and
commenced rattling the typewriter and
billy had stomped out

   railroad man-nothing but a rail-
road man she was calling after him
mockingly

   damn railroads-and women he
muttered he went straight to mrs
mangums where he boarded and
started to his room

   you look like a funeral he
looked up to see marjorie phelps grin-
ning at him she was file clerk in the
supers office

   i feel like one he admitted

   oh i was just kidding billy
youd better hurry in to breakfast
mrs mangum has little pig sausages
and hot cakes

   not hungry he said as he bolted
upstairs a man couldnt have an ap-
petite when he had so many worries-
tough job old boggs the super ill as a
bear with a sore foot and always grip-
ing anyway to say nothing about the
two hundred bucks spent for a ring
with no finger to put it on

   damn football football specials
boggs railroads women and news-
paper pictures he repeated explo-
sively as he went to bed

billy had had no misconception
of the nights work ahead his
hands were full the district was
sizzling flocks of symbol trains head-
ing in both directions six passenger
schedules slated to meet on his stretch
of track and three of them reported
late drag freights belated locals and
forthcoming work trains mingled in the
mess that was going to make night
hideous

   if they owned any more engines
theyd have em all out here on this
cussed piece of track he declared to
danny holmes the branch dispatcher

across the table from him danny
grunted nodded sympathetically and
puffed his pipe it was old stuff to
him

   copy seven- billy was already
wishing he had four tracks instead of
the measly one

   engine  run extra he droned
out the order making his meeting points
with other traffic he was fixing the
returning football special now he
didnt know how the game came out
he didnt want to know he was tired
of the big splurge people were making
over pug winston irene would be
right by the big bruisers side of
course

  old danny heard the click that told
him another message had come up the
chute from the telegraph office he
wandered in slowly to get it

   pink he bawled billy heard out
of one ear he wondered what it could
be these pink messages carried the
most important rush wires handled on
the railroad

   holy jumpin catfish youre get-
tin the presidents special danny
yelled excitedly  listen its from
manson of the b  a

delivering you manville junction

  movement your lines chicago

  billy looked at the clock it was
 now the corners of his mouth
drew down a little he was wonder-
ing how he was going to move that hot
shot in and out through that mess of
trains without a serious delay

   ok danny he reached for the
button that would ring a bell in the
office at manville junction as he said
the words  get the roundhouse fore-
man quick he instructed the operator
who had answered the call promptly
 tell him i want an atlantic type hot

send a man down to the wye to pilot
their crew through our yards step
on it frank

  old danny listened to the fast
spoken instructions nodding his head
in approval billy might be young in
years but he had a mighty good head
he was doing just what danny
would have done if he had been in
charge of the district jim blake was
the ace engineer of the d  e the
ideal man for the job

  danny fully intended to do all the
chores about the office so billy gregg
would have nothing to do but handle
the situation but railroads have a
habit of doing the unexpected and
just at the time when danny would
have been very useful a bridge on one
of the branches took a notion to burn
from that instant the old man had a
problem of his own he was fighting
an individual battle which he couldnt
drop

 tndustrious men the words

  a were accompanied by a bit of
girlish laughter both looked up
marjorie phelps stood in the door be-
tween the chiefs office and the dis-
patchers den

   hello ive been getting caught up
on my files she explained

   marj were snowed under  billy
groaned  danny has a bridge burn-

ing ive got a heck of a railroad and a
hot shot coming up

   what can i do billy

   get long distance put in calls for
the agents at pemberton barclay and
titusville tell em to get to their
offices as quick as they can ive got to
get my mitts on some of those trains
out there in the dark

   engine  run extra manville
junction to pemberton with right over
all trains he had snapped into his
work again the president would be
on his railroad in a few minutes he
heard marjorie following his instruc-
tions capable girl he liked her
voice and that rosebud in her hair

   put jim blake on the phone he
instructed the operator when the order
had been completed  i want to talk to
him when he comes he kept up the
incessant grind of orders and instruc-
tions until the engineer came in on the
phone

  jim im up a tree billy ex-
plained  they dumped this high-
stepper on me unexpected im giving
you a clear shot to pemberton and ill
try to have another stretch clear by the
time you get there look out for high-
balls from the ops keep coming down
the main stem if you get em walk
the dog boy ill be handing em up as
fast as i can to keep you rolling in
high theres a mess down the pike
he was working in a sort of an aside
from himself his brain trying to grasp
a dozen different moves in a flash he
was concentrating on the order he was
sending but in the back of his head
others thrust themselves forward de-
manding attention he must keep
things safe-traffic moving

  something moved at his side he
looked up to see marjorie placing a
steaming pot of coffee on the table
she had slipped over to freds and got


railroad stories

it she poured one of the cups full
and sat it by his hand and gave the
other to old danny

   thanks marj how did you
know 

   marj is a humdinger old danny
barked  worth a dozen of these
flappers

   ill say billy agreed  engine
 run extra pemberton to laird
with rights over all trains he had
succeeded in opening another block of
track for the president

   just like a football game-real
football he was thinking  jim blake
lugging the ball and me furnishing the
interference he grinned at the
thought  jim will get credit for a
great run if i can keep him wheeling
me ill get hell from old boggs

  he saw dimly a form moving quietly
about the office it took tubes from the
chute sorted the wires poured fresh
coffee into the cups beat a tattoo on the
chiefs typewriter fought side by side
with him and old danny helped the in-
terference to function

   hey marj he called  its nearly
morning youve been up all night
you beat it for home

  todays sunday i dont have to
work today simple its fun billy
helping

   some girl billy said to himself
he had kept jim blake roaring
down the field without a slow-up a
strict book-of-rule official would have
frowned on blakes coming up the main
line on signals from operators here
but the engineer knew what the situa-
tion was and he knew billy gregg
thats why jim was the best engine-
man on the d  e hed always kick
in and play ball with a fellow

  in a few minutes the fight would be
over as soon as things cleared around
decatur the battle would be won from

that point on the track would be as
clear as a bell

and then a drag freight pulling into
- the siding derailed a pair of trucks
at the head-in switch the siding and
main line were both hopelessly blocked

   hand me the blueprint of decatur
marj he said he studied it a mo-
ment when she had placed it before
him

   listen he spoke to the waiting
operator  have the drag crew take
their engine and clear the cars from
the house and stock tracks shove
them on the passing track ahead of the
derailment double the eastbound
drag over on the main line throw the
switches onto the house track over the
cross-over connection to the stock track
to the main

  old danny gulped it was good
headwork-if nothing happened

   tell the boys to hurry theyll have
to work fast if we keep the rattler
moving

   the  is pretty heavy for those
light rails danny suggested

  if they go in the ditch ill be
canned danny but ill tell jim to take
it easy and nobody will be hurt he
placed a caution order to the special at
ames and instructed the crew as to
the move they might expect at decatur
he got it to them just in time to keep
blake wheeling then he turned his
attention to the situation at the derail-
ment  how they coming he in-
quired

   theyre rasslin em around the
operator advised

  he kept up a steady stream of in-
formation as the moves were being
made

   all clear he barked joyously
after awhile  the switches are lined
and here conies the rattlerj
interference



   close billy uttered the word
wearily as he looked at the girl and
danny the situation was out of his
hands now he had done all he could
do

  a sounder snapped once or twice and
was silent the pendulum of the big
standard clock swung slowly

   out on the main and gone i the
operator fairly shouted  put him by
at seven-fifty-nine

   ok kid thanks

  marjorie phelps had waited only
long enough to know the move had
been successful then she darted out
the door danny blinked a couple of
times shook his head and returned to
his side of the table the two relief
men came in the door billy got up

   youll need the big hook out at
decatur he explained to his successor
 pair of trucks across the main stem
hell of a night i

they stood at the station-billy
gregg and danny-as the special
wung around the curve the  was
a pretty sight in the reflection of the
morning sun as she swept along with
the private cars behind her jim blake
brought her to a stop at the depot as
softly as a butterfly lighting on a tulip
danny looked at his watch

   what time did they leave manville
junction he asked

   six-ten

   not bad-a hundred and thirty
miles and its just eight-seventeen

  a gang of newspapermen were hur-
rying down the platform and rushing
to the engine they wanted jim blakes
picture the engineer grinned and
stepped down beside the  then he
saw billy gregg

   wait a minute boys i carried
the ball but yonder is the fellow who
provided the interference hes the

dispatcher who made the run possible
the engineer explained in a fewr
words the difficulties under which his
run had been made

   nice work billy never saw
better it was boggs voice and billy
gulped this was the most unexpected
thing of all it was the first time such
a thing had ever occurred in the
memory of those who knew the super-
intendent billy had not known the
boss was riding the special

  he walked over to where the re-
porters beckoned him it was all a sort
of daze crazy-like the railroad had
been another train pulled in as the
special pulled out it was the football
special that billy had put on a siding
ten miles out to let the president by
one of the first passengers to alight
was pug winston he looked glum
and took a taxi without paying any at-
tention to the others a man passing
winked at boggs

   pug fumbled and lost the game
he grinned  the crowd razzed him
and hes sore

  irene apperson came along with
other sleepy rooters and barely nodded
as she passed somehow billy reached
the conclusion that she and pug might
have quarreled

marjorie phelps met him at

the door of the boarding house
 youre the tiredest looking man i
ever saw billy and no wonder now
the little pig sausages are excellent

   too tired to eat marj

   nonsense of course you want
breakfast toast anyway - and
coffee she bustled him into the din-
ing room

   funny he was thinking as he
later went to his room and to bed ive
always liked blondes best but ive be-
gun to see that brunettes are more

beautiful and social like his dreams
that day were confused in them irene
apperson insisted on reading- about
football heroes and thrusting pug
winstons picture in front of him while
marjorie phelps was toasting delicious
slices of bread to a crisp brown

there came a pounding at his door
 get up billy it was marjories
voice and she wras excited about some-
thing  hurry downstairs hurry
billy

  she met him in the hall

 there youre famous she
spread a paper before his eyes look-
ing up from the front page was an ex-
cellent likeness of jim blake and him-
self standing side by side and under the
picture was the word teamwork
the column below carried the story
of the run made by jim blake with the
presidents train and information on
how billy gregg dispatcher had made
it possible

  superintendent boggs had given the
technical points to the reporters with-
out stinting things it was good adver-
tising for boggs division - and the

d	 e

   thats a press association story
billy marjorie reminded him  itll
be spread all over the state im so
glad i always knew youd- she
stopped suddenly blushing furiously

   lets talk this over out on the porch
swing its-not so crowded out
there billy suggested an hour later
they were still discussing it and then
mrs mangums voice sounded from
the hall

  telephone mr gregg

  billy came in from the porch and an-
swered

   bill-ee the voice cooed  ive
just read the paper honey im so
proud of you honey-boy

 yeah

   you know that ring was always a
bit tight but i think it can be fixed

   its already fixed girlie

  youre always so thoughtful
dearie

   uh-huh you see i didnt want to
change the ring so i found a finger it
just fits-perfectly gbye

railroad stories

railroad movies

  the silver streak movie i saw recent-
ly remarks made by some of the film characters
sound like my story  old hell bender  sept
 which also had a train called the silver
streak in this picture the chief characters-
as in practically all railroad films-are officials
an old-time engineer fears the silver streaks
speed and the hero is a youth who believes that
juice is more potent than steam said youth is
in love with the presidents daughter its easy
to see why such photoplays arent popular with
railroad audiences they cater to the white-collar

class whereas rails want a picture which plays
up railroad men-e s dellinger  e

  why doesnt g l phillips tell the real reason
why so much goods is shipped by truck instead
of by rail other old rails will agree with me
that it always has been-and still is-the practice
of railroads to hold a train for more tonnage
regardless of what is already in the train or how
rushed it might be shippers all over have found
this out and consequently use the  truck route 
for the best service if the railroads would get
rid of tonnage-mad officials and run their freight
trains to give the best of service they wouldnt
have to worry about truck competition-paul

  regarding g l phillips articles on trucks
and busses when trolley cars replaced horse cars
the companies had to pave all streets over which
they ran and keep them in repair why not
compel the trucks and busses to construct their
own right-of-way or else charge them a license
fee sufficient to pay for highways they use-e

english fans heard from

 every railway tale

was just unadulterated
tripe written by some-
one who once bought a
railway ticket and
thinks he has a railway
background so i was
skeptical when i bought

stuff i was surprised to read of an american
locomotive boiler explosion such a thing is al-
most unheard-of in england there has been just
one case since the war an l m s -- type
blew up at buxton due to the safety valves being
ground too fine when heated they bit into the
seatings and refused to budge

 a fine performance was made on the great
western ry here with a -- type having  in
drivers and weighing about  tons she covered
 miles london to birmingham in  hours with
a train of  bogie coaches averaging  tons each
maximum speed was  mph it took a superb
engine and first-class men to set this record in
the future whatever may take the place of steam
will never gain as much place in our affection as
our old locos keep printing stories about them

run by the milwaukee on

railroad slang

  you print too many stories not enough rail-
road lore your covers are gaudy and cheap
the  famous engineers  series and the old prints
showing wrecks etc are just plain junk elimi-
nate slang it is disgusting possibly railroad men
spoke that way  years ago but today they have
sense enough to call ah engine an  engine-
harry l wynn author of  build an engine
model for c  th st lewisburg pa

	 

  real railroad men are not the swearing slang-
throwing kind that most of your authors portray
instead theyre usually men of character with the
usual human weakness such as those depicted by
frank l packard for that reason packard is
my favorite author-garland peterson  w

                      a question is fre-
quently asked  why
cant steam locomotives
attain the high speed of
diesel electrics the
answer is back pressure
on the pistons getting
expended steam out of
the cylinders is an even
greater problem than get-
ting live steam into them
the speed at which a modern locomotive will run
on paper and in actual practice will always provide
endless argument for the speed enthusiasts the
fact remains that a critical point is reached in the
operation of the steam engine when it is impos-
sible to make the steam travel through the full
cycle of its operations from the boiler through
the valves into and out of the cylinders through
the exhaust nozzle and out of the stack at a
greater rate than a certain maximum speed ex-
periments with double exhaust tips wider smoke-
stacks and improved front ends have gradually
raised this critical point and speeds of  mph
are now commonplace

 spanish river

t query from l j ander-
son  this was one of the
worst wrecks in canadian
railroading  killed
many injured it occurred
jan   at nairn
centre ont where the

crosses the spanish river
j miles west of sud-
bury train no  west-
bound montreal to sault ste marie was in
charge of engineer harry trelford and conductor
tom reynolds she was on time running at
normal speed which in those days was about 
mph approaching spanish river bridge the
train suddenly broke in two behind the baggage
car the second-class passenger coach plunged down
to the rivers edge the first class coach shot by into
the cold river while the diner slid down on its
side with the forward end submerged and the
sleeper just behind the engine mail and express
car and baggage car went oh over the bridge and
stopped just past the west abutment

  only one person in the first-class coach was
saved-a man who lay for  hours clinging to
the top of a lamp with about  inches of air
space between the water and the car roof if
this incident were mentioned in a fiction story
some of you critics wouldnt believe it

  conductor reynolds who was in the diner was
the hero of the wreck after being thrown to
the forward end of the car under water reynolds
broke the windows and crawled out coming up
on the spot



another important point frequently overlooked
is the problem of lubrication pistons and valve
mechanism are moving with extreme rapidity as
the speed of a steam locomotive passes the 
mark and any failure of the oil supply would soon
result in disaster locomotive engineers have had
unpleasant experiences along these lines however
the problem of lubrication is gradually being over-
come and the steam locomotive is a long way
from being backed out of the picture by the diesel
engine-wm j parry engineer canadian na-
tional rys  chatham st e windsor ont

	 

about  years ago when i was firing on
n y central they had several inspection engines
such as the one pictured in your feb issue as
nearly as i can remember they were the  niaga-
ra  ontario  mohawk  catskill  and
hudson they had  or  in cylinders 
lbs steam pressure and were the only engines
equipped with electric headlights in those days
it was thought that engine crews could not see
block signal colors plainly because electric head-
lights were so bright officials would ride in front
end of the cab just over the running board and

abandoned pikes

curves were so sharp that at almost every one
the air or train line would come apart stopping
the train on a mountain side as we looked
down the deep canyon it seemed miles to the san
joaquin river after a stop the crew would
drop down the mountain couple up the train and
start the climb once more if we were lucky we
made it but usually we had to repeat this process
many times before we finally reached big creek
the longest train i ever saw used on the up-
grade had  frt cars and crummy passenger
trains usually had only  coaches and took 
hours to climb the mountain last august on

build a
model
wedge

 by leonard cooper

model by g a vaughan  th st college point n y

cj very outdoor model railroad should
have a snow plow mine was made at
very low cost when put in front of rny
mallet compound photo in feb  is-
sue this  inch scale wedge plow does
real business in  or  inches of snow such
a model can be created as follows

  first make wheels for the trucks get
a piece of old  inch shafting place it in
a lathe and hacksaw off  disks  inch
thick i said  hacksaw  because with
the lathe running it saves time and
material drill a  inch hole in the
center of each disk and press onto axles
that have been previously made up from
y inch steel rod and turned down to 
inch where the wheel goes on if the fit
is too tight bending of the axle will re-
sult to overcome this a loose fit can be
made tinning the joints and sweating
will produce a nice job the axle should
project through the wheel about  inch for
the purpose making the journal later

  next place a pair of these blank wheels
in the lathe holding one wheel in the
chuck use the steady-rest just back of the
other wheel anyone familiar with car
wheels can now grind a tool to face off the
blank wheel tread and the outer side then
turn the journals to size reverse and re-
peat after all wheels have been finished
in this way remove the steady-rest hold
the wheels in the chuck by the tread next
to the flange and finish the back side in
like manner of course wheels can be
bought from a model supply house which

fig 

 fig-

would save a lot of trouble but i am one
of those fans who prefer to make their
own

  now build the rest of the truck get
some  gage sheet-iron from this cut out
as shown in fig  and bend along dotted
lines make two forms out of material 
inch thick as shown in fig  by clamp-
ing into a vise one plate on each side
along the dotted line of part indicated in
fig  it is easy to hammer the edges to
shape

  mark out as shown and cut the open-
ings for your journal boxes the finished
product will look somewhat like fig 
cut another piece as shown in fig  bend
along the dotted lines and fasten by rivet-
ing crosswise underneath fig  as shown
in fig  make the journal boxes square


railroad stories

and the openings in the truck oblong in
order to make room for springs above cut
off heads of no  round-head screws leav-
ing just enough of the screw for the spring
to slip over the slot in the screw will fit
nicely on the upper part of the slot in
the truck side

  no dimensions are given here my main
intention is to show you how easy it is to
shape metal and make different parts
moreover each model railroader has his
own idea as to the size he prefers it
would be easy to work out dimensions for
any size model mine are all  inch scale
for smaller ones use sheet-iron lighter than
what i have mentioned

  this truck can be used on almost any
kind of rolling stock journal boxes should
be made of brass or a form can be made
and cast them of babbitt next build a
regular flat-car body leaving off the coupler
arrangement on one end

  make the beams etc for underneath the
same as those in real cars they can be
shaped easily over iron bars or forms which
were first made to size the rest of the
car except the plow end is constructed
similar to a box car with the addition of
a couple of windows and a cupola on top
near the rear

  to make the plow end first cut pieces
out of cardboard curve and shape them
then cut them out of sheet iron bend and
fasten on they can be made in two pieces
and arranged either to plow both ways or
to throw the snow to the right as for dou-
ble-tracked lines the latter however is
more likely to jump the track some ar-
rangement can be made for flangers if one
desires to clean the rail more closely i
will be glad to answer specific questions on
this subject for any reader sending a self-
addressed stamped envelope to my home at
