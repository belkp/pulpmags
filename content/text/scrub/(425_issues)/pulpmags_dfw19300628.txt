diamond death

              in the room of the crucible a terrible fate
              awaits professor wheatland maker of gems

                                          wished to see

lieutenant williams head a man in a linen smock rose from
of the citys murder squad fol- an easy chair before a table and came
lowed the sedate butler down a forward with outstretched hand he

diamond death



height but his keen eyes under bushy
brows gave the lie to his dull large
featured face

  professor wheatland smiled
the lieutenant  i am very much inter-
ested to see your workshop but im
rather curious to know what you can
want with me

  for a moment wheatland scientist
and society man looked gravely and
appraisingly at the tall lithe figure of
the young lieutenant he was satisfied
with what he saw since it amply lived
up to the reputation the officer had
built for himself in the past five years
and with a smile he motioned to a
chair

   i sent for you lieutenant because
i am about to be murdered he said
flatly

  what williams gazing with in-
terest about the curious room brought
his gaze back to the professors face
with a start

  wheatland nodded

  yes it is quite a serious matter
but fipst of all i must show you this
room then you may understand
better of course you have heard of
my ability to manufacture diamonds
yes said the lieutenant looking
frankly incredulous and i must con-
fess that with the rest of the city i
dont believe you can

  the professor smiled fleetingly

   look at this room he requested
 that door you came in by is positive-
ly the only opening it -has no other
doors and no windows here i work
in absolute secrecy i have to as my
invention would be worth millions to
many industries you realize what it
will mean if i make diamonds in this
crucible

  he motioned toward a stand near a
huge electric furnace

  williams nodded

  yeah if you can make them he
said  but no man can make a real
diamond professor dont try to
hand me that

   i expect that attitude naturally
said the professor patiently  but i
have already demonstrated to the
heads of various jewel industries
that i can make diamonds in that fur-
nace they have seen me do it the
diamond powers are growing fright-
ened and well they may but it is not
to show you how i make diamonds
that i asked you to come here first
of all i wish you to examine to your
own satisfaction this room convince
yourself that there is no way out of it
save through the door by which you
just entered

  with growing interest despite his
incredulity williams rose and walked
about the oval room tapping the white
painted walls and pausing to carefully
examine the electric furnace

   the dopr is locked by a combina-
tion only my wife and myself know
went on the professor  and i have
been most careful to let my wife know
this combination examine the lock if
you please

  williams did so wondering if what
the papers said about the scientist was
not true and if he were not just a bit
gone in the head

   this said the professor scrib-
bling on a paper and handing it to the
astounded officer of the law  is the
combination memorize it if you
please

  the lieutenant having read the
paper the professor immediately
burned it in a small dish on the table

   in this room to-night lieutenant
he resumed  i demonstrate to a few
friends a reporter and the head of a
famous diamond mining company an
expert that i can mix my ingredients


detective fiction weekly

in this crucible and put the crucible in
that furnace and in a short time take
from the crucible a handful of
genuine diamonds i am giving a little
dinner party first but it is not with
that i am interested in this room be-
fore this select little group leaves it
after my demonstration i shall be
killed 

  the lieutenants disgusted face
flushed a little

   how can you possibly know that 
he demanded

   i have been told over the telephone
and by notes left at my door and dis-
covered in the morning by jock the
butler the notes will be of no help to
the police and i have not saved them
they have all been alike worded the
same and composed of printed words
cut from newspapers and stuck on a
bit of wrapping paper there has never
been any envelope

   i should have liked to see them
however said the lieutenant im-
patiently  they might have told us
more than they told you we have
some rather good men at head-
quarters

   the notes all told me to stop this
diamond faking as they called it or i
would die went on the professor not
heeding the lieutenants remark  this
morning after the papers had an-
nounced the demonstration that is to
take place here to-night i received the
final note in which i was told that if
i tried to interest this diamond expert
to-night in my trickery i would not
leave this room alive you have ex-
amined the room

yes said the lieutenant briefly
the professor leaned forward tensely
 there will be few guests here he
said very low his keen eyes on the
young officers  i will give you a list
of them the man who has been writ-

ing me these notes is in love with my
wife as well as desirous of possessing
himself of my priceless formula for
making these gems

   but then said the lieutenant a
bit disgustedly  you know the man

    i do not said the professor lean-
ing back again  that is just it i do
not caresse my wife is most tactful
she is a very clever woman yet i
know that she loves some man and that
they are both plotting to get rid of me
and to get their hands on the formula

  but if you are killed here in a
sealed room and some time afterward
one of the men who were present starts
to manufacture diamonds how will he
escape discovery asked williams

    that is exactly what will happen
said the professor you do not
properly estimate the brains of my
enemy my wife would never care for
a stupid man i have lost her because i
dabbled too much in this room but
who would not with such a fortune as
this at stake do you realize what it
means to make diamonds

   yeah grinned the lieutenant
but i dont believe you can do it no
youd never get by with that pro-
fessor

    i sent for you to ask if you or one
of the best men you have in your de-
partment will come to my dinner to-
night said the professor coolly  
am accustomed to laughter sneers in-
credulity i ask only to prove what i
can do people must believe their eyes
also  want the protection of the
police i am to die to-night lieutenant
and my work is not finished all that
i ask is that the man who kills me
never dares use what my brain has dis-
covered this will not be like a crime
out in the crowded world you have
convinced yourself that the only exit
from this room is by that door and
diamond death



that only myself my wife and you
possess the combination

  but if your wife lias it and loves
this man she can give it to him said
the lieutenant

  yes that is why i told her
chuckled wheatland if she lets him
use it to come in or out he is identified
jock looks like a meek person but he
is an ex-pugilist and lie shoots from the
hip when i am not in here all night
jock is until i finance my vast ven-
ture we take  chances i told my
wife that combination to trap her and
the man she loves but she is far too
clever to use it you have not met
caresse

  surely thought the lieutenant the
man was a little mad but for a mo-
ment the wild idea occurred to him
that possibly the fellow could make a
diamond for weeks the papers had
been giving him a lot of publicity and
his several demonstrations before all
sorts of men had been most successful
but no hard-boiled police lieutenant
could swallow that stuff the chap
was a crook despite his reputation and
his social position

chapter ii

the ghost violin

 tvthat is it you wish me to do
yy if i attend your dinner to-
night professor asked the
lieutenant after a moment during
which he sat studying the room

  nothing said wheatland grimly
just come and watch and wait there
will be plenty for you to do after
dinner we come in here all of us for
the demonstration i lock the door
with the combination only you my
wife and i myself know if caresse
has told this man she loves he will not
dare to use it lest he brand himself

   give me the list of your guests
said the lieutenant interested in spite
of his incredulity conscious of a thrill
that was not entirely pleasant some-
thing seemed to warn him that he was
standing on the threshold of danger

  drawing a bit of paper toward him
the professor wrote rapidly a list of
names and addresses

   linda price my wifes oldest
friend he told williams touching the
first name with his pencil tip  a
charming girl runs a fashionable tea
shop not because she has to but be-
cause she must be busy she and
caresse will be the only women present
it is the men who interest me you
see without the diamond expert whom
we may except since i have only met
him once and caresse not at all there
are four i am not eliminating from
this list young frisby the reporter on
the news caresse went to school with
him although we do not see much of
him then there is philip farren my
lawyer will clinton the chemist and
eddie harmer who lives on his
money one of these men lieutenant
is coming here to-night to put a finish
to me to make it possible for himself
to win my wife and to take the
formula of this formula there is only
one copy any one would think that i
would naturally have another in a safe
deposit box or- some place as secure
but no if i die my wife is not to have
this formula no one is my secret
of manufacturing diamonds dies with
me caresse and her lover will not
benefit by the fruits of my brain after
they have rendered me powerless

  the lieutenant put the list of guests
slowly into his pocket he seemed un-
decided about something

   do you mean to tell me he asked
 that your wife is in the plot to mur-
der you 


detective fiction weekly

  the professors face twisted grimly
 i think that if i am killed caresse
will know by whom and why he said
deliberately  i wanted you to knowt
that her beauty and charm are quite
unusual there is something magnetic
and potent about her personality you
will not believe that she can be capable
of deception but if i am murdered
to-night i have given you the motive
remember that that is more than you
often get lieutenant before a crime
has been committed

   but what makes you think that
your wife is in love or that she is aware
of these warning notes asked
williams

   i know my wife said the pro-
fessor grimly  and you do not and
you never will dont flatter yourself
that you ever will no matter what
comes out of all this but she cannot
fool me

  lieutenant williams who had solved
many strange cases and was accus-
tomed to many weird stories simply
stared at the professor he could not
imagine a man who knew that his end
was near acting as he was acting

   the formula went on the pro-
fessor calmly  is typed upon a small
square of paper it is secreted in this
room not even jock knows where it
is if i am killed not even caresse
frantically searching will find it

  the lieutenants face showed varying
emotions he did not believe the pro-
fessor quite sane and yet if the man
could not make the diamonds in that
absurd crucible he must have a pretty
store of the gems somewhere about
and what was his game nothing
could make young williams believe
that any man could manufacture
genuine diamonds

  and this murder stuff-

  in any ordinary case he would have

given any one who told him such a
yarn the laugh long since but professor
wheatland was different if he called
on the police for help he must be given
help he could not afford to forget
the coming dinner party and laugh it
off and then have a hurry call come in
to headquarters during the evening
from the wheatland mansion but it
was something new to the head of the
murder squad to be summoned to the
scene of crime before the crime had
taken place and that by the victim him-
self no he would not dare pass
this up

   you have no idea in what manner
this criminal will approach you pro-
fessor he asked as he rose

   not the slightest

   very well said the lieutenant
with sudden decision  i will attend
your dinner to-night professor and
study your guests with interest you
may be sure if anything happens to
you you can be certain too that we will
get the man no matter how clever he
has been are you armed 

   it would be of no use said
wheatland with a strange smile  a
gun would do me no good against this
danger i somehow know but if you
advise it i will carry one

   i certainly do advise it said the
lieutenant with sharp s u s p i c i o n
 there is nothing quite so comforting
as an automatic in ones pocket

  as he spoke he swung upon the pro-
fessor with a start a very unpleasant
sensation creeping up his spine for
in the air about them inside that close
cell-like apartment there was growing
the sound of a violin a magnificent
violin and the thing it played was
chopins  funeral march 

   great scott cried w i  i a m s
 what is that

  the professor had grown rather
diamond death



ghastly he wiped his damp forehead
and tried to smile

   i didnt want to tell you about
that he said in a shaking voice  i
hear it all the time it-more than the
notes-has me rather rattled every
now and then that cursed violin plays
that depressing thing youve no idea
how it affects one

   but your wife-she plays asked
williams rather bewildered

   not at all caresse is not musical
we have no radio and no musical in-
strument of any sort in the house this
is the ninth or tenth time i have heard
the thing at night it is hideous when
i am down here alone

  the sound of the violin was dying
out exquisitely played it was grow-
ing fainter and even as the lieutenant
using the combination he remembered
wrenched open the door it ceased

  the softly carpeted corridor stretched
away in both directions entirely empty
there were no doors near the pro-
fessors workroom

   you have looked for this violin
he asked the professor as he returned
to the room

   certainly said wheatland still
mopping his brow  i have done all
that mortal man can to solve its mys-
tery of course it is a human agency
and it is not the thought of ghosts
which upsets me lieutenant it is the
thought of my own death with my
work unaccomplished and my wife
and her lover triumphing

was a triumph of paneling and
tapestries was weighed down with sil-

straight down the middle of it candle-
light shed a soft glow over the womens
gowns the mens white shirt fronts
the silently moving figures of the two
men serving the pugilistic jock and an-
other man whom lieutenant williams
did not know a breath of flowers
drifted in from the gardens through
the open french windows

  at the head of the table sat caresse
wheatland a girl whom the lieutenant
instantly found it difficult to describe
she was a flame a flash a vivid dash
of exotic color a lovely flare of some-
thing unbelievably e x q u i s i t e-but
definitely dangerous auburn-haired
and brown-eyed slim as a rapier with
a delicious curving mouth and a
naturally perfect skin she would domi-
nate any gathering for behind her ar-
resting beauty was plenty of brains
williams could see why the professor
might fancy her in love with some
other man even plotting with the
other man to free herself she was
nothing that could ever be held long by
one person-as uncertain as quick-
silver

  had it not been for the music of that
weird violin down in the strange room
where the professor worked the blase
young police lieutenant would not have
believed any of the professors story
the man might be a genius but he
seemed a trifle cracked but he could
not forget that violin if it could be ex-
plained by something logical as of
course it could it at any rate spelled
danger for the professor

  again and again the lieutenants
puzzled eyes came back from a study
of the guests to that exotic young
hostess an emerald-studded cigarette
holder between her rouged lips what
material she would make for the press
if she ever got herself into a mixup
	detective fiction weekly

and then naturally his eyes went to
the reporter fred frisby who sat on
mrs wheatlands right and absorbed
a good deal of her attention frisby
was a sandy-haired young man with a
likeable face and a store of good dinner
yarns

  next to frisby sat saleworth the
d i a m o n d expert a gray-hairecl
youngish man with a slow voice and a
droll wit the lieutenant did not pay
much attention to him then came
linda price a fair-haired dimpled
young woman who wore many dia-
monds and laughed at everything any
one said

  phil farren the lawyer sat beside
linda he was a type one passes on the
street every day medium height me-
dium color medium brains williams
decided though he could not be too
sure he must not make a mistake about
these people for if that crazy pro-
fessor was right a clever crime was
hatching about that magnificent dinner
table boy what news it would make
and what a case for his office

  next to farren sat the host and
next to him the chemist will clinton
stout and rather red-faced and pos-
sessed of a jovial laugh clinton did
not seem the type to make the brilliant
successes he had made in his line
which went to show thought williams
grimly that one must not be too swift
to judge and certainly not in his work

  he himself sat beside clinton and
next to him came eddie harmer the
idle millionaire harmer wasyoung as
young as the lovely hostess and his
wavy dark hair dark eyes and swarthy
skin coupled with a good figure and
perfect grooming made him very at-
tractive caresse seemed to think so
for when she could tear herself from
frisby she turned instantly to harmer
to the exclusion of the rest of the table

avhich she left to linda price and her
husband

  if any of those well bred people
felt uncomfortable to have a police
lieutenant seated at that exclusive
board with them they gave no evi-
dence of it perhaps they were accus-
tomed to the eccentricities of the host
although his presence thought wil-
liams must cause the man who was
contemplating a crime some uneasi-
ness

  the dinner moved along smoothly
enough until the frozen dessert was
passed and then with no warning
whatever the host rose cleared his
throat and stood at the end of the table
facing his radiant young wife until si-
lence gradually fell and every one
looked at him

   before we go down to my work-
room said the professor in a pleas-
antly clear voice  i wish to say a few
words to the man who has come here
to-night to murder me

  caresse gave a gasp and her face
flushed with lovely warm color

   archie she said sharply  dont
be such an utter fool

   my dear wheatland bowed cour-
teously  i dont care to be interrupted
if you please there is a man at this
table who has come here this evening
to murder me i repeat he-has sent
me notes telling me so for the past
weeks he does not wish me to demon-
strate this evening my marvelous
ability to make genuine diamonds pie
wishes to be able to do that himself
my dear caresse after he has stolen
my precious formula and married
you

  my dear fellow gasped farren
horrified while protests arose from
about the table

  the lieutenant sat in grim silence
watching the shocked face upon which
diamond death



the candlelight danced strangely it
was not his job to interfere-yet his
feelings were anything but enviable
he realized that he was in a position
no police lieutenant had probably ever
been placed in and he studied the men
about that table with keen anxious
eyes they were on the verge of a
great crime a mysterious crime he
was being told so to-morrow it might
sprawl across the pages of the press
to-night he broke bread with the mur-
derer and knew not who he was his
hands were tied until the crime was
committed it was hideous

  the professors face was quite quiet
as he looked about the table his eyes
did not linger longer on one face than
on another

  and then before he could go on with
his ghastly remarks the faint sound of
a violin playing the funeral march
drifted in from the hall or the garden
-it was hard to say which

  linda price screamed thinly and laid
her jeweled hand over her mouth

   what on earth is that  she
gasped  archie wheatland i dont
think this is funny make him stop
caresse

  lieutenant williams was frowning
his keen eyes never ceased their trip
about the table studying one face after
another but he could not pick up one
guilty expression

  the playing of the violin came
closer came apparently to the very
door of the handsome dining room and
stopped there its mournful strains fill-
ing the silent room

  then caresse wheatland sprang to
her feet

  archie if this is more of your
trickery stop it at once she cried
it is horrible none of us are
amused stop it i say

  down the length of the flower-

decked table the eyes of husband and
wife locked

   my dear said the professor slow-
ly  you know i speak the truth as
for the violin playing-i have not its
secret somebody explain it please
the man who has murder in his heart
can do so i know

  but for a moment while still the
strains of the funeral march magnifi-
cently played possessed the air no one
said a word and then frisby gave a
strained laugh

   professor this is great stuff for
the front page he said ill work
this up in my account of the demon-
stration to-night very clever and
amusing

   i have nothing to do with it said
wheatland sternly  the lieutenant
knows i have not he heard that
violin to-day while down in my work-
room with me i can assure you there
is no radio in the house or any other
contraption which would explain it

  i heard it yes said williams then
quietly  but i cant say that the pro-
fessor had nothing to do with it i
simply could not understand how he
could have

  the music abruptly ceased

  the professor and his young wife
were still standing staring antagonisti-
cally at each other

   archie you will take back what
you said about me said the girl then
through tight scarlet lips  as for the
idea of some one here wishing to mur-
der you that is like some of your other
crazy notions i dont care about that
but the part about me about some man
loving me-that you must deny and
at once

   i am sorry said the professor
bowing ironically  but it is the truth
i know it and you know it in an
hour or so all the world will know it


detective fiction weekly

and i wish to add now that the man
who leaves the workroom below stairs
after the crime will brand himself as
the criminal and my wifes lover if
he takes the formula or tries later on
to manufacture diamonds he will
brand himself i have told lieutenant
williams the entire case what i know
of it but i do not believe this fright-
ens the man who has determined to
end my life he has a splendid defiance
which appeals to caresse he is clever
and fearless  believe that is all let
us go now and have the demonstra-
tion

  but the diamond expert was on his
feet protesting with a white face

  no professor if you have any
such mad idea in your head i must
refuse to permit you to take the
chance he said  we will have no
demonstration to-night

   to-night as well as any other time
my dear saleworth replied the pro-
fessor smiling  i do not intend to
give up trying to prove to the world
that i can make diamonds this is
the result of years of labor on my part
i insist upon going on with the matter
and at once

   but you make us all so frightfully
uncomfortable said the lawyer far-
ren  great scott i feel as though i
am a criminal myself

   and perhaps you are my dear
farren smiled the professor grimly
 i do not know but the lieutenant
will find out

   id go home after that phil said
linda price indignantly  i wouldnt
stay for the silly old demonstration
let us all go home

   the man who makes that move
will be rather unfortunate said the
professor mildly

   you are right spoke clinton then
 wre must stay i for one would not

think of leaving if anything so hor-
rible as an attempt upon the profes-
sors life actually does take place i
want to be present after this speech of
his and that violin stuff rather has
me going

   quite so joined in harmer who
had grown rather white  of course
we cannot any of us leave now buck
up linda weve all got to see it
through

   this man one of you feels quite
safe said the professor looking about
the table  he has carefully thought
out this thing he feels he can defy
the police he is not afraid even
though the famous lieutenant wil-
liams who has many successes behind
him is seated at the table with him
come let us go and get the thing over
with

chapter iv
in the crucible room

caresse wheatland stood
for a moment at the head of the
table her radiant head held high
but the lieutenant watching her
thought he saw death in her eyes and
why not it was the death perhaps
of her love if the professor had spoken
truth in giving herself to the man
she cared for after the death of her
husband she signed his warrant she
branded him as a murderer marriage
to caresse wheatland would have been
a confession after that scene at the
dinner table provided the professor
was murdered

  and as the little party left the dining
room and walked in silence down the
stairs and along the softly carpeted
corridor to the apartment that held the
crucible and the furnace the lieutenant
could not help thinking of a march to
the electric chair what were they go-
diamond death



ing to and how would he and his office
be able to cope with it was the pro-
fessor right or insane with jealousy
could he actually make a genuine dia-
mond or was he a fake a crook
williams could not decide

  but as he had several times before
this brought out a handful of genuine
diamonds from his crucible and as he
would probably bring out some more
that night no matter how he did it
there must be to the lieutenants way
of thinking a store of diamonds in
the house in all likelihood in that
queer workroom suppose the criminal
knew that knew the hiding place of
the gems but his plans must have
been horribly upset by that dinner table
speech of the professors by the pres-
ence of lieutenant williams

  the professor stepping ahead of the
others unlocked the door with its
secret combination then standing to
one side with a courteous gesture he
invited them into the room

  switching on the light bv the door
the professor snapped the door shut
with a meaning look at the lieutenant
and williams knew that only the pro-
fessor caresse and himself knew how
to get out of that room and sne other
the murderer-if the woman he loved
had told him

  in the lieutenants opinion the pro-
fessor well deserved to die for any-
thing more diabolical than the trap he
had set for his lovely wife and her
lover he could not imagine it must
have fanned into wild hatred the feel-
ing already smoldering in the killers
heart and no woman could ever live
happily with wheatland the lieuten-
ant was inclined to sympathize with
caresse although he was on the alert
to pick up anything that might help
him if the prophesied crime really took
place

  the professor motioned them to
chairs and removed his coat and turned
up the sleeves of his dinner shirt roll-
ing them to his shoulder

   saleworth you are at liberty to
watch me mix my ingredients he
nodded to the diamond expert who
was watching him uneasily

   i again ask you not to try this to-
night professor said saleworth
earnestly  you have made me most
uncomfortable

   to-night as well as any other
time said wheatland with a twisted
smile  but one more word the
door by which you all came in is the
only exit from this room there are
no windows the door is locked by
a combination only myself my wife
and lieutenant williams know ca-
resse may have told the man who is
going to murder me i do not know
but he will not make use of the knowl-
edge-now

  as he said this the professor turned
a devilish grin upon the horrified faces
about him picking up the crucible he
passed it to the lieutenant

   every one kindly examine this
most carefully he instructed

  in silence the container was passed
from hand to hand

  the professor in silence too care-
fully watched by saleworth mixed the
ingredients which he told them would
form in the terrifically hot furnace a
small collection of genuine diamonds
and gathered about the table the little
group examined the mixture before it
was placed in the crucible

   i have only one formula said the
professor as he placed the crucible in
the furnace  that is in this room
i do not need any for the trick is en-
graved upon my mind so long i have
labored at the thing this formula is
carefully hidden but i think the mur-


detective fiction weekly

derer can find it he thinks he can
it is for this secret he will kill me as
much as to win my wife but now he
will have to take great care and skill
in using it else he will be sent to the
chair

   let us out of this hideous room
gasped linda price  i cannot stand
this any longer caresse poor darling
how do you endure it the man is
mad

   perhaps that is why i endure it
said caresse with a strange smile
 he is mad linda he can no more
make a diamond than i can

  the lieutenant believed her and in
watching closely the movements of the
professor he had forgotten for the
time the impending tragedy for the
life of him he could not discover how
he worked the trick but of course no
diamonds were in that crucible at the
moment how the diamonds would
get into it wras what interested
williams

chapter v

eight diamonds 

 tvte will have a wait of about a
vy half hour or a trifle more
announced the professor
turning from the furnace  lieutenant
i will be grateful if you will stand be-
side the light switch i do not intend
to have my demonstration stopped be-
fore i show to mr salevvorth the
diamonds which i shall take from the
crucible

  with folded arms williams took up
his stand beside the door where a
button controlled the powerful lamp
which was set in the snowy ceiling
and which lighted the small apartment
with a trying white glare his eyes
wandered from face to face every
one was grave and a bit shocked un-

easy and just a little disgusted as was
to be expected but even with all his
experience he could not decide what
man had murder in his heart or the
weapon upon him which would cause
the death of the professor anti at that
last thought he had an inspiration

   professor since you are so set
upon the idea that some one here is
going to kill you he said pleasantly
 suppose i search the gentlemen for
a weapon if you are right and we
find one it may help us vastly later
on

  a good idea said the professor
looking grimly about the circle  does
every one agree to this

  a chorus of vehement voices replied
apparently every one insisted upon
the search and the lieutenants face
grew rueful he was getting the idea
that caresse was right and they dealt
with a madman

   i did not follow your advice
lieutenant smiled wheatland i
have no gun upon me i thought it un-
wise to bring one here

   i will search caresse and she must
search me said miss price in a high
indignant voice  women can kill as
well as men

  the search however brought to
light no weapon of any sort

   my dear professor said the
lieutenant  there is nothing here
which can end your life not even any
poison nor a hypodermic syringe i
see nothing on your tables that can be
used for such a purpose in what
fashion do you expect to be killed by
one of your guests

   i have no idea said the professor
looking about the silent circle  but a
man about to die cannot be fooled
the way will be found i only ask this
person to wait until i empty this
crucible
diamond death



   i shall faint if i do not get out of
this dreadful room cried linda
price hysterically

   put up with it advised clinton
gravely archie is just a bit off his
head

  ill say he is flared eddie har-
mer  i never heard of anything so
utterly ridiculous we all know each
other but what mr saleworth and
the lieutenant think of us must be
plenty

   we have as yet no reason to think
anything wrong said saleworth
gently

  silence then fell rather sullenly
upon the strange little room the fur-
nace grew hotter and hotter the
professor leaned with his bare arms
folded against the table edge and
stared moodily at the fire

   can a fellow smoke  should like
to know  asked clinton then with a
nervous laugh producing a cigarette
case

   if you like nodded the professor

  silence again the professor looked
frequently at his wrist watch the ten-
sion grew and the group shifted feet
uneasily the thought of the locked
door was not so good if the professor
really was mad as most of them must
have believed him to be but the recol-
lection that caresse and the police
lieutenant knew the combination was
comforting they could at least get
out no matter what happened

  at last without a word the profes-
sor stepped forward and with sale-
worth watching him closely took the
crucible from the furnace

   this must cool he said with a
glance about at the excited faces

  it seemed like a nightmare to the
lieutenant a man making genuine
diamonds before his eyes he would
never believe that if the professor

took diamonds from that crucible then
he put them there with some sleight of
hand no one saw he was just a clever
crook but what did this murder talk
mean and the sound of that invisible
violin

  saleworth himself opened the cru-
cible when the time came eight ex-
quisite diamonds rolled out into his
palm

   i insist that you take these gems
and have them examined said the
professor quietly to your own satis-
faction

chapter vi

when the light went out

  by jove they look like the real
thing said saleworth bending
over the stones puzzled and
anxious

   you can easily prove that said
the professor i am most grateful to
the murderer for permitting me to con-
vince mr saleworth of the genuine-
ness of my discovery

  as he spoke the great glaring light
in the ceiling went out and the small
rather horrible room was plunged into
darkness there was a choking gasp
from some one and a scream from
linda price

  even as lieutenant williams put
out his hand to the switch the sound of
that weird violin playing the funeral
march seemed to fill the room it was
dreadful beyond words that instant of
darkness with the wailing violin notes
close to them all exactly as though
one of them was playing

  when the light came again the violin
ceased and the lieutenant stood look-
ing down grimly at the body of the
professor on the floor at their feet a
red stain widening on his white shirt
front


detective fiction weekly

  the criminal had chosen ihe only
moment when such a thing could pos-
sibly happen that brief space of time
when every one was held entranced by
the glittering stones saleworth had
taken from the crucible even the
lieutenant scoff as he did convinced
as he was of the professors expert
trickery had for an instant been intent
upon the gems and in that instant the
murderer had struck

  but that hideous violin

   lie is dead said clinton who
was kneeling by the professor  great
heaven he told the truth one of
us has killed him

  what with asked the lieutenant
stooping to the body  i carefully
went over this room and every one of
you what is this

  from the breast of the professor he
drew a short gleaming dagger its
handle set with precious stones

  linda price screamed again and put
her hand to her wealth of blond hair

  oh-oh it is mine she cried i
wore it in my hair i havetwo of them

	always wear one in the evening they
were my mothers oh-oh do you
think i killed him

   for crying out loud said the
lieutenant staring in disgust at the
pretty blonde  how the heck did i
miss that thing in your hair when i
searched everybody i should have
seen that if i had had any eyes
you would not said caresse then
quietly  not the way linda wears it
she puts it deep in her hair with just
the handle showing

  williams turned to look at her then
she knew who had stabbed her hus-
band there was no doubt of that but
she also knew that the man if she
loved him was lost to her forever

  did you hear that cursed violin
demanded harmer nervously  my

gosh we are in for it now is that
door locked

  yes it has not been unlocked
said the lieutenant steadily no one
could unlock it save mrs wheatland
and myself could they mrs wheat-
land 

   i did not tell the murderer the
combination if that is what you
mean said caresse wheatland then
meeting williamss eyes boldly

  the professors words came back to
him dont flatter yourself that you
ever will knowr caresse no matter
what comes out of all this

  the cleverness of the criminal and
the daring of him of one of those men
shut in that little room with him
amazed lieutenant williams to use
the jeweled dagger in linda prices
hair and linda always wore one
that was something to go upon the
man who had done that knew that
linda wore a weapon in her hair hair
that had never been bobbed or thinned
out during the search how he must
have laughed but caresse wheat-
land in searching her friend knew of
the dagger knew it would cause death
if need be and she had not mentioned
it yet would she not have saved her
lover from this positon if she could
she would never dare marry him now
nor would they dare to use the
formula if there was one which
williams doubted the professor had
of course never manufactured those
diamonds

  but what had been his game

  at any rate he had been sane enough
about getting himself murdered

   can you imagine whatever caused
that violin playing asked frisby
touching the lieutenants arm his face
rather haggard but pencil and paper
in his hand for frisby was a natural
reporter

i d
diamond death



   i cannot snapped williams

   this is damn serious said far-
ren the lawyer  one of us stabbed
the professor you know no need to
look outside in the hall locked in
here one of us put out that light and
killed him just as the poor old boy
said we would

    undoubtedly said the lieutenant
who was still examining the body  it
narrows the circle

   it stamps me forever said
caresse then in a still cold voice all
my life all of you will believe that
what my husband said at the dinner
table was true that one of you men
present is my lover that together we
connived to kill archie

  oh how could they think that
cried linda price putting her arm
about her friend and still mopping her
eyes  caresse no one who knew
you darling-

  nonsense said caresse clearly
look at fred frisby he is already
writing it up for his hideous old
paper

    miss price said williams rising
with the dagger in his hand and care-
fully wrapping it in his handkerchief
before placing it in his pocket did
you not feel some one jerk this from
your head

  yes said the girl with big
frightened eyes on the lieutenant  
did it pulled my hair that was when
i screamed

   i guess we were all pretty well
keyed up said clinton walking up
and down the small room

    this certainly lets us in for a bad
time growled harmer again

  without speaking the lieutenant
walked to the desk which stood in a
corner from it he took a sheet of
clean white paper a blotter and a
bottle of printers ink

  	d

   i should like to take your finger-
prints if you please he said looking
about the silent circle  i dont for a
moment think our clever criminal was
fool enough to leave his prints on miss
prices jeweled pin but just the same
i must take them one at a time please
mrs wheatland you first

  there was not a single protestation
as the professors wife and his guests
filed past the desk and submitted to
having their finger tips inked

    now well do all we can to clear up
this matter while we are locked in here
together said the lieutenant taking
charge of the paper after setting a
name under each print  i feel sure
you all wish me to do that only one
of you stabbed the professor the
others must be keen to establish their
innocence it is the devil of a position
for you all

  you do not say only one of us is
guilty breathed caresse looking
steadily into the lieutenants eyes
 you like the rest of the group here
present think i am an accomplice you
believe archie and to-morrow the
rest of the world will believe it
yes said williams meeting those
glorious eyes calmly i am afraid
you will have to be prepared for that
mrs wheatland

  what rot cried harmer starting
up angrily the professor was bug-
house you saw him do his diamond
stunt ridiculous clinton who is an
expert chemist says he was a fake
to-morrow night he was going to
bring an alienist to examine archie
werent you will

   clinton flushed slightly

yes i was he admitted frank-
ly i thought him not all there he
had changed in the past two years
harmers bold championing of mrs
wheatland aroused the lieutenants in-

              r


detective fiction weekly

terest would the guilty man step
forth like that or was it a play the
play of a person relying upon the
lieutenants common sense to tell him
that no guilty man would do that

   this thing is a bit beyond me im
afraid worried young williams

  saleworth who had been pale and
agitated since the crime stepped to the
side of williams and held out his left
hand

   i say what shall i do with these
cursed diamonds he asked wretched-
ly  i should like to have them
thoroughly examined but if mrs
wheatland-

  oh by all means shrugged
caresse  do what you wish with
them you will find them genuine my
husband had a cache of diamonds
about here i feel sure perhaps i shall
he lucky enough to find it

  the lieutenant took half the stones
into his fingers

   ill give mrs wheatland a receipt
for these and you can do the same
saleworth he said  i too should
like to give these to experts

   i am an expert said saleworth a
trifle stiffly  and i pronounce them
fine stones of the first water however
the thing was too much of a menace
to be lightly treated five experts wait
to examine the stones i was to bring
them after to-nights demonstration
mrs wheatland watched the men
write their receipts with sullen brilliant
eyes she shrugged them aside when
they handed them to her and williams
laid them upon the desk top he could
so easily understand the terrible posi-
tion in which the girl stood whether
she was guilty or not with the death
of the man at her feet the door to her
happiness was slammed in her face
even if she had had nothing to do with
the crime and loved one of the men

present marriage with that man would
not be possible

chapter vii

i play a violin

having laid the receipts for the
diamonds upon the desk the lieu-
tenant walked again to the body
of the professor and stood before it for
a silent moment he was trying to see
wheatland and the entire room the
moment before that light went out

  saleworth had been bending over
the diamonds which he had just taken
from the cooled crucible the pro-
fessor had been beside him and as far
as williams could recall every one else
grouped curiously about

    say dont you think we should
take into consideration the playing of
that unearthly violin asked frisby
 that will make great headlines and
there are servants in the house you
know jock in particular was devoted
to archie

   but the man who stabbed him was
locked here in this room with us and
he took the jeweled pin from miss
prices hair to commit the crime
snapped the lieutenant  dont forget
that the violin player no matter how
involved or how he worked the trick
was not in this room

   yes said farren  one of us
is guilty

   what good would it do one of us
to kill the professor asked clinton
 even if his wild speech at the dinner
table were true none of us would dare
marry caresse now

   perhaps the guilty man has the
formula said saleworth looking
about

   the formula my aunt sneered
harmer  there aint no such animal
old arch was stringing us and the
diamond death



public about these gems mother
nature made them all right

   you can easily have the stones
traced said the lieutenant to the dia-
mond expert  they are large and
pure enough

   oh quite bowed saleworth

   but suppose he did make them and
nobody ever finds the formula for poor
dear caresse sobbed linda price
 how dreadful if arch was on the
square the result of years of labor will
just be wiped out by the murderer-
by one of you men nobody ever does
believe in anything that has never been
done before

   be quiet linda said caresse
sharply  the whole thing was a trap
set for me cannot you see archies
wild jealousy is at the back of it all
for a moment the lieutenant was in-
clined to believe her forgetting the
body at his feet he was almost swayed
by the girls compelling charm and
then again he heard the professors
grim voice if i am killed caresse
will know by whom and why and
the professor had certainly been killed
that alone was the lieutenants job
he now had a murder on his hands and
he could swing into his stride

   all of you try to take up the posi-
tions now that you held when that light
went out he said briskly  remem-
ber as best you can snap into it
weve got to get somewhere in this
case to-night before i open that door
as every one moved rather uncer-
tainly to obey will clinton the
chemist spoke hesitantly

   i fancy i had better tell you now
lieutenant before you find out for
yourself he said  i had a grievance
against the professor some months
ago he promised to let me into this
secret of the diamond making i was
frankly incredulous and he promised to

take me in as a partner he has never
done so and each time he put me off
he owed me money several thousand
and that is why he promised to do this

i	said that if he convinced me that he
could actually manufacture diamonds
we would cancel the debt

   i see said the lieutenant slowly
 all right thank you for your frank-
ness mr clinton if any one can think
of anything else that sort of thing
saves me probablya good bit of work
harmer gave a sudden short laugh
not a pleasant laugh his eyes met
those of caresse fieetingly

   i suppose i may as well confess
that i own a violin and that i can also
play it he said  but ive never
played the funeral march jazz is more
in my line

chapter viii

too many combinations

for a moment the lieutenant
looked about the small circle with
a frown he knew just what he
was up against as soon as that door
was unlocked and these people released
all sorts of things might happen
never again would he have them com-
pletely in his power as he had them
now with the body of the murdered
man at their feet the murderer was
there where he could handcuff him with
no effort whatever and yet he had no
idea which of the professors guests he
was or she could caresse that
flame of a girl with the smoldering
eyes have taken the dagger-like pin
from her chums hair and stabbed her
husband it was possible a womans
youth and loveliness did not bar her
from being a criminal lieutenant
williams knew well

  yet somehow he was inclined to
think this a mans job it had taken


detective fiction weekly

strength to plunge that dagger into the
professors heart strength and accu-
racy in the dark

   is this the best you can do he
asked looking about at the little group
 are you all perfectly sure yon were
in these positions when that light went
out

  they assured him eagerly that they
were to the best of their recollection

   then mr farren was closest to
the light switch said the lieutenant
thoughtfully

   it seems that i was said the law-
yer grimly

   you saw no one brush past you
asked williams  they would have to
you know to reach that switch

   i was not conscious of anything
like that said farren firmly  i was
anxious to see what saleworth would
get from that crucible

   so were we all said clinton with
a short uncomfortable laugh  but
you see lieutenant this room is so
small almost any of us grouped as we
were could have reached out for that
switch miss price could have or my-
self or farren or frisby speaking
for myself i can swear i would never
have noticed i was so dead anxious
to see what saleworth found when he
opened the crucible

   yes said the lieutenant grimly
 the moment was chosen well yet one
of you put out that light and stabbed
professor wheatland i say to that
person now that it is only a matter of
time before i expose him before i ar-
rest him i shall never stop until i
solve this mystery it is going to be a
big case as you all must realize- i can-
not afford to be called in as the pro-
fessor called me and asked for aid
and then be present during the actual
murder and fall down on the case one
man here in this little room is doomed

he need not think for one moment
that he can get away with this

  eddie harmer was rolling himself
a cigarette he had done so frequently
during the evening williams had
noted his long slim fingers were en-
tirely steady and his eyes met the lieu-n
tenants gravely

   this is as serious for us as it is for
you lieutenant he said if you do
fall down on it we shall all be under a
cloud the rest of ur lives

   and even though the professors
dinner speech would seem to let me
out put in saleworth  i cannot be
considered innocent i was in here
with all of you locked into this small
space  must accept the same position
the rest of you are in

   will you let us out now gasped
linda price looking appealing at the
lieutenant  i cannot stand it in here
another moment

  she looked on the edge of fainting
and williams fancied he saw raw panic
in her eyes but why the girl was
nothing but a guest the best friend
of caresse wheatland even so why
should she be so frightened the lieu-
tenant watched her shaking fingers re-
arranging her hair

   id like to say one thing said
frisby then briskly putting away his
notebook in which he had been busily
writing  that is that in my opinion
there is no formula and no process to
this diamond making the professor
is simply-was i should say-a slick
magician he put it over on everybody
for some reason of his own he
smuggled those gems into that crucible
each time somehow he must have
and so all that stuff about the criminal
wanting to kill him for the formula
and the chance to make diamonds him-
self is nonsense the criminal prob-
ably killed him for some private griey-
diamond death



ance and possibly for a chance to win
caresse the professor had plenty of
enemies but there is nothing but a
trick to this diamond stuff however
it is going to be written up by me as
 the diamond death  and itll go big
you can bet in the morning editions
has the professor ever been abroad
mrs wheatland asked the lieu-
tenant coming out of deep thought and
paying no attention to the reporter

   no

    see what you are getting at
nodded saleworth brightly  the dia-
monds if it was trickery he must
have had a lot of them here close by
probably in this room

  williams did not reply he con-
tinued to study the faces in the group
and his manner made them all exceed-
ingly uncomfortable linda price
shrank into a corner with her hands
over her eyes and caresse put an arm
about her

   i think there is too much smoking
in this room gentlemen said the lieu-
tenant suddenly picking up a small
dish from the desk top just place
your cigars and cigarettes in this if
you please

  without demur the surprised gentle-
men dropped their cigars and cigarettes
in the receptacle handed them by the
lieutenant and before them all
williams picked up in his slender wiry
fingers the cigarette eddie harmer had
just rolled and lighted unrolling it he
shook the tobacco from it and held it
close to his eyes for a tense moment

  lifting his head he shot harmer a
glance which would have made any
other man cringe under the circum-
stances but which slid off young
harmer like water from a ducks back
leaving him indifferently amused and
rather brazen

   harmer there is upon the inside

of this cigarette paper the combination
to the lock of this door he said
sharply  explain that if you please
 easy shrugged harmer  the
moment the professor died while you
were examining him caresse whispered
it to me she said she felt sure she
would not have another chance i
wrote it down on one of my cigarette
papers because i saw the fix we were
in and i figured on a search and all
sorts of stunts before we got out of
here my memory is about an inch
long and i felt sure during all the stuff
we were in for id get that darn com-
bination mixed up

  an ominous silence settled upon the
room in the lieutenants ears the pro-
fessors voice seemed to be speaking
had caresse after all branded the
man she loved the guilty man

   and why did mrs yvheatland give
you the combination of the door
asked williams quietly

    she thinks there is a cache of dia-
monds in this room and she wanted me
to try to find it said harmer frankly
 she was afraid she would not get a
chance to tell me again nor a chance
to look herself after this i know she
has stolen in here whenever she could
to examine the place

   you apparently miss the fact that
in giving you this combination it
might look as though mrs wheatland
thought you the guilty man and was
trying to assist you to get out of the
room said williams dryly

  nonsense snapped clinton his
face very red  caresse whispered that
door combination to me the moment
we entered this room before arch
started his demonstration

   i was a bit ahead of you both
put in farren grimly  as we came
along the hall caresse told it to me and
said she felt sure there were diamonds


detective fiction weekly

hidden here she wanted me to look
for them not only to give them to her
but to stop her husband from getting
himself caught up by the law and
openly disgracing them both

   just as the professor put that cru-
cible in the fire caresse told me the
combination of the lock said frisby
then with a little chuckle  she said
shed explain later since i have a mind
like a card index got to have in my
game i didnt have to do anything as
elaborate as harmer and write it on a
cigarette paper

  across the smoke-filled little apart-
ment lieutenant williams met the bril-
liant eyes of caresse leaning against
the wall with folded arms and the
jeweled cigarette holder dangling in
one hand she looked back at him with
mockery that was like a glove flung in
his face if she knew the man she
had done a clever thing to protect him
and yet give him information it had
been just possible that williams would
not have found that out and one of
them might have had the luck or the
brains to discover that hiding place of
the gems if there was one

  by jove said saleworth rather
blankly  no one told me about the
lock

   and why mrs wheatland did
you tell clinton farren and frisby the
combination before the crime took
place asked williams crisply

   archie was so sure he was going
to be killed that i thought he probably
would be replied that amazing girl
coolly

   but these men one of them might
have taken the diamonds reminded
the lieutenant

   no said caresse her head flung
high  they are honest i could trust
them all

   yet one of them stabbed your hus-
band said williams dryly

  caresse merely shrugged and made
no reply

  very well said the lieutenant
then looking about  i shall alter the
combination of that lock no one but
myself will be able to enter this room
after the professors body is removed
if there is a cache of unset diamonds
here used by professor wheatland in
his manufacturing stunt we shall find
it i am laying my cards frankly on
the table now we cannot stay in here
all night it is getting on our nerves
now every one of you will be under
police surveillance from this time on-
ward you will remain here until my
men arrive and then you will be at
liberty to return to your homes i
understand that you have nothing more
to tell me none of you can recall any
little thing that will assist me

  utter silence answered him and
after a moment or so the lieutenant
turned quietly to the telephone upon
the desk lifted the receiver and called
into the transmitter police head-
quarters 

  and across the two sharp words
there shivered an ear-piercing scream
as linda price fell in a dead faint to
the floor before farren who stood be-
side her could catch her

to be concluded
miracle murder

              fraync looks over the  lilies of the field 
              for the slayer of the lovely baa-baa jackson

 on your toes don five-four in
games remember if i take
this one it  give me the set
inspector frayne walked to the
service line

  better give me all youve got
chief came back haggerty  ive
just been kidding you along

 the famous manhunters answer
was a nod and a smile and a ball that
haggerty was barely able to lob over
the net frayne killed it and hag-
gerty grinned

 still kidding you sir he said
frayne laughed this time he rare-
ly laughed he enjoyed these games
with don though although don was

younger and had been a tennis crack in
college the two were fairly evenly
matched it was the only outdoor sport
in which the police official indulged
and he drove to this upper west side
club whenever he could find the leisure
there was no better physical exercise
on the market in his opinion and he
had to keep himself in trim

  frayne after a beautiful volley took
the next point and took the following
one after a still harder tussle he
didnt get a chance however to put
over his next serve

  a club attendant came rushing up
excitedly all club attendants had
strict orders to interrupt any game at


detective fiction weekly

any presumably crucial moment if
necessary if an official call came over
the wire

   mr haggerty sir the man was
literally bellowing apparently enjoy-
ing the importance of the layman at
being mixed up in police business
 from headquarters lieutenant geo-
gan very important hes on the
wire sir

  frayne dropped his arm nodded just
once and haggerty took a hurdle over
the net and raced for the clubhouse

  haggerty was fraynes right hand
man his protege his buffer it was
dons task before anything else to see
that his superior was not troubled with
any murder problems that might have
been dissected by any average detec-
tive no one was allowed to communi-
cate with the famous manlninter direct-
ly they had first to give their stuff to
his assistant

  frayne had been forced to lay down
this law otherwise lie would have
been swamped with all the unimportant
and easily untangled cases that are
bound to occur in the five boroughs
that comprise the miracle city of the
world new york

  frayne was twirling his racket im-
patiently lieutenant geogan wouldnt
have called unless the affair had been
a vital and baffling one geogan was
one of the shrewdest men on the new
york force

  but haggerty was back now he
was running his fingers through his
reddish hair as he invariably did when
he thought a mystery was on deck

   baa-baa jackson chief he said
his keen face alive with enthusiasm
 paid the so-called wages of sin at
last found in her bed this morning
cold murder beaten up first then
stabbed a kitchen knife from her own
apartment she-

  why not frayne cut in with a
frown  she must be-yes she must
be thirty-eight she had a long run
couldnt geogan put his broadway
crew on the job

   wait chief wait a minute please
replied haggerty  the maid let her-
self into he apartment with her key
at nine oclock this morning as she al-
ways did baa-baa sort of half woke
up and said she didnt want to be dis-
turbed until eleven the maid got busy
on the job of cleaning up the place
in something less than half an hour as
near as she can figure the doorbell
rang it was vince lamont he in-
sisted on waking baa-baa they found
her dead-beaten up and slabbed
geogan swears that the colored maid is
o k good rep and she also
stood up under questioning she says
she cant be wrong that baa-baa spoke
to her when she came in at nine the
bedroom window was latched be-
sides the maid didnt hear a sound

   chief haggerty finished  it
looks nice

  frayne fingering his well trimmed
mustache with the thumb and index
finger of his right hand was smiling a
trifle skeptically his voice also had
the same tone

   another of these miracle mur-
ders eh 

  haggerty didnt answer this one
haggerty wasnt supposed to answer it
haggerty knew just when and when
not to speak which was one more
reason why he was a valuable asset to
the great manhunter

  fraynes eyes of that cold blue of
a particularly cold winter sky had gone
to triangular slits they always did
when he was musing on murder

  murder it so happened was his
hobby it was more than his hobby
it was food and drink to him
miracle murder



it was what made his blood keep on
pumping and his brain keep on throb-
bing it was his life

  lamont he suddenly asked

   alibi looks on the square geogan
says vince says he left baa-baasapart-
ment at about four in the morning after
one of their merry rows he stopped
in an apartment on the ground floor
where a party was going on and had
a few drinks seven or eight witnesses
to that coming back to make it up
with baa-baa when the maid answered
his ring he says

  frayne nodded and tuckeddiis racket
under his arm starting briskly for the
clubhouse

   lets go don

  four minutes and fifty seconds
later after having shed tennis flannels
and taken a shower and changed into
street garb they were roaring through
traffic in fraynes private roadster
that had the fastest engine made in
america under its hood

ii

aa-baa jackson

you should ask as the phrase
has it

  back in the days when italian table
dhote dinners including wine were
fifty-five cents back when drinks were
two for a quarter and name your
brand back before the self-starters
could always be counted on to do their
stuff back before the affair at sara-
jevo that is said to have precipitated
the war to end wars-back in nine-
teen hundred and twelve to be ex-
plicit-a little girl had come out of the
south

  the newspapers had said she came
out of the south anyway-and so did
she-although two or three catty souls
averred that she had been born and
reared and raised up in herkimer

county they said furthermore that
ike schubel the new york musical
comedy man had found her in the sta-
tion of this same up-state town she
had they added been serving coffee
and pie and sandwiches from under
circular glass cases in the station res-
taurant

  maybe yes maybe no mr schubel
at least had seen her innate possibili-
ties she had had a more than fair
figure she had had a voice with exactly
the correct touch of throatiness she
had had also very large black eyes and
very natural light golden hair and
that in itself as mr schubel stated is
always something to telegraph home
about

  briefly lie hadnt done any tele-
graphing he had signed her on the
spot for his next production and he
had taken his two bags from the wait-
ing train he had caught the next
train for tammany town with baa-
baa in tow

  so the story goes when it is told by
those two or three catty people

  her first appearance which nobody
noticed it must be admitted was when
she went through the motions with the
rest of the chorus in  little fleecv
lamb

  just how long she would have kept
on kicking up her legs in company with
twenty-three others can never be
definitely ascertained

  appendicitis was quite fashionable
that season and the second female lead
came down with it she could afford
to having recently annexed what is
now known as a big butter and egg man
to attend to the tedious task of seeing
the landlord on the first of the month

  this little lady had been singing a
song that ike schubel had thought
would be a wow so had the lyric man
and every one else only it hadnt been


detective fiction weekly

that was why they hadnt been so
grieved at the outbreak of appendicitis
they could chuck the number now
and let it go at that one salary saved

  but the girl with the golden locks
and dark orbs had pleaded to be given
a tryout just once

   it costs nothing was how mr
schubel had argued down the opposi-
tion  let her she should try it once

  that is the true history of how  i
want to be somebodys baa-baa
lamb  came to be the greatest song
hit of the period

  no one can dope it out for many
have tried and all have failed yet it
happens to be a fact that certain per-
sonalities have been able to put over
certain things that other equally color-
ful personalities have flopped on com-
pletely

  baa-baa jackson from that night
was made

  she didnt have to have appendicitis
to break her contract with ike schubel
she merely told him to go to hell

  she had quit  little fleecy lamb 
for the protection of a great big wolf
-one of the wall street variety he
had given her very pleasant pastures in
which to gambol including an im-
ported car with a liveried driver and
some rather lavish articles of jewelry
she seemed to have had a proper eye
for precious stones from the start too

  baa-baa in short had gone from
one gilded cage to another for the lady
tired easily and seemed to find no
difficulty whatsoever in discovering
playmates who were not precisely
poverty stricken that is to say dur-
ing those first five or six years while
the so-called bloom of youth still
lasted

  but she didnt seem to mind her de-
scent in the social grade so to speak
there were still plenty of suckers even

if they didnt spend quite so lavishly
she wanted as the years rolled on a
good time more than anything else so
at least she said apparently she was
having one accordingto her standards

  she was still known at the present
period in every night club in town and
when her escort happened to be a par-
ticularly generous one the host always
asked baa-baa to get up and do her
stuff sing her once famous  i want
to be somebodys baa-baa lamb in
other words she could always get a
kick out of that she had been getting
a kick recently out of vince lamont

  he had not in any form or fashion
by any remote possibility been another
of her  protectors not vince in
fact he rather wasnt averse to having
ladies take him under their wing the
minute you gave a dame even a lousy
nickel was his ironclad axiom right
i rom then you lost all her respect

  vince was another lily of the field
who neither toiled nor did he spin not
in legitimate pursuits anyway he was
a race track tout a fixer for a few big
gamblers a go-between in an occa-
sional important bootleg deal

  his interest in baa-baa rumor had
it was because business had been a bit
slack and because miss jackson had
been in funds a wealthy south ameri-
can coffee planter broadway gossip
ran had presented her with a perfectly
good check for ten grand not a month
previously when he had sadly taken
the boat back to his tropical shores
after having enjoyed a hectic few
weeks of her hospitality

ill

inspector frayne was re-
minding himself of this gossip any-
way as his car zoomed along down
town inspector frayne incidentally
knew more about new york and the
miracle murder



various characters in it than any man
living he had been born there he
loved the place as if it were his own
flesh and blood he found it highly
profitable also to know as much as he
could of what was going on in the
miracle city of the world

  don brought the car to a halt before
an old apartment on west fifty-
seventh street it had been a grand
apartment in its day perhaps but its
day had been in the os and s a
five story affair with only two flats on
a floor big rooms but dark rooms
running the length of the building and
known as the railroad type with only
the front and rear getting any light to
to speak of there was no elevator 
hallway attendant a seedy place for
seedy people

  there was a little knot of loiterers
before the steps as well as an officer in
uniform the latter cleared the steps
with a sweep of his night stick as
frayne descended and stood rigidly at
salute

   morning sir

   morning harrigan said frayne
pleasantly leaving the cop flushing
with pleasure at having his name re-
membered

  upstairs in the apartment the man-
hunter found lieutenant geogan and
one of his plain-clothes squad davis

   anything new since the phone call
geogan  he asked

   no sir

   uh huh

  frayne nodding glanced about the
hallway was a wide one with the en-
trance door about in the center a
kitchen and dining room were toward
the rear with a bath next almost
opposite the door then came two
bedrooms with the living room up in
front of them facing the street

  where is she asked frayne

  geogan pointed to the first bedroom
frayne went in a pathetic death
chamber seeing that baa-baa had
previously had some exceedingly nice
boudoirs in other and more genteel
parts of the city there was too much
gilt in this one too many laces too
many beribboned pillows too many
startling colors

  she lay on the bed in scant negligee
with a big red bruise on her left jaw
and a big dark red patch  her left
side with a kitchen knife sticking in
the center of it

   denham been here yet

  denham was the finger-print expert
 no sir we waited for you said
geogan  youve asked us to al-
ways-

  thanks said frayne and added
 get denham don

  don wras at the telephone before
frayne could speak again

   maid and lamont up ahead 

   yes sir in the living room
the manhunter walked up forward
to a room quite as garish as the one in
which baa-baa had met her death

  vince lamont and the colored maid
with an officer in charge were there
the tout was sitting in a rocker by the
window comfortably stretched out
smoking a cigarette he didnt rise
but raised inquiring eyebrows the
maid-a  high yaller  type-was
walking the floor and moaning

   come out of it snapped frayne
 y-yessuh she said and changed
her moaning to a sob

   whats your name

   b-bethenia sub bethenia gib-
bons

   all right bethenia the sooner
you get hold of yourself the sooner
you can go-back home or behind
bars one of the two lets get to work
and get your story


detective fiction weekly

 bellin bars suh oh lawdy suh
you aint meanin that for me is you
frayne didnt look at her as he
spoke he looked at vince lamont as
if silently asking his opinion

  lamont shrugged it was an expres-
sive shrug it said that the maid had
after all been found in the apartment
with her dead mistress

  frayne nodded as if in under-
standing and then spoke with gentle
patience

   come now tell me what happened
bethenia

  bethenia gibbons did try to pull her-
self together she somewhat suc-
ceeded her lower lip quivered and
she shook her head

   i done tol it so many times to them
other police genlemen suh

 just try once more said frayne

   well suh i opened the door with
my key at nine oclock i always tip-
toes to miss baa-baas bedroom to see
if shes awake or not to see if she
wants her breakfast or what order has
she got i aint only come in the door
this mornin though when she asks
out in a sleepy an yawny kin o
voice-you know suh-if its me i
says yes an then she says go ahead an
clean up the front room an not wake
her till about eleven oclock

  frayne frowned he had seen when
he had looked at the dead body of baa-
baa jackson that rigor mortis had
already set in how could this have
occurred had baa-baa not been killed
until after nine oclock

  was the maid lying

   did you kill her frayne sudden-
ly snapped  what was your motive
 i didn kill her the girl said
sullenly  i usta keep a-tellin her she
would be killed though if she didn
start leadin a more clean an decent
life

   mmmm said frayne  so you
used to tell your mistress that you
didnt approve of her mode of living
eh  how did she take that 

  bethenia flushed hung her head
stubbornly remained silent

   speak up-speak up snapped
frayne

  the girl did

   she-well she give me notice to
leave the end o the week if you wanta
know -its the fust place i ever
been fired from too im a respectable
workin girl i am an is worked for
real quality folk down in-

   and you killed her because she
fired you eh

    j yy

  but frayne had raised a hand
frayne could always get instant action
by merely raising a hand he got it
now the girl sullenly hung her head

   well he asked  what happened
when you say she told you this morning
to clean up the front room

  bethenia gibbons looked frightened
panicky for a moment

   i went right to the front room-
right to this here room-and begun a-
tidyin an a-sweepin an all i wasnt
here so long suh-maybe ten minutes
maybe fifteen-an then i went to fix
the dinin room an kitchen an put a
pot o coffee on the stove for myself
like i does i-i dunno the coffee
wasnt biled quite when the bell rings
an its mistuh lamont

  bethenia hesitated again she
looked at vince lamont a trifle plead-
ingly but he shrugged again and a
faint smile came to the lips under his
thin black mustache

  frayne didnt nod at him this time
frayne winked

   i tol mistuh lamont that miss
baa-baa wanted to sleep till eleven
but he says thats all right she wouldn
miracle murder



miu him a-wakenin her an-an-
well suh thats all they is he went to
wake her an he foun her dead so
help me god im tellin you the truth

  frayne began pacing up and down
the room then his eyes narrowing
a slight furrow  his forehead

  the bell rang presently and some
one entered

   that denli a m don called
frayne

   yes chief replied haggerty
coming to the door

  frayne sat down suddenly as if he
were a trifle nervous he took out a
pencil and began tapping the arm of
his chair as nervous people fre-
quently do

  but it wasnt that frayne was
nervous

  the manhunter was tapping out a
message to his assistant in a private
code that he and don had invented

  the message said that haggerty was
to send for grady the coroner and
that the latter was to get there without
delay

  frayne rose stretched again began
to walk leisurely up and down the
length of the room finally with a
frown he paused before vince laniont

  what do you think about the whole
mess laniont he abruptly asked his
voice and face frankly puzzled

iv

the tout smiled it was a cynical
smile tinged with a touch of
candid relief

   theres one thing im thinking of
right now inspector he said  and
that is that heres one thing they cant
hang on me

  frayne regarded him gravely the
thin mouth with the thin black mus-
tache the dark brown eyes that baa-baa
had probably liked the coal black hair

showing a contrasting white line where
it was parted with meticulous care
straight down the middle

  although his clothes verged slightly
 the broadway cut frayne never-
theless noticed that laniont could be
called a well-turned-out man frayne
was qualified to judge clothes too he
himself was the best garbed police
official that new york or any other city
had ever had he wondered idly why
it was that on this hot august day
laniont wore silk gloves in the house

   it doesnt seem so agreed frayne
thoughtfully  no it doesnt

   dont think im such a hard-boiled
guy for speaking of that right off the
bat inspector laniont said suddenly
losing his cynicism and looking
troubled  i guess if i didnt have this
cold turkey alibi it could be made to
look damn bad for me i- he
shrugged  i dont know what to
think inspector since you ask me

   i believe the boys got your story
laniont but give it to me again just
for forms sake said frayne

   i- i you know about baa-baa
and myself i guess ive known her on
and off for three or four years but we
just didnt click all that time you
know we didnt get this yen for each
other till about a month ago since
then weve been together pretty near
all the time we-

  live here with her interrupted
frayne although he knew that vince
hadnt

  nothing doing inspector laniont
laughed with a wave of his hand  no
dame gets me like that ive been hang-
ing out at my own little room-and-bath
at the piccadilly circle ever since its
been built about four years ago

  wise man nodded frayn e
well last night

   we blew in early from the  spanish


detective fiction weekly

slipper a little after two id say
we had a few shots more of rye and-
aw hell you know how this hooch hits
some dames lately they get naggy
and start to hang things on you that
you never done we-well baa-baa
was jealous and she starts saying i
was trying to make a cabaret kid at
the spanish slipper one word led to
another-and that word led to about
six more-and-

  vince lamont shrugged again made
a helpless gesture with outstretched
hands and blew out smoke

   maybe i am wise in some ways in-
spector like you said i am in one way
i know i never let a dame get me into
a deep argument thats maybe gonna
lead to a light i blow instead i blew
last night it was about four

   thats when you stopped down be-
low and had a few more shots is it
 yeah flo and toots mason-
you know from the scandals-have
got a flat there they were throwing a
party and i-

   you stayed there howr long

   oh maybe an hour maybe a little
longer

   and then 

   i blew over to jerry spinos place
and had a few more shots not many
two or three i think-yeah three i
got to mopin about baa-baa after
that i-aw hell inspector maybe
im a little hard-boiled see but id
lately got to thinkin a lot of baa-baa

i	felt sorry wed had that spat i got
to thinkin i was too quick in takin her
up i got to thinkin perhaps i had give
that wop cabaret kid the eye i   
aw i figgered it was up to me to come
back and make up

  he paused looked somber for a
moment and took out another cigar-
ette he lit it and blew the smoke out
with a sigh

   well you know what i come back
to

   uh huh said frayne

  frayne was telling himself that he
knew one thing for certain he knew
that the alibi at jerry spinos speak-
easy would be copper riveted and
otherwise unimpeachable the spino
crowd stuck together as the man-
hunter was well aware

  so you rang the bell eh you
didnt have a key

   baa-baa was shifty about handing
out keys inspector nope she didnt
even give one to me hell i only
know one guy that ever had-but aint
that right bethenia  never had a
key did  

   no suh said bethenia  he
didn have no key mistuh lamont
didn

  frayne was fingering his close
cropped and well trimmed mustache
with the thumb and index finger of his
right hand

   so another lad did have a key he
was musing

   nix inspector laughed vince
with a positive wave of his hand
 wrong there this was just a bird
that baa-baa fell for a coupla months
ago for about a week she probably
hasnt seen him since and i know he
gave her back the key he-

   why so positive

   hes a dub gawd knows how
she ever did fall for him even for a
day hes the night clerk at the pic-
cadilly circle-a sap thats always
tryin to beat the ponies from the out-
side i take most of his bets for him
 losing lately

   ever see a sucker that won in-
spector countered vince

   no said frayne  and i never
saw a wise guy that did either

   youre tellin chuckled lamont
miracle murder



   whats he called

   baker-blondy baker inspector
but say youre all wet an i mean that
right he had no more to do with this
than-

   what time does he finish his
shift

   seven in the morning

   live at the hotel

   yeah

   don said fravne

    yes sir

   youll make better speed in the
roadster chase over to the piccadilly
circle and round up blondy baker the
night clerk step on the gas don

    i will sir

  frayne took out a cigar presumably
searched his waistcoat pocket for his
lighter and didnt find it

   let me have a light lamont
lamont fumbled in his own pocket
clumsily took out a match lit it and
held the flame for frayne

   thanks said the inspector he
noticed that the tout had not removed
his gloves

  frayne started to walk up and down
his eyes narrowing denham appeared
in the doorway then denhams face
told frayne furthermore that no
finger-prints had been found on the
knife or on the body of baa-baa

  frayne continued his pacing he
stopped presently he stretched
yawned looking like a man who is im-
measurably bored who was slightly
annoyed too

   too bad you had that row with
baa-baa last night lamont might
have averted the murder if you hadnt
it came at a devilish awkward time for
lie i was having some tennis with
haggerty when we were called and i
needed only another point to beat him
it isnt often i beat my young assistant
either he ended ruefully

   im not a tennis shark inspector
but i sure do like my sleep grinned
the tout  make believe i couldnt
use some now

   oh youll get enough sleep in la-
mont he smiled  its infinitely
harder for me to get in enough tennis
he stretched again as he finished
and strolled out into the hallway a bit
impatiently

v

dox must have stepped on the gas
for fraynes wrist watch told
him that his protege had been
gone a few seconds less than twelve
minutes

  blondy baker was with him

  not so vicious when it came to looks
blondy a foppish little fellow with
pretty curls wearing a gorgeously
striped silk shirt that tried to vie with
an amazingly lined cravat

  frayne wasted no time he did not
speak harshly he spoke in a coldly
matter-of-fact tone

   baker did you kill baa-baa jack-
son this morning

   did i kill-did i kill baa-

  it looked like legitimate surprise be-
yond question as the night clerk gasped
out his words his face went white

  precisely said frayne did
you stick a kitchen knife into baa-baa
jacksons heart this morning

  whatever broadway veneer baker
had attained now left him and lie
showed up for the frightened young
lad that he was

   oh my god inspector he cried
 what do you-what do you think i
am

 i told you so inspector not him
it was vince lamont speaking and
every officer there looked to see the
tout raked by frayne for the interrup-
tion


detective fiction weekly

  frayne didnt rake him however
he merely turned on him with a grave
nod

   thats right lamont you did he
said

  the manhunter faced blondy then
and spoke in an exceedingly kindly
voicev

   yes you seem to have a champion
in lamont baker

  blondy was blinking blondy was
looking as if he didnt quite get what
it was all about blondy looked all at
once as if it had just come to him what
the trouble was

   you-you mean baa-baas been
murdered inspector frayne he
asked hoarsely

  with a kitchen knife said frayne

  that - thats awful isnt it
breathed the night clerk after a mo-
ment or two

   better than the chair perhaps
said frayne  some ones going to get
the chair for this remember thats
why youre here youve got to clear
yourself you-

  clear myself

   you had a key to her apartment
didnt you

   no sir i have not sir i did not
have    well i mean i havent had
one in-oh in two months inspector
frayne i swear to god i havent
sir he ended with a sobbing gulp

   you might have had an impression
made when you did have one frayne
reminded him

  a whistle came at that it came
from vince

   im-im not a murderer sir
blondy baker was saying his voice
quavering

  take it easy take it easy sug-
gested frayne then he asked
briskly

   wlien did you last see baa-baa 

   see her

   see her speak to her said
frayne

   i-oh i havent spoken to her for
a month or more except when id see
her at some club on my night off i-
you see we didnt play around for very
long together me and baa-baa she
just took a fancy to me for a few days
-a pretty strong one if i do say it
myself-and i guess she wasnt hard
for me to fall for she-well she
dropped me as quick as she took up
with me he ended flushing and hang-
ing his head as if ashamed to admit his
inability to hold the affections of the
little girl who had wanted to be some-
bodys baa-baa lamb

  very suddenly however blondy
baker jerked up his head his eyes
were very wide and understanding had
come to his entire face he spoke in
a rush

   oh-o-o-oh now i see why you
suspect me he cried  somebody
saw me come here this morning some
body-

  you were here this morning
asked frayne quietly

   well i was here at the door i
mean i rang the bell but baa-baa
didnt open i rattled the knob too
and knocked  the door i wanted to
see her badly

   what time was that baker

   i leave the job at seven sir i
brushed up and walked right over so i
guess -he thought for a moment-
oh i guess it was before half past
seven anyway

  why did you want to see her
pressed the manhunter

  the night clerk of the piccadilly
circle did some more flushing then
he spoke out

   well she was always a damn good

     	o

fellow inspector and i was in a hole-

	d
miracle murder



i mean i still am in a hole god knows
he laughed bitterly  i been playing
the ponies and theyve been taking me
for all ive got i owe everybody and
 dont know where to turn i got to
get some jack by to-night and i
thought of baa-baa i heard shed
grabbed ten grand and i thought she
might maybe let me have just three
hundred just three hundred would-

  he paused and licked at his lips and
his eyes naturally pale became
strangely darker

   theres one in the fifth to-day at
saratoga that if i had three centuries
on his nose   god it would put me
all in the clear inspector he ended
feverishly

  a knock came on the door then

   come in called frayne

  it was grady the coroner

  wheres the body frayne he
asked his friend

   second bedroom down the hall
bring me a report right away will you
old man

  frayne followed grady out of the
room he did not stop in the death
chamber grady would get every-
thing that he wanted there he knew
instead the manhunter examined the
other rooms

  he went to the unoccupied bedroom
to the dining room to the bathroom
to the kitchen he didnt spend much
time in any of these rooms for it was
said that frayne in a single glance
could take in more details than the av-
erage man would absorb in minutes of
close scrutiny

  the kitchen seemed to interest him
at least he stood there in the center of
the room frowning his cold blue eyes
going to triangular slits

  suddenly he walked over to the
dumb-waiter he peered down the
shaft his body stiffening he began

  d

to pull on the ropes presently all at
once he stopped

  then he leaped back and called out
sharply

   don

  sir replied haggerty coming
like a flash

   cut out those dumb-waiter ropes
theres our evidence

  frayne instantly was back in the
living room he was standing over
lamont

   take off those gloves you rat he
snarled

    like to keep my gloves on
frayne said lamont his voice and
his eyes defiant

   and i want em off damn you
snapped the manhunter  peel them
off lamont

  slowly his eyes on fraynes the
race track tout obeyed he had to he
knew they would have been torn off
otherwise

   i thought so frayne exulted as
he saw the bruises and blood blisters
on the palms of lamonts hands

  whaddaya mean you thought
so said lamont his voice ugly
 hell cant a guy go rowin an get
blisters on his hands

   sure he can agreed frayne  but
theyre not rowing blisters

  he turned then and beckoned to
the finger-print expert

  got your magnifying glass with
you denham

   yes inspector

   examine lamonts hands ex-
amine those bruises and blisters ex-
amine them for particles of hemp

   you cant hang nothin on me
frayne vince lamont was now
snarling  i got my alibi i got-
 take him don said frayne as
haggerty came to the doormat and
stood ready for orders


detective fiction weekly

  lamont started to bound from his
chair but haggerty was across the
room like a leaping panther the race
track touts wrists gripped between his
fingers

  denham was a painstaking work-
man and he was an exceedingly - ef-
ficient workman it took him three or
four minutes-maybe five-to study
those blistered hands

  when he straightened up and faced
his superior his face had a contented
look

   seven particles sir he said
 five on the right hand two on the
left there may be more  closer
examination im certain about the
seven though

   good said frayne

   say i heard a lot about somethin
bein greek to a guy smiled lamont
trying to bluster  and now i know
what it means put it in plain amer-
ican will you

   glad to oblige said frayne
 youre arrested for the murder of
baa-baa jackson

  vince lamont looked at his hands
looked about the room

  suddenly hope blazed up in his face
and he cried out loudly 

   flow in hell can you hang that on
me when baa-baa was alive when
bethenia come in at nine-somethin
oclock she spoke to her didnt she
and wasnt i drinkin over at jerry
spinos all mornin 

  frayne didnt answer frayne in-
stead called out

  finished grady

   right frayne coming

   whats the report asked the
manhunter when the coroner showed
up in the doorway

   she was killed somewhere in the
vicinity of four oclock this morning
frayne

    knew the maid was wrong when
she said baa-baa called through the
door at nine oclock frayne said
 the body had already stiffened when
i got here the answer to that is-
somebody was imitating her voice
frayne then faced vince lamont
his voice now came in a drawl

   still greek to you lamont

   worse than ever inspector
laughed lamont his own eyes not do-
ing such a bad job of bluffing

   when mr haggerty slips the
handcuffs on you as the murderer of
baa-baa jackson ill explain

  the handcuffs clicked

   ill try to reconstruct the crime for
you as nearly as i can said the man-
hunter  you and baa-baa did have
a fight of course but i dont think it
was about any little cabaret girl i
think it was because she wouldnt come
across with as much money as you
asked for right  that lamont
 aw-

  but frayne had started to walk for-
ward frayne was flexing the fingers of
his right hand a good many crooks-a
good many other people-knew about
those fingers it was said that frayne
with a mere pressure of them here and
there could cause a man torture he
did not have any sympathy for a kill-
er either he did not believe they
were sick creatures who should be cod-
dled  he believed they were extremely
dangerous people who should be elimi-
nated from the scheme of things

   aw-aw maybe we did have a
run-in about jack grumbled lamont
as fraynes hand went for a hand-
cuffed wrist

   i thought so said frayne suave-
ly  thanks well i dont know
with what you hit her on the jaw-
its unimportant now and well get it
later-but you hit her so hard that
miracle

murder



you thought youd nearly killed
her you got frightened then and
youd been drinking and you were sore
because you couldnt get the money
anyway you went and grabbed that
knife and stuck it in her did you say
i was right

   you leave me alone frayne you
   all right all right jeez ill say
yes i got to say yes aint i 

    sensible lad too bad you werent
as sensible before you killed her then
you wouldnt have done the job too
bad you werent as sensible after you
killed her then you wouldnt have
pinned all those clews onto yourself

  what-what clews

   wait let me tell you what you
did you went out the door after
youd murdered her and you went to
that party downstairs when you left
there though you wrent into the cellar
from that door in the back of the main
floor hallway when you got in the
cellar you went to the dumb-waiter
and you hoisted yourself up here then
you waited until bethenia let herself
in

  frayne paused started to stretch
out a hand but vince lamont with
a cry had covered his face

   you imitated a female voice-
baa-baas voice-and told the maid to
clean up the front room and not to dis-
turb you until eleven it isnt so diffi-
cult imitating a female voice espe-
cially when that voice is supposed to
conic from a person just waking from
a sound sleep anyway as the maid
came into this front room and you
heard her start to clean you sneaked
out of the bedroom and again made
for that dumb-waiter in the kitchen
then you let yourself down you hid
in either the cellar or the hallway
downstairs after a few minutes you
came and rang the bell

  frayne paused he pointed to
blondy baker

   this lad  where does he come
in that was just one of those things
that happen you heard him ring the
bell and knock at the door when you
were waiting here with the corpse you
probably peeked out of the window to
see who it was you brought his name
up to me because you thought you
might pin something on him you
thought you had a break there didnt
you 

  lamont was swaying

   i asked you a question lamont 
came fraynes voice  answer that
one and answer the rest have i or
have i not doped it as it all happened 
lamont uncovered his face it was
a very weak face now a very
stunned face dazedly he nodded his
head

   your clews frayne was saying
his own voice quickening  that
dumb-waiter rope was hard on soft
hands you left blood on it the rope
left little particles of hemp in your
bruises and blisters too as denham
saw with the magnifying glass your
shoulder blades as you went down the
shaft brushed against the kalsomined
wall my dear fellow you should see
how the back of your coat looks for
one as particular about his clothes as
you are youd be damned ashamed of
yourself but another thing too how
could a woman speak at around nine
oclock when as reputable a physician
as dr grady will testify she was killed
in the vicinity of four

  vince lamont didnt answer this
one he sagged forward a great gulp-
ing sob coming from his throat

  frayne didnt expect him to answer
didnt want him to answer he was
speaking to geogan

   take him away lieutenant
a fair reward

a novelette
by erie stanley gardner

clints lie detector was a strange
contraption and he put it to strange
uses in the thurmond murder case

chapter i
a backwater of life

governor icendall blotted

the signature laid down the pen
and whirled the big executive
chair through a complete half circle to
regard his visitor

   clint do you know why i sent for
you

  the dapper individual on the other
side of the desk shrugged his shoul-
ders

   i might guess-wrong

  the governor nodded  and again
you might guess right try

  clint kale smiled and there was a
trace of mockery in that smile

     something to do with my work in
 psychology 

     youre asking questions i told
 you to guess

     some mission you want to have
 me undertake and are having difficulty
 getting the ice broken

    the governor frowned

     hang it clint its your cold-
 blooded efficiency your ever-present
 air of supercilious superiority that gets
 you into trouble

    clint smiled affably

     really  he drawled

    yes really you remember that
 talk you made at the club the other
 night about the fallacies of circum-
 stantial evidence you claimed that
 
a fair reward



circumstances could lie just as well as  all right this is confidential
human witnesses	snapped the harassed executive

  clint kale reached for a cigarette jane thurmond fifty-two convicted

you cant come bustin into my
territory the officer bellowed

 ah he said then after an in-
 terval during which he lit the tobacco
 and exhaled smokily  so youre won-
 dering if shes really guilty

 the governor started flushed

  i havent said so

  you were about to

 the executive pulled a black cigar
 from a desk humidor bit the end off
 with a snap of his decisive jaw re-
 garded his visitor over the flare of a
 match

  suppose we eliminate the mind
 reading

  you asked me to you know
 yes youre right hang it
 youre always right thats the irri-
 tating thing about you clint

 he paused for a moment and clint
 bowed

of first degree murder sentenced to
death and the papers are urging me
to sit tight and let the sentence be car-
ried out

  clint nodded

   circumstantial evidence he said

   yes and no partially circum-
stantial evidence partially direct
testimony but heres the rub if the
woman had any sex appeal the news-
papers would be singing another tune
if shed had any looks the jury would
never have convicted her you cant
imagine an adventuress of twenty-five
or six with pretty ankles and a baby
stare having been convicted of any-
thing on that sort of evidence

   it was because this woman was a
coarse-skinned product of half a cen-
tury of work that the jury rushed in


detective fiction weekly

and made short work of it they
werent out two hours

  clint nodded

  the governor reached in a drawer
slammed out two bound volumes of
typewritten transcript

   theres the record in the case
clint stared at it for a moment then
shrugged his shoulders

  if you doubt her guilt why dont
you commute the sentence

  the governor puffed reflectively on
his cigar

   hang it clint i dont know how
i feel i dont doubt her guilt and
yet-well id dismissed the matter
from my mind until the other night
when you broke loose with that psycho-
logical patter about circumstantial evi-
dence you made me think and now
 dont know just how i do feel about
the case

  clint shook his head after the man-
ner of a teacher chiding a disobedient
child

   i must learn to keep my mouth
shut he said  its hard to realize
one is talking to the highest executive
in the state when one is at a card
game-

   oh forget it clint be serious
cut the comedy i have half an idea
you deliberately started all that talk
about criminal justice in order to raise
a doubt in my mind

  clint raised one eyebrow

   really  he drawled

   yes really anyhow thats neither
here nor there but heres what im
up against unless i sign a pardon or
a commutation of sentence that woman
is going to die within two weeks shes
a mother two grown children she
has one grandchild

  clint nodded that amused nod of
superiority which the executive found
so irritating

  the governor waved his cigar to-
ward the typewritten transcript

   this case came up from a back-
water of the state a regular cow-
county the people in that county all
know each other the district attorney
could have called every one on the
jury by his first name jane thur-
monds son engaged a city lawyer to
go down and defend her

   he was a good lawyer in the city
but he went up against a local combine
the district attorney had been in part-
nership with the trial judge the peo-
ple all figured it was a chance to show
everybody how good their district at-
torney was he licked the  slick city
feller that jury really didnt vote on
the womans guilt they voted that a
home town lawyer was just as good as
the slick city lawyers

  clint kale yawned patted his lips in
a deprecatory gesture

   the evidence he asked

  the governor flushed

   all right if im wearying you ill
be brief the evidence is this the
woman had a place it was mortgaged
she was desperately in need of funds
old sam pixley was the town miser
he was murdered whoever committed
that murder knew where he kept his
money it was in a strong box under
his bed in a little cubbv-hole cunningly
built into the floor

   the woman had acted as pixleys
housekeeper she went to his house
once every week and straightened up
the rest of the time pixley did his
own cooking and cleaning

   he was found dead in his bed he
had been hit over the head with a club
several times

   then the murderer had moved the
bed opened the trap door in the floor
pried the lid off the box and taken
what money there was just how much
a fair reward



there was no one knows there were
some bonds a few diamonds set in
old-fashioned jewelry and some money
the bonds were hanover irrigation
district bonds perhaps some others

   the murderer cleaned up on the
bonds and jewelry the only things
that werent taken avere some stocks
that were valueless some promissory
notes and a packet of letters

  clint leaned forward flipped his
cigarette into the cuspidor took a pen-
cil from his pocket opened a leather
bound notebook

  the valueless stocks he asked

  the governor thumbed through the
pages of the transcript

   american carbonator incorpo-
rated he said  they were old
stocks a clever promoter had or-
ganized the company fifteen years be-
fore and victimized several of the
towns prominent men sam pixley
knew the stocks werent any good but
hed paid money for them so he kept
them in with his valued possessions

   the body was found the next
morning that afternoon jane thur-
mond paid off her mortgage in cash
the cashier at the bank identified one
fifty-dollar note that had been torn and
pasted with adhesive tissue he had
paid that note to pixley in cashing a
check for him less than a week before
the murder

   remember clint this is a small
community were talking about every-
body knows everybody else every-
bodys business is everybodys busi-
ness

   perhaps suggested clint  sam
pixley put the torn bank note into
circulation

  the governor shook his head

   pixlev never put money into circu-
lation he took it out of circulation
and kept it out hed lost money in

a bank failure once after that he
cashed his checks and hid the cash

  clint nodded

   that all the evidence he asked

   good lord no jane thurmond
was interrogated she admitted shed
not earned the money finally she
said she found it all wrapped up in
a bundle and dropped on her doorstep
the mortgage was eleven hundred and
fifty dollars she said there was ex-
actly eleven hundred and fifty dollars
in the package that was dropped on her
doorstep not a very likely story

  clint regarded the executive through
half closed eyes

   go on he said

   that started an investigation tane
thurmond was taken to the scene of
the crime accused of murder she
denied her guilt but was somewhat
rambling as to her statements of where
shed been the night of the crime one
thing she was certain of she hadnt
been near pixleys place

   that was proved to be false two
witnesses had seen her one going one
coming but she had left before the
crime was committed thats one point
in her favor pixley must have been
killed shortly after midnight jane
thurmond was seen leaving the place
about ten thirty its the theory of
the prosecution that she returned and
committed the crime

   theres a witness by the name of
ezra hickory who says he saw jane
thurmond leave her house shortly be-
fore midnight he doesnt know where
she went or what she did but he swears
she was carrying a club something that
looked like an ax handle

   subsequently they found the blood-
stained ax handle it was hidden in
the barn on sam pixleys property it
fitted an ax head that was found in
jane thurmonds woodshed


detective fiction weekly

  clint held his pencil poised over his
notebook

   didnt mrs thurmond finally ad-
mit shed been to sam pixleys house
 yes she eventually admitted it
she said some one had telephoned her
that sam pixley had said hed be will-
ing to take over the mortgage she
went over to see sam said nothing
doing the woman left thats her
story

  any finger-prints asked clint
not a finger-print not on the ax
handle not on the box nowhere in the
place there were some old finger-
prints on the ax handle they be-
longed to mrs thurmond thats set-
tled its her ax handle she finally
admitted that but claims she doesnt
know how it got there

    that all 

    thats all

   and what do you want me to do
 clint i want you to go down there
middlevale middlevale county and
get the real inside facts on that crime
you can do it if that woman dies i
want to feel certain shes guilty
clints half closed eyes held some-
thing of a mocking glitter

   theres enough evidence there to
convict a dozen defendants you
shouldnt feel any doubt in your mind
the governor groaned

   i didnt not until you gave that
little dissertation on circumstantial
evidence and how facts lied then i
began to feel uneasy you were so
cocksure so coldly final and youre
nearly always right

  clint smiled enigmatically

  if i do this i shall want two
things he said

   name them

   i shall want to go to the states
prison and pick out a good burglar i
shall pick one who is eligible for pa-

role ill want him to be paroled in
my charge in addition to that i shall
want a tube of radium from the state
hospital with those two things ill
undertake the job

  the governor regarded him with
closely knitted brows

   you seem to want peculiar things
and you dont seem to hesitate any in
thinking what they are

   those are my terms clint said

   oh take em exclaimed the gov-
ernor irritably  my secretary will
fix you up with the necessary papers
ill sign em hang it im almost
beginning to believe you started that
talk about circumstantial evidence just
to make me feel uneasy about this
case

  clint kale reached for his gloves
drew them on with an air of quiet fi-
nality

   i did he smiled

   you did  i wondered what was
the big idea

   i doubt if the womans guilty
there are too many facts and theyre
too conclusive circumstantial evi-
dence is really mighty poor evidence
the facts dont lie but our interpre-
tation of those facts may be wrong
ever since the beginning of time man
has misinterpreted facts he thought
the thunder was the voice of a god
he thought the sun rose in the morning
and set at night the facts were there
man simply didnt have enough knowl-
edge to interpret them correctly

   now in this present case there are
two facts that the jury considered as
pointing to the guilt of jane thurmond
which i consider point to her inno-
cence

  those facts rasped the gov-
ernor

   will be explained later theyre
as evident to you as they are to me
a fair rew ard



theres one thing i want understood
though ive got to use my own meth-
ods here you cant control those

   how do you mean clint

   well im going into a backwater
of life and civilization ive got to
use weapons that those people arent
familiar with theyll all team against
me right at the jump ill be like that
city lawyer that went in there and got
massacred in front of a local jury

   therefore ive got to hit em with
something theyre not accustomed to
ive got to use weapons they dont un-
derstand

   such as  asked the governor

   such as humor for one thing and
applied physics and psychology for an-
other you see this jane thurmond
had only lived in the town for eight
years they all regarded her as being
a rank outsider

  the governor shrugged his shoul-
der

   dont do anything thatll connect
you with me in any way keep this
entirely confidential

  clint nodded

   that he observed as he edged to-
ward the door  was one of the wisest
remarks youve made in a long time
if those chaps put me in the insane
asylum pardon me out

  and he was gone

chapter ii

the scientific detective

the bewildered secretary fixed
clint kale up with the necessary
documents which entitled him to
one quarter-inch tube of radium
valued at some five thousand dollars
also with a letter to the prison board
which enabled clint to check over the
records of some half dozen eligible bur-
glars of unquestioned skill

   i want he told the warden at
length  a man who never smiles i
want a man who looks like an under-
taker on duty with indigestion and a
toothache i want a man who can
open anything except his mouth

  the warden nodded

   you want boston blackie he
said and pressed a button

  boston blackie arrived he was
short solidly built his head was
covered with a shock of black hair his
ebony eyes glared out from beneath
shaggy black brows his face was
covered with black stubble his mouth
was twisted to one side until it seemed
to grow entirely out of one cheek

  in his bearing was the surly defiance
of one who has found all the resources
of existence pitted against him in the
battle of life permanent pessimism
was stamped upon his features

   blackie said the warden not un-
kindly  this is mr clint kale at one
time a professor of psychology a
friend of the governor he wants a
man to do certain things and i have
recommended you

  boston blackie favored clint kale
with a dour appraisal

   my experiments said kale  will
require that the subject come with me
as a servant the duties will be light
there will be fresh air sunshine good
food pleasant work

   ugh huh moaned blackie  you
aint lookin for me

  why not

   no luck ever came my way its
all a mistake

   on the contrary i think youll do
you will be paroled to my charge and
will of course be under my super-
vision

  you mean youre takin me

   yes

   it wont do no good youll get

run over by an automobile or get shot
or somethin ill be back here inside of
a week

  the warden turned to a clerk

   arrange to have this prisoner
paroled to the custody of mr clint
kale

  boston blackie studied kale gloom-
ily his face did not change expression
as he heard the words which secured
him his liberty

  were drivin away from here
he asked

   in my car kale assured him

   drive careful husked boston
blackie

  the town of middlevale seethed
with hissing whispers of gossip

  a detective had arrived was stay-
ing at the palace hotel the detective
was investigating something some
said one thing some another some
said he was an income tax detective
come to check over ezra hickorys re-
turn for the preceding year some said
he was working on a new angle of the
sam pixley murder

  clint kale registered at ten thirty
in the morning

  by noon he was known by sight to
every man woman and child who was
able to walk past the lobby of the hotel

  at twelve thirty a motor truck drew
up to the hotel and kale went out to
greet the driver after a hurried con-
ference the porter was summoned
two loafers were pressed into willing
service and great packages began to
slide to the sidewalk where clint kale
himself supervised unpacking them

  it took three and one half minutes
for the news to reach from one end of
main street to the other another two
minutes for the crowd to gather

  they goggled open-mouthed at the
assortment of machinery

  clint kale had secured this machin-
ery by the simple expedient of calling
upon certain manufacturers of lab-
oratory and dental equipment picking
up the obsolete models they had traded
in on newer equipment then he had
done the same thing with the manu-
facturers of dictating machines had
also called at the salvage department
of the railroad companies picking up
shipments of various paraphernalia
which had been damaged in shipping
refused by the consignee and salvaged
by the railroad

  there were obsolete dictating ma-
chines in which the motive power was
furnished by a tread there were
dental drills which had long ago given
up their last vestige of nickel plate
there were x-ray machines whose
weak bulbs gave forth weird lighting
effects and sputtered hissing sounds of
static throughout the surrounding at-
mosphere there were obsolete radio
sets incapable of tuning in any single
station now that the air was crowded
with programs there were cameras
on tripods old studio cameras ob-
solete equipment of all kind

  and last to be unloaded was a
casket

  under the direction of clint kale
boston blackie opened this casket upon
the sidewalk within wa another
casket slightly smaller that casket
was locked

  clint kale unlocked that casket
opened it boston blackie disclosed
another casket opened that within
was a box there were three padlocks
on the box each requiring a different
key

  clint unlocked them with something
of a flourish

  a small lead box came to view

  clint opened the lead box within
carefully resting in an asbestos nest
a fair reward



was a very small tube something like
a quarter of an inch in length

  kale took some forceps from his
pocket and lifted the capsule with ten-
der reverence then he nodded and
smiled at boston blackie

   the radiums there he said

  boston blackie frowned at the
circle of eager faces which kept nar-
rowing as outer pressure thrust the
craning necks into a smaller area

  well it wont be long he
prophesied

  clint kale turned to his audience a
compact ring of pushing struggling
seething townspeople

   that gentlemen is a tube of gen-
uine radium worth exactly ninety-three
thousand two hundred and thirty-
seven dollars and sixteen cents-
gold

  and then he proceeded to cover the
lead box to snap the padlocks one at
a time to restore box to casket casket
to casket when he had finished the
task he turned to the porters

   take it all up to my room blackie
and i will handle the radium

  there followed a shuffling of steps
the eager hum of voices and the pack-
ing case wreckage was slid to the
gutter eager hands furnished motive
power and the variegated assortment
of machinery was carried across the
hotel lobby up one flight of steps and
installed in kales suite

  in the process the two assistants
were swelled in number until some
thirty volunteers were carrying equip-
ment all for the reward of one glance
at the interior of the mysterious rooms
where all this paraphernalia was to be
used

  when it had all been finally adjusted
to his liking when x-ray machine was
hooked up to obsolete radio when
the loud speaker thundered forth static

which was duly recorded upon the wax
cylinder of an old time dictating
machine clint kale announced him-
self as satisfied thanked those who had
assisted him and announced a desire
to be left alone that he might get to
work

  the men shuffled down the stairs
out through the lobby but they did
not leave the vicinity they milled
into little groups knots of men who
talked in low voices not since the
murder of sam pixley had there been
quite so much excitement in the little
town and the loafers proposed to see
that nothing escaped their observation

  precisely fifteen minutes after the
equipment had been adjusted there
came an imperative knock at the door

 at a word from kale boston
blackie threw it open

  on the threshold stood a pasty-faced
chap an ancient collar around his neck
eager eyes peering from behind thick-
rimmed spectacles in his hand was a
notebook

   im carl rosamond from the
courier he said

  clint kale met him with grave
courtesy

   it is a pleasure mr rosamond i
am not like those detectives who shrink
from the press and seek to carry on
their work in mystery and seclusion
i am fully aware of the power of the
press i know that they can ferret out
any secret that nothing is obscure to
them therefore  have adopted the
policy of confiding to the press in the
fullest detail i give them my most
confidential plans my secret findings
my every thought

  and i only ask of them to treat my
confidences with respect such as i
wish to have published i release for
publication such as i wish to remain
a secret i intrust to the honor of the


detective fiction weekly

high class gentlemen who comprise the
fourth estate

   do come in and sit down my dear
chap

  carl rosamond blinked

  you have questions asked kale

  the reporter pulled out pencil and
notebook

  this stuff he asked waving a
soiled hand at the pile of equipment

  ah yes purred clint kale i
am a detective theres no use con-
cealing the fact from your keen eyes
my dear mr rosamond but i am no
mere blundering detective i am a
scientific detective who supplements
the fallibility of human judgment by
the unerring accuracy of mechanical
investigations

  boston blackie coughed

  carl rosamond gulped

  this thing he asked and waved
toward the x-ray machine

   ah exclaimed clint kale and be-
gan to talk with the rapidity of a ma-
chine gun  as you are doubtless
aware the metaphysicians have long
claimed that the human body is en-
cased in a subtle emanation of the life
force which has been referred to as the
 aura

   for many years their claims were
ridiculed by science but of more rec-
ent years it has been determined that
science was in error by the use of a
certain coal tar product the aura can
be seen even photographed

   now to diverge for the moment
we originally considered the atom to
be the smallest unit of mass in recent
years the atom has been resolved into
electrons we have therefore all mat-
ter reduced to a series of disembodied
negative electrical impulses grouped
about a positive central electrical
nucleus of vibratory composition

   it has even been said that all mat-

ter is electrical vibrational intangible
it is in short but a light whorl a vor-
tex of vibration in a sea of vibrations

    and you may well ask how all this
is connected with my work simply
thus i place a witness before this ma-
chine which amplifies the aura i send
that amplification through two stages
of radio audition i record the result-
ing sound vibration upon a wax cylin-
der which in turn is synchronized
with certain questions at the same
time the amplified aura of the witness
is subject to the photographic recorda-
tion of the ultra violet emanations
the result my dear rosamond is in-
fallible

    you have my permission to pub-
lish that

  the reporter gulped asked more
questions

   those questions were answered in a
patter of scientific jargon which con-
tained the nucleus of thought clothed
in an almost impenetrable covering of
scientific terminology

   when he had finished the reporter
had the flattering feeling of having
been taken into the confidence of a
great man his brain reeled with the
stuff he was permitted to publish his
notebook was crammed with misspelled
words which he could never afterward
decipher and which wouldnt have
made sense if lie could have done so

   he sprinted from the room in time
to make the afternoon paper with a
brief note of his interview that in-
terview found headlines across the en-
tire front of the middlevale courier
 scientific detective reduces crime
detection to certainty read the head-
lines there followed much about
guilt detectors lie arrestors aura

vortexes and kindred matters
a fair reward



  clint kale read the account and
nodded his head with pleasure

  in the meantime the occupants of the
hotel had heard the roar of the stutter-
ing sparks resounding through a loud
speaker the whir of electric motors
the scientific detective was at work
the question was what was he detect-
ing

  the courier had been on the streets
less than half an hour when important
steps thudded their way down the cor-
ridor paused before the door of kales
room there sounded an imperative
hammering on the door panels

  clint kale signed to boston blackie
that individual through the pessimis-
tic habit of long years in the under-
world stood well to one side as he
flung open the door

  the man who blocked the opening
was built somewhat the shape of a huge
barrel his great torso resting  huge
hips was as broad as it was thick the
shoulders were slightly rounded the
neck was a great pillar of fat-incased
muscle a long walrus mustache swept
down from either side of the upper lip
the forehead was low the eyes were
a glitter of malevolent concentration

  whats cornin off here he de-
manded

  clint kale regarded him with casual
indifference he remained seated in
one of the hotels uncomfortable chairs
his slippered feet resting on the bed

   who the hell wants to know he
asked his voice the patronizing drawl
with which one addresses a child

  i do shouted the man and barged
across the threshold

   you would agreed clint kale
still keeping his posture of relaxed in-
attention  and who may i ask are
you

  it was boston blackie who blurted
an answer

   for gods sake boss he warned
 cant you spot em 

  the heavy set man turned a glower-
ing glance in the direction of boston
blackie then swept his glittering eyes
back to clint kale

   im ellery hatcher the chief of
police in this here town

  clint kale reached for a cigarette

   ah yes you would be pardon
me mr hatcher but i never work
with the local police i am only called
into a community to solve that which
has hitherto been unsolved that
means that i am seeking to cover the
inefficiency of the local authorities

   under the circumstances i prefer
to have no business dealings with them
whatever

  the chief of police took a threaten-
ing step forward boston blackies
hand strayed toward the handle of a
hammer which had been used in un-
crating the machinery

   well by heck i got something to
say about that bellowed the officer
 you cant come bustin into my terri-
tory with all these fool contraptions
and then try to ignore me i wont
stand for it

  clint kale slowly removed his slip-
pered feet from the bed dropped the
four legs of the chair to the floor with
a thump and regarded his visitor
quizzically

   chief he said  are there any
speakeasies in town any places where
illegal beverages are dispensed

  the officer snorted

   so youre a revenue agent eh

   not at all i had a purpose in
asking the question

 the answer is no growled
hatcher

   ah yes said kale  not being
any speakeasies of course it follows as
a necessary corollary that you are not


detective fiction weekly

receiving any hush money graft per-
centage rake-off or knock down from
such nefarious enterprises

  the chief sneered

   so thats it

   not at all chief not at all i
merely asked the question because i
am now about to demonstrate to you
the facility with which my lie detector
operates

  and clint kale pressed a button
the electric lights dimmed there
was a whir of a motor the sputter of an
arc the ancient x-ray machine sent
out a flickering light from the old bulb
which had long since ceased to func-
tion properly the radio took up the
song and thundered the static from its
loud speaker

  clint kale took a seat before the
dictating machine worked the treads
with his feet and spoke loudly into the
mouthpiece

   operator this is a test of the
veracity of ellery hatcher the chief
of police of middlevale he has just
testified that there are no speakeasies
in town and that he collects no graft
from them

  kale gestured with his hand

  if youll just sit in that chair fac-
ing the radio machine and with your
profile to the camera chief i shall
demonstrate the unfailing accuracy of
my equipment

  but chief hatcher refused the
proffered chair

  what the hells the idea i aint
on no witness stand i came up here to
see what your doin an i want a re-
port you an me aint goin to have no
fight unless you want to start one but
you gotta cut me in on this particular-
ly on the publicity

   oh yes observed clint kale
 the publicity id forgotten that
boston blackie please see if you can

get that reporter chap on the telephone
young rosamond carl rosamond
call the courier and if you cant get
him there 

  chief hatcher interrupted

   dont call that number its six
fifteen he gets off work about five
thirty and eats at the green star lunch
counter after that he drops in at the
drug store hes a little sweet 
betty gilvray tell you what call
gilvrays drug store you dont need
the number just tell central you want
gilvrays drug store

  boston blackie put through the call
asked for carl rosamond

   here he is

   ah yes exactly remarked clint
kale as he sauntered to the telephone
took the receiver and drawled a lazy
 hello

   good evening mr rosamond
that was a very nice write-up ably
handled i have some more publicity
for you yes this is mr kale the de-
tective yes got your pencil good
get this

   chief hatcher-er what were the
initials again mr hatcher-oh yes
chief ellery hatcher of the local
police force denied emphatically that
there were any speakeasies in the city
or that he received any graft from the
operators of the same when asked to
take the chair in front of the lie de-
tector and repeat that statement he re-
fused   

  there was the sound of swift mo-
tion the pad of heavy feet behind kale
and that individual hastily slipped the
receiver back on the hook turned to
face the irate rage-distorted features
of the chief of police

  what the devils the idea you
poor sap what do you think youre
trying to do you try that stuff on
me and ill break your damned neck
a fair reward



youre trying to ruin me in my home
town all right wait and see what
happens to you

   you wanted publicity murmured
clint kale  this would make dandy
publicity the metropolitan newspa-
pers would probably copy it  

  with an inarticulate roar the chief
flung past him out of the door

   ill have to kill that copy he
snorted  and then ill be back ill be
back

  the door banged

chapter iii

insult intentional

t tell be back croaked boston
  x  blackie lugubriously

        think so really asked
clint kale

   think so i know it ever know
anything about a rubber hose boss
 they use it to sprinkle gardens
with dont they

   yeah and guys like him can work
wonders with about a three-foot length
of it hell be back youll learn some-
thin about police officers

  thatll be fine i wonder who our
next visitor will be

   maybe the local undertaker he
might get an inside tip an-

  he broke off as steps sounded in
the hall once more

  these steps contained something of
a swaggering strut to their rhythm
they paused before the door a well-
timed knock rat-a-tatted on the panels

  boston blackie in response to a
gesture from kale eased himself to
one side and opened the door

  the man who stood on the threshold
had carefully dressed for the part he
was to play there was about him an
appreciation of the dramatic a pose
of haughty learning of contained dig-

nity he was a man who had carefully
planned each step as he went through
life devoting his attention to impress-
ing his fellow men

  he was tall thin hatchet-faced his
gray hair had been swept back from
the high forehead the frock coat was
an impressive black emphasizing the
high whiteness of the collar the flow-
ing black tie

as he stood there at rigid attention
he thrust one hand within his vest and
spoke in a voice which reverberated
through the room in studied eloquence
mr clint kale the detective
clint bowed

  and i have the honor of address-
ing

  thomas jefferson train sir the
district attorney of this county

  clint sank back in his chair as
though disappointed

  oh shucks he exclaimed audibly
well come on in

  the lawyer stalked with stately dig-
nity into the room his pale eyes sweep-
ing over the miscellaneous assortment
of equipment

   i read of your advent in the paper
mr kale and you will appreciate my
natural curiosity as to the particular
matter which you may have under in-
vestigation it is only natural that i
should enjoy your confidence your
complete confidence your utter con-
fidence your implicit confidence
and the district attorney stalked to
a chair executed a right turn paused
flipped the tails of his frock coat to
either side and jackknifed himself into
a sitting position

  clint kale leaned forward

  you take the middlevale courier
may i ask

   certainly sir as one in a public
position i deem it my duty to sub-
scribe to each and every paper printed


detective fiction weekly

within the confines of my county the
middlevale courier is one of the most
reliable of the sheets it has always
supported my candidacy for public
office

  i see well mr thomas jefferson
train if youll read the columns of the
courier from time to time youll enjoy
as much of my confidence as i care to
make public

  the lawyer flushed then thrust a
hand within the breast of his coat as-
suming an oratorical posture

  your attitude sir is scarcely that
of one who desires to enforce the ex-
isting laws and statutes upon our
books i may assure you that nothing
more than such an arbitrary rude and
unusual statement is needed to arouse
my suspicions i am to believe then
that you are in league with the criminal
element anxious to obstruct rather
than to expedite anxious to avoid
rather than to enforce law and justice

  i had even heard a rumor sir that
you were employed at the behest of
that foul murderess that blood-
thirsty jezebel jane thurmond i
understand that you were trying to
upset a just conviction in a court of
justice a conviction that has been
affirmed by the highest appellate tri-
bunal in this state

  clint kale put his head in his hands

   dont make me appreciate the
depths of my own infamy he begged
 your accusation makes my activities
seem illegal

  thomas jefferson train nodded
gravely

   they are

   but suppose the conviction was
unjust

   she was tried by a jury of her
peers

   but the two witnesses who swore
they saw her at sam pixleys house

suppose they were lying couldnt i
place them upon that chair in front of
my lie detector couldnt i subject
them to a scientific test to determine
their credibility

  the district attorneys long neck
pivoted inside his high collar as he
gravely shook his head in dignified
negation

   no that would be reopening a
case which i have pronounced closed
i came to advise you of that

  and this man this ezra hickory
how of him

   a most valuable witness a client
of mine by the way

   a client i thought you were the
peoples attorney

   i am but the emoluments of this
office in a small county are not
sufficent to furnish a satisfactory re-
muneration for the highest legal talent
it has therefore been the policy of the
legislature to allow a district attorney
in counties such as these to accept cer-
tain outside employment 

   i see but suppose one of your
clients should commit a crime would
you feel free to prosecute them

   my clients would not commit
crimes sir

   then it would only be necessary
for a man to pay you a retainer to
secure virtual immunity from prosecu-
tion during your term of office

   very emphatically not i merely
remarked that i am careful in choos-
ing my clients they are not of the
criminal class

  i see how about ezra hickory
   how about him indeed 

   thats all i wanted to know do
you suppose the fact that you were his
private counsel may have influenced
his testimony in the murder case do
you suppose knowing you were desper-
ately in need of a witness who had

	d
a fair reward



seen the defendant near the home of
the deceased at around midnight he
stretched his imagination a point-
thomas jefferson train un jack-
knifed his tall figure stood with tel-
escopic rigidity while he frowned por-
tentously

  sir you are insulting me

  clint kale turned to boston blackie
with a gleeful smile

   hes got it blackie hes got the
idea at last

  the lawyer covered the distance
from chair to door in three long strides

   you shall suffer for this he de-
claimed and then he too banged the
door

  oh gawd moaned boston
blackie theyll frame a murder rap
on us now why did i ever get into
this mess i was so happy in my cell
compared with what inf goin to get
into leme go back tell the warden

i	violated parole

  clint kale shook his head

  no blackie i need you i need
your cheerful optimism of character
but i was going to give you a telegram
to send  wouldnt send it from
middlevale the town gets gossip
around a little too speedily youd
better hire a car and drive across
the county line send it from center
city

  boston blackie took the telegram
mournfully put on his hat and coat

   ill probably find you in jail
maybe theyll frame something on you
thatll get you lynched i aint got no
relatives but youd better make a list
of your relatives an the address of
where you want the body sent mail it
to your friends and send a copy to the
hospital an the undertaker

  and he closed the door with thefirm
determination of a martyr marching
grimly to his doom

 	d

  he would perhaps have been even
more mournful had lie known the con-
tents of the message he carried it was
addressed to the warden of the state
prison and was as follows

  communicate at once criminal record
  of boston blackie to chief of police
  here ask to report if this party in his
  vicinity send photos and finger-prints

  but boston blackie handed the
sealed envelope to the telegraph
operator in the neighboring city
handed over the bill kale had given
him received his change contemplated
the advisability of breaking his parole
finally decided against it and returned
to middlevale

  he found his employer peacefully
snoring

  boston blackie locked all doors
barricaded the windows and then
sought his own bed long into the
night he could be heard restlessly toss-
ing and turning

  morning dawned and found carl
rosamond pencil and notebook in
hand waiting in the corridor as soon
as clint kale left the room for break-
fast the reporter attached himself like
a bur

   youre in bad he cautioned

  clint kale nodded

  awful bad he agreed

   and then some added rosa-
mond

   yes groaned kale  ive lost
my radium

   whats that

  yes my radium its gone it was
worth exactly ninety-three thousand
two hundred and thirty-seven dollars
and sixteen cents-gold

  the reporter stared goggle-eyed

   i want to put a want ad in your
lost and found department offering
one thousand dollars for the return of


detective fiction weekly

that tube of radium and no questions
asked

  the reporters pencil was busy

   good lord that wont be neces-
sary youll get all the space you want
a want ad wouldnt amount to any-
thing iil smear the story all over the
front page robbed you think 

  the gloom upon clint kales coun-
tenance deepened

  robbed im afraid he said it
was done so cleverly i didnt have any
idea of it not until this morning

   gee breathed the reporter his
news sense causing him to forget his
audience  what a story scientific de-
tective coming to this city to in-
vestigate obscure crime is robbed first
rattle out of the box of a hundred
thousand dollars worth of radium
used in connection with his lie detector
gee thats a wow ill telephone that
in to the city newspapers gosh what
a story

  clint kale scowled

   that wouldnt be very good adver-
tisement for me would it

  the reporter shrugged his shoulders
 its news an we gotta print the
news

   of course

  have you any theories

  no only i shall recover the
radium the reward will do it its of
no commercial value only hospitals
and lie detectors scientific laboratories
and certain limited manufacturers are
in the market for radium it will be
returned ill be out the reward
thats all

  the reporter nodded

   i think ill get off an extra he
said

  yes yes do so my scientific ap-
paratus is greatly curtailed in efficiency
as long as the radium is missing be
sure to state that i think it is merely

lost or that if it was stolen it will be
thrown away by the thief in order to
escape detection discount the theory
of theft

  the reporter hesitated a moment

   i shall report the facts he said
and walked away

  clint kale sidled up to the lunch
counter in the gloomy restaurant the
odor of stale grease was a rancid insult
to the nostrils the place was blue
with the by-products of cooking

  the tired-eyed girl smeared a bare
arm over a perspiring forehead

   we got ham an eggs or steak
whichll you have

  clint kale picked ham and eggs

  a shadow fell over the counter he
looked back and up ellery hatcher
the chief of police was grinning down
at him and the grin was triumphant

   hear you lost somethin

   yes

   maybe you wont be so highhat
now

   i fail to follow your reasoning

   haw haw haw the big detective
comes to town to show us guys up an
what happens gets held up and a mil-
lion dollars of radium stolen haw
haw haw

  clint looked around apprehensively

   not so loud

  chief hatcher raised his voice

   and it takes the local police to
come to the rescue you got a crook
workin for you an we have to tell
you that hes boston blackie a
parole and the big house wants the
dope on him i wired in a report this
mornin theyll likely wire me back to
pick him up

  clint straightened dropped knife
and fork clattering to the lunch
counter

  youre sure

   of course im sure i knewm the
a fair reward



minute i clapped eyes on him but i
sent in a wire to find out if they still
wanted him they sent me his picture
and finger-print classifications and
told me to report in detail haw haw
haw

   but protested clint  how could
you know 

   oh we know boasted chief hat-
cher swinging his triumphant glance
to include the circle of gawking faces
which had assembled as by magic
us country police aint boobs we
know our way about-even if we dont
donate no million dollars worth of
radium to crooks haw haw haw

  clint kale seemed to have lost his
appetite he paid for his check clapped
his hat on his head and sprinted for the
hotel nor did he emerge from his
room the entire day

chapter iv
 what about the reward 

al night boston blackie carefully
 coached in the part he was to
play moaning dire calamity to
come slipped from the back entrance
and made his way to the home of ezra
hickory he was the unwilling cus-
todian of the radium

   i want your help he husked

  ezra hickory a wrinkled specimen
of hardened manhood fastened cold
eyes upon the man

   youre a convict he rasped

  boston blackie started

  you know that

   sure

  boston blackie groaned

   thats the tough part of it i am
and the boss lost a tube of radium it
spilled out i happened to find it
theres a reward offered for it but
if i should say i found it theyd bring
up my criminal record and i not only

wouldnt get no reward id get put
back in the big house with another
sentence hung on me

  now i was figuring that youre an
old-established citizen here and youre
a client of the district attorney maybe
if you was to find this here radium
there wouldnt be nothing said youd
collect the reward and then we could
go fifty-fifty

  ezra hickory glanced up and down
the dark lane which led to his secluded
dwelling frogs were booming in
various cadences a whippoorwill whis-
tled his mournful note an owl hooted
from the telephone post at the corner
of the driveway everywhere were
evidences of isolation

   come in here where theres light
he invited

  boston blackie entered the hallway
produced a golden capside from his
pocket

  how much is she worth asked
ezra

   pretty near a hundred thousand
dollars even money

  how much is the reward

   the boss offered a thousand hed
pay ten if he had to

  ezra wrinkled his brow shrewdly
any way of identifying this here
bit of radium as belonging to clint
kale

   none whatever

   humph murmured ezra

 you an me fifty-fifty on the re-
ward said boston blackie

  ezra extended his hand

   give it to me he said

  boston blackie passed it over

   you gotta put it some place you
cant carry it for no length of time
it  burn the skin thats what they
use it for burnin out cancer and such
stuff

  ezra hickory regarded the small


detective fiction weekly

capsule then his face stiffened in de-
cision

   you wait right here he said
 dont move

  and he glided out of the hallway
into the house as furtively as a
shadow

  ten minutes later he was back

   the chief o police is lookin for
you hes got authorization from the
penitentiary to pick you up as a parole
violator and the district attorney is
aiming to frame a crime on you because
your boss was highhat to him you
better do somethin

  boston blackie collapsed on the
stoop

   oh my god he moaned  as
bad as that

   worse croaked ezra hickory

   gee whatll i do

   im goin to help you ill put you
in my machine an you can get to the
state line well get there in a couple
of hours ill give you money to get
away with you better keep movin
 how about my half of the re-
ward asked boston blackie

   what reward 

   for the radium i gave you of
course

   you didnt give me no radium
said ezra hickory

   the hell i didnt

   the hell you didnt do you want
a lift to the state line and money to
get away on or do you want me to call
the chief an tell him i found you
prowlin around the house

  and ezra hickory produced a big
revolver levelled it at the whimpering
figure of boston blackie

   i want a lift to the state line said
boston blackie  how much get-away
money do i get

   enough i dont want to have em
catch you

  you wont get into no trouble
asked boston blackie

   heh heh heh chuckled ezra
hickory  the district attorneys my
private personal lawyer heh heh
heh

  they went to the garage the light
flivver roared into activity and jolted
away into the darkness 

  minutes passed the frogs failed
to resume their chorus the owl had
ceased to hoot the whippoorwill had
faded into the night

  a furtive shadow glided along the
driveway inserted a skeleton key in
the front door and entered the house
the shadow became a figure of a man
carrying a heavy bag the bag was
opened a flash light taken out also a
glass jar

  the light of the flash disclosed the
features of clint kale

  he took the glass jar a curious con-
trivance which contained an insulated
rod on the top of the rod was a but-
ton at the lower end of the rod safe-
ly incased in the glass were bits of
gold leaf hanging limply

  clint kale took an ebonite rod
rubbed it briskly waved it over the
metal button after an interval he
touched the button with his finger
withdrew the rod

  the bits of gold leaf attached to the
end of the insulated rod flew apart re-
mained rigidly erect each repelling the
other

  clint kale had created an electro-
scope the bits of gold leaf each being
charged with a similar kind of static
electricity repelled each other yet let
them come in contact with a field of
electrical energy the charges would be
dispelled and the leaf would collapse

  holding the electroscope in his left
hand nestled in a specially constructed
holder clint kale moved about the
a fair reward



house holding the electroscope near
the walls sliding it over the floor push-
ing it up to within a short distance of
the ceiling

  room by room he went through the
place

  in the cellar he slid the electroscope
past a section of what appeared to be
solid concrete of a sudden the leaves
of the instrument collapsed

  clint marked the place then he
again separated the gold leaf and began
a series of experiments when he had
finished he had a certain section of
wall carefully marked

  he gave that section careful atten-
tion

  its secret was disclosed only after
microscopic examination the section
of wall had been so cunningly fitted
that it was almost impossible to notice
the lines which marked the junction of
the removable section and the rest of
the wall

  clint kale removed the section

  there was disclosed a hidden recess
in that recess was the tube of radium
also certain other papers and docu-
ments a great pile of currency

  clint went back upstairs got out a
camera and tripod from the bag he had
brought to the house with him and got
to work

  he made a double exposure on the
plate one exposure was of the opened
recess with its papers its currency its
radium the other exposure was from
the same place but with the section of
wall back in place

  the plate when developed would
give the x-ray effect of a solid wall
behind which would be visible the docu-
ments the money the radium cap-
sule

  clint exposed another plate in the
same manner

  then he carefully packed up all his

belongings and left the house as
furtively as he had entered

chapter v

trick photography

it was well toward noon when the
thump of many steps sounded in the
corridor of the palace hotel heavy
knuckles sounded imperatively upon
the wooden panel

  clint kale opened the door

  the solemn-faced delegation greeted
him with elaborate formality there
was chief ellery hatcher there was
carl rosamond the reporter of the
courier there was thomas jefferson
train and there was the wizened form
of the astute ezra hickory

   mr kale said the chief  this
here is ezra hickory

  clint kale bowed

   a client of mine hastily inter-
osed the district attorney  and ill
do the talking-all of it for my client
of course

   you are now speaking in your
private capacity asked clint kale

   certainly snapped the district at-
torney

   wheres boston blackie smirked
the chief

  clint kale spread his hands palms
out in a deprecatory gesture

   gone

   skipped said the chief

  clint shrugged

  thomas jefferson train cleared his
throat

 you lost a capsule of radium

   yes

   that is very valuable

   very

   you advertised offering a reward
and no questions asked

   not exactly i wanted to but
rosamond advised against it there-


detective fiction weekly

fore no formal offer of reward was
ever made

  the district attorneys face twitched
 you cant get around it by no such
technicality he said  my client
found that radium or some radium
he gestured to ezra hickory that
individual took from his pocket a pack-
age the package was undone a gold
capsule fell to the table

   thats it yelled clint and
swooped toward the capsule

  chief hatchers hairy paw snapped
down upon his wrist

   no ye dont said the chief

   youll have to identify it as yours
first said the district attorney

   but of course its mine how else
would any radium get to this com-
munity  why not have your client tell
how he got it

   that said train with dignity
 will come later for the present we
are inquiring into your title the thing
that makes me more suspicious than
anything else is the small amount of
the reward offered according to your
own declaration this radium is worth
approximately one hundred thousand
dollars yet the reward you offer is
but a paltry thousand that in itself
is enough to indicate that it is not the
same radium

   as district attorney i could not
allow this radium to be turned over to
you until the circumstances convinced
me it was the same radium

  speaking officially asked clint
speaking officially rasped the
district attorney

  if the reward were increased it
would convince you

   yes

   speaking officially

   speaking officially

   your client would get that re-
ward

   naturally

   and you would collect a per-
centage 

   of course

   officially

   no sir speaking privately now
in my capacity of private attorney
clint kale rubbed a hand over the
angle of his jaw

   you seem to have me sort of
sewed up

  the lawyer said nothing

  ezra hickorys features softened in-
to a half smile

  the chief of police snickered au-
dibly

   what reward would you sug-
gest

   as district attorney i should say
a reward of ten thousand dollars would
prove that you really felt the radium
was yours

   speaking officially

   yes

   thats a lot of money

   my client would be willing to ac-
cept it in full as a rewrard

   speaking privately now mr
train i take it

   speaking privately sir

  clint sighed

   guess im hooked he admitted
 but first ill have to make certain
scientific tests to determine that this is
really the radium

   you have my permission
  officially

   both official and private the chief
will keep an eye on you and see theres
no funny business

  clint picked the capsule up with a
pair of forceps weighed it carefully
noted the weight

   i shall require a bit of blued steel
to rub it over he said

  blued steel

   yes
a fair reward	

  the chief of police tugged at his
holster produced a six-shooter

   ah thank you chief set it
down there right by mr hickory if
you will thats fine now watch
the barrel

  tie took the forceps ran the capsule
over the steel

   leave it there for a moment or
two and see if the oxidation brings out
any apparent change in the barrel
now one more thing i have to tell
where this radium was stored while it
was absent from me if radium is
stored for any length of time in an
electrical field it tends to lose its energy

   however fortunately radium is
sufficiently active to impress a photo-
graphic plate with its environment let
me place the capsule between two plate
holders fine now well put them
in this developing box put on the top
pour developer in the opening now
theres nothing else to do while we wait
for the plates to develop

   tell me since were all here gen-
tlemen how about that sam pixley
case

   that what you came down here to
investigate asked chief hatcher

  yes i might as well admit it
it is

   the case is closed said the dis-
trict attorney

  ezra hickory said nothing

   i always felt said clint kale
speaking in a reflective monotone
 that the woman wasnt guilty her
testimony is too utterly incredible to
have been fabricated the telephone call
to go see pixley the finding of the
package of currency in the exact
amount recpiired to pay off the mort-
gage only a fool would have told
such a story if it were the truth not
even a fool would have made up such
a yarn as a lie

   but there were no finger-prints on
the job that indicates mental shrewd-
ness but most convincing of all the
shares of stock in a worthless com-
pany were left untouched but only a
few of the older inhabitants knew that
this stock was worthless mrs thur-
mond had only lived here eight years
the history of that stock goes back
farther than that

  clint ceased speaking smiled around
him

   i think the nlates have developed
we will now pour off the developer
and put in the hypo to fix them

  he walked to the wash bowl poured
off liquid washed the plates poured
off the washing water poured hypo
through the light-proof opening that
was placed in the top of the develop-
ing box

  then he returned to his chair

   i have carefully examined the
transcript he said  it seems to me
that the testimony of ezra hickory
was the determining factor in the con-
viction

  ezra hickory squirmed in his chair

   i have long wanted to talk with
mr hickory to get him to face my
lie detector

  thomas jefferson train cleared his
throat with a metallic rattle

   youll settle this matter of the re-
ward first he rasped

   betcha life growled chief
hatcher

   ill tell my story anywhere
s n a p p e d ezra hickory glancing
around him with some visible appre-
hension as he took in the various equip-
ment of the place

   fine agreed clint and took the
top off the developing box  we can
now inspect the plates

  they were perfect exposures

   look here said clint draining


detective fiction weekly

one and holding it to the light  you
can see where this radium was stored
the last few hours theres a wall
but the radio rays go right through
the wall and give a perfect photograph
of the interior there are some stocks
and some currency look you can
even see the names on the stocks the
numbers of the shares- lets see
theres a name theres a number
theres a date stock in the-no its
bonds-bonds in the hanover irriga-
tion district and here are some dia-
monds-most interesting one has
only to seek such a wall-

  there was a flourish of motion

  ezra hickory had snatched the blued
steel six-shooter from the desk

   hands up he yelled

  his hearers stared at him with wide
eyes

  the little man brandishing the
weapon scuttled for the bathroom
went through it to the communicating
room opened the hall doorway

  a state officer was posted at the
end of the corridor

  ezra hickory didnt hesitate he
raised the weapon to his temple

  there was the roar of an explosion
the sound of a limp body thudding to
the floor

  he was dying as they reached him

  he rattled out a confession as they
took him to the ambulance he died
as he reached the hospital

chapter vi
he got his reward

governor kfndall frowned

over the desk at the dapper fig-
ure that lounged in the chair
across from him on the desk was
the signed pardon which liberated jane
thurmond also on the desk were
copies of the middlevale courier

  the governor indicated those copies
with a wave of his hand

 i dont like your methods he said
whats wrong with them i told
you id have to be more or less un-
conventional that paraphernalia was
just a stage setting

   oh it isnt that its the casual
manner in which you made it possible
for ezra hickory to shoot himself in
fact you fixed it so he couldnt do
much else

   oh that remarked clint kale
with a shrug  it was after all only
a matter of reward ezra wanted his
just reward he came with his at-
torney to collect it he got it

   humph shrugged the executive
 how long had you known he was
guilty

   some time the newspaper re-
ports showed he must be the woman
didnt have enough mentality to guard
against finger-prints not if she was as
foolish about the rest of the facts as
she seemed and in any event she
wouldnt have known the worthless na-
ture of the american carbonator
stock

  the governor sighed

   and you staged that elaborate
third degree with the idea ezra
hickory would save the state the ex-
pense of his trial

  clint shrugged

   it would have embarrassed the dis-
trict attorney to have had to prosecute
ezra he might have been half-hearted
about it and ezra would have been
shrewd enough to get a local lawyer

   no he was there to collect his
reward he got it

  the governor slammed the blotter
down upon the signed pardon

   get out of here he said  and let
me think just what im going to tell
the newspaper reporters
a line to lefty

       coats decides to  pick em dumb  after one experi-
       ence with a girl who things faster than he shoots

 f ll take that rod coats said
 suddenly

       for a sultry minute hiding with
lowered lids eyes that were murder-
ously aflame coats would let byrne
do all the talking let him strut his
stuff

  then ill take that rod a whip-
crack

  foolishly byrne had taken his
hand from his pocket saying it with
words wasnt quite enough he

wanted to add the gesture of snapping
his fingers at coats

  he didnt snap his fingers coats
flying at the chance had made one of
those split-second miracle draws of
his his gun squeezed free in its
holster under his left arm flashed into
his hand as uncannily as a sleeved ace
into a magicians

  byrne stopped short staring with
round dazed eyes at that dark hole in
the pistol muzzle aimed uphill at his


detective fiction weekly

heart his palms jerked to a level with
his reddening ears and remained
elevated after coats had deftly rid his
pocket of the blue-steel weight that had
sagged it

  now go on an tell me lefty
coats invited  tell me where i get
off at

  a ear rolled into the garage and one
of the four hard-mouthed passengers
it had brought walked to the door of
the office in back wliat he saw
wrenched a startled oath from him

  you birds rehearsin something

  coats turned a razor-thin smile on
the questioner

   lo jimmy walsh he said
 no-it aint a rehearsal its a play

  yeah the newcomers stolid
gaze reappraised the tableau and
fastened on coats-blank  i dont
get it

   the play itself thats what it is
coats repeated his rhetorical figure
pleased him and he extended it
 wrote and produced by mr lefty
byrne i was supposed to be the dog
audience for th try-out-see what
im doing right now im callin the
author

  he exploded with a brief laugh of
self-appreciation and then his voice
went harsh

  still too fast for yuh walsh
well ill tell you another way lefty
made a collection to-day-got the
dough for that load of fancy stuff that
went out on the north shore satur-
day five grand he should a turned in
and would you ask me what he tried
to turn in instead his resignation

 lefty byrne who had turned
several colors directly before walshs
intrusion was all scarlet

  listen jimmy he appealed
hoarsely  is a fella tied to any racket
with a ball an chain cant he do a

fade-away when he wants to-if he
can walk out clean  sam owes me that
five grand every dime of it breakin
with him why shouldnt i hold it
walsh blinked and shrugged de-
ferring to coats

   dont ask me he said  im not
the big shot in this racket sam runs
the mob

  tootin right i do coats grimly
affirmed and anything you got
coinin from me byrne is paid when
im ready to pay you dont snatch it
see fork over

  lefty byrne swallowed hard ant
forked five crackling notes went on
the desk and were swept casually into
a drawer

   ill put em in a better place coats
said after im done with yuh i want
to hear some more my mind was
somewheres else so maybe i didnt get
you straight the first time im sittin
back here safe am i grabbin the kale
while the boys take all th risk i aint
gave you a fair break aint i 

  he had put down the pistol and
byrne taking that to mean the passing
of his crisis drew a deep breath the
film that had dulled his eyes passed
away blue and steady they met
coatss glare

   be reasonable sam he urged
 if i got on my ear it wras your fault

i	brought th dough in didnt i and
wasnt i on the up-an-up with you
sayin i wanted to junk the booze
runnin game an buy that gas station
up in yonkers an settle down
sure grinned coats you as
much as told me heres your five
grand sam only you dont get it
then you went up in the air because i
couldnt see it that way

  lefty byrne shook his head
now wait he protested softly
 what happened you made a rotten
a line to lefty



crack about-about a certain party a
lady friend a mine

   which murmured coats with a
wink for walsh  was dorcas odon-
nell right be a good guy byrne an
tell jimmy what youre goin to do to
me if i ever look cock-eyed at that
dizzy dame a yours again

   oh walsh said and smirked
 her

  were goin to get married byrne
told him ciuicklv  married-regular
get that

   i got a picture a dorcas odon-
nell sittin home and darnin socks
crowed coats  say unless she mar-
ried a bank roll big enough to buy her
all the excitement on broadway shed
be back to the hostess racket in th
gold slipper before the weddin
flowers faded

  walsh saw something ominous in
the tautening of lefty byrnes jaw
and the swift hunching of his shoul-
ders

  well i dunno he interjected
hurriedly attempting a diplomatic
diversion  shes got a domestic streak
at that dorcas has i mean you got to
hand it to her she does her own
laundry i know

   whose business is it byrne de-
manded truculently if she does
lets just drop her out of th conversa-
tion walsh he transferred his
frown to coats  now that youve got
the money sam and a portion of my
sentiments along with it i guess i
might as well take the air

  coats put out a big hand and
dropped it significantly over the two
pistols lying side by side on the
desk

   guess he snapped  again
youre not walking off lefty as free
an easy as all that you know too
much to be let stroll out a here sore

head beat it upstairs an take a nice
peaceful nap for yourself

  he threw a nod to walsh

   take him up jim put him in his
own room and turn th key on him
his case is goin to take some heavv
thinkin

ii

for one instant byrne hesitated
weighing his chance for a break
against the dubious aftermath of
acquiescence once lie was upstairs
coats had him in the bag if big sam
made up his mind that way they could
put him on the spot right here-use
that rod of sams that had the silencer
on it and bump him without a sound
getting to the street or if they wanted
to make a fancy job of it they could
pile him into a machine and take him
for one of those quiet little one-way
rides into the country

  as he stared past walsh poised for
a dash the square of the outer twilight
up in front was already narrowing
the steel garage door rumbling on its
rollers it closed with a clank-and that
was that his only choice then was to
give in to play to coats

   okay sam he said  ill chase
on up-but say get that funny idea
out a your bean wont yuh whether
we split or whether we dont im no
squawker you ought to know me
betterll that by this time

  for a little coats studied him and
again the red lids dropped over his
eyes when he spoke there was a note
of concession in his voice-a straw
that lefty byrne snatched at grate-
fully

   oh hell he said  forget that
the reason im boldin yuh lefty i
dont want yuh goin out mad well
talk about the money end later when
were both feelin better go on along


detective fiction weekly

now hit th hay maybe youll wake
up with different notions about givin
the mob the go-by

  the three riders who had arrived in
the big touring car with walsh looked
curiously after byrne as he started up
the stairs back to the office evidently
they had overheard enough to know
hed had a falling out with coats and
their chill silence told him plainly
enough whose side theyd be on at a
show-down the fact that theyd all
been pals that theyd fought side by
side in a dozen skirmishes with hi-
jackers-all that would be overboard
if sam ever turned his thumb down

  walsh himself said nothing until
they were on the second story thread-
ing through the dusty and idle
machinery that camouflaged the big
shots diversions of government-doped
alcohol by way of his withdrawal per-
mit for beautiful doll boudoir prepa-
rations inc

  up there remote from coatss ears
walsh deplored

   somethin must a rattled loose in
your head lefty you tyin into sam
that way a wonder he didnt turn the
smoke on you instead a just the gas
 i guess it is byrne agreed
moodily  but theres a limit to what
a guy can take jim he shouldnt a
brought in the kid-thats all i think
lies beginning to see it that way him-
self

  yeah liell be all right now
walsh opined  all you got to do is
tell him you changed your mind about
jumpin the racket and everythingll
be hotsy-totsy again that was his
main grouch-dont you see it hes
short-handed now the way things are
openin up

  another stairway took them out of
the powdery precincts of the beautiful
doll preparations to the third and up-

permost floor of the garage building
the  cell-block the mob called that
particular department of the coats
menage it had bpen partitioned by
bleak walls of hollow tile into half a
dozen sleeping rooms and each was
furnished with a good bed and a
dresser

  lefty byrne walked directly into a
cubicle at the rear that had been
 home  to him for the last couple of
years-all the home hed thought he
would ever want until hed discovered
dorcas

  shifting the key from the inside of
the door to the outside walsh depre-
cated   this is applesauce lefty but
you know how sam is we dont
either of us want to rub him the wrong
way

  byrne grinned wanly

   its all right by me he said  do
your duty sheriff

  he was at the window staring out
over cluttered back yards at a rectangle
of light in a tall seedy building below
when the key turned evening had
come and dorcas was up preening
herself for the nights grind at the
gold slipper

  lefty had seen her first from where
he stood now it came back to him as
vivid as if it had been yesterday that
broiling afternoon street cars and
trucks roaring so you couldnt hear
he at his window and the girl covered
by some filmy silk thing gasping at
hers their exchange of smiles he
had made a street corner rendezvous
by signs though at first she had
laughed shaking her head all that-
the beginning

  the beginning and how was it
going to end

  she wras expecting him to drop in
at the gold slipper to-night but he
wasnt going to be there to-morrow
a line to lefty



slicd be certain then hed come around
to the flat would he though a
chill came on him again who could
say what to-morrow had in store

  hungrily he watched her shadow on
that shade down the line passing re-
passing slim and quick he prayed
that shed come to the window and
look out then hed switch his own
light on and try to show her in panto-
mime that circumstances prevented
the keeping of dates just now

  but she didnt come her light went
out presently and even that tantalizing
shadow of her was gone

  he smoked a cigarette in darkness
before he reached for the switch and
threw himself on his bed with a much-
thumbed book

   money in gas was the books
title and it was further described on
its cover as  a practical guide for the
independent filling station owner

ill

in the dressing room at the gold
slipper toward midnight a large
 glittering blond lady-the famous
tennessee martin in person and ex-
tremely so-cast eyes of concern upon
the prettiest of all her dancing sub-
hostesses miss dorcas odonnell

  why she asked so pensive
its early for a headache

  the slender dark girl made a
grimace of repugnance

   honey she said  im not here
for headaches not since i collected
a real one once and missed a date
they could sail the leviathan right up
to the bandstand on all the loaded ap-
ple-juice ive spilled to-night

   whats wrong then

  the girl sighed

   everything this time-a dates
missed me a very special one

 love deary said miss martin

 is a disease and youre a hospital
case if i ever saw one but cheer up
the boy friend will be here when he
gets here you ought to know theres
lots of night work in a profession like
his hearts may ache and women
may weep but somebodys got to go
down to the sea in speed boats
dorcas odonnell shuddered

   i cant laugh it off she protested
 ive got a feeling that-somethings
happened it wasnt just the every-
day risk that lefty was going to face
when i saw him this afternoon he
was bound to have a showdown with
the man hes been working for-and
that mans a killer tennessee its
no secret if i mentioned who he was
and lefty was yours youd be in a
panic too i tell you im scared to
death of what im going to see in the
papers when i leave here

  the gold slippers buxom hostess-
in-chief threw an arm around the girls
trembling white shoulder

   then the best thing chickie she
comforted  is to leave before the pa-
pers are out get on your things this
minute and taxi along home and
dont sit up when you get there think-
ing horrible things thatll be funny in
the morning go to sleep rest is
what your nerves need

  good advice-but how could she fol-
low it across the dingy yards the
starlight showed her lefty byrnes
window standing open did it mean
as it always had before that he was
there if he was why hadnt he come
uptown why when he knew shed
be anxiously waiting holding her
breath anguished with fear for
him 

  it was dawn before she dozed but
at nine she was up heavy-eyed and
at the window again

  a glad crv escaped her lefty bvrne

was at his own window there and
in just the pose of that first day of
theirs a leg thrown up on the sill a
cigarette in his fingers

  he saw her at the moment of her
appearance and she divined he had
been watching for her he waved
she beckoned he shook his head-and
she couldnt understand that

  lefty was trying to make her under-
stand  working in what seemed a
frenzy of gesticulation to get some
message to her across that void filled
with the racket of the  l  trains and
the flat-wheeled surface cars the strain-
ing trucks and the ceaselessly honking
smaller fry of fast side traffic

  he pointed down and shook his
head he pointed behind him and shook
his bead he took out a billfold held
it upside down open empty and shook
his head again

  come over she called desperate-
ly  come over and tell me

  her voice was a whisper in a thun-
derstorm he couldnt hear her she
knew he couldnt but he could guess
he spread his hands helplessly that
meant he couldnt come maybe why

  while she was trying to puzzle that
out he vanished from the window
just before he vanished he bad turned
quickly as if some one had come into
the room behind him what did that
mean why hadnt he stopped for a
good-by wave

  impulse took her to the telephone
when after long minutes lefty hadnt
reappeared

  it was coats who answered her ring
at the garage hed been drinking
his voice was thick and surly but it
smoothed when she spoke her name

   why no kiddo he said  lefty
aint around just now he laughed
anybody else do

  she stiffened at the he

   where she asked  is he then 
  coats hesitated

   hes out on a little errand ought
to be back any minute why dont
you come over an wait for him

  she could think of several good rea-
sons why she shouldnt but swiftly she
was aware of a still bigger and better
reason for not presenting them
around at the garage she might find
the answer to the mystery

   maybe she said with a thin echo
of that widely-imitated engagingly
amiable gurgle introduced in night club
circles by miss tennessee martin
 maybe i will

  she bathed and dressed quickly and
she had a trained smile for big sam
coats when she walked into his office
half an hour later

   lefty aint here yet he told her
grinning back  but sit down make
yourself at home he aint the only
one that likes to look at you

  she had girded on her armor of the
cabaret for him and took it wide-eyed

   i thought you were different
sam she murmured  all business
but youre like all of em i guess the
man doesnt live who wont try to band
you a line

  coatss widening smile showed a
glint of gold in his upper jaw

   the big question before the amer-
ican girl to-day he said  isnt the
mens line but what theyre willing to
hand with it ill spend money any
day on mine sweet boys are all right
but it takes a fur coat to keep a lady
warm when the mercurys down
dorcas odonnell sighed

   some get furs and some dont
she said  youd be surprised how the
big-hearted customers up at the club
shower them on me between two and
five any morning-in promises but
whenever the delivery cars stop in front
a line to lefty



of my door its something c o d
theyve got for little dorcas

  coats chuckled

   i was going to say something i
guess i wont

   why not

   lefty byrne mightnt like it

  fler gaze was a baby stare steady
and gently thoughtful and provo-
cative

   but she suggested demurely
 lefty isnt here

  sam coats guffawed and slapped his
knee

   thats good well if men are the
same-aint women he swung
around and sidled his chair along be-
hind the desk  i like em smart
kiddo up on their toes out to grab
what they can but-on the square-
i always thought you was too good-
lookin to be anything but dumb

  the girl evaded his reaching hand
but her smiled stayed put

   dont she whispered  not here
lefty-

  coatss eyes narrowed

yeah he questioned lefty
 he-he might be coming back
she drew further from him in the
pause while the big shots blunt fin-
gers began softly to drum the desk

   listen he said  listen here
kiddo tell me th truth would you
care a lot if he didnt would you
mind it that is if somebody with a
real roll was ready to be good to you 
she lost the smile at that-gasped
 wh-what do you mean 

  the gold tooth flashed again

   you heard me youve got ears-
and brains a skirt like you could
dazzle this town if she had things if
she was hooked up right what th
hell are you alive for just to sit
around and help the butter-an-egg men
get ready for an ice bag in the morn-

in or to waste time on a cheap gun
that aint got nerve enough to stick
with his racket

  the girl straightened

 thats-lefty where is he sam
why are you talking that way about
him about him not-coming back
coats had caught himself and his
eyes were veiled to her

   thats somethin he said and
coughed  somethin that could be
taken care of i got connections in
florida-and believe me hell go
where the best dough is he got up
and crossed to a filing cabinet pulled
open one of the steel drawers and from
the drawer produced a bottle and
glasses  how about a  first to-day  
he asked  this is the mccoy kiddo
stuff you never get uptown my own
private stock with th music of th
bagpipes in every drop

  she had started to refuse but some-
thing was buzzing suddenly in the back
of her mind she had to stay and
that meant she must play the game as
nightly she played it at the gold slip-
per play it the spartan tennessees
way with a glass in one hand and the
reins firmly in the other until she knew
what was coming up for lefty

  out by the garage door walsh and
two or three others still were loiter-
ing coming in shed wondered why
they were sticking so close to-day with
the big car wondered why they had
been so set on avoiding her eye now
after that sodden miscue of coatss
terror was throbbing in her throat

  yes she must stand by if she
could only make a party of it run it
in her maddest madcap manner get
them whooping it as she knew they
often did get upstairs to lefty-
staring at her with the bottle un-
corked big sam coats said  well
what do you say


detective fiction weekly

  she gave him the tennessee look
and the tennessee gurgle

   if its as good as you say it is
pour me one as big as i ought to want
it then as if it had been a swift
inspiration she wanted to know
 how about having the boys in
why grunted coats

  both coolness and promise were in
her slow glance

   im a hard woman in a hard world
sammy she drawled  starting now
when anybody talks fur coat to me-i
want witnesses

  coatss eyes went wide

   what a gold digger my babys
turnin out to be he gave her an
ecstatic squeeze in passing and roared
happily through the office door
gang front and center

iv

it called for a flawless technique the
handling of that days wild whoopee
party in sam coatss garage for it
was a party epic in its potentialities
the scotch as plentiful as powerful
early proved a distillation not only of
bagpipe music but of stout highland
combativeness twice the thick-shoul-
dered mr walsh had to separate two
of his partners of the touring car crew
and once walsh himself was at the
verge of a clash with coats

  ardently wishing theyd slaughter
one another but uncertain whether
they would dorcas odonnell vindi-
cated herself as an accomplished mis-
tress of ceremonies by directing the re-
moval of the radio from the office to
the garage floor

   i love to dance she shrilled
 when i dont have to and what a
stag line

  coats maudlin by then claimed her
first

   when th rest a you dance he

hiccoughed  is when im too tired
whose liquor is it anyhow and
whose joint-an whose dame

   you ought to ask lefty some one
suggested

   shut up coats roared then
lefty aint here see

  but dorcas odonnell had marked
the source of the jeering invitation
and that was the man she danced with
next

  whats the joke about lefty
she asked him when they were at the
far end of the floor

  her partners tongue was almost
but not quite as loose as she had hoped
it would be

   joke he said  well if you call
it that him an sam had an argment
about some coin-and sams got the
coin playin close to his vest with it
ill say he is under his vest its in
his money belt now next to his skin
yes the girl breathed and
what about lefty

  the well had run dry

   thats somethin the rum runner
told her belatedly cautious  that
youll have to ask coats

  when she danced next with coats
she did try again but  hes gone on
erran-a long erran was all he told
her

  a while after that coats went into
the office and called one of his men-
the straightest one except for walsh
of the crowd the girl close to the
door overheard an interchange that
froze her heart

   now lissen here buck coats was
saying in a hoarse whisper  this
goes my minds made up im tired
a hearin that broad with her lefty
this and lefty that an  where the hell
is lefty 

   yeah said buck  it goes-but
what 

	d
a line to lefty



   the works snarled coats
 youre goin to take him out in the
car to-night and you aint goin to
bring him back give him a water ride
see take him way out an sink him
 told the skirt i might be sendin him
to florida well i will-inside a
shark

  he came from the office weaving to
find the life of the party faint and
white

   whats the matter kiddo gettin
sick an me just after openin an-
other case

  she rallied bravely

   no im just beginning to have a
good time but we need more girls

i	was just thinking-theres a couple
over in my house hostesses theyd
love to come over

  fine endorsed coats phone
em

   i cant they havent a phone ill
have to go after them

  the host glowered and grunted

   you wouldnt come back

   i will i promise wont you be-
lieve me-sammy

   all right coats said  i believe
you but ill send walsh with you
just for luck

  walsh went but the girl left him
waiting on the sidewalk when they had
turned her corner breathless she fiew
up the stairs to her own small flat and
to the rear window

  she wasnt disappointed lefty was
over there looking out-looking for
her patient after the hours

   honey boy she screamed at him
 youve got to get out of there

  he didnt get it didnt get a word
of it didnt get the frantic signs she
made with only a couple of hundred
feet between them they were a world
apart precariously close she realized
with a dry sob to two worlds apart

 	d

  and then at the height of her
desperation she thought of her strata-
gem of another day and saw a way
thought of that trick of hers to explain
to lefty why she wasnt meeting him
one afternoon after a big night up-
town and went flying to-her laundry
bag

v

she kept her promise within a
half hour after she had left big
sam coats she had returned to
him walsh at her side

  too bad she told him as she had
told walsh  one of the girls didnt
get home last night and her sister isnt
feeling well i stopped to freshen up
for a lone womans struggle

   your funeral grinned coats
 you missed a lot of drinks want to
catch up

   and how cried dorcas odon-
nell she stooped to bring up the
amplification on the radio until the
music was a boiler shop roar and
caught big sams arm  come on
she urged  take one with me my
first in a long while

   tootin i will coats said and
stumbled after her into the office

  she closed the door and shook her
head at the bottle

   no wait she breathed  what
about that fur coat sam what
about-being in back of me did you
mean it

   i said it he told her  you treat
me right ill treat you right i always
dq business that way

  she nodded

   then ill tell you something i
know where lefty is

   huh coats stared

   hes upstairs in his room i just
saw him from-from the girls flat
he was at his window


detective fiction weekly

  big sam blinked

   was he well its too bad he
wanted to keep out a sight if you
want it straight he was hell for duckin
you you see a fine chance come up
for him to go to florida-alone he
got wise to himself all of a sudden
saw hed be a sucker not to take it

  the girl laughed

   i should have a weeping spell
she said in a voice as hard as coatss
own  its fifty-fifty if leftys got
his way to make ive got mine to make
far as im concerned lies out of my
life out like a light theres plenty
of others plenty-and real men men
with dollars to his nickels hes cheap
id like to tell him so tell him to his
face

  it was a great act and the befuddled
coats was getting a good kick out of
it

   atta baby he encouraged  you
tell him kiddo

  the girl caught up his hands

  no no i take that back she
cried  i never want to see him again
wants to go to florida does he for
all of me he can go way south of
there go and stay but i want him
to knowr sam just whos quitting who
listen id wrrite him his walking
papers here and now if-

  coats had decided lie liked her in the
hysterical part he wasnt too far gone
to congratulate himself she was that
kind-the peppy kind that just blew
off steam and tried to beat the man to
it when he was ready to give her the
gate so much the better

  he picked her up at the pause

   if-what he said

  if youd take his discharge up to
him sammy she finished  serve it
on him yourself right away while i
know just what i want to say to him

  big sams arms circled her

   momma lie exulted  you sure
rung the right messenger say i
wont only hand lefty the walkin
papers ill fix up his transportation
for him-to-night he waved at the
desk  theres paper an pen an ink
go ahead poison him 

  she wrote just a couple of lines
they were ladylike but final in implica-
tion 

im playing the mob from now on

you know where you can go and how

                           d od

  coats gloated over the note

   thass the idea kiddo he ap-
plauded  dont ever waste words
tell it to em snappy

  he lumbered out of the office turned
his back on the scattered and flattening
party and started unsteadily up the
stairs

vi

the key was in the outside of
lefty byrnes door and lefty
was waiting just inside when the
big shot fumbled at the lock a heavy
wash basin was in his hands and it
came crashing down on coatss head as
he entered

  for a second coats stood waving
then he slumped he was out cold
byrne bending over him ripped open
his vest and his shirt swiftly unbuckled
the money belt under them and took
from it the same five thousand dollar
bills that he had been forced to give
up

  when he had stuffed them into his
pocket he glanced at the note which
coats had dropped it brought the
ghost of a smile to his lips

   thanks lots he said aloud
 youre the smartest girl in america
honey you bet i know where to go-
and how
a line to lefty



  he patted the big shots pockets
transferred a pistol to his own and
whisked the sheets from his bed when
he had knotted their ends together he
collected sheets from other beds along
the cell block  and tied them in too
the squawk of the overtuned radio and
a bedlam of drunken shouting coming
up to him as he worked

  it was in walshs room that he made
his rope of sheets fast to the bed that
room looked out on the alley and there
were no fences to climb below out
the window he went and down

  three minutes after coatss arrival
with the note lefty was in front of
dorcas odonnells house with a wait-
ing taxi dorcas came scurrying
around the corner presently

   it was kind a tough one to read
lefty grinned as she climbed hurriedly
into the cab  but it percolated i
crowned sam an i got my money
lets go places

  her face again was ashy as she
snuggled to him

    far places said she

  nearly a half hour had passed be-
fore walsh always more careful with
his drinks than the others missed the
big shot

   hey he shouted coming out of a
doze whats become a sam

  an answer came hazily through the
shriek of the radio

   him an the skirt went out

  but the gunman called buck recol-
lected otherwise

   no he corrected staggering to
walsh  they didnt no such thing
thats a lie an whoever said it can get
as tough as he wants to sam went
upstairs thass where sam went an
the dame said she wtfs goin to the cor-
ner to bring in some sanwiches but
hell thats a long time ago

  walsh sprang up

   say he exclaimed sobered  we
better see whats happened if sam
tangled with lefty in the shape lies in
then plenty may of shut off that
damn music box

  there was no sound from above
walsh gun in hand leaped for the
stairs

  on the third story he found coats
the big shot was sitting on the floor
of leftys room with the door wide
open behind him he was rubbing his
head his eyes were open but there
was only a profound stupefaction in
them

   i-i was ganged he stuttered
 a s-somebodv copped my dough
wheres lefty walsh de-
manded

   coats couldnt tell him but he found
out for himself-saw that hawser of
sheets moored to his own bed and lead-
ing out the window

   ill tell you he said  about
lefty hes blew

  that materially assisted the big
shots recovery rage convulsed him

   what dyou mean blew  he
thundered  you guys let him walk
did you 

  he didnt walk said walsh  he
slid he went out my winda into the
alley

   coats struggled to his feet

   then he was tipped he accused
 somebody told him he was in for the
works his jaw dropped  say-
that dame did she come up here with
me and give me th double cross

   nope she went out

  walsh was at lefty byrnes win-
dow looking across the yards he
knew dorcas odonnells window for
lefty once had pointed it out to him
on that window his eyes were fixed a
clothes line leading from it to a pole in


detective fiction weekly

the center of the noisy court was strung
with what struck him after a moment
as a preposterous assortment of
clothing

  his gaze widened as he stared and
suddenly he snorted

   my gawd he wheezed  shes
went and pulled that gag with the wash
again an maybe she didnt hand
byrne a lineful this time

  coats came up behind him

   what th hell are you talkin
about he snapped

  walsh pointed at the clothes line

   there thats where lefty got bis
dope

  the big shot looked hard at him

   somebodys cuckoo

  walsh laughed wildly

   somebodys slick he amended be-
tween gasps  itll all come out in the
wash they say and this is once when
it did listen sam i mind one time
when dorcas odonnell fell down on
a date with lefty byrne usually she
ducks the heavy wine parties see-
but shed got into one where she had to
drink plenty and dyuh know the way
she tipped off lefty what was the
matter with her she hung out some
sheets on her wash line to signal him
she wras woozy three of em get it
so much as to tell him she wras  three
sheets in th wind ho ho

   what a dame commended coats
he stared at the odonnell clothes
line again  but whats that got to do
with-now 

   its the tip off said walsh
dabbing at his eyes with a handker-
chief  look at that line a hers sam
what do you see on it

   a lot a junk grunted coats

   name some a the things sam

   youre nuts but-well theres
one a them gadgets a broad wears in-
side her dress sometimes

  walsh nodded

   sure thats right they call it a
 slip and what else do you see
coats cursed him

   is this an eye test but its a crazy
wash at that when you come to look
it over the upstairs part of a couple
pyjama suits without no pants an
the half of a pair a socks without the
soul mate

   fine approved walsh  two
pyjama coats and a sock also a
white belt and an item a underclothes
and two sheets and a wash tie and a
lace collar but you dont start readin
in the middle of a line do you  read
this one from left to right now

   ill call a doctor coats offered
stop your laughin youre drunk
 who wouldnt laugh  clucked
walsh  ill read it to you myself-
left to right the way the line faces
leftys winda here no ill do better
ill write it out for yuh

  he scribbled rapidly on the back of
an envelope and handed the envelope to
coats reading it the big shot col-
lapsed heavily on the edge of the bed

   yeah he murmured mournfully
 i could sure a used that dame she
beats me she played me right into it
once more gone speechless he
stared at walshs transcription of the
odonnell  wash it was there an
out-and-out wigwag as the quick-eyed
walsh had written and spaced it

sock coats collar belt
under clothes tie
sheets slip

  a sickly grin spread over the big
shots face

   well i dunno he said  maybe
im lucky at that cop a dame that
works as fast as that an she owns
you me ill pick em dumb an be

  exploits of the wolf

        linky mitchell iv as the terror of the underworld until
        a little man with a keen eye threw a hat in his face

he wolf is dead

  a few weeks ago when
those words slipped from
twisted mouths with lightning-like
rapidity in certain quarters of that
weird labyrinth known as new yorks
underworld there was great rejoicing

   hes dead huh  well thats a
relief

  but federal officials from the pres-
ident down knew that with the passing
of the wolf-otherwise knowm as
james r kerrigan-the government
of the united states had suffered an ir-

reparable loss for kerrigan was the
ace of uncle sams narcotic agents
a man of unadulterated courage and
stamina despite the fact that the
scales said only one hundred and
twenty pounds and the possessor of a
brain that was sharper than that of
the sharpest criminal kerrigan thrust
terror into the hearts of narcotic law
violators big and small in this country
and in europe for more than a decade
hence his sobriquet

this month he would be in san
franciscos dimly lit chinatown bat-


detective fiction weekly

tering down the doors of an  import-
ing and exporting house and seizing
a few hundred thousand dollars worth
of dope single-handed next month
he would be aboard a transatlantic
liner peering through the keyhole of a
stateroom in the dead of the night un-
earthing a gigantic smuggling plot on
another occasion he might be found
sitting in a joint deep in the notorious
halfway world of amsterdam his keen
ears tuned in on conversations not in-
tended for him

  born in new yorks famous east
side the wolf grew up with many of
those individuals who were later to
carve niches for themselves in the
realm of dishonest enterprise accord-
ingly when the wolf passed on he took
to his grave with him inside informa-
tion about criminals which will never
be retrieved literally he was a walk-
ing encyclopedia of information on
the underworld and its habitues he
hadnt the time to impart all he knew
he revealed a good deal to his fellow
agents understand but not half
enough

  often times he would be walking
along murky streets with his two side-
kicks-agents ray connollev and
louis kelley-when some one whom
he knew would slink by

  see that guy the wolf would
say  well listen take a good look at
him and ill slip you the low-down on
him in case i get bumped off and
thereupon the wolf would narrate the
history of the individual in question
giving among other things his racket
his various hangouts his real name
and his aliases the date of his birth
the names and addresses of those with
whom he contacted and so on ad
infinitum

  the police when they were at sea
regarding the whereabouts of a certain

person they wanted usually called on
the wolf they figured that he would
have in the back of his unusual and
retentive brain the information they
desired and they were rarely dis-
appointed

  a few years ago when the river
pirates in and around gotham were
extremely active the authorities de-
cided to call a halt to their nefarious
practices things had gone a trifle
beyond the pale of tolerance in fact
it got so that a self-respecting boat was
afraid to go out at night if it did
it was looted

  whereupon some one suggested

   maybe the wolf can help us out

  so the wolf was asked what he
knew about the activities of the river
pirates

   well he answered  thats a
little out of my line dope you know
is my meat but i think i can help you
boys

  so the wolf unreeled certain in-
formation from the film of his memory
with the result that the river pirates
passed into history ere a month went
by

  quite an unusual man this ker-
rigan youre thinking well lets take
a look at him five feet ten and the
aforementioned one hundred and
twenty pounds skinny as a rail

  no flesh but lots of nerve is the
way he put it

  lines all over his face dark burn-
ing eyes that looked right through you
you wouldnt lie to kerrigan a big
forehead forty-two

  tobacco and booze were taboo his
wife and two children rarely saw him
he slept wherever his work took
him-when he did sleep

  arnold rothstein notorious gam-
bler racketeer and dope lord who was
recently slain was one of the many
exploits ok the wolf



who would have given anything for the
wolfs good will kothstein tried hard
enough heaven knows but got
nowhere

  kothstein used to sip coffee by the
hour in a well-known restaurant on
upper broadway kerrigan often
passed the place but he seldom passed
without being approached by roth-
stein

   hello there wolf rothstein
would say as he rushed into the street
bareheaded  come on in and have
something to eat

   im not hungry go on and sell
your papers arnold the wolf would
answer  i dont want to be seen in
your company

  but despite the fact that he detested
racketeers and dope runners the wolf
was often seen in their company on
such occasions however he was
usually busy turning down bribes not-
withstanding the truth that his pay
was small and his family more or less
in want it is estimated that he turned
a deaf ear to a cool million in bribes
during his service with the govern-
ment

  only a few weeks before his un-
timely demise the wolf was passing
the restaurant frequented by roth-
stein and his gang when a pale-faced
fellow ran out of the eating place and
accosted the narcotic agent with this
remark

   say wolf i understand youre
after me

   thats right egg answered ker-
rigan who was truthful to the point
of painfulness

  well lookit i got twenty-five
grand for you if you lay off see

   listen bozo he snapped  who
ever told you i went in for petty
larceny

  kerrigans icy stare was famous

his eyes would start at your shoes and
wander upward in a despising wither-
ing manner to your face then he
would stare hard looking right
through you that stare was most ir-
ritating and disconcerting therefcjre
it produced results

  at noons the wolf when in new
york frequented a cheap eating house
patronized by characters of the under-
world when entering the place he
was in the habit of giving every one
in the joint the once over one day he
let his glance fall on a man and a
woman he didnt know them he
hadnt in fact ever laid eyes on them
before but they apparently knew him
for when his gaze roved from their
shoes to their heads they nudged one
another left their meals unfinished
paid their bill and hurried into the
street

   oh boy said kerrigan to agent
kelley  theyve done something
notice how fast they blew when i
looked em over

  so the wolf bounded through the
door and shadowed the couple-for
two weeks

  they wound up in jail having been
underlings connected with a big dope
ring before taking the rap they
spilled information to kerrigan which
resulted in the demolition of the ring
in question

  for more than a year preceding his
death the wolf concentrated on an in-
ternational narcotic network which
had for years mystified the best minds
of the government kerrigan loved big
jobs-and he knew that to get to the
core of that ring was a big job pie
had an idea that arnold rothstein was
in back of the organization but he
couldnt get the goods on him

  the wolfs labors however began
to bear fruit just after rothsteins

death it seems that the police had gone
to the offices of the rothmere realty
company one of the slain gamblers
many  smoke screens in an effort to
unearth a clew which would lead them
to rothsteins murderer but the police
came to the conclusion that there was
nothing of value in the offices

  the wolf however had a hunch
that a search of the  realty  com-
panys premises might reveal some-
thing of moment so the place was
gone over with a fine tooth comb and
certain data-the government wont
reveal the details-was obtained the
upshot of the whole thing was this

  one fine day a few weeks after
rothsteins murder joseph ltngar a
suave and dapper crony of the slain
man strolled into the grand central
terminal in new york he was leav-
ing for chicago on the crack twentieth
century limited the first section of
which pulls out every day at two forty-
five it was then two thirty and
ltngar occupied himself with the task
of seeing that his two expensive-
looking trunks were properly placed in
one of the baggage cars

  meanwhile the wolf sat in the
office of assistant united states at-
torney john m blake in the federal
building his long nervous fingers
beating a tattoo on the desk he was
waiting for the word from grand
central terminal

  shortly after three oclock ungars
two trunks which had been removed
from the train without the knowl-
edge of their owner were brought in
to kerrigan

  now well see if ive worked a
year for nothing said the wolf to
blake with that kerrigan took an
oversized hatchet and began to smash
one of the trunks open when his task
had been completed he was confronted

with a sight he had long anticipated-
narcotics valued in excess of a million
dollars

  the wires began to buzz with the
result that the twentieth century was
flagged outside of buffalo that night
ungar was unceremoniously hustled
from his berth forced to complete his
toilet in the railroad yards brought
back to new york and sent up for a
long stretch

  but im a trifle ahead of my story
when kerrigan was smashing open
the second trunk which also contained
more than a million dollars worth of
 hop his hatchet slipped and lie
struck himself in the stomach

   dammit he said a sly smile play-
ing about his lips  ive killed myself

  and the wolf had killed himself
he was taken to misericordia hos-
pital where he succumbed to an opera-
tion for a twisted intestine brought on
by the blow from the hatchet he didnt
have a chance his constitution had
been undermined by seventy-two con-
secutive hours of work preceding
ungars arrest and the wolf died a
martyr to his country the same as a
soldier on the battlefield

  and so the arrest of ungar marked
the beginning of what promises to be
the end of the rothstein dope ring-
the crowning achievement in the fiction-
like and hair-raising career of the peer
of all narcotic agents little was pub-
lished about the wolfs exploits when
he was alive the government was
rather touchy about that it didnt want
people to know how clever he was but
his death changed all that so i sought
out the man with whom he had worked
on so many cases and who knew ker-
rigan as well as anybody-assistant
united states attorney blake and
from mr blake i obtained the inside
stories on three of the wolfs most
exploits of the wolf	

thrilling exploits many of the facts
being set clown here for the first time

ii

beyond a shadow of doubt the
intrepid kerrigan had his closest
call during his encounter with
 linky  mitchell generally recog-
nized as one of the most fearless and
desperate of the bad men and the
scourge of new yorks halfway world
linky and the scrappy agent met head
on one night in a glorified speakeasy
just off the street called gay and only
a miracle-in the form of wolfs
dominating personality-prevented the
loss of several lives in order that the
reader will thoroughly appreciate the
pure grit displayed by kerrigan on the
night in question it will be best per-
haps to unfold some of the more im-
portant details of linky mitchells life
and habits

  mitchell a stocky lowbrow in his
early twenties-with a career of petty
crimes behind him-earned the sobri-
quet of  the link  with the ad-
vent of prohibition at which time his
leap to notoriety was swift and last-
ing he was perhaps the first of the
bootleggers to successfully execute on
a large scale the racket of toting booze
from ship to shore he operated sev-
eral small boats which in the murky
hours between midnight and daybreak
chugged their way out into the ocean
got their cargo from waiting rum ships
and brought it to shore for distribu-
tion thus mitchell became known
as the link because he was the go-
between who brought about a connec-
tion between ships at sea and the
thirsty ashore as time went on the
nickname the link was abbreviated to
linky

  in a short while mitchell became
something of a whisky czar in certain

circles he supplied many of the more
disreputable of the night clubs and
cabarets and a long string of speak-
easies with booze one fine day another
bootlegger made the sad mistake of
encroaching on linkvs territory and
the next night the bootlegger in ques-
tion was found lying in an alley liter-
ally perforated with forty-five caliber
bullets linky boasted of the killing
displaying an empty but recently-fired
forty-five caliber revolver

  when a few months wore on the
leader of a notorious gang decided to
give linky a little opposition in the
booze racket and dispatched one of his
henchmen to mitchell to tell him so

   you go on back retorted mit-
chell  and tell your boss that as soon
as he starts talcin the play off of me
hes a dead one i love to bump people
like that off i do-and i aint kiddin
linky mitchell never goes back on his
word he dont

  when the gang leader was apprised
of linkys threat he laughed long and
loudly he had a whole army behind
him he reasoned while mitchell was
known to be a lone wolf so the gang
leader promptly took an order for some
booze in linkys self-designated do-
main and within a week he was in his
grave again linky boasted of a kill-
ing as he strutted lordly through the
underworld

   n let that be a warnin added
linky to his awe-stricken listeners
 that nobody is goin to step on linky
mitchells toes and get away with it-
they aint

  in a short while linky no longer en-
joyed the thrill of encounters with
those who trespassed on his territory-
for the simple reason that other boot-
leggers were afraid to trespass linky
had them all scared stiff so flushed
with victory he went out with the ex-

press purpose of digging up trouble
deciding to cut into the rackets of
others his first move in this daring
campaign was a visit to a cabaret which
was the hang-out of thieves thugs and
racketeers of all types linky ap-
proached the proprietor of the place
and asked

   who are you buyin your booze
off of 

  the proprietor supplied the name of
his bootlegger whereupon linky re-
torted 

   well beginnin to-morrow youre
buyin it off of me see

  no i aint snapped the proprie-
tor who happened to be a tough egg

   listen guy warned mitchell
 ill be around to-morrow and if you
aint changed that weak mind o yours
then ill bump you off im linky
mitchell see-

  the proprietor laughed a slightly
sickly laugh as the vicious-looking
linky strutted from the place his cap
pulled down over his eyes and a cigar-
ette drooping from his tight lips he
told some of his thug-patrons of
mitchells threat they advised him to
pay no attention to linky-which
turned out to be bad advice

   well take care of dat bimbo if he
starts gittin tough was the reassur-
ing comment of one gangster

  so when mitchell called the next
night the proprietor told him he had
decided to string- along with his old
bootlegger and that he linky could
go to hell if he didnt like it twenty-
four hours later the man who had de-
fied linky was leaving his cabaret for
his home when he ran into a fusillade
of steel-jackets and dropped to the
sidewalk a corpse

  a couple of nights later linky went
into another night club and sought out
the proprietor

   my names linky mitchell see
did you read about what happened to
the guy what run the blue owl did
you 

   yes why

   nothin answered linky  only
im the fella what bumped him off he
wouldnt buy his booze off of me who
are you takin your stuff off of

   im gettin it from marty the
wop

   well beginnin to-morrow youre
takin it off of me see

  all right

  so that sort of thing went on for
many moons whenever linky de-
cided that he wanted to supply another
night club or cabaret with booze he
simply made his wish known to the
proprietor of the establishment in ques-
tion the latter gentleman being only
too pleased to acquiesce to the bad
mans desire and whenever any one
was foolhardy enough to demur he
was promptly riddled with bullets and
linky would go home and reload his
gun

  but the peculiar thing about linky
was that he did things in such a man-
ner that the police were never able to
pin anything on him they didnt have
any evidence they laid a score or
more murders at his door but their
hands were tied linkys reign of
terror was so completely dominating
that the toughest of the tough simply
wouldnt entertain the fantastic notion
of turning informer against him such
a thing was entirely too dangerous
and there the matter stood

  so linky continued on his defiant
boastful way fearing neither man nor
god

  his sole precautionary measure
was the donning of a bullet-proof vest
which he wore even while sleeping he
had by this time many enemies but
exploits of the wolf



he often remarked that those people
were to him the spice of life in fact
he didnt know what he would do with-
out them they supplied his only thrills

  one of linkys favorite stunts was
to walk into a joint where he was sur-
rounded by gangsters who were just
eating their hearts out for a chance to
murder him on such an occasion
linky would take a seat in a corner
and order the most sumptuous repast
which the establishment had to offer
when he had eaten he would call the
waiter over hand him a good-sized tip
and then remark

   im linky mitchell i guess they
aint no bill for this food is they

   oh no sir thats quite all right
sir

  whereupon linky would turn his
back on his hawk-eyed enemies and
brazenly depart but did any of those
gangsters have the nerve to fire at
mitchell guess again they were
thanking their stars that he had gone
without firing at them

  time passed and one night in
january of  linky swaggered into
a smoky disreputable speakeasy and
pulled his usual line  the proprietor
asking him who he was buying his
booze from informing him that he
would have to change bootleggers and
so on the proprietor exhibiting more
than his share of nerve told linky that
he was perfectly satisfied with his
present bootlegger

   ill be around at ten to-morrow
night i will said linky  n if you
still talk back like that ill bump you
off right in ljere

  shortly after linky left jim kerri-
gan walked into the speakeasy it
might be explained at this point that
this particular place was a favorite
haunt of the wolfs because it was fre-
quented by many stool pigeons who

from time to time turned over certain
information to the agent which re-
sulted in the seizure of hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of nar-
cotics

  in view of the fact that the place
was a source of great aid to uncle
sam kerrigan arranged things so that
those in authority closed their eyes to
its violations of the prohibition law
in other words here was one speakeasy
that was under the protective wing of
the united states government

  when kerrigan entered that night
the proprietor rushed up to him ex-
citedly and told him of linkys threat
kerrigan of course knew all about
linky he had never come in contact
with him but he knew him by sight-
and he hated him likewise with
linky he hated kerrigan for the
very plausible reason that the agent
was a symbol of law and order-the
thing most removed from linkys
heart

  kerrigan listened intently to the pro-
prietors story and upon its conclusion
he asked 

   what time did that egg say he was
cornin to-morrow night

   at ten oclock

  all right dont worry ill be
here too

  the prospect of an encounter with
the desperate mitchell meant little to
kerrigan it was just another nasty
job in the line of duty-and duty was
sacred kerrigan had started and
finished many nasty jobs in his time
he had bucked up against what was
thought to be certain death on count-
less occasions only to exit unscathed
fear was a total stranger to him

  so at precisely ten oclock the next
night linky entered the speakeasy as
usual he was alone he was never
seen in any ones company taking

a table near the door linky ordered up
a whisky the place was blue with
smoke and the atmosphere was charged
with a foreboding tenseness men with
white faces and women with carmined
lips made their way through the blue
haze and out into the street-and
safety-when linky ordered his second
whisky they knew that an ill wind
was blowing but a few of the more
ignorant souls-those who didnt know
linky-remained

  five minutes after the bad mans
arrival kerrigan entered the gritty
little agent walked up to linkys table
and focused his piercing blistering
stare on the man before him the
effect of this treatment on mitchell
should be evident he started to burn
up asked kerrigan in threatening
tones what the hell he wanted where-
upon the agent without speaking
abruptly and sneeringly turned his back
on the bellicose linky and strolled
across the room

  mitchell recognized as the fastest
man on the draw in new york aside
from kerrigan pulled out his revolver
and aimed it at the agents back ker-
rigan was looking at the bartender not
linky the bartenders eyes nearly
popped from their sockets kerrigan
knew what that meant so without
turning he shouted

  mitchell put that cannon away

  then kerrigan turned around and
slrode swiftly over to linkys table
the bad man was still pointing his gun
at the agent who had not drawn his
weapon

   i told you to put that cannon away
you dirty filthy lousy rat thundered
kerrigan who knew all the adjectives
-and used them

  mitchell for the first time in his life
put his gun back in his pocket without
firing it then the wolf who weighed

a hundred pounds less than the bad
man grasped mitchell by the coat col-
lar and the seat of the pants marched
him over to the door and threzv him out
on the sidewalk-face downward

  kerrigan then returned to the table
which linky had  left  so uncere-
moniously scooped up the bad mans
hat went back to the door and threw
it in its owners face

  if you ever set foot in this place
again you weasel roared kerrigan
 ill blow your rotten brains through
your thick skull im one guy that
you cant scare

  kerrigan later explained that he had
not drawn his gun on linky for fear
that several of the cabaret patrons
would be killed by stray bullets as
for mitchell he wa a broken man
after his encounter with the wolf he
hadnt the heart to go after the little
agent and he was never seen in the
vicinity of the unlucky speakeasy
again

  linky died as violently as he had
lived a little later a girl lured him
to a speakeasy four men who didnt
want to go to the trouble of removing
linkys bullet-proof vest grabbed him
while a fifth stood on a chair and
pumped six bullets through the crowtn
of his head when kerrigan heard of
the murder he smiled and said

   what a pity poor linky gave me
the biggest thrill of my life and i had
hoped to meet up with him just once
more before one or the other of us got
bumped off   

ill

about two years ago members of
l the narcotic squad working out
of new york were beginning to
get gray around the temples because
they couldnt lay their hands on a mys-
terious leak through which hundreds
exploits of the wolf



of thousands of dollars worth of dope
was finding its way into this country
various of the agents had a hunch that
the stuff was filtering in from big
transatlantic liners or ships calling
from south america but sharp eyes
focused on the baggage of incoming
travelers at the new york piers failed
to confirm any such suspicions

  assistant united states attorney
blake under whom many of the gov-
ernments best agents operate called in
kerrigan

   jim said blake  this leak is be-
ginning to get on my nerves i want
you to concentrate on it and plug it up
 enough said replied the intrepid
kerrigan who picked up his battered
slouch hat pulled it well down over his
eyes and sauntered out of blakes
office

  for several days the wolf met all
the big steamers which docked at new
york and trained his eagle eyes on each
and every passenger who came down
the gangplanks on the seventh day
of his vigil he noticed a dapper young
man with a pinpoint mustache leaving
a steamer which had just arrived from
south america kerrigan began to
search his uncanny memory he had
seen that face somewhere before oh
yes that was the fellow he had
pinched in december  for run-
ning dope so when the gentleman
in question set foot on the pier kerri-
gan called him aside

   remember me  asked the agent
   i sure do was the tart reply

   come over here in the corner i
want to search you

   youll be wastin your time wolf
i havent got a thing on me

   are you sure theres no hop sewed
up in your clothes asked kerrigan
eying up the man before him in a sus-
picious manner

   ill give you my word that there
aint was the reply  ive laid off the
stuff since the time you got me seven
or eight years ago

  nowr here was an unusual thing
about the unusual kerrigan in nine
instances out of ten he could tell when
a man was lying-and he could tell
when a man was speaking the truth 
the latter happened to be the case the
wolf never exposed any one to the em-
barrassment of a search thus he
made many friends for there is
nothing more flattering than to have
your word accepted at its face value if
youre telling the truth

  so kerrigan beamed on the returned
traveler and said

   o k kid i know you wouldnt
lie to me-and im glad to know that
youre walking the straight and
narrow  by the way hows the
family

  just great wolf got twro new
members-a boy and a girl-since i
sawr you last

   now isnt that just dandy kid
responded the inspector  by the way
look me up any time-especially if you
know of anything thatll interest me
remember now that if you tip me off
to anything i wont question you i
know youre on the level but i thought
maybe you had overheard something
hot in your travels   

  the wolf looked after the dapper
young man as he walked away the
kid personally was on the square
mused the shrewd agent but he knew
more than he was telling   

  the next morning when kerrigan
took up his vigil at one of the largest
piers the dapper young man who had
figured in the previous days proceed-
ings approached him and said 

  well here i am again wolf
thought id find you here


detective fiction w eekly

   hello there said kerrigan jov-
ially  whats up 

   just this wolf  ive been thinkin
things over and ive decided that youre
a pretty white egg now im going to

give you a tip the b- is due in

at noon and on board is signor a a

diplomat from c- a small foreign

country several diplomats from that
country have been cornin over here
lately and i understand theyre all
cartin dope they sell it in new york
and washington and make a lot of
dough for themselves

   thanks a lot kid said the wolf
as the informer made his way from the
pier

  so that was it emissaries were
bringing in the stuff taking advantage
of diplomatic immunity which enabled
them to get their trunks through the
customs unsearched a rotten low-
down trick mused kerrigan

  the big liner drew into her pier
shortly after twelve thirty and one of
the first to march down the gangplank
was signor a accompanied by his sec-
retary and a valet signor a puffing
away on a cigarette kept almost a foot
from his mouth by an ebony holder
appeared very nonchalant as ship
workers toted his three trunks after
him when the baggage was deposited
on the wharf a ship officer told one of
the customs men that a search of the
effects would not be necessary as they
were the property of signor a a dis-
tinguished visitor en route to washing-
ton on official business kerrigan stood
a safe distance away but close enough
to the scene of activities to take in
everything

  signor a cast a furtive glance or
two about him and then stepped into a
taxi instructing the driver to fasten
one of his trunks to the side of the cab
the other two trunks were strapped to

a second taxi this machine being
occupied by the diplomats secretary
and valet

   follow those cabs said kerrigan
to the driver of a third taxi which he
boarded

  the three machines traveling in line
weaved their way in and out of the
clutter and din of the dock vicinity and
twenty minutes later drew up in front
of one of new yorks largest hotels

  kerrigan followed the diplomat into
the hostelry and stalled around in the
lobby until the visitor and his retinue
were ensconced in an expensive suite
then the agent went up to the suite and
knocked on the door the diplomats
secretary answered

   id like to speak to signor a said
kerrigan

  signor a who spoke excellent eng-
lish having been in this country on sev-
eral previous occasions was not long in
putting in an appearance

   im an officer of the united states
government said kerrigan revealing
a bronze badge  and id like to search
your trunks

   but my dear sir mildly protested
the suave diplomat   am protected
by the flag of my country and am
therefore immune to a search of my
effects

  but these words fell on deaf ears
the wolf was no respecter of person-
ages or titles

   i dont care what sort of protection
you have lie said  theres something
in one of your trunks that i want

  but signor a held his ground

   do you realize my dear man
he said menacingly  that i could have
you discharged for this unwarranted
intrusion 

  kerrigan thought fast signor a
was no blockhead he would have to be
cornered by a subtle scheme
exploits of the wolf



   i cant understand your attitude
said kerrigan pleasantly  you
threaten to have me discharged just
because i have come here to help
you

  to help me asked the diplomat
with some surprise

  yes signor i am here to help you
  in what way

  the wolf stepped closer to his
quarry

   please dont get excited now he
said calmly  but theres a time bomb
in one of your trunks

  what shouted the diplomat

   i say there is a time bomb in one
of your trunks i just got word of it
after the ship docked it was placed
there by some of your political enemies
who crossed on the boat with you
oh this is terrible-terrible
wailed signor a  which trunk is it
in

   i dont know said kerrigan
 lets open them all-in a hurry
the bomb is set for two oclock and
its one thirty now

  so the diplomat called his secretary
and valet and the three of them hur-
riedly removed the contents of the
three trunks while the wolf stood by
watching their every move

  among the effects which were ex-
citedly placed on the floor was a
wooden box about a foot square with
a sliding lid kerrigan never took his
eyes from that box when everything
had been removed from the trunks
signor a said to kerrigan

  you seem to be mistaken my dear
man there is no time bomb in these
trunks

 well well well laughed the
wolf  i guess i was misinformed
kerrigan then picked up the wooden
box slid back the lid and a fortune in
opium greeted his expectant eyes

   here here shouted signor a
realizing that he had been out-smarted
give me that box

  no ill just take this along with
me smiled kerrigan

   i shall complain to the president
of the united states thundered the
emissary  you shall pay for this

   thats where youre wrong joked
the wolf whose sense of humor was
quite pronounced  i am one man who
shall not pay for this-opium i shall
have it free

   an outrage an outrage thats
what it is

  with that kerrigan took the dip-
lomat by the arm and escorted him to
a chair

  now sit down and listen to me
snapped the agent focusing his re-
nowned icy stare on his prey  i want
you and the rest of that crowd from
your damned country to stop bringing
dope into the united states and
diplomatic immunity or no diplomatic
immunity i am personally going to
search the baggage of every one of you
rascals who come over here in the
future-and you can tell them so
w hen you go back

  the minutes wore on and kerrigan
continued to talk

  before long he had completely won
over signor a

   very well sir said the diplomat
when kerrigan had stopped talking
 i assure you that this shall be the last
offense now then shall we have a
little something to eat

  so the wolf was extended all the
hospitalities of the government he had
so recently condemned until late in
the afternoon and when he left the
hotel suite-with the opium under his
arm-he left a friend signor a for
from that day to this diplomats com-
ing to these shores from the country in

question have never violated the law as
laid down by kerrigan to signor a

iv

the wolf was strolling up new
yorks famous broadway one
night early in  looking for
trouble he had heard that many
traffickers in narcotics were openly
plying their nefarious calling along
the main stem and he was out to de-
moralize the practice little did he
realize what was in store for him

  on this particular night kerrigan
had hit upon a clever scheme he was
imitating a  hophead -one who uses
dope his arms twitched at his sides
his eyes bulged out blankly his every
movement was quick nervous jerky
the masquerade in short was perfect
and it was not  long in producing
results

  the wolf had been sauntering along
for perhaps ten minutes wrhen he
noticed a heavy-set man attired in a
natty brown suit and overcoat follow-
ing him

  kerrigan crossed to the other side
of the thoroughfare and the man
in brown did likewise finally the
little agent made a sharp turn to the
left and eased up fiftieth street he
slackened his pace and when he reached
a point half a block from broadways
mad milling throng the man in brown
overtook him

   leanin against the stem  asked
the stranger his expression meaning
to dope users  do you smoke
opium

yeah drawled the inspector

  in the market was the next
query

  yeah came the enthusiastic an-
swer got any

  about fifty dollars worth

  gimme it quick said the wolf

his hands reaching out nervously and
eagerly

   lets have the cash first retorted
the stranger

  kerrigan produced fifty dollars in
bills of ten-dollar denomination the
other man took the money counted
and pocketed it and then reached into
another pocket and extracted a good-
sized chunk of opium kerrigan
grasped it as a hungry baby grasps a
bottle of milk

   gee this is great he said train-
ing his eagle eyes on his purchase
which he knew to be genuine stuff
then lifting his glance to the peddler
he asked

   say can you get any more of this
stuff i sell it too but the fellow i
been gettin it off got pinched by the
agents

   yes i can get you more how
much would you want

    oh a hell of a lot of it say fifteen
thousand dollars worth

  the man in brown was taken aback
at the mention of such large figures
kerrigan was eying him up not miss-
ing a trick

   well answered the stranger
 thats a pretty big order but i guess
i can fix you up all right could you
come for the stuff yourself

  yeah answered the wolf a
pause then where

   well i could deliver it to you at
an old farmhouse outside of rutland
vermont if that wouldnt be too far
for you to come you see i dont like
to take a chance on bringing so much
down here to new york i been doin
quite a business lately with my two
partners and the agents might be on to
me

  kerrigan feigned indecision at
length he said  

   well the agents wont bother me

d
exploits of the wolf



ill come up to vermont just where

is the place

  the stranger gave kerrigan detailed
directions as to how to reach a deserted
farmhouse situated along a lonely road
ten miles out from rutland

   you cant miss it he concluded
 its a big place and sets far back
from the road it aint been occupied
in years

  what time will i see you there
asked kerrigan

   eleven oclock sharp to-morrow
night-will that be satisfactory to
you 

   yeah thatll be o k ill be there
youll have the cash with you
ill have fifteen thousand in my
pocket whats your name

   phelps-ned phelps

  the following night at eight oclock
kerrigan and agent ray connolley
alighted from a train in rutland the
night was pitch black a storm was
brewing

  the two agents hired a decrepit
automobile and drove over ten miles of
lonely country roads and finally ar-
rived at a spot where a deserted old
house sat far back from the road a
stretch of woods began in the rear of
the place

   this must be it ray opined tjie
wolf  now heres what wed
better do ill take you back down the
road and leave you at that gas station
we just passed and then ill come back
here if i dont return to the gas
station by eleven thirty you come
after me i want to handle this baby
alone because if he sees you anywhere
around lies sure to blow

   but he might turn out to be a
tough egg when he finds out who you
are ventured connolley

   he wont turn out to be half as
tough as i am replied the wolf

   d

  so kerrigan drove connolley to the
gas station about a quarter of a mile
back toward rutland left him there
and returned in the machine to the old
farmhouse he parked his car in from
the road alighted and walked into the
dark deserted structure with the aid
of his flashlight he saw that the floors
were bare and that there was not a
piece of furniture in the place the
wind whistled ominously through in-
numerable cracks in the sides of the
house and any one but kerrigan there
alone would have been frozen by
fright

  after completing his explorations
the wolf took a seat on the floor of
what had once been a parlor drew his
overcoat collar up around his neck and
proceeded to wait for eleven oclock

  a couple of minutes before eleven
oclock the dozing kerrigan was
awakened by the noise of an old
flivver which pulled up in front of the
house he went to the front door and
there saw the man who had sold him
the dope in new york coming up the
porch steps

   well said phelps  i see you got
here all right

  yeah said the wolf smiling
 ive had a pretty cold wait been
here since ten

  the peddler still sporting his natty
brown outfit led kerrigan back into
the house lit a couple of candles which
he had brought with him andthen
drew a gun on the little agent

   are you a narcotic man  snapped
phelps

   lord no replied kerrigan
 what made you think that

   well i wasnt sure-and i aint
sure yet

  with that phelps holding his gun
in his right hand ran his other hand
through the wolfs hip jacket and


detective fiction weekly

overcoat pockets but found no trace
of what he was looking for-a gun
kerrigan however had his trusty
automatic with him but it was repos-
ing in the left-hand arm pit of his
jacket thats where the wolf always
carried his gun it was placed in such
a manner that the barrel pointed
downward and the handle stuck out
from the arm pit making a quick draw
quite simple and let it be recorded
one of the late jim kerrigans many
specialties was a quick draw

   well said phelps after his ex-
amination of the agents person had
been completed   guess youre all
right but if id found out you was
an agent id knock you off in a min-
ute    got the money for the stuff

  kerrigan produced a roll of green-
backs and handed them over to the
man in browrn the latter counted
them by the aid of candlelight pro-
nounced the sum  fifteen thousand
iron men just right and then told
kerrigan to come outside with him

   we got the stuff in two suitcases
in the machine here said phelps in-
dicating the flivver

  when kerrigan approached the ma-
chine he noticed two men sitting in
silence in the rear of the car he had
not anticipated dealing with three dope
runners

   hand out the suitcases said
phelps to one of the occupants of the
flivver two bags were promptly
tossed from the car

   mind if i look over the stuff
asked the wolf of phelps who was
standing alongside of him still toying
with his revolver

  not at all go right ahead

  kerrigan opened up one of the suit-
cases and extracted a big chunk of
what was represented to be opium he
then walked in front of the automobile

headlights explaining that he wanted
to get a better look at the stuff the
agent at once recognized the contents
of the suitcases as imitation opium and
knew instantly that he was dealing
with a gang of racketeers who special-
ize in the old game of  cheating
cheaters

  the wolf began to burn up he had
gone to time and trouble of making the
jaunt from new york to vermont in
the hope of running into something
big only to be disappointed in the
worst way he concealed his anger
however for phelps was standing right
in front of him kerrigan was in a
ticklish position-and he knew it
why any one of these fellows could
bump him off out here in the wilder-
ness and make a clean get-away

  suddenly kerrigan raised the chunk
of fake opium over his head holding
it withboth hands as if to further ex-
amine it then in a fraction of a
second he let it fly-right in the face
of the man in front of him phelps
fell to the ground in a heap knocked
completely unconscious by the terrific
blow in less time than it takes to tel
it the wolf whipped out his gun and
covered the two men in the machine

   you babies can step right out of
there he snapped  before i blow
your dull brains out

  two stocky frames made clumsy
exits from the car the wolf searched
them and confiscated two revolvers
and a hundred or more loose bullets
still covering them he leaned down
and picked up phelpss gun then he
marched the two conscious captives to
the rear of the house and told them to
stand with their chests flat against two
trees which were close together kerri-
gan next ordered the men to stretch
out their arms and when these instruc-
tions were complied with he extracted
exploits of the wolf



some fine but strong copper wire from
his overcoat pocket and bound the mens
hands thus only a tree separated
each prisoner from his liberty

   i guess thatll hold you fellows for
a while said the wolf

  going back to the flivver kerrigan
noticed that phelps was beginning to
display signs of life so the little agent
grabbed the latter by the collar and
dragged him into the deserted house

  shortly after eleven thirty connol-
ley fearing that something had hap-
pened to his side-kick put in an ap-
pearance seeing the candlelights in
the front room of the farmhouse he
walked in to find kerrigan holding an
animated conversation with his desper-
ate-looking captive

   would you mind going out to the
back of the house ray and bringing in
those two eggs who are tied to the

trees theyll probably find it a little
warmer in here

  ten minutes later the three prisoners
were lined up before the two agents

   whats the idea of selling me fake
dope asked kerrigan of the trio
 im a narcotic agent and came up
here to catch you with the real stuff
 i was just thinkin was the
answer  that you aint got a thing on
us we didnt sell you real dope

   is that so shot back kerrigan
 well listen to this i didnt give you
real dough either its all counterfeit
stuff seized by other federal men in
raids we use it on guys like you
 well were even then said the
man in brown

   the hell we are said the wolf
 im taking the three of you in for
the sample of real stuff that you sold
to me in new york last night

  the second message

             hugo oakes passes up some big money
             to solve the mystery of the broken lantern

hugo oakes was leaning back
in his chair comfortably he
was trying to roll a cigarette but
not succeeding very well most of the
tobacco had already trickled down on
his wrinkled and bespotted vest yet
he seemed vastly pleased

  the papers on the desk in front of
him may have had something to do
with his mood he had been retained
as the legal representative of a wealthy
gentleman named markum whose
carelessness had involved him with the
law money big money

    his short fat body heaved and he
  sighed a satisfied sigh then he turned
  to his stenographer who had a desk in
  a corner of the same dingy office room

     mamie said oakes  we got to
  work hard to-day on this markum case
  cant lose no time

    oakes was capable of magnificent
  eloquence in a court room speech but
  elsewhere he talked as if he had
  studied english in the back room of a
  district police station

     and mamie i aint going to let
no penniless bum interrupt me either

the second message



   yes sir said mamie very seri-
ously

   whats more mamie i aint never
going to let no poverty stricken fool
that gets himself into trouble waste my
time im off this charity stuff for-
ever

    yes sir

  oakes pounded the desk

   no from now on i got to see the
cash before i lift a little finger cash
in advance mamie no exceptions
now well get busy on this markum
case and if any one comes butting
in-

  the door was opened rather it
flew open a young man was stand-
ing in the doorway

  he was quite a young man not much
over twenty a rather undersized
young man whose bow tie was tw-isted
to an almost vertical position whose
hand trembled on the doorknob and
whose eyes were wide with agitation

  oakes glared at him indignantly
the young man closed the door and
hurried in

   mr oakes he inquired

   yeah but im busy

   its awful important mr oakes
the young mans voice was rising
until it was almost shrill

  important huh it may be im-
portant to you young feller but to
me-

  the cops are after me blurted
out the young man

  oakes began to roll another cigar-
ette he shifted uneasily in his chair

   cops or no cops he objected
vigorously  im busy and i cant le
bothered-

   theyre after me the young man
repeated

   well why come to me

   i read about you in the papers-
   have you got any money

  why no sir but-

  then get out said hugo oakes
 the young man looked at him
 despairingly his mouth open

  but theyre after me he insisted
 i called up home not long ago and
 found out-theyre after me

  what for

  murder

  well you shouldnt commit mur-
 der-not unless you got money

  i didnt the young man pro-
 tested

  another innocent victim of cir-
 cumstances oakes sneered  whats
 your name

  larry-larry deronda

  who got killed

  mr lanyon sydney lanyon

 in spite of himself oakes looked in-
 terested

 lanyon eh big theatrical guy
 aint he

  a big bum exploded larry
 deronda

  well i guess he is by this time
 oakes grinned  where did he get
 killed

  out on the county highway near
 the broken lantern

  broken lantern who busted it
  thats a road house mr oakes
 called the broken lantern theres
 another road house right across the
 highway from it called the blue plume
 they found lanyon on the road out-
 side the broken lantern

  when was this

  oh about three oclock this morn-
 ing sir maybe a little before

  what was lanyon doing out there
 at three oclock this morning

  he was with my sister myrtle

  ah and what was your sister
 doing out there at three oclock this
 morning

  why she-sis was a waitress in


detective fiction weekly

the broken lantern she works until
two in the morning lanyon called for
her when she got off work and took
her across the road to the blue plume
 lanyon was sweet on your sister
was he

  larry deronda screwed up his face
as if he was about to weep

   fie-he was a dirty liar mr
oakes he claimed he was going to
put sis on the stage and all that hooey
but he-he-

   you mean his intentions werent
honorable 

   sure i mean he was a dirty
skunk

  apparently oakes had completely
forgotten that he was very busy on the
markum case he leaned across the
desk and let his half-rolled cigarette
drop on the floor

   now larry what were you doing
out on the county highway at three
oclock in the morning

  larry deronda flushed

   i-i was watching them mr
oakes i was afraid something might
happen to sis i warned her but she
wouldnt listen to me so i went out
there to watch them

  tut tut spying on your own
sister did you see anything

   not much sir theres a field on
one side of the blue plume i was
in the field looking through a side
window sis and lanyon were sitting
at a table then a waiter came up and
gave a message to sis pretty soon
she got up and walked out she walked
across the highway toward the broken
lantern then in few minutes the
w-aiter went to the table again and gave
lanyon a message and he got up and
went out too

   that was the last you saw of
them 

   no sir that is it was the last i

saw of sis i stayed there in the field
but after a while i got to thinking
maybe they were not coming back to
the blue plume i figured id better
cross the road where i could look into
the broken lantern so i got through
the fence and sneaked across the high-
way-

  larry derondas legs seemed to get
weak suddenly he dropped into a
chair

  well oakes prompted

   i-i was across the road mr
oakes almost directly in front of the
broken lantern and i ran right into
the body of a man lying by the side of
the road there wras a little light and

i	leaned over and saw that it was lan-
yon well i felt like yelling at the top
of my voice i was so glad to see that
rat dead but at that i was pretty
scared

   and so you went into the broken
lantern and called up the police
oakes suggested

   no sir not me i was kneeling
there staring down at lanyon when i
heard something i looked up and saw
somebody had come out of the broken
lantern first thing i knew the fellow
was almost up to me looking at me
well i just beat it my old rattle-
trap was a couple of hundred feet up
the highway and i hopped in and
rambled on

   and now the cops are after you

   yes sir i kept under cover the
rest of the night just scared and
just before i came up here i phoned
home to see if sis got home all right
and mother told me the cops were
after me

  oakess little eyes were gleaming
with interest then he suddenly glared
at the young man

   you ought to go to jail he re-
proved him gruffly  in fact you got
the second message



to go to jail we cant have this-a
suspected murderer running around
loose

  what do you want me to do
asked larry deronda disappointedly

   get right down to headquarters
and give yourself up said oakes
sternly  ask for inspector mallory
tell him i said to give you the best cell
in the place

  the young man got up his legs
were still shaky he fumbled with his
cap

   then youll do something for me

   i aint saying what ill do im
pretty busy you just beat it right
now

  and oakes began to shuffle a pile of
papers on his desk larry deronda
looked at him in embarrassed silence
then he turned and stumbled out of
the office

  oakes continued to fuss with his
papers for a few moments presently
he leaned back with a heavy sigh and
reached for his hat

   mamie he barked

   yes sir

   when that fellow markum calls
up tell him im too busy to attend to
him to-day

   yes sir

  oakes pushed his hat over his shiny
pate and heaved himself wearily out
of his chair

   and mamie he added fero-
ciously if markum dont like it tell
him he can go get some one else to do
his dirty work

ii

when hugo oakes got off the
bus in front of the broken
lantern two men were stand-
ing in the road near a telephone pole
talking oakes approached them

   headquarters men

  their reception was not very warm
oakess appearance was scarcely im-
pressive and the interruption obviously
irritated them one of them however
spoke to him

   no the bulls are gone now

   hm too bad id like to get a
line on this killing business im oakes
-hugo oakes

  the other man at once became
friendly his teeth which were
wedded to a cigar showed in a smile
a golden smile it was evident that he
had heard of hugo oakes

   well well mr oakes maybe we
can help you im collman proprietor
of the blue plume and this is mr
bouchet-jim bouchet jim runs the
broken lantern here

  mr jim bouchet of the broken
lantern was a large man whose none
too agreeable face had been rendered
still further ineligible as a thing of
beauty by a flattened nose and a couple
of ears that had been whacked out of
shape in some physical encounter
oakes shook hands with them

   glad you two gents are on good
terms he remarked  hardly ex-
pected to find you two chatting like this
competitors aint you

   sure growled bouchet of the
broken lantern  but we dont mind
that

  open for business are you
oakes asked

   no said collman  neither of
us opens until six in the evening and
keep open until four in the morning
but this murder has kept us around
here aint it jim

  bouchet nodded

  where did they find lanyon
oakes inquired

  bouchet stuck his foot forward and
indicated a spot in the road with the
end of his shoe


detective fiction weekly

   right there

  the spot indicated was just on the
edge of the road it was about forty
feet from the front of the broken lan-
tern there was a vacant space be-
tween the road house and the road
used doubtless for the parking of cars

  this lanyon come out here
often 

   quite a bit lately said bouchet
 came out to see the girl myrtle
deronda she worked in my place
hed come out about the time she got
off around two in the morning and
take her over to the blue plume across
the highway

   sure agreed collman of the
blue plume  theyd come over to
my place and eat and talk i guess
he added with a grin  they liked my
stuff better than jims

   looks like somebody figured out
in advance how to bump lanyon off
oakes suggested

   maybe said bouchet dubiously
 but my guess is that myrtles
brother young deronda did it any-
how i came out last night and found
him standing over the body he ran
away i understand the bulls are on
his trail hes a crazy kid anyway
and he was pretty sore at lanyon

   howr long were you out in front of
your place mr bouchet before you
saw the kid with the body

  bouchet looked at oakes rather bel-
ligerently

   i dunno about fifteen or twenty
minutes i guess

   lanyon was shot was he 

   yep shot just once a clean shot
through the heart no one heard the
shot so i guess the killer used a
silencer the bulls aint found the gun
-deronda could easy have ditched it
before now

  oakes thought a moment

   i thought id like to talk to the
waiter that delivered the messages to
the girl and to lanyon figured
maybe somebody arranged to have
them messages delivered so that lan-
yon would come out where the killer
could get him

  collman turned to bouchet with a
wide smile

   mr oakes is way off there aint
he jim

  bouchet scowled

   pie sure is nothing to that mr
oakes why i phoned over to the
blue plume myself a message for
myrtle you see the other waitress i
had working for me was supposed to
work until four oclock but she got
sick so i wanted myrtle to finish the
night out in her place

  the other girl aint you got
more than two girls working for you 
 no only two xa  the rest are
men waiters

   well oakes commented  that
would account for the message to
myrtle but how about the message the
waiter gave to lanyon a few minutes
later-the message that made lanyon
get up and follow myrtle across this
way to the broken lantern 

   nothing to that either said
bouchet  myrtle just agreed to work
until four oclock then she phoned
over to the blue plume to ask lanyon
to come back over here to the broken
lantern

  oakes pushed his slouch hat back
over his head and scratched his pate

   you gents are sure good to me
he thanked them genially  giving me
all this information by the way mr
bouchet you say you discovered young
deronda standing over the body nowt
how come you were out of your place
of business just then

  bouchets eyes flickered angrily
the second message



   me what you mean why i-
it was a fine night last night and i just
came out for a little airing i often do
that when its a fine night dont i
collman 

   you sure do collman confirmed
him

   no offense meant oakes pla-
cated them just wanted to show
how easy it is to throw suspicion on
any one you see mr bouchet how
difficult it might be for even you to
produce an alibi

   i guess thats right too agreed
collman

   and where were you mr coll-
man when lanyon was shot

  collman stared at oakes his lips
parted

   why i-i guess i was down in my
cellar about that time looking over my
stock

   can you prove that did any one
see you 

   i dont know mr oakes i dont
remember but i always go down to
the cellar about that time of night
dont i jim

   you sure do bouchet supported
him

  oakes grinned amiably

  there you go he chaffed them
neither one of you could prove an
alibi but we wont worry about that
say mr bouchet how about your
waiters-the men any suspicious
characters among em

  bouchet pondered a little

   not that i know of of course
you understand they aint saints none
of them but i dont know nothing
against them

  you got a list of your employees
aint you could i look at it

   why sure i got a list-names
addresses and telephone numbers i
guess you could see it wait a minute

  bouchet hurried into the broken
lantern and returned soon with a small
notebook which he handed to oakes

  oakes looked it through carefully
made a note or two on the back of an
envelope and handed the book back

   im sure obliged to you gents he
said heartily  say i think id like to
see the waiter-the one that delivered
those messages to miss deronda and
lanyon where could i find him

   youre lucky said collman
usually this time of day hes in town
at home but on account of the murder
hes had to stick around here this
morning you can get him right over
in my place there in the blue plume
his name is hayden billy hayden
 ill go right over said oakes
 by the way this bird that was killed
was quite a ladys man wasnt he

   sure collman grinned  lanyon
was stuck on that other dame wasnt
he jim

  yep said bouchet he used to
come out and chin with the other
waitress the one that left early last
night that was before i hired
myrtle though myrtle took his eye
right away and he ditched clara
well this other girl clara she
left the broken lantern last night
just before the killing did she

  i guess so bouchet said just a
few minutes before

   say said oakes abruptly whats
the time

  collman glanced at his watch
  just about ten oclock

   thanks said oakes

ill

in the center of the blue plume wras
an open space a dancing floor
around that were tables and along
the walls were curtained booths the
kitchen was in the rear


detective fiction weekly

  there was no activity in the place
when oakes entered except for a
porter who was scrubbing floors at the
back the only other occupant was a
man who was seated at one of the
tables

 the solitary man looked up as
oakes came in he appeared to be
about fifty pale faced white haired
dark eyed a typical waiter of the old
school oakes sat down in a chair op-
posite him

   your name hayden 

  the man nodded oakes introduced
himself

  youre the man that delivered the
messages to myrtle deronda and
sydney lanvon last night

  yes sir

   i suppose you realize that the mes-
sage you delivered to lanyon resulted
in his death

  the question seemed to startle the
man

   well it would seem so sir

  the waiter was obviously tired
lender ordinary circumstances doubt-
less he would have been in bed at this
time of day oakes softened his tone

   mr bouchet of the broken lan-
tern tells me that he telephoned the
first message the one to miss deronda
and she herself telephoned the mes-
sage to lanyon

   i believe thats correct sir

  and you conveyed both mes-
sages

   yes sir

  were the messages written
yes sir the cashier at the desk
took the messages over the phone
wrote them down on a slip of paper
and gave them to me to deliver to the
table

   did either miss deronda or lan-
yon make any comment when they re-
ceived the messages

   not that i recall sir that is ex-
cept that they were both put out at
miss derondas having to go back to
work

  now hayden when you gave
lanyon the message from the girl did
he go right out-that is out the front
door

   certainly

   theres a back door to the place
isnt there

   yes sir a kitchen door but
nobody uses it except the help

   and can you go along the outside
of the building from the kitchen door
to the highway

  yes sir theres a road conies in
from the highway trucks with sup-
plies drive right up to the kitchen door
on the south side

   very good hayden i like your
straightforward answers now show
me the kitchen door will you
hayden lifted his eyebrows in sur-
prise but he got up promptly and
led the way back to the kitchen

  oakes walked out of the kitchen
door he strolled thoughtfully down
the narrow road along the building to
the highway then back again his
eyes were searching the ground
hayden watched him curiously from
the kitchen door

  oakes returned and reentered the
kitchen hayden followed him just
inside oakes stopped he was looking
at a large sink that was close to the
door

  dishwasher work there

   yes sir

   well now the dishwasher that
was working last night from two
oclock on-i suppose hes home now
no said hayden it happens
that hes here thats him just inside
the dining room mr oakes tom
comes to work at one in the morning
the second message



he relieves the first dishwasher tom
washes dishes until the place closes up
then he does the porter work thats
why hes here now

   guess ill talk to tom then
oakes said  by the way hayden
whats the time

  hayden took his watch out opened

it

    close to ten thirty

   thanks say that picture you got
in your watch-shes some good looker
daughter is she

   no sir said hayden closing the
watch just a friend

   well said oakes  got to hurry
guess ill talk to tom first though
you can go now hayden

  hayden went back to the dining
room oakes called to the man who was
busy at the scrubbing

  tom was a young man slight of
stature eager of eye and distinctly
greasy of aspect he clearly belonged
to that unfortunate group of humans
who in spite of a ready grasp of de-
tails never succeed in mastering any
but the most menial positions

  now tom oakes confided  im
working on this murder case i want
you to help me

  toms eyes shone like twin stars

   me gosh

  yeah now where were you be-
tween two and three oclock last
night

   me why i was hanging over that
tub there massaging dishes

   think now tom are you sure
you-

  hey wait a minute tom began
to get excited  i did quit the sink for
a while

   when was that 

   i dunno just what time it was no
occasion to look but i was gone about
half an hour i guess

  now youre getting hot oakes
commended him warmly  what were
you doing while you were away from
the sink 

   i was shaving spuds

  shaving spuds think of that

      i

now

  yes sir i remember because i was
just going to leave the sink when up
comes billy hayden thats the waiter
you was talking to and billy says why
he says you cant leave the sink now
tom to fix them spuds because youll
be swamped with dishes before vou get
back

  and what did you tell him

   oh i tells him that i got to go and
shave them spuds because mr coll-
man himself ordered me to

   so mr collman ordered you to
peel the potatoes right away did he
 sure he was down in the cellar
and he comes up-the cellar door is
right over in that corner-and tells me
to barber the spuds right away

 and after mr collman told you
to fix the potatoes where did he go
 he went back down in the cellar
 and where did you work on the
potatoes tom

   why back in the vegetable room
theres a little room way back there
back of the kitchen where they keep
the vegetables thats where i always
shave the spuds

  oakes was beaming on tom de-
lightedly

   say tom youre a smart guy
now there must have been some
reason why mr collman wanted you
to fix the spuds right away and i bet
you he didnt fool a clever lad like you
what do you suppose was the reason 
tom suddenly lost some of his en-
thusiasm for a moment he seemed to
be tongue tied

  dont be afraid oakes en-

couraged him if you lose one job a
brainy guy like you can always get
another

    well said tom reassured al-
 though he lowered his voice  when
 im in the stock room i cant see the
 cellar door nor the kitchen door

    ah said oakes  you mean
 maybe they was taking something out
 or in that they didnt want you to
  see

    sure i know there was a truck
 drove up to the kitchen door not long
 before mr collman told me to go and
 fix the spuds

  fine tom now what do you
 figure it was they didnt want you to
 see

   tom lowered hi voice another notch
    itooch he whispered

    oh said oakes

   yes sir tom went on gathering
 courage  mr collmans got a couple
 of other places but he keeps most of
 his hooch here they cant fool me
 and that truck that was outside the
 kitchen door when i went to shave the
 spuds it was gone when i got back to
 the sink mr oakes

   you dont say oakes surveyed
 tom admiringly  its a good thing
 theres a wide awake chap like you
 around here tom

    yes sir tom admitted

    now dont tell any one about this
 tom ive got to go now but youve
 been a great help to me

    all right mr oakes im sure
 glad you spoke to me about it

   oakes shook hands with the dish-
 washer and left instead of going out
 through the dining room however he
 went through the kitchen door to the
 side road

   a few feet from the door he
 stopped stooped quickly and scooped
 up a small and crumpled piece of paper

 he straightened it out glanced at it
 it wras a scrawled note reading

meet me at the kitchen door of the

blue plume outside ill be waiting

for you leave by the front door and

dont tell any one	myrtle

 oakes folded the note up and in-
 serted it in his vest pocket he walked
 slowly down the road toward the high-
 way

as he reached the highway coll-
man of the blue plume was coming
across from the opposite side having
apparently just parted from his friend-
ly competitor of the broken lantern
mr jim bouchet

did you see hayden inquired
collman

 who oh you mean the waiter
sure i saw him nice old chap

 collman gazed at him rather doubt-
 fully

  learn anything he asked

  sure said oakes

  what 

  that dishwashers are smart peo-
 ple oakes told him

 the answer did not seem to satisfy
 collman his lips appeared to be fram-
 ing another question but a bus swung
 around the bend in the highway and
 oakes trudged out to hail it

iv

back ill town hugo oakes was
presently standing in front of a
small shabby house on a shabby
street he rang the bell a middle-
aged woman small of stature some-
what old-fashioned in dress and plain-
ly worried opened the door

 i want to see miss myrtle
deronda said oakes

  she isnt here just now said the
 woman  can i do anything for you 
 im her mother
the second message



   no said oakes  i want to see
her where is she

  mrs deronda hesitated

 is it about this dreadful murder
 oh it aint such a dreadful mur-
der oakes comforted her  nothing
messy about it  just a shot through the
heart

  the woman seemed on the verge of
tears

   i never wanted myrtle to work in
that road house she lamented  and
i never did thrust that mr lanyon

   well mrs deronda said oakes
 these young women are hard to
handle but i got to talk to the girl
its in the interest of your son so you
better tell me where she is

   shes with clara

   clara

   yes clara fanning thats the
other girl that worked at the broken
lantern she lives in a rooming house
a couple of blocks away down this
street-number 

  oakes thanked the woman and left
with as much speed as he could man-
age

  clara had a room on the second floor
of the rooming house to which mrs
deronda had sent him at the door
the landlady directed him and he
wheezed up a flight of stairs in a few
moments he discovered that he was un-
usually ill at ease he was in a room
with two young women both of them
quite dangerously good looking

  which of you is miss deronda
he asked

   thats me said one of them
myrtle deronda was dark with chal-
lenging black eyes stubborn little chin
and daringly fashioned lips she was
sitting on the arm of a large chair

  oakes turned to the other one who
was sunk deep in the same chair her
eyes and hair were brown a gentler

type than the deronda girl and prob-
ably some years older but still quite
handsome she was clearly distressed
and the younger one seemed to have
assumed the role of comforter

   then you must be clara fan-
ning

   yes sir

   sorry to disturb you two ladies
oakes apologized  but im represent-
ing miss derondas brother hes in the
can-er-that is hes under arrest you
know

  myrtles eyes flashed

   hes a crazy kid he ought to stay
home nights where he belongs

   maybe oakes suggested bravely
 that might be a good plan for you
too	

   say i dont need no bodyguard
the girl flared at him

   well maybe you dont oakes
hastily retracted  but we got to get
the boy out or theyll send him up for
murder

   poor kid myrtle changed her
tone at once

   now miss deronda you was over
at the blue plume with this fellow
lanyon not long before he was shot

   sure

   then mr bouchet of the broken
lantern called you up to ask you to
work the rest of the night in claras
place

   yes clara felt ill and had to go
home so of course i worked for
her

   then you called up and sent a mes-
sage to lanyon suggesting that he
come back over to the broken lan-
tern 

   wthere do you get that  suggest-
ing  stuff i just said for him to come
right over

   those messages were written
werent they


detective fiction weekly

   sure

  oakes leaned forward a stubby
forefinger raised

   now think hard miss deronda
what happened to the written message
that was delivered to you

   why i think-well i guess i put
in my pocketbook then i-oh now
i remember just before i got up to
go i was rummaging in my pocket-
book for a handkerchief and  took
the message out again and handed it
to syd lanyon

   and do you know what he did
with it

   no

   well it dont matter i know

   you know 

   yeah said oakes  he put it in
his pocket

   how- do you know-

   never mind oakes grinned
 but i want to be sure about this
who would write those messages out
before the waiter took them

   the cashier of the blue plume
said myrtle deronda impatiently

  oakes sat grinning into space for a
few moments then he turned again
to clara fanning

   and what did you do when you
left the broken lantern

    i caught the bus sir

   did you catch it right outside the
broken lantern

  the young woman hesitated

   well no sir the bus has another
stop farther down the highway about
a quarter of a mile so i walked down
there to meet it

   and why young lady didnt you
catch it right outside why walk a
quarter of a mile

  clara fannings fingers were twitch-
ing nervously myrtle was fidgeting
on the arm of the chair

   well sometimes standing in front

of the road house there some of the
men might be annoying

   some of the men now tell the
truth dont you mean one man in
particular 

   perhaps

   whats his name

   i-i cant tell you that

   what man has a small picture of
you 

  n i cant tell you that either

   oh you cant oakes was getting
brusque  isnt it a fact that this
sydney lanyon was an-er-admirer
of yours before this other young lady
cut you out 

  aw shut up put in myrtle

  but clara flushing admitted that it
was true

   now said oakes  according to
our story you were up the road wait-
ing for the bus when lanyon was
shot 

   yes sir

   ah  but can you prove it  have
you any proof that you werent right
there in front of the broken lantern
when lanyon-

  cut that out the other girl
snapped at him

  myrtle deronda had jumped oft the
chair and was standing in front of
oakes shaking her little fist in his face

   but my dear girl said oakes
soothingly  im only working up a
case for your brother ive got to-
say if you have to drag clara
into this mess so you can get larry
out why you can just let the dear boy
stay in the can

  oakes stared at her blankly then
he shrugged his shoulders

   oh all right he put his hat on
 you two ladies will be going out to
work again to-night will you 

   sure said myrtle  if youll get
out so we can get some sleep
the second message



  oakes muttered apologetically
then he stumbled to the door mur-
mured some apologies and went out

  downstairs he stopped at the land-
ladys office and asked permission to
use the telephone he called head-
quarters asked for inspector mallory

   sent you a customer this morn-
ing he reminded mallory

   uh huh we were looking for
him wed have got him anyway

   you guys never do give anybody
else any credit oakes complained

   well conceded mallory  if you
think youve got something coming
name your price

   i want you to drive me out to the
broken lantern to-night about eight
oclock said oakes promptly

  mallory grumbled but agreed

  to show you that im looking out
for your interest oakes added cheer-
fully  ill give you another live tip
 all right spill it

   about the time that lanyon was
getting shot there was a truck-a booze
truck-belonging to collman standing
out in the road near the kitchen door
of the blue plume

  well i aint friendly with the
liquor squad mallory objected

   maybe you aint but get a couple
of your men to trace that truck right
away find the truck and look it over
carefully

  that all said mallory sarcasti-
cally

   thats all-until eight oclock to-
night

v

ttell inspector said oakes
yy when mallory picked him up
in a police car at eight oclock
 were going to meet a murderer
mallory was having a difficult time
concealing his curiosity

   we got young deronda-

   yeah you got him and youll
let him loose before the nights over
 oh well mallory hedged  we
was only holding him on suspicion i
been keeping an eye on a couple of
others

   oh

  yeah them two road house
babies bouchet and collman are kind
of interesting theyre tough lads
and did you notice they aint neither
one got an alibi 

   sure but thats in their favor
oakes commented

  in their favor how do you get
that way

   listen inspector bouchet and
collman maybe aint had the benefit of
a good education like you for in-
stance but theyre pretty wise birds
at that and if either one of them was
going to stage a killing thats the first
thing hed arrange-a good alibi
mallory looked disappointed

   well anyway i got a couple of
pair of bracelets-

   you wont need em inspector
oakes assured him

  mallory puzzled turned to look at
him

   why say you dont mean that one
of them two girls perforated lan-
yon-

   first oakes interrupted  did
you find that truck 

   sure ill give you credit for that
oakes that was a hot one we
found the truck

   and there was blood on the rear
end

   right you are but how-

   just a matter of working on the
most likely angles inspector you will
remember that jim bouchet proprie-
tor of the broken lantern was walk-
ing around outside his place of busi-


detective fiction weekly

ness at the time of the murder but
so far as i could see he was not a likely
suspect lie would have gone to more
trouble to cover his tracks

   yet if some one else had shot
lanyon right where his body was
found bouchet was almost sure to
have seen or heard something well
he saw nothing and heard nothing
therefore the body must have been
dropped there and it must have been
dropped from a moving vehicle else
there would have been blood leading
up to the spot

  all right how i knew the
answer when tom the dishwasher
told me about the truck

   you aint accusing the dishwasher
are you mallory waxed sarcastic
if not who are we after

   i found the answer to that one just
outside the kitchen door of the blue
plume said oakes

   what was that

the second message the message
that the waiter delivered to lanyon
 and who does that take us to

   well see when we get there
oakes countered

   well now about this message-
 here we are at the blue plume
oakes put in  lets hop to it

  inside the blue plume business was
slack it was too early in the evening
for the crowd collman the proprie-
tor was sitting near his cashier close
to the door he looked at oakes with
disagreeable surprise

  oakes however paid no attention to
collman he approached the cashier a
middle-aged woman with watchful
eyes

   say write  meet me at the kitchen
door  on a piece of paper for me
oakes instructed her bluntly

  the woman startled looked at coll-
man and collman looked at mallory

   thats the law with him collman
told his cashier  better do as he
says

  she hesitated then scrawled on a
scrap of paper oakes took it scru-
tinized it

   now you collman

   me said collman  dont kid
me why i cant hardly write at all
 thought not oakes said and
turned to the cashier again

   say lady do your waiters write
out their checks do they put down
what a customer orders on the
checks

   sure said the woman  theres
a stack of em on that spindle and
each waiter initials his own checks
too

  oakes ran through the stack rapidly
and presently lifted one it was in-
itialed in the corner  b h

   lets go see billy hayden said
oakes to mallory

  the waiter was standing near the
kitchen door at the back of the dining
room oakes and mallory crossed
toward him oakes drew him aside
into a corner he spoke to him not
unkindly

   its all over hayden

  the waiter looked at him steadily
his pale face set rigid

  what is it sir

  no good to bluff said oakes
 you tricked sydney lanyon into
going around to the kitchen door by
way of the road along the side of the
building there you shot him loaded
the body on to the back of a truck
rode with it out to the highway and
dumped it in front of the broken lan-
tern you returned the same way
billy hayden was silent

   it was the message-that second
message-that gave you away hay-
den

	d
the second message



  oakes brought the crumpled piece
of paper from his vest pocket and un-
folded it mallory leaned over his
shoulder and read

  meet me at the kitchen door of the
  blue plume outside ill be waiting for
  you leave by the front door and-dont
  tell any one	myrtle

  your handwriting aint it hay-
den oakes insisted

  the waiter was still silent

   you figured on taking this slip of
paper away from him when you shot
him oakes went on  bui there was
a slip up myrtle gave lanyon the first
message before she left and it was
that message that you took out of
lanyons pocket this one-it was all
crumpled up-must have been clasped
in his hand and he dropped it on the
ground just as you were shooting him
still hayden said nothing

   snap out of it mallory barked
you had better come across

  but the waiter paid no attention at
all to mallory

  you can see that the case is com-
plete against you oakes proceeded
almost coaxingly  but i might add
that if you dont confess to the killing
you will place some one else a lady in
a dangerous position

  for the first time the lines on the
waiters face changed presently he
spoke reluctantly

 a lady who

   clara fanning miss fanning left
the broken lantern just before lan-
yon was shot she has no alibi-

   clara had nothing to do with it
hayden broke in hastily

   i might as well tell you the facts
sir he went on after a pause
 theres not much to it ive been
fond-too fond-of clara for some
time

 	d

   yeah oakes put in i noticed
 that picture of clara in your watch this
 morning

    but she did not encourage me i
 was too old although no older than
 that snake lanyon for a few weeks
 clara was deceived by lanyon she
 was living in a fools paradise then
 he deserted her for the other girl it
 hurt her terribly i hated him for it i
 often wished i could kill him planned
 to do it

     then last night the chance came
 when clara had to leave work because
 of illness and claras illness itself en-
 raged me all the more sir because i
 was sure he was the cause of it

    everything seemed to fit in so
 beautifully the truck was out by the
 kitchen door the driver was down in
 the cellar nobody in the kitchen
 would notice me going out and in ex-
 cept tom and he was back in the store-
 room

    when that second message came
 from myrtle to lanyon i destroyed
 - it and wrote another one it was so
 easy you seem to have learned it all
 sir i went out by way of the kitchen
 shot him loaded his body on the truck
 which i knew would leave soon it
 took a bare five minutes and nobody
 noticed my absence

     and he added  im not the least
 bit sorry

   oakes put his hand on haydens
 shoulder

     say this lanyon killing gave me a
 client this morning-young larry
 deronda nowr ive lost my client and
 i need another one how about it

   hayden looked at him hopelessly

     but i have no money sir

   oakes laughed

   money my dear man the very
 last thing i ever expect of a client is
 money

  dorothy hearn also falls into wal-
laces hands

chapter xxiii

all but one

some time later hal came to his
senses stimulated by a vague feel-
ing of urgency that he could not
define the muscles of his shoulders
and back had stiffened and felt horribly
sore when he tried to move

  suddenly in the darkness he became
aware of a hand on his arm and a voice
in his ear

   hal came the whisper again

  the fog that lay over his senses
lifted and cleared

  dan how did you get here
have you brought the police

   police nothing there wasnt
time

   can you get out again  if you can
go for help mchenry is the murderer
hes wallace hes mad as a hatter
find morgan and mccoy and bring

asperation

furiously

  i just had time to follow you
thought it was fishy the way mchenry
hung around without doing anything
saw him look at you once when you
werent looking-

why the hell didnt you tell me
 no use you wouldnt have taken
no stock in it but i knew you wouldnt
shoot a man and then run so i left


detective fiction weekly

 the lobby and hung around outside
 didnt know what to think

    nor how to think either said
 hal

    yeah well when that wheel chair
  came out right after the murder i did
 some thinking i looked at the trunk
 and saw the air holes along the top of
 it i did some thinking then when i
 guessed you were in that trunk you
 would of thought it was a rabbit-and
 not been so far out either-

    how did we get here and where
 the hell are we

    i got your car started when the
 taxi pulled away i followed going up
 through the park it was stopped all of
 a sudden i guess by the party inside
 there was a big car near and i saw
 that thing in the taxi get out the taxi
 went on and they took the trunk away
 from the road

    after a while the driver of the big
 car and whoever it was in the taxi
 came back with you between them
 they left the trunk i guess but they
 lifted you in the big car and got in
 themselves and drove away-

    you never thought of picking up
 a policeman and having him stop the
 car whispered hal with sarcasm

    i was too far away to be sure the
 figure they carried was you and if
 i tried anything like that they might
 of got away that car was faster than
 yours wonder you wouldnt keep
 yours with gas in

    go on whispered hal

    i followed that car way uptown
 and around for a while and then clear
 back down again it was a big blue
 car guess it was the one that brooks
 got your mother in it stopped on a
 corner and mchenry got in i was
 way behind luckily then the car beat
 it out toward yonkers

    once past harlem it stuck to side

roads for miles i had to dim the lights
and i sure bumped around trailing
their tail light it crossed the main
hudson road then i ran out of gas
and had to stop

   thats funny-that you had to
stop

   is it well i left the car pointing
the way i had come hoping the police
would find it  ran ahead a while and
there was the river in front and no side
road and no car i galloped around in
bigger circles over fences and through
bushes until i saw a light it was this
window i crawled up to it in time to
see that guy pasting you with that
rope-

   all right whispered hal  now
for the last time will you get out of
here and go for help

   not without you retorted dan
obstinately  think ill leave you here
alone to get beaten up again 

   oh lord groaned hal  give
me strength to deal with this dumb egg
all right then stay here and get shot
for your pains if any one comes roll
under the bed if its the black man
you lie still hed break you in two
if its mchenry alone ill jump him
and you grab his feet when i whistle
maybe he carries a gun well have to
get that away from him-

   ill handle him if i can get my
hands-

  at that moment from a distant part
of the cellar came despairing cries that
rose steadily until they became broken
screams both hal and dan felt a
coldness along their spines the voice
was that of a man beside himself with
pain and terror

  they listened until the shrieks died
away listened still in awed silence
until faint at first but growing louder
they heard the shuffle and check of
footsteps upon stone almost without
the blind fury



a sound dan rolled under the cot
some one fumbled at the door then
the light flashed on

  hal turned his head slowly wallace
and nimbo were in the room and ap-
proaching him wallace was empty
handed the nubian carried a tray
with two dishes of gold and a thin-
stemmed wine glass he set them on
the table within easy reach of hal one
plate bore a piece of dirty bacon rind
the other some moldy crusts of bread
the glass was full of muddy water

  wallace seated himself on the end
of the table nimbo stood at his side

   ive brought you the sort of
banquet my daughter enjoyed for
eighteen years explained wallace
evenly  you were whipped to-night
as she was whipped she is dying so
nimbo took toll of revenge for her
the debt is a heavy one and will take
some time to pay evans

   it wont take long on this sort of
food said hal  who else have you
been torturing just now

   i told you that my daughter gloria
is dying it is only a matter of hours
i think papaniotis has satisfied him-
self of her approaching dissolution and
therefore of his own because when she
dies i will kill him though nimbo
has beaten him almost every day he
seems to cling to life but gloria does
not he has not made life attractive
to her

  again hal sensed an abyss of suffer-
ing beneath the pitiless voice despite
his own wrongs he felt a certain re-
spect for this broken-hearted madman
with his iron self-control

   thats-pretty tough he admit-
ted  even if my visit here hasnt
been particularly entertaining im glad
my father had no hand in your
troubles

  wallace lifted one eyebrow in iron-

ical disbelief as he glanced about the
room

  suddenly his regard grew fixed then
flashed back upon his prisoner hal
guessed that he had seen the cellar
window hanging open a little from the
top hal returned his stare blankly
but wallace was not deceived

  he drew a revolver and laid it across
his knees at the same time motioning
toward the window

   that should have been nailed up
he rasped  our guest is not as weak
as he looks see to it

  grinning anxiously the nubian
rolled his eyes at the revolver and hur-
ried out of the cell soon he was back
again with a hammer and a dozen long
nails which he drove in the sash

  lacking leverage from the inside it
would be impossible now to open the
window even if the glass was broken
the panes were too narrow for the
passage of a mans body through the
space they occupied

  and wallace had two prisoners in-
stead of one though he did not knoav
it

  nimbo returned to his masters side
to attack wallace during the blacks
absence had been out of the question
because of that ready revolver

   you complain of your entertain-
ment observed hals captor  would
you like to hear how my revenge was
accomplished it was difficult and in-
tricate but successful

  hal nodded shortly he hoped that
both nimbo and the revolver might
disappear during the narrative giving
him a chance at wallace

   i planned the work long in ad-
vance began his captor  my posi-
tion at the dam was important for its
contact with hearn but more im-
portant to avert suspicion

   in order to use it as an alibi it wag

necessary to be in two places at once
so far as the usual methods of trans-
portation are concerned

   i bought a seaplane and learned to
fly in the wild country above the
site of the dam there is a little lake i
hid the plane there before i became
 mchenry

   in this way i was able to carry
nimbo from above the dam to the inlet
near your home last saturday night
and arrive early in the evening there
was the symbol to leave and wre had to
make other preparations

   after the house had been fired we
went back to the plane and reached
our little lake before daylight so far
as the workmen knew i had never left
the dam

  hals grief and rage returned full
flood it cost him a violent effort to
hold his tongue

   sunday night we blew up the dam
monday evening we removed hearn
after his death the police permitted
me to leave for buffalo to visit my
sick wife i made for the plane in-
stead nimbo had reached it ahead of
me-

   how did he get away from the

dogs

   he walked in the stream for a few
yards and then took to the trees his
arms are strong as you may remem-
ber

   sort of missing link said hal
with a savage glance at the nubian

  nimbo stared back at him blankly

   we came down on the hudson
that night not far from here the next
day i drove into towrn for your mother
that was tuesday-

   how did you know where to find
her

   one of my agents met me at your
home saturday night and followed you
into town sunday morning

  dont see why the police let you
leave the dam monday night-right
after you murdered hearn

   i had another agent in buffalo
evans he wired me to hurry to the
bedside of my mythical invalid wife i
had only to show that wire to the po-
lice

   and the same man wired from
buffalo asking for quiet rooms for you
in new york hal exclaimed

   almost obvious-now that you
know replied wallace with a faint
sneer to continue we drove your
mother to a place of safety later we
returned to new york to get dorothy
hearns jewels i found them myself
just before she woke but i slipped
out of the window while she wras star-
ing at nimbos luminous skull

   it was touch and go that night we
had to wrork fast but i got back to
the plane in time to reach the lake the
dam and the inquest in barton the fol-
lowing morning i left nimbo behind
to prepare for his part on wednesday
afternoon it was all play to him he
does not know what fear means

   he will muttered hal

   i doubt it by the way i trained
him to stand on a chair if any one ex-
cept his victim could see him i want-
ed the police to think they had a defi-
nite clew and look for a man of great
height as well as strength

   we gathered that hal retorted
 did you  how interesting as
regards hearn i knew that he had
skimped on cement and would wish to
examine the damage alone it was
simple to post nimbo at the top of the
dam where the concrete was faulty
when flearn got up there nimbo
throttled him pinned the symbol on
his chest and flung him to the bed of
the stream i wished the crash of his
body to distract attention and give
the blind fury



nimbo more time to get clear as i
led the pursuit and did the firing i was
pretty sure he would not be hit of
course he escaped

   for the moment retorted hal
wallace chose to ignore the proph-
ecy

   my agent in buffalo he contin-
ued  wired mccoy that i would leave
barton after the inquest and take the
train to new york i did so

   in the meantime my new york
agent drove nimbo to a station where
my train would stop we came to new
york together and accepted the suite
opposite yours-

   you mean that your nervous wife
was-nimbo cried hal you
smuggled him into the hotel-

  of course my wife was sup-
posed to have a terrible skin disease
so nimbo could keep out of sight and
i could bandage his face and hands
when the waiters came in huddled
in a wheel chair his bulk was hardly
noticeable

   you must have enjoyed my sym-
pathy said hal

   or your stupidity that empty
suite seemed a gift from the gods the
god of vengeance perhaps-

   next comes murray he was
shrewd enough to guess his danger and
guard his person i did not dare risk
nimbo in a direct attack on him then
came that matter of the contract an-
other gift from the god of vengeance
what i overheard you say to murray
over the phone and what you after-
ward told me showed me how to get
murray away from his men

   when i left the hotel that after-
noon i phoned you as burke telling
you to stay there all evening then i
phoned murray that you wanted to see
him later i sent morgan and mc-
coy on a wild-goose chase ta long

island-to find a double cross waiting
for them

   it was probable that you would
take murray upstairs to discuss your
misunderstanding and that he would
leave his guards in the lobby nimbo
was waiting behind our door he had
the automatic which we had taken from
your room the night before when we
got the contract

   nimbo shot murray throttled you
dragged you into our suite and locked
you up in the big empty trunk we
brought with us for that purpose-
you got me out of the hotel in a
trunk demanded hal quickly dan
had already told him so but dan was
not supposed to be hiding under his
cot at that moment

   of course nimbo left the auto-
matic to incriminate you your disap-
pearance would look like flight the
police would believe you guilty at least
until after we escaped

   but how did you escape
wallace nodded toward the big
nubian

   my  wife  was supposed to be
highly neurotic i explained that the
shots and subsequent excitement had
almost brought on a stroke and it was
vital to get her away the police let
me send her and her trunk to a nursing
home an hour later morgan him-
self let me get away to see that she was
comfortable he will be annoyed with
himself to-morrow when i fail to ap-
pear at his office

  wallace paused for a moment

   so here we are he concluded-
 all but one

  what do you mean cried hal
although he guessed

   your little friend dorothy hearn
owes a debt replied his captor

 why what has she done if
you dare touch her-


detective fiction weekly

  well inquired wallace tone-
lessly

   ill kill vou if its the last thing i
do

   you mentioned that before i
think her payment begins to-morrow
-here

      chapter xxiv
      the shuffle of feet

hals thoughts raced too much
confidence might lead wallace to
suspect dans presence he tried
pleading

  but theres no sense in it shes
never done you any harm why punish
her

   so far as i know my tiny children
had never done any one any harm yet
they suffered horribly-for eighteen
years-all through their childhood and
youth

   whats that got to do with dorothy
hearn 

   they are my children hearn
made them suffer dorothy hearn is
his daughter there still remains a
debt from his family to mine-what is
left of it

  thats not sense its madness
what about mother

   i shall release your mother re-
plied wallace evenly  she profited
by your fathers treachery to me but
she has lost her money and shes going
to lose her son you and hearns
daughter will pay most of your debt
elsewhere your mother has suffered
and will suffer enough

  between rage and dread hal had to
fight for control of himself he almost
lost the struggle

   its all lies he shouted  youre
not wallace youre irish youre
mchenry-a sore employee-

  his captor studied him keenly

   you want all the facts youd like
to denounce me later eh  but you be-
lieve my story have it so

   in twenty years of wandering i
made by bread in many ways i was
on the stage for a while the part of
an irishman is easy to play the part
of that ignorant suspicious sailorman
who befooled papaniotis was much
more difficult is there anything else
youd like to know

  hal shook his head slowly

   youre insane of course he de-
clared  or youd know that you cant
heal old scars by making new ones
theres something in the bible about
vengeance maybe you know it
wallace stood up and pocketed his
revolver

   the lord had his chance for
eighteen years evans but he let my
children suffer now vengeance is
mine  i think thats all between us
for to-night

  he walked out of the cell nimbo
followed snapped off the light and
bolted the door behind him

  hal lay still his back hurt him
terribly but it was forgotten in the
torment of his thoughts

  his mother was a prisoner of this
madman who might or might not keep
his word to free her hal had little
doubt that wallace would capture
dorothy despite morgan and mccoy
judging by the devilish ingenuity he
had already shown he and dan were
unarmed-helpless as yet-

  if dan had only gone for help-

  a bump and a muffled curse focused
his attention elsewhere

  he lifted himself painfully on one
elbow dan was crawling from under
the bed

   maybe we cant get out muttered
dan  but you wanna stay dont
you
the blind fury



  hal dropped on his face with a
stifled groan

   you win the cut glass bath mat
you long eared wall-eyed pig headed
ass he whispered

    is that so

  and theres your bray well
climb up on this bed and see if you can
lay your ears back and kick out these
bars overhead if you step on my back
ill pull you apart

  dan climbed obediently fumbled
about and shook the bars until the bed
creaked under him

   not a chance he whispered

  dan stepped off the bed he felt his
way to the door explored its surface
tested the bolt and returned

   nothing doing there he said
 but its got a bolt on the inside we
could keep em out-

   sure while they smoke us out-
or starve us to death youre mothers
little helper you are

  with a sore back a raging thirst and
a sense of utter helplessness hal wras
letting go a little

   anybody that didnt know you
muttered dan resentfully  ud think
you was kinda irritated

  hal gasped and lay still

   well he muttered at last  heres
half the bed might as well get some
sleep maybe wallace will give us a
chance at him alone to-morrow if we
can get his gun and bolt the door you
can keep the others away from the bars
and the window  

   ill sleep under the bed dan
broke in

  he arranged hals coat over his sore
back took off his owrn and crawled into
hiding

  luckily the summer night wras so
warm that the cellar was not uncom-
fortably cool

  shock and exhaustion spared hal an

awakening to his plight until midday
dan woke earlier ravenous with hun-
ger but he kept as quiet as possible
anxious to let his companion sleep and
regain his strength

  at noon nimbo unbolted the door
and flung it open rousing hal the
big nubian shuffled into the- room
after him entered a grizzled hard-
eyed individual with a wealth of tat-
tooing on his bare arms lie carried a
tray of dishes and a coffee pot nimbo
removed the dishes with their mocking
contents the sailor set his tray on the
table with a crash

  nimbo grinned vacantly at hal and
the two tramped out again the door
closed the bolt shot home

  hal sat up quickly stared at the tray
and sniffed unless both sight and
smell deceived him here was a real
breakfast coffee scrambled eggs
bacon frizzled by an expert a covered
dish that might mean toast-

  dans head and long lean neck wrere
thrust turtle-fashion from under the
cot

   food he croaked

  hal reached for the tray then drew
back

   food it is but why-after that
other muck drugs disease germs
damn wallace

   if youre gonna let a little thing
like that spoil your appetite muttered
dan  lemme taste it-

   nothing doing youre my ace-in-
the-hole if wallace comes in alone ill
taste it myself-

  he did so since dan could not
scramble out in time to prevent him
there seemed nothing wrong with the
food hunger conquered caution hal
began to divide the meal into two equal
shares

  dan stood by with itching fingers
but a dim light filtered into their cell


detective fiction weekly

through the window and hal ordered
him out of sight again under the bed

  in a moment he was wolfing his
share and passing the other half down
to dan

  both felt better after the meal but
hals sense of well-being was purely
physical to think of dorothy in the
hands of this madman stung him to
apprehension

  about two thirty nimbo appeared
again this time he was alone with
another grin at hal he picked up the
tray and departed bolting the door as
usual but he failed to switch off the
light

  when dan stuck his head out hal
ordered him in a vicious whisper to
pull it in again

  a little after three they were star-
tled by hoarse screams from the same
distant point the muffled sounds rose
to a crescendo of horror and ceased
abruptly

  still listening the two prisoners
heard the shuffle of feet along the pas-
sage approaching their door

   now for it whispered hal
 keep out of sight

  but the shuffle passed on and
stopped then they heard it again
from somewhere close at hand

 hal looked up suddenly the
square of barred darkness above his
head now showed a light beyond

  he rose cautiously to his knees to
look through the bars just before his
head reached the level of the opening
the light beyond went out

  hal rose  higher but lay down
again no good showing the silhouette
of his head against the light in his cell
he wanted his captors to think him
weaker than he actually was it might
add a fraction to his chances

he was hardly prone again before
the cell door opened and wallace

strode in hal turned his head wearily
the mans face was drawn and pale
but his eyes blazed

  nimbo shuffled in at his heels

  you heard that bellowing wal-
lace demanded

   another victim  queried hal in a
weak voice

  wallace advanced to the table
there his figure began to lose its erect
tensity his shoulders drooped a little
the light of fury faded from his eyes
leaving only shadows of hopeless trag-
edy the glance that met hals seemed
turned inward and blind with pain

   gloria died this morning he
muttered  she died while i was gone
you heard papaniotis before he fol-
lowed her if i could kill him a thou-
sand times-

  the harsh voice trailed off into si-
lence

  hal felt his judgment reeling this
was plain murder yet wallace had
suffered-was suffering-almost past
endurance because of papaniotiss old
cruelty

  it needed hals dread for dorothy
to steel his determination tragedy or
no this madman must be downed

  wallace looked slowly in his direc-
tion as though seeking him with blind
eyes

   i have done you and your mother
an injustice he droned monotonously
you will suffer no more harm from
me as soon as possible you will be lib-
erated your mother is here and quite
unharmed in other ways i have done
what i can to make amends it is too
late to bring back your father and my 
friend i made a mistake there-

   youve made more than one said
hal grimly

  yes i trusted to letters-for
eighteen years

  there was a little silence
the blind fury	

   how did you learn that dad never
betrayed you hal demanded

   an old letter some one sent it to
the papers morgan no doubt your
father wrote it soon after my crash
he offered to help me i never got it
you were right

  hal studied his captor blankly here
were sanity and madness cheek by
jowl hands still shaking from one
murder wallace sincerely regretted
another having wreaked his triple
revenge with almost incredible skill
and foresight he had shown a simple-
minded carelessness in confessing his
crimes he had bedeviled hal and his
mother now he would make amends
then dorothy might escape harm if
hal pleaded her cause-

  but hal hesitated while admitting
his human mistake the man still
usurped the prerogative of a deity he
had inflicted a sort of rough justice
demanding an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth

  hals heart sank if hearn had
been guilty how could dorothy hope
to escape such mad distorted revenge

  wallace straightened his shoulders
and spoke

   in the meantime he sighed
 you are again to witness the justice
of punishment inflicted in kind
nimbo	

  before hal could stir the black had
lifted him like a child and stood him
up on the bed the nubian leaped to
his side gripped him by one wrist and
arm and spun him about to face the
dark barred opening

  hal turned his head quickly wal-
lace was eying him to risk an upper-
cut at the blacks jaw would be mad-
ness

  with the skill of long practice
nimbo bound first one of his wrists
and then the other to the bars he

stepped down leaving hal securely
lashed his enemies behind him in the
lighted room and mysterious darkness
before him

  the bed creaked as wallace took the
nubians place his head close to hals
at the bars

  a wall switch clicked hal found
himself looking into a cell like his own
now flooded with light but it backed
a window presumably the barred
opening was intended for ventilation

   on the far side of the cell with its
head against the wall stood a cot like
his own dorothy lay there dressed
and fast asleep

  hal caught his breath at the sight
of her

  she lay with her head away from
him her slim arched feet projected
limply beyond the foot of the bed her
ankles were bound to the bar there
the rope ran under the bed where it
was fastened out of her reach

   hal turned his head to face wallace
 untie her and let her go he or-
dered with desperate calmness  i love
her wallace you have no quarrel
with me you owe me something for
that beating

   no said wallace

   if you must torment somebody
take it out on me not on a girl

   no that it happens to be she who
must suffer is your misfortune not my
fault her father was guilty

  hal jerked at his fettered wrists
his eyes narrowed to slits glimmer-
ing with a chill desperate purpose

   ill kill you for murdering my fa-
ther he promised huskily but if
you touch that girl in there you mad-
man ill torture you to death ill fol-
low you until i get you as you fol-
lowed them

  for an instant wallace hesitated
then he shrugged

chapter xxv

the last stand

when dorothy reached the of-
fices of her fathers lawyer that
afternoon her detective escort
left hlr she was admitted at once
elder was conferring with a man past
middle age he greeted her warmly
then asked leave to present judge
moreland

  dorothy saw a rather stern-looking
man of great natural dignity the
sternness was modified by his smile

   so this is dorothy he echoed the
introduction  pardon my familiarity
you had been eating mud pies wrhen
i last saw you

  dorothy laughed  my passion for
mud pies has faded

   has mr elder -told you that we
are closely related asked the judge
 i dont-quite understand
your father asked me to be your
godfather and i accepted the honor
promising to come to your aid in time
of need not every one takes such a
promise seriously but i have always
managed to keep my word miss
hearn

  dorothy smiled uncertainly judge
moreland nodded

   when i heard of your fathers
death i came up from baltimore where
i have been living in retirement i am
without other ties you must not hesi-
tate to let me keep my word to poor
ben mr elder tells me that your af-
fairs are in a muddle that wont do
i hope you will let me take your future
into my hands i am a just man miss
hearn it will be a pleasure to me
dorothy was touched so touched
that her eyes filled with quick tears

   youre awfully kind she said
 but-were quite strangers i have
no claim on your kindness judge
moreland playing godfather to a
child is no more than a pretty custom
 it is more to me only some fifteen
years have passed since you were kind
to a bachelor who was rather at a loss
in your presence you put me at ease
by presenting me with a large piece of
sticky candy whats more i ate it

   ive asked mr elder to prepare for
me a statement of your financial posi-
tion he continued  while his clerk
is at it will you join me at lunch so
that i can apologize for taking such a
liberty

   so that you can use your legal skill
to override my objections she cor-
rected smiling  well i accept the
invitation to lunch for the other i
dont see why-

   the lunch is all i ask replied the
judge gravely  until we are better ac-
quainted miss hearn

  he rose and held out his arm in a
courtly way

  dorothy accepted it with a small
brown hand warming to the obscure
sadness she read in his face

  down in the street judge moreland
called a taxi and helped her into it
they drove to another large building
farther uptown here the judge ex-
plained he had told his chauffeur to
meet him

  he dismissed the taxi and looked
about for his car

   the rascal isnt here he smiled
 probably he is waiting at the other
entrance

  he led her through the long foyer
toward the next street as they trod
the tiled floor side by side dorothy
felt a surge of gratitude to her escort
in his position not one man in a mil-
lion would have considered himself
the blind fury



obligated to help her an upright
judge she mused he had called him-
self a just man not a generous one
what a quaint point of view

  almost as soon as they appeared in
the street beyond a big dark-blue
limousine drew up at the curb the
chauffeur jumped down to open the
door about to slip lithely into the
tonneau dorothys finer instinct made
her wait to allow the judge to hand
her in

  he took his place at her side the
door slammed the driver hopped back
to his place as the car drew swiftly
away from the curb dorothy turned
to smile at her companion

  at that instant she felt a sharp pain
in her arm and uttered a little cry of
surprise 

  judge moreland looked his concern

   what is it my dear he inquired
anxiously

    pricked my arm on something
she exclaimed  why-i feel quite
ill-

  darkness swooped down upon her
senses she did not even feel the judge
slip his arm about her waist and draw
her nodding head to rest against his
shoulder

  later she was dimly aware of a
shout and a grinding crash she tried
to stir something stung her arm
again she lost consciousness

  her next impression was very shad-
owy she thought some one was carry-
ing her-an interminable distance-

  she felt herself laid on a resilient
surface and drowsily opened her eyes

  close above her floated a black and
dreadful face she tried to scream
but could manage no more than a piti-
ful murmur of fright a third time
came the pain in her arm and again she
fell asleep

  she was still unconscious though on

the edge of waking when hal first saw
her on the cot in the next cell his
pleading and threats came to her as a
blur of sound

  she lay still too listless to raise her
eyelids

  then she saw i lals face against the
bars his bound wrists wallaces hand
at his throat and wallaces face at his
shoulder

   whats the matter  she gasped
 what are you doing there hal is
that you judge moreland whats
happened-

  suddenly she remembered morgans
warning her hand flew to her mouth
and she stared at them with scared
eyes

  wallaces voice rasped in hals ear

   nimbo get in there the lash

  hal turned a desperate face in time
to see the black grin vacantly and
shuffle out of the room yet this might
be their chance if only he could free
himself he jerked and strained at his
bonds they would not give way but
he hoped the creaking bed would cover
the noise dan might make as he
crawled from beneath it

  far from guessing his object wal-
lace dropped the knife he had snatched
up from the table and gripped hals
shoulders with both hands swaying
with his struggles as lie looked past
him into the next cell

  hal saw nimbo roll into sight lash
in hand and approach dorothy her
sharp scream of alarm set him beside
himself but the ropes held

  suddenly there was a double weight
on his shoulders and a shout in his ear
wallace let go of him stumbled back
and toppled to the stone floor

  from the next room came a fright-
ened scream of pain

  dorothy hal yelled insanely

  behind him as he fought his bonds


detective fiction weekly

he could hear a thrashing struggle in
progress a second cry reached his
ears and he grew desperately sane
there was one loose loop in the rope
he caught it with his teeth and ground
at it like a savage animal

  a knife glittered past his eyes and
sliced the taut rope near one wrist
dan hacked at the other he was free

  he turned swiftly wallace was just
lifting his head from the floor
struggling to draw his revolver his
face dark with the choking dan had
given him

  spurred by a shriek from the next
room hal sprang off the bed and
landed on wallace with both feet
knocking him flat again

   get his gun dan he yelled
 hold him here-

  regaining his balance he flung him-
self into the hall wallace found his
voice at the same instant

  nimbo he shouted here to
me	

  the cry saved dorothy from further
harm

  as hal tore into the next room
nimbo was turning toward the door
wild with rage though he was hal
realized that he was no match for the
black if they came to grips nimbo
crouched and sprang at him hal put
everything he had into one hasty swing
it missed nimbos jaw but landed in
his great thick neck

  having made no attempt to guard
himself the black took the full weight
of the blow and went over backward
with a jar and a grunt he lay still for
a second in sheer surprise

  desperately cool hal remembered
the sailor who had brought his food
he turned like a flash bolted the door
on the inside and whirled again nimbo
had scrambled to his feet hal met his
savage charge with a straight-arm blow

on the nose and leaped aside to escape
his clutching hands

  ignorant of such fighting the black
did nothing but try to rush him again
and again hal struck and escaped
swinging and jumping clear with a
savage and primitive lust

  dorothy watched the fight without a
sound instinct warned her not to cry
out lest she distract hals attention for
one fatal instant

  still nimbo came on his great bat-
tered face snarling and smeared with
blood his huge hands reaching reach-
ing

  once he maneuvered hal against the
bed forcing him to leap clear over it
behind dorothys shrinking back

  hal heard a shot in the next room
and a yell of pain from dan his heart
sank he struck and struck again in
savage anxiety

  suddenly nimbo turned from him
ran clumsily to the door and switched
off the light swerving in the sudden
darkness hal brought up against the
bed nimbo sprang for the sound just
in time hal distinguished the luminous
face as it bobbed close he struck with
all his force the black grunted with
pain but one of his clutching hands
touched hals arm turned and gripped
it

  with a furious twisting wrench ilal
managed to free himself it was a
close call he dared not risk such an-
other darting sideways he felt for the
bed and scrambled across dorothy
knocking her flat luckily for hal
though unhappily for the breathless
girl nimbo clambered after him in-
stead of turning aside to cut him off

  it gave hal time to blunder to the
door find the switch and snap it on
again before the nubian bore too close
nimbo followed all his movements by
ear with an uncanny accuracy
the blind fury



  again hal escaped the blacks rush

  suddenly the latch of the door
rattled a great voice boomed at
nimbo to open the door a furious
pounding began on its panels

  dan must be out of the fight every
instant hal expected the inside bolt to
give or a shot from the barred opening
to bring him down

  but he dared not even glance aside

  he had landed half a dozen blows on
nimbos throat and chin that would
have knocked any other man uncon-
scious the black only growled in re-
sponse mouthing at him like an ani-
mal the ferocity of his rushing attack
increasing as hals hard bare fists
crashed against his face and body

  the most nimble of footwork was
vital against such a giant hal was tir-
ing fast but the nubian seemed made
of steel springs

  hal fought on without hope getting
what satisfaction he could out of his
punishing blows

  at last as he slipped between his
opponent and the foot of the bed his
foot struck a caster spinning him half
about in a flash the nubian gripped
his shoulders and yanked him over
backward his head struck the stone
floor with a crash

  before he could stir the man wasm
top of him snarling with hate those
terrible hands clutching his throat de-
spite his sudden thrashing efforts to
avoid them

  dorothy screamed at the top of her
voice flung herself over the foot of the
bed and buried both her small hands in
the murderers hair

  fighting in vain to draw one breath
of air hal heard her screams more
faintly as the roaring in his ears in-
creased the room grew dim nimbos
bleeding snarling face seemed to re-
cede to a vast distance

  with a last shudder he lost con-
sciousness

      chapter xxvi
      a crumpled fender

the news that dorothy had been
abducted and that mccoys men
had failed to trace her left a
vibrant silence in morgans office the
columnist was angry-and anxious

  he stared at his companion with
eyes that glinted under bushy brows
the police had accomplished nothing
in the case now they had blundered
badly

  but not all the responsibility was
theirs

  mccoy and he had blundered at
every turn

  morgan surged to his feet to stride
back and forth a glimmer of white
caught his eye some one had slipped
an envelope under the door he
swooped for it

  the captain needed only the slight
stiffening of morgans big body to
jump up and look over his shoulder

  morgan held a card bearing the
familiar symbol dollar signs and
skulls occupied the first seven spaces as
before in the bottom row where two
had been vacant up to now the middle
space c o n t a i n e d a cat-o-nine-tails
sketched in ink but unmistakable the
final space was still empty

   good night morgan rumbled
 this is foul weve got to get those
men and get em quick

   whats it mean 

  it means theyve turned from mur-
der to torture theres no time to lose
how long will it take that raid car to
get here

   half an hour twenty minutes
more maybe

  what time is it now

  mccoy looked at his watch

   just on two

   eh what-by gad ross-

  morgans face flamed darkly drop-
ping the card he pounced on the classi-
fied telephone directory and slapped
through its pages me sat down with
the big book open before his eyes and
diligently applied himself to the tele-
phone

  his calls completed he turned to
mccoy

   ross locate the cops who went
to the belmore last night let me talk
to em

  mccoy called ihe nearest police sta-
tion

   here he growled  heres the
sergeant

  morgan put a rapid fire of questions
that brought the captain upright in his
chair thanked the sergeant and re-
placed the receiver

  right under their noses he
snapped

   what dye mean 

 mchenry hes brooks and
we let him go not a woman was ad-
mitted last night to any nursing home
in the bronx but half an hour after
ihe murder mchenry wheeled his suf-
fering wife out of the hotel while your
cops stood by the sergeant says her
face and hands were bandaged shes
a he ross the murderer was in that
chair

   but mchenry came down here to
help us he was up at the dam when
evans was murdered-

   not he why did he wire for a
quiet suite he knew the one across
from the evanss was empty he took
it to get evans hes played with us
like a pair of kids

   you think he got evans out-

   in that big trunk the sergeant
speaks of

  if young evans has been knocked

about-

  he can stand it morgan
snapped  but theyve got dorothy
hearn shes a girl ross god
knows what well see in that last

space-

   why growled mccoy wheres
their motive

   damn the motive weve got to
save that girl

   theres nothing to do but go out
there-

  where got any program

   see that cop at mount vernon
get a description of the car look up
our patrols out there what else can
we do

  mccoy was almost humble

  morgan dropped his head in his
hands suddenly he sat up with a
shout grabbed the telephone and called
his paper

  five minutes later he hung up in
triumph

   ross can you get hold of a police
boat-to meet us at yonkers theres
just a chance-

  sure i can what for

   mchenrys our man he had to
be at the dam every day how could
he strike down here and get back there
by morning and what an alibi-
only a plane ross but no plane could
land in that rough country he had
to have water-and a seaplane my
people looked it up on a big map
theres a little lake not far above the
dam but less accessible thats where
your murderer went when they lost
track of him up there-

   still i dont get the police boat
idea-

   that dark-blue car is up the hud-
son somewhere mchenrys through
at the dam hed bring his plane away

 n
the blind fury



to come down on water if we go tip
by water theres a chance we may see
his plane

   right but im sending that car-
load of police by road as well im
counting on those patrols if we both
have luck we can take him from both
sides-

  morgan nodded impatiently mc-
coy called headquarters ordered a po-
lice boat told burke to send out a gen-
eral order to pick up mchenry and
asked for news

   nothing new on the big case sir
burke reported

   well send out an order to watch
for a big trunk mchenry had one
with him

   a park patrolman found a big
trunk in central park this morning
no shelves or drawers pierced with
air-holes-

   thats the trunk why didnt they
report it to police headquarters at
once

   they did captain you hadnt
mentioned a trunk-

   thats right my fault get that
police boat started for yonkers as
quickly as possible will you

  the force loved mccoy because he
played fair

  morgan was calling mount vernon
when they heard the siren of their raid
car in the street far below the motor
cycle cop was conscious again and they
could see him

  their progress northward to the
boston road was a thing of sound and
fury mccoy led in his own car which
hardy drove the raid car followed
both sirens blared as they tore through
the streets morgan was glad to have
it so any one who saw them would
think they were going all the way by
road

  at the hospital mccoy was led at

 	d

once to the ward where his patrolman
lay

  the man looked up with sullen apol-
ogy in his eyes

  the captain grinned and touched his
shoulder

   tough luck smith lets hear
the story

  smith lay back and looked his grat-
itude

   that girl came out with an elder-
ly man they took a taxi i trailed
em they stopped uptown a ways and
let the taxi go i watched em through
a long lobby and took a couple a cor-
ners in time to see em pulling away in
a big blue car that looked fishy-
the change and the blue car-but you
said just trail em of course i got
the number

  he repeated it mccoy wrote it
down

  right then what

   i followed em uptown keeping
back they crossed the harlem to-
ward mount vernon i closed in a bit
i noticed they was on good terms the
girl had her head on his shoulder
morgan suppressed a groan at this
point

   well sir they turned into a side
road that leads over to yonkers it
wrinds a lot and i had to close in for
fear of losing em i figured theyd
take me for a civilian now anyway
but they must have seen me earlier 
took a curve fast and there was the
car pulled up across the roadi hit the
front fender thats all i remember
until i woke up here a while ago

   all right nodded mccoy rising
 anything you need 

   not a thing sir thanks im sor-
ry-

   forget it and get well come on
morgan

  in a few minutes they wtere speed-


detective fiction weekly

ing toward yonkers there hardy
stopped long enough for morgan and
mccoy to get out then tore northward
again leading the raid car

  the police boat was waiting mc-
coy took command and they shot away
up river putting on speed until a bow
wave of clear water hissed high to port
and starboard

  soon after they passed irvington
morgan got his companion to puil in
and hug the east shore

  the grim walls of sing sing swung
into sight rose high above them
slipped past suddenly morgan
shouted

   see that old dock  pull in
closer-

  the wheel was put over the boat
careened as she veered to starboard
nearer the shore drawing close they
saw that the wharf was old belonging
to a disused factory

   here we are cried morgan
 look

  a road dipped down a ravine toward
the wharf at one time it had crossed
the railroad lines old planking led
across the tracks more recently the
fence that guarded the right of way
had been built across the road

  now something had torn through
that fence flinging its woven wires to
left and right and just clear of the
tracks lay a crumpled dark-blue fen-
der

  as the boat pulled cautiously along-
side the wharf they noticed that a post
at the end of it had been broken off
short very recently for the splinters
were bright yellow

  they landed and hurried across the
tracks chips of dark-blue paint clung
to the broken wires of the fence

  one of the men in the boat called to
them and pointed in the eddy down-
stream floated a black leather cushion

  out of control rasped mccoy
 theyre drowned

  drowned nothing morgan
snapped at him  here went mchen-
rys incriminating dark-blue car with
nobody in her the house is some-
where above

   they went past the next town with
mrs evans

   and doubled back mchenrys
clever but hes not far away nor
evans and his mother and dorothy
hearn

   would he leave such a clewr so
close to home 

   he figured wred come by road and
never see it

  morgan did not trouble to add that
even by water mccoy had missed the
clew until it was pointed out to him

   worth having a look anyhow
mccoy agreed

  he called an order the boat wras
made fast all except two of the men
on her came ashore to join him

  mccoy led them up the road to the
top seeing no house he sent his men
into the woods on either side in a
widening circle he and morgan
stayed on the road

  presently a man came trotting back
to them

   empty car farther along sir he
reported

  another policeman burst out of the
bushes to their right ran up and sa-
luted

   big house off there near the cliff
sir looks old and deserted but i
saw a light-

   got him  cried mccoy  wait
here for us you two tell the others
to wait wdien they come back

  he strode along the road with mor-
gan until a bend showed them the car
morgan stared at it and whistled
softly
the blind fury



   bottis thats young evanss car
bottis smelled a rat and trailed em
theyve got him too or he would have
phoned us for help long before this
the house ross

  the men from the boat had collect-
ed again on the road the man who
had found it led the way to the house
presently it showed through the trees
an old-fashioned wooden structure
with cupolas and wooden lacework

  the men spread out to surround it
morgan spotted the light low down in
a cellar window

  suddenly they heard the muffled re-
port of a revolver

   blow the charge and be damned
roared morgan  pm for the front
door-

  mccoy drew his whistle and blew it
his men closed in about the house he
raced after morgan arriving in time
to see the big column writer burst
through the aged front door with a
crash they both heard the alarm bell
that rang somewhere below three
men crowded in after them

  somewhere beneath them came an
agonized screaming in a girls voice
it turned morgan cold

  he thundered down the hall luck-
ily the cellar stairs were exactly where
he hoped to find them he plunged
down mccoy and the others at his
heels

  dorothys cell was near these stairs
hals beyond when the warning bell
rang wallace and the sailor had been
pounding on her door which hal had
lxlted on the inside

  at the first alarm wallace thrust the
sailor along the passage toward the
front of the house and followed him

  the two were at the far end of the
corridor when morgan came clatter-
ing down the stairs mccoy saw them
and yelled an order to halt wallace

opened a door at the far end thrust the
sailor through and started to follow
him just as mccoy drew his revolver
and opened fire

  but it was a long shot mccoys
bullets went wide wallace vanished
and slammed the door mccoy and
his three men raced in pursuit

  intent on the frantic screams from
close at hand morgan had no atten-
tion for anything else he located
their source and hurled himself at the
door of dorothys cell

  for all his reckless weight it would
not yield the screams continued
cursing mccoy he ran into the next
cell in search of another door

  dan lay writhing on the floor there
struggling to drag himself toward the
bed his face a mask of agony

  when morgan entered he turned
with a snarl then waved toward the
barred opening and held out the re-
volver he had taken from wallace

   that sailor shot me from the
door he groaned get the black
take this and get him through the
bars quick before he-

  morgan jumped on the bed and
glared through into the cell where
dorothy lay screaming and tugging
at nimbos hair hal was just los-
ing consciousness the girls writh-
ing little person was directly in line
with nimbos figure as he crouched
over hal morgan roared at her to roll
to one side but she was too frantic to
hear him

  taking a chance he fired at the
nubians bent leg at a point below and
in line with his body though no great
marksman he had the luck to send his
bullet home

  nimbo howled with pain and sham-
bled to his feet sweeping dorothy
aside still in his animal fury he saw
morgan and started toward the bars


detective fiction weekly

  morgan took careful aim and fired

  the heavy bullet struck the black be-
tween the eyes and crashed through
his brain he reeled backward and
down across hals body dead before
he struck the floor but the tremendous
vitality in his squat frame kept him
jerking and twitching for many sec-
onds after

  dorothy lay in a limp heap where
she had fallen dangling by her bound
ankles a glimpse of hals face sent
morgan into the corridor again

  mccoy and his men were still try-
ing to break down the door through
which wallace had escaped

   ross bellowed morgan come
back here and break down this door
its touch and go with evans-

  against all his instincts mccoy
abandoned the chase ayd came pound-
ing back with his men

  without orders these three hurled
themselves as one against the door
the bolt snapped and they tumbled into
the cell in a heap morgan scrambled
over them

   first aid quick he ordered
 the boys been strangled the
blacks dead ill see to the girl-

  he waited until the men had begun
to work over hal then he turned to
dorothy he cut away the ropes from
her chafed ankles picked her up in his
arms and laid her on the bed

  she would be all right despite the
pink welts on the soles of her feet
black with anger he turned to see what
hope there was for hal and at that
moment hal opened his eyes drew a
long painful breath felt of his throat
and sat up weakly stung thereto by a
deep subconscious memory of danger

  morgan turned suddenly a long
lean figure had crept to the door
dragging a broken leg its tortured face
seeking hal dan saw his friend sit

up knew that all was well and dropped
senseless in his tracks

  in the meantime mccoys whistle
and his yell for an ax had brought more
men pounding down the stairs one of
them had found an ax somewhere back
of the house

  mccoy led them racing along the cor-
ridor two or three blows knocked
out a panel in the door at the end he
reached through to the bolt and the
door swung open

  they found themselves in a long
tunnel roofed with heavy planks it
led downward and straight for the
cliff

  when they had covered about forty
yards stumbling through darkness the
tunnel swerved sharply to reveal an in-
closure lighted by electricity about fifty
feet farther on

  suddenly this was flooded with day-
light now they could make out the
side of a plane

  they heard a tremendous swelling
roar the plane stirred and shot out
of sight

  with an oath mccoy ran on and
burst into a great cave in the cliff look-
ing over the hudson he was just in
time to see an amphibian plane swoop
across the water toward the police boat
the men on the boat scrambled to un-
limber the gun in the bow

  before they could train the gun the
plane rose in a wide graceful arc and
headed south toward new york

chapter xxvii

an act of god

one hasty glance showed mccoy
why they had not seen the hangar
from the boat a huge canvas
curtain painted to resemble the face of
the cliff had hidden the mouth of the
cave it was counter-weighted so that
the blind fury



a touch had sent it up and let the plane
escape

  he led his men back on the run tell-
ing one of them to cut through to the
main road meet hardy and the raid
car and lead them to the house

  the other men from the boat had
scattered through the building mor-
gan had found mrs evans unharmed
in one of the upper rooms and set her
free the police had found her jewels
and dorothys a room on the ground
floor held the corpse of an emaciated
young girl in a gorgeous bed -

  the cellar had yielded another
gruesome find this was the body of
an elderly foreigner swarthy and fat
his face still convulsed with agony his
color and the puncture in his wrist in-
dicated that he had been poisoned

  dorothy had regained her senses and
now lay weeping and shuddering in the
arms of mrs evans the sailors bullet
had shattered the bone of dans leg
above the knee the wound had been
roughly bandaged dan was still un-
conscious

  but mccoy had time for none of
this he was in search of a telephone
in the upper hall he found one

  he got burke at headquarters and
told him to send out a general alarm
for mchenrys amphibian plane
locally and as far as possible through-
out connecticut new york pennsyl-
vania and new jersey it was a large
order mccoy had no great hopes of
immediate success but in the end the
plane would be found and mchenry
traced and captured

  as he concluded morgans voice
boomed in his ear

   dont hang up yet

   wait a minute burke mccoy
complied

  he turned to find hal as well as
morgan at his side the younger man

wheezing through a bruised and swol-
len throat

   why not catch mchenry your-
self inquired morgan

  mccoy glared

   he got away in a plane how the
hell do i know where hell come
dowrn 

   i think we do know

  well well

  well well morgan echoed
 mchenry told evans his story hes
wallace hes got pap-wrhos-is in his
power collared his money and his
yacht and came here to get revenge
his jobs done paps dead but the
yachts somew-here hes got a sea-
plane-

   burke yelled mccoy  gimme
the chief

  the captain sweated over that ap-
peal to his superior and the police
commissioner backed his men given
a sketchy knowledge of the situation
he promised to ask for a naval sea-
plane and the fastest federal rum
chaser available mccoy was to come
down river in the police boat the
chaser would be waiting at the battery

  im going along croaked hal as
mccoy hung up  i told mchenry id
get him for killing dad 

   right nodded mccoy and
turning plunged down the stairs
again

  in a storm of fierce orders he
arranged for a guard on the house
transportation to new york for dan
dorothy and mrs evans when hardy
arrived and a search for the chauffeur
then he was away and racing down
the road with morgan hal and six of
the men from the boat lumbering after
him

  he yelled an order before he
reached the police boat she was cast
off as they tumbled aboard in a mo-

ment she backed clear of the wharf
and headed south

  as the fast little vessel tore down-
stream like a vibrant living thing hal
croaked and wheezed out the story
wallace had told him

  then mccoy explained the chiefs
plan of campaign to locate mchen-
rys plane was out of the question but
the naval plane was to quarter the har-
bor mouth and the sea beyond in
search of the yacht the chaser would
follow to sea and stand by if the plane
located the yacht it was to come back
and lead the chaser in pursuit

  all this if the yacht circe were not
actually in port but it seemed more
likely that she would be standing off
the harbor mouth or out at sea

  it was sheer deductive gambling
but the chief knew morgans guesses
and thought this one worth testing

  as they neared the battery a steel
gray chaser shot to meet them seemed
about to ram the police boat and
curved alongside with a flurry of
spray its high bows wet and glistening
in the sun

  mccoy morgan and hal scrambled
aboard her to find a crew of young-
sters who feared neither man beast
nor devil

  the hard-eyed young commander
put himself at mccoys orders adding
that he and his crew had seen mchen-
rys plane come down the hudson and
head straight out to sea

   pity we couldnt follow it then
he observed

   follow it now said mccoy
evenly

  hal had thought the police boat fast
but the chaser tore through the water
like a bullet the bow rising higher and
higher as their speed increased

  he clung to the quivering rail of the
bridge while the wind whipped his

clothing and rainbows danced in the
flashing spray staten island wheeled
past at length the shores began to
open and recede now they were crash-
ing into the long atlantic swells

  the lightship was to be their rendez-
vous with the plane when they neared
it and drew alongside the commander
hailed the blunt-bowed craft

   aint - seen - no - plane came
faintly across the water to them
 fog-just-cleared-hour-ago
the only man-made thing in sight
except the lightship was a tramp
steamer to southward

  morgan touched the commanders
arm and pointed his face pale green

 since your craft has wings he
groaned  suppose we hail the tramp
the commander looked at mccoy
mccoy nodded they wheeled and tore
south

  the little steamer grew larger and
more distinct suddenly the command-
er whistled

   look at her stem

  they drew nearer the rusty craft
now even the landsmen could see that
her stem sloped back from her fore-
foot nearer still and they saw that
her bows wre buckled in clar from
the waterline the chaser ranged
alongside

  seen a plane bawled the com-
mander

  a man on the tramps bridge took up
a megaphone

   plane - came - over - us -
half-hour-ago

   seaplane

  su-ure

   what course 

   dead-astern-our-course
what happened to your bows
the man on the bridge leaned for-
ward and the megaphone waggled in
his hand
the blind fury



   rammed - yacht - circe - last
-night - fog - no - lights - no -
horn-cut-her-in-two

   my god muttered morgan

  anybody saved mccoy prompt-
ed the commander

  he yelled the question

   three - seamen - she - sank-
quick

  where away

  west - south - west - thirty-
knots

   can you make port 

  yes-got-her-plugged floated
down to them

  the commander waved his hand
there was a hasty consultation on the
bridge wallace had been heading for
his rendezvous with the yacht he had
seen the wreckage and returned to
land there was nothing to do but go
back to the lightship and wait for the
naval flyer to find them

   theres a plane now shouted hal
suddenly

  it was low down to the north mak-
ing for the lightship the commander
signaled for full speed and they leaped
away to intercept it

  presently the flyer saw them
wheeled in a wide arc and came drift-
ing overhead his engine throttled
down something dropped breaking
out a tiny parachute an instant later
the commander maneuvered his craft
so that the message floated down just
back of the bridge

  a waterproof box contained a fold-
ed slip of paper

   plane down at sea forty miles out
follow me ran the message scribbled
on it

  the naval plane was drifting off
toward the southwest the chaser tore
away in pursuit

  half an hour later they found what
they sought

  wallaces plane had crashed snap-
ping off a float and both wings and
turning turtle

  xhe wings and the float were drift-
ing near by

  the other float was upside down and
awash

  the chaser pulled alongside one of
her crew dived overboard into a cream-
ing swell and made a line fast to the
submerged fusilage with the block
and tackle on one of the boatfalls they
hoisted it clear

 wallaces drowned body was
strapped into one of the seats they
found wo trace of the sailor

  the tanks avere empty which ac-
counted for the crash in his hasty
flight wallace had taken with him
little more than enough gasoline to
reach his rendezvous with the yacht

  his body was taken aboard the
chaser the commander cruised about
for a while but the sailor had evidently
drowned and washed away

  at length the chaser headed west-
south-west at full speed where the
circe had gone down they found traces
of oil and a few bits of flotsam from
the yacht but no survivors

  they headed reluctantly back to
new york

   what a death muttered hal to
morgan  searching searching until
his gas gave out-for a yacht that
went to the bottom last night

   better than electrocution his
death comes pretty close to what they
call an act of god

chapter xxviii

restitution

next morning mr wilder called
on hal and his mother the lit-
tle lawyer was jubilant he had
just dropped in he said to tell them


detective fiction weekly

that an unknown benefactor had de-
posited to their credit half a million
dollars each

  mrs evans demurred she said that
wallace must have stolen the money
from papaniotis and they had no right
to it wilder insisted that wallace had
made more than a million in breaking
mr evans on the stock exchange the
money was his to restore if he chose
and ethically theirs

  hal went to the hospital that after-
noon dans leg had been set as soon
as he arrived now his temperature
was down and he was doing nicely

  before hal went in the nurse
warned him that bottis would- be lame
for the rest of his life

  dan lay contemplating the huge cast
in which his leg had been slung above
the level of his eyes at sight of hal
he scowled

   whatcha want  he demanded sul-
lenly

   just dropped in to see which was
uglier you or nimbo explained hal
 i guess nimbo was better-looking
dan merely grunted

   going to look for that job when
you get up

   ats my business 

   well mchenry left me a fortune
so if you want a job chauffing for me

	suppose you can have it

   might be willing to work for your
wife exclaimed dan meaningly  if
you wasnt around too much

   havent got one yet snorted hal
but he flushed

   huh well you will handsome
hal leaned over and stuck his fist
under dans nose

   now listen you mule he said
 whether i marry or not you and i
are going to stick together do you
hear  if you marry your wife has got
to reckon on that if you ever try to

leave ill push your ugly chin up
through the top of your head

  dan turned his face away

  is that so he snarled huskily

  hal turned in haste and stalked out
his heart warm with gratitude toward
dan

  mrs evans had taken rooms in an-
other quiet hotel hal had found her
there no worse for her adventure he
had his hands full however standing
guard over her the reporters were
wild to get at them both

  twenty-four hours after his rescue
hal himself had nothing wtorse than a
very sore throat to remind him of his
narrow escape from death

  dorothy had been sent to a nursing
home to recover by cashing a check
and using his smile to advantage hal
surrounded her with fruit flowers and
anything else the doctor would permit
he was not allowed to see her

  three days later she was well
enough to leave hal went to get her
mrs evans had rented a little flat and
arranged it attractively with some of
dorothys furniture

  she let them in noticed that they
did not seem to have much to say to
each other pleaded some shopping and
departed left alone they faced each
other squarely dorothy rushed into
speech her eyes shining with gratitude

  hal ill just never forget you
almost gave your life to save me a
little pain

   heres what i want to know said
hal  when can we get married 
think we ought to wrait a whole year

   pooh said dorothy explosively

  she turned away touched this and
that then swung to face him flushed
but calm

   just because weve shared an ad-
venture together i suppose dont be
so old-fashioned
the blind fury



   you know better than that said
hal advancing

  dorothy retreated a little way

  hal found that his breathing
troubled him

   not because weve shared a bad
scare he stumbled  oh  here
dorothy let me show you-

  he advanced another swift pace
since she failed to retreat in time they
collided

  the shock of it to them both was
out of all proportion to the impact it
lifted dorothy off her feet

  after a moment she pushed him
away shook her bright hair back from
her face and looked up at him with a
self-possession that concealed anxiety
 its not just romance she gasped
 its the very tip-top of romance
 why so it is she admitted slowly
standing on tiptoe she kissed him

   well have your mother to live
with us of course i havent a cent
heavens i never thought of that

   shes much too wise sweetheart
but i guess well have to keep dan
one of his legs will be shorter than
the other

  as if we wouldnt

  the doorbell rang dorothy slipped
out of his arms and went to answer it

  morgan walked in looked at their
flushed faces and the light in their eyes
and shrugged his shoulders

   guess theres not a thing i can do
for you he grumbled

   theres-theres one thing that
puzzles me dorothy stammered
 how could wallace know that judge
moreland was my godfather and that

i	used to eat mud pies

   the first is pure invention my
dear a judge moreland does live in
baltimore elder wired him he
never met your father

   the other was a guess because

 wallace left this country before you
 were born most children eat dirt at
 some early stage in their careers espe-
 cially girls they say

    i suppose they want to see what it
 tastes like and make the men eat it
 when they are older of course your
 father had friends who gave you
 pennies

    youre sure its all right for moth-
 er and me to keep that money hal
 demanded

    right as rain pap-something-or-
 other was an orphan and probably ille-
 gitimate his government collars the
 lmge bank account he had in nice and
 the one wallace had here theyre
 more than satisfied

    before pap sold his avife into
slavery it seems he made a will in
her favor and that of her children
with all four of them dead wallace
would inherit from the children as next
of kin there was plenty for wallace
to leave you what he did

    oh yes i just called to say that
 after legal representations paps gov-
 ernment have agreed to leave a hun-
 dred thousand dollars to you miss
 hearn by way of slight restitution

    oh my goodness cried dorothy
  anything else inquired morgan
 restlessly

   just our thanks to you we want
to forget-

    i like that when i planned all
 that fracas out there to bring you two
 together

   hal burst out laughing

   your method was a bit painful
we would have found each other any-
way its written in the stars
theres gratitude for you mor-
gan grumbled

   he had taken a licking over the case
 his failure to save them suffering made
 him want to demonstrate a very real

humbleness but he did not know how
to go about it

   well ill leave you together he
growled  ill leave your door on the
latch for myself too

the

   in the meantime i have a little
work of my own to do though i can
never make mccoy realize it

   so-god bless you my children

old dungeon discovered

a mysterious underground chamber believed to have been a punish-
 ment dungeon in territorial prison days was recently discovered at the

     colorado state penitentiary under the old dining hall it wtas that hall
where first blood was spilled in the now famous canon city mutiny of
october t workmen in excavating for one of the main piers of the
new central building foundation discovered the abandoned chamber

     the chamber is twenty feet long eight feet wide and ten feet high with
an arched roof the floor is of sand and the walls of stone the only open-
ing into the room apparently is a ventilator in one corner this ventilator
opens into a shaft which runs horizontally up the hill but the shaft had fallen
in and it was impossible to find to what point it led

     it is believed that at one time there was a manhole in the ceiling of the
underground dungeon through this incorrigible convicts probably were
dumped bodily into the chamber and left there in total darkness until their
punishment in  the hole  was terminated

    an employee of the penitentiary who has been around the prison for
fifty-three years said he had no knowledge of the mysterious chamber the
central building under which the chamber was discovered wras built in 
but prior to that time there had been a government penitentiary of territorial
days on the site

    discovery of the underground room was fortunate otherwise one of
the main piers of the new building would have rested upon the arched ceiling
of the abandoned dungeon and probably would have crashed
  why do they go

by g haines trimingham

 ive got you covered tony my boss

          matty had an idea why men went for the gang-
          sters ride but he was dead wrong about it



y

ea spike you know all about

wilkins with obvious irony
 go ahead and tell me

   havin nerve aint got nuthin to
do wid it insisted the other man its
hopin until the last minute i guess
and maybe most of them would rather
take it where they have some soft
grass to fall on the speakers
laugh was not pleasant

   bunk all i can say is that they
must be a bunch of saps to go on a
ride with a mighty broad streak of
yellow or theyd take it right then and
there-or else shoot it out

  the stocky man called spike laughed
again  there aint no use tryin to

convince you how many of these
rides have you seen pulled

   none wilkins seemed ashamed
to admit the fact  but ive heard
about dozens of them and im
damned curious

   i guess you have to be shown
thats all too bad you cant get a
chance to sit in on one

   aint it

   i know one whats gonna be pulled

didnt make no promises if they raise

a dollar on the green felt  lets go
 the other guy is right outside
waitin spike told him when they

road youve got a rod aintcha
wilkins nodded

   this is matty was all spike said
to the man at the wheel the driver
did not even glance at him

   uhufi he grunted he let in the
clutch and the big sedan glided away

   it aint far remarked spike
 youll see i aint been kiddin you
about it bein easy he fished in his
pocket and brought forth a sizable
roll of bills  hold your hand
some twenty minutes later they
pulled up before what was ostensibly
an express office but which had none
of the marks of a thriving business

   come on said spike  better
pull down to the corner jake we
wont be long if hes in an i got
reason to know we aint gonna be dis-
appointed

  spike found a button set in an in-
conspicuous place near the door but
almost beyond arms reach it was
evident he knew the place well for the
door opened almost immediately and
they stepped into a long narrow room
illuminated only by the light filtering
through the buff paint and dirt which
covered the windows

  hows tricks tony began spike
addressing a dark man whose smile re-
vealed a perfect set of gleaming teeth

   cant kick eighteen cases this
week pickings are good

   but they wont be for long
smirked spike wilkins saw his right
hand go into a coat pocket  ive got
you covered tony my boss wants
to see you

  the hell you say tony leaped
for a dust covered shelf but spike was
quicker

 no you dont the gunman
snapped  frisk him matty maybe
hes got another stuck in his belt
matty followed the order while
tony glared and cursed

  whats it all about

cant you guess never mind
that would you like to write a note
to the ball and chain ill give you
time five minutes how about it
 she dont mean much to me but

i	better drop her a note at that if-
 dont forget ill give it the once
over better not say too much spike
advised

  they both stood guard over him
with drawn revolvers while the palpa-
bly distraught man scribbled a few
lines to his wife then with the gun
concealed in his coat pocket spike
why do they go



prodded him through the doorway
 dont try to pull nothin in the
street he warned  we wont leave
you until youre pumped full of lead
so you cant be tellin no tales an
dont forget to lock the door

ill

the four were speeding up second
avenue before wilkins had
time to consume the cigarette he
had lighted in the speakeasy tony
sat quietly in the tonneau beside spike
none of them had spoken until the car
swung onto the grand concourse
tony asked where he was being taken

   what does it matter youll soon
find out

  up the bronx river parkway they
sped it was sunset and october had
been lavish with its colors on the
trees the air was sparkling and
wilkins felt at peace with the world
and his companions

  have a smoke he invited tony
 thanks i left mine in the store
too much excitement

   uhuh but its not bothering you
none wilkins remarked

   why let it

  the conversation proceeded easily
and wilkins became filled with admi-
ration for the man he exhibited
genuine courage

  here we are said spike suddenly
as the car came to a stop atop the
kensico reservoir  pretty view aint
it lets make it snappy we just
timed it right its gettin dark   
you stand here matty    tony you

wilkins as the powerful spot light
was focused directly into his eyes
something hard was prodding into his
back

   drop the rod commanded jake

terrible suspicion dawning

   yea laughed spike  aint it
a surprise it was a big surprise to
poor red too i guess when you put
him on the spot but his pals aint
the kind to forget that light makes
you a swell target you fell for it
easy now you know why they go

  tony joined in the laugh

by h m sutherland

when a murder suspect joins in
the hunt for clews a sheriff must
uncover his evidence carefully

if hook-dave make a break
for it stop him-with
a bullet 

sheriff rutherford
sprawled in his chair with his
feet on his desk mopping his
beaded brow every few minutes with
a large bandanna the first sultry day
of early summer was sending shimmer-
ing heat waves upward from the row
of tin roofs across the street just be-
yond which the purpling cumberlands
towered majestically staring at them
speculatively rutherford shivered
somewhere in the depths of those
wooded shadows lurked the deadly
stalking figure of hook-dave hall
that ghostly enigmatical killer of the
devils apron country whom all men
feared

bart cantrell youngest deputy of
the sheriffs staff was leaning across

the table tense and eager watching
rutherfords face expectantly a lithe
tawny youth his steel-gray eyes
narrowed his muscles corded with the
excitement under which he labored
courage and determination were de-
lineated in his every feature confidence
seemed to ooze from every pore

   reckon im goin to have to refuse
ye barft declared rutherford after a
long silence during which he had been
tugging fiercely at his drooping melan-
choly mustaches  sendin ye out
alone after hook-daved be nothin
short omurder i wouldnt tackle him
lessn i had a dependable posse with
me

  young bart relaxed disappointment
creeping into his eyes
moonshine



   then let me spot his still an get
the lay of the land sos we can take a
posse in there an get him pleaded
the deputy  hes runnin a thumper-
keg outfit up there on bear pen creek
--i got that straight ill just locate
him an wont try to arrest him

  for a long minute the sheriff pon-
dered that request his fingers drum-
ming softly upon the desk then he
let his feet fall heavily to the floor as
he reached into a box for a long stogie

  all right he agreed with a shrug
 onderstand im not orderin ye to
go an tis aginst my advice still if
yere bound to go i figger twould be
best to do yore spottin from the top of
a high mountain somers through a
pair of fifld glasses

  bart chuckled and came to his feet
 i promise to try to steer clear of
hook-dave he declared with a grin
 but in case i do happen upon him
sorta accidental-like it might be best
if i had some papers to serve on him
 got none cut in rutherford
shortly  we both know he killed that
state prohibition enforcement officer
but we aint got no proof thatll hold
five seconds in court if we can catch
him moonshinin hell get a stiff term
in the federal penitentiary

   thought he was wanted over in
kentucky suggested bart

   yeah drawled the sheriff he
killed three-four men over thar but
kaintucky is like us-they aint got
enough evidence to convict him or
even to arrest him hook-dave dont
leave evidence scattered about

  bart hitched his belt into a more
comfortable position and reached for
his hat

   afore ye go said rutherford
 mind tellin me what plans yeve
made about goin in that bear pen
country 

   sorta figgered on slippin in there
durin the night an locatin a likely
spot from which i can watch the head-
waters of the creek i reckon i ought
to locate the smoke of his still without
much trouble

  ye know that section

   squirrel hunted over ever foot of
it

   even so yeve got to be durned
careful cautioned rutherford so-
licitiously  sometimes i think that
hook-dave aint human hes a born
killer but hes slick enough to cover
his tracks he can get through the
woods faster an without makin any
noise than any man in the hills an i
reckon hes the best shot in the county
so ye cant be too careful

   ill keep my eyes skinned de-
clared bart and took his departure

ii

for a full minute rutherford sat
motionless at his desk and then
aroused by the clatter of hoof-
beats upon the street outside he moved
lumberingly but silently to the win-
dow where he stood watching the re-
treating form of the deputy until he
vanished in the direction of the loom-
ing cumberlands

  a premonition of lurking danger
for bart stirred rutherford and for an
instant he debated saddling his horse
and setting out after the youth then
with a shrug he dismissed that thought
bart was well able to take care of him-
self

  shortly after noon on the following
day ranse moore a shambling apolo-
getic figure appeared in the door of
the sheriffs office and stood fumbling
his battered old hat rutherford recog-
nized him and realized with a start that
he was from the bear pen creek
country


detective fiction weekly

   well  demanded the sheriff
sharply

   i jes drapped in to tell ye re-
plied ihe hillman uncertainly  that
yore deppity bart cantrell was
killed

   killed rutherford came quickly
to his feet  flow 

   looks as though he fell offn a
cliff

   fell off

   looks as though

   who found his body

   hook-dave hall lige honey-
cutt an me

  rutherfords drooping mustaches
fairly bristled at the mention of hook-
dave

   when 

    bout ten oclock or a leeile atter
guessed the visitor with an apologetic
shrug

  any bullet holes

   not that i seen i didnt look
dost-jes come straight on in to tell
ye about it

    think he fell offn that cliff durin
the night

   done told ye all i know sheriff
said the hillman twisting his old hat
out of shape

   whered this happen  demanded
rutherford buckling his belt and guns
about his waist

   up thar on the head of bear pen
bout three mile from hyeh

  all right ranse much obliged
for cornin wait till i saddle my boss
an get one of the boys an well ride
back with ye

  ten minutes later rutherford with
crit randall a lanky deputy of in-
determinate age and a startlingly long
neck rode out of town a few paces
in the rear jogged the hillman who had
brought the news little was said
during that forty-five minutes ride

until they reached the mouth of bear
pen creek avhere rutherford and his
deputy reined to a halt and permitted
their guide to pass them

  the trail up the creek was nothing
more than a sheep path and the three
horsemen were continually swaying
and bending stooping and dodging the
thick undergrowth that at times made
progress difficult here and there the
sheriff caught sight of the tracks of a
horse in the soft mold but they had
palpably been made by ranses horse
as he had ridden out with his news
and not a trace could he find of young
bart cantrells horse undoubtedly the
latter had left his mount near the
mouth of the creek and followed that
trail afoot	

  coming out of a dense bed of rhodo-
dendron they found themselves in a
little clearing in the center of which
sat a log cabin

 who lives here demanded
rutherford of their guide

   i do he dismounted and laid
down a panel of the rail fence reckon
wed best leave our hosses hyeh cant
go further on hossback

  despite his huge proportions ruther-
ford set a pace into the headwaters of
the creek which taxed the strength and
energy of his two companions and
brought a twinkle of admiration into
the eyes of the deputy it was quite
apparent that the sheriff was a woods-
man of no mean order nor did he
pause for rest until a rim of precipices
towered high above them

  at a gesture from ranse he turned
off at right angles and swung up a
sharp incline for a matter of some-
thing like a hundred yards before
reaching the bench behind which reared
that line of cliffs seated upon mossy
bowlders at the base of the nearest
precipice were two motionless men and

 d
moonshine



rutherford with a start recognized one
of them as hook-dave that enigma
of the cumberlands the other was
lige honeycutt an uncle to the deputy
whom the sheriff had brought with
him

  as they drew near the sheriff saw
that the two men were talking in a low
tone as if awed by the presence of
death and just beyond them he caught
sight of a motionless shapeless form
wedged between two great bowlders
in single file the three newcomers
drew near

  howdy men drawled ruther-
ford removing his hat and fanning
his perspiring face slowly he let his
eyes sweep over the scene missing no
detail then he turned his gaze to
lige honeycutt

 bad business eh he ejaculated

  honeycutt grunted an affirmative

  rutherford knew and trusted lige
honeycutt a pillar in the primitive
baptist church and a law-abiding
citizen he could have had no part in
the crime neither would he aid in the
capture or prosecution of the perpe-
trator it had been a  hands-off 
policy which had enabled him to live
in peaceful and successful proximity
to the lawdess elements along the state
line and he was unlikely to change
that attitude

  after shaking hands with honey-
cutt the sheriff turned to hook-dave
and met the latters expressionless
gaze he was a heavy squat man in
direct contrast to the average gangling
hillman and there was that about his
mouth and eyes that set him apart
from his people as a dangerous and
menacing figure his gray eyes were
flinty and his lips thin and straight
giving him a grim appearance at all
times which the heavy stubble of beard
failed to efface

 	d

  in a fight with a rival faction across
the state line some several years earlier
he had lost his right arm near the
elbow-had it literally shot away-
and in its place he wore a sharp steel
hook which dangled from his sleeve in
such a manner that it gave the casual
observer the creeps and manifestly
that steel arm could be a dangerous
weapon in close quarters indeed if
rumor could be believed it had done
deadly havoc more than once

  rutherford knew that there was
open hostility in the glance he gave
hook-dave but he found it utterly
impossible to mask his malice he
had warmly liked his young deputy
and the sight of that shapeless figure
at the base of the precipice had sent a
surge of uncontrollable anger rippling
through his veins not for a single in-
stant did he believe that barts fall had
been accidental but to connect that
crime with hook-dave would be an-
other thing but of one thing he was
positive-he would bring hook-dave
iiall to justice for that act if he never
did anything else

ill

with a common impulse the five
men gathered in a semi-circle
about the body while the sheriff
made a superficial examination it was
apparent that bart had met death in-
stantly and that he had fallen from the
top of the precipice at least two hun-
dred feet above as far as he was
able to ascertain there were no other
marks of violence except those which
could have been made by the fall
hook-dave had covered his crime well

  rutherford straightened and tugged
thoughtfully at his mustaches staring
through half-closed eyes at the wild
morning glory vines which covered the
two bowlders between which the vie-


detective fiction weekly

tim was wedged then he turned to
lige honeycutt

  who first located the body lige
he demanded softly

   i did replied the hillman  me
an ranse an hook-dave hyeh was
passin an i seen it-lyin thar

   what time was that

   ten oclock-mebbe a little atter
 how ye happen to be up hyeh
lige demanded rutherford

  we was goin up thar on that upper
bench atter them curly-walnut stumps
explained honeycutt  feller offered
me a good price fo stumps like that
an id made arrangements for hook-
dave hyeh to go along with us an
blow em up me knows bow to handle
dynamite we was coinin along that
sheep path past this cliff when i jes
happened to see the-body

   what time did ye first see dave
this monin 

   bout seven oclock i reckon
atter he come we waited a leetle while
on ranse hyeh an then we had to wait
till my boy got in with the dynamite
must a been nigh onto ten oclock
when we got started

   on a guess lige continued
rutherford thoughtfully  what time
would ye say that this-happened
 couldnt say sheriff might a
been a hour-might a been half a
day to tell the truth i didnt get
dost thought id leave everthing jes
as it is fo ye to examine

  rutherford nodded his approbation
and then stooped over and raised
slightly the deputys body extracting
a silver hunting-case watch the rear
of that watch was dented and battered
but the crystal strangely enough was
intact but the force of the fall had
shattered the jewels and ruined the
works

  the four spectators crowded about

rutherford and watched him as he
tried to wind the timepiece then he
shook his head

   looks like it happened at four
minutes to nine oclock declared
lige softly  she stopped then is
she bad broke sheriff

   plumb ruined

  rutherford shot a quick glance at
hook-dave but the latters expression
was masked in indifference his alibi
was perfect he had been with lige
and ranse at that hour and could not
have had a part in the murder

   what do ye reckon he was doin
up thar on top sheriff queried lige
curiously

  he was tryin to spot hook-daves
still replied rutherford bluntly

  with one accord the little knot
wheeled and watched dave but the
latters enigmatical smile could have
meant anything me offered no denial
of the charge of moonshining but
shrugged and resumed his seat upon
the moss-covered bowlder

   lets go up on top an see what
we can see suggested rutherford
 he must a been on that ledge up
thar near the top

  up a precipitous path on the right
of the cliff they toiled the sheriff and
deputy randall leading the way with
the other three men following a few
paces in the rear watching his chance
rutherford leaned close to the deputy
and whispered

   keep yore eye on hook-dave an
if he makes a break for it stop him-
with a bullet

   huh the deputy grunted his
surprise  his alibi-

  rutherfords gesture was bne of
warning and the deputy grew silent a
few minutes later they were on top of
the precipice and gingerly advancing
along a narrow ledge from which it
moonshine



was palpable that bart cantrell had
fallen at a point directly over the
scene of the tragedy rutherford halted
and motioned to the others to remain
where they were then inch by inch
he went over the ground seeking signs
of a struggle footprints-anything
that might throw light on the mystery

  the surface of the ledge was bare
stone relieved here and there by tiny
patches of moss and crevices at its
broadest point the ledge was not more
than six feet wide and at the rear arose
a wall of granite some twenty to thirty
feet high just a few paces ahead of
rutherford the shelf narrowed and be-
came sheer wall

  on hands and knees rutherford ex-
amined the entire surroundings keep-
ing his back to the watchers as much
as possible three times he found
scratches upon the stone surface-four
parallel marks about an eighth of an
inch apart and once he located a fresh
cut along the jagged surface of the
rear wall manifestly there had been
a struggle but the evidences of it were
meager and vague

  at last he arose to his feet and stood
tugging at his mustaches then with a
deep sigh be drew near his companions

   well finish up this work down-
there he announced

  find anything sheriff demanded
lige whose curiosity had overcome
his natural reticence

   nothin i didnt already know
replied rutherford enigmatically lead-
ing the way down the sharp iitcline to
the base of the precipice

iv

upon reaching the bowlders
rutherford motioned his deputy
forward

   lets move the body over in the
shade crit he suggested and gently

they placed it upon a bed of leaves and
rutherford removed his coat and
spread it over barts face then he
came back and stared long and thought-
fully at the bed of wild morning glory
vines crushed and flattened by the
deputys crumpled weight

   strange thing about that watch
lige observed rutherford at last
ye know when a man puts his watch
in his pocket he alius puts it in with
the crystal next to his body sos it wont
get broke but bart had stuck hisn
in with the crystal out

  hook-daves eyes narrowed and one
of his hands crept toward his inside
coat pocket out of the corner of his
eye the sheriff saw his deputys hand
close upon the butt of his forty-five
and at the same time hook-daves
left hand dropped to his side

   another thing about that watch
continued the sheriff never taking his
eyes off hook-dave  is that not only
was the crystal outside but it wasnt
even cracked-while the back side of
that watch was mashed up

   what do ye make o that sheriff
asked old lige softly but it was ap-
parent that he had caught the drift of
rutherfords monologue

   i figger that somebody took that
watch outta barts pocket-after he
was dead

  complete silence greeted the state-
ment

  another thing lige resumed
rutherford in even tones which seemed
to carry a hint of steel  bart want
killed at nine oclock id say that
whoeveh took his watch outta his
pocket set it at four minutes to nine
oclock to prove him an alibi bart
was throwed offn that cliff afore sun-
up

  eh liges glance shot toward
hook-dave but the latters expres-


detective fiction weekly

sionless face gave no indication of the

thoughts that were seething behind it

 yeah drawled rutherford
what time was sunrise this monin 

    bout six i reckon

   then bart was murdered afore
six thirty look tliar rutherford
pointed dramatically toward the bed
of wild morning glory vines upon
which the body had been lying

    the sun resumed the sheriff his
eyes on hook-dave  would strike
this place a few minutes after it come
up by six thirty these monin glory
flowers would all be closed up like they
are now but them flowers which was
onder the body aint closed up yet

 see

   lige peered intently in the direc-
tion in which rutherfords accusing
finger was pointed and saw the scat-
tered full-blown petals which were be-
ginning to wilt rutherfords reason-
ing was irrefutable the morning glory
vines established the time of the trag-
edy to be not later than six thirty that
morning

    mebbe he lost his footin in the
oncertain light of early mornin sug-
gested lige

the madame aubertin

a true story
by david redstone

 i am dying you have poisoned me i 

the butcher the baker she finished with poison-
and the candlestick maker had a role in the plot

  a ubertin the baker was plying
his trade in the usual even tenor
of his way when one day at the
time of the year when the grass almost
bursts with greenness he fell ill with
a violent pain that tore at his stomach
as if with invisible knives

  he groaned so loudly that certain of
the citizens of the village in the vosges
mountains heard him

  his wife wringing her hands in
terror remained helpless to do any-
thing but bring him the water which
he craved in the midst of his in-
tolerable thirst he gasped retched and
breathed his last

  neighbors were rushing in

   the good god

   what has happened madame
aubertin 

   dead but it is impossible
get water chafe the hands a
little brandy-

 ah he is past all hope i fear
indeed it was so the baker of the
vosges village lay in death his form
convulsed his contorted face horrible
to see

 he has had a fit the poor man
the neighbors uttered their sorrow
and comforted the widow as well as
they could but they were not long able


detective fiction weekly

to bear the sight of the deceased soon
they departed in little groups and the
woman was left alone to take care of
her dead

  the bereaved wife sent word to her
daughter who had been spending a
fortnight with her friends in a tiear-by
town

  when yvette arrived a day later
she gazed not upon her fathers
face but on his grave for swiftly as
the death had come the burial was
equally surprisingly sudden such
hurried management drew more than
censure upon madame aubertin it
drew suspicion for whisper followed
whisper about the circle of scattered
cottages

   alas the good man dies like a
candle snuffed out and she does not
even wryt for the body to lose its
warmth she is in a remarkable hurry
that woman

  yet why not a somewhat kindlier
villager said  even in life aubertins
face was a large replica of a meat ball
and since you say that he was a sight a
pig would turn its eyes away from
when the fit possessed him do you
blame the poor woman all alone as she
was for burying him with such dis-
patch 

  not only are you stupid alphonse
but you are also gullible the wife of
this charitable citizen said  it is
fortunate for her that the gendarmerie
are also men as if every one who is
not blind cannot see how greatly the
monsieur hennezal is concerned and
how much she is concerned with him-
la there is neither grief nor shame
in the hussy

  thus were opinions voiced and thus
were they somewhat allayed-until a
dav during- the harvest the death and
the burial together created less con-
sternation than what then occurred

   did i not tell you alphonse-a
hundred times no

  the widow aubertin had married
hennezal maker of goblets candle-
sticks and ornaments of glass where-
upon the whispers grew to murmurs
and what was voiced as mere suspicion
and gossip became established in the
minds of the villagers as a fact auber-
tin had been dealt with foully

  whether these suspicions reached
the ears of the law the history of this
case does not show

  at any rate they were not acted
upon at the time

  it is only apparent that the police
authorities would not take up the stray
possibly malicious gossip of a com-
munity nor would it order a disinter-
ment on the strength of such gossip
unless expressly desired by the near
kin of the deceased

  thus the matter rested for a time
until further circumstances coupled
with the suspicions already known
took form in a chain of evidence that
made madame aubertins case exceed-
ingly more fascinating

  some little time passed the
madame seeing that her daughter was
fair to look upon indeed yvette was
being  looked upon  to some small
notoriety began to cast her eyes
about her upon the eligibles of her
vicinity with characteristic sudden-
ness mine aubertin-now mine
hennezal-made a choice namely
bourlette a prospering butcher in a
village not far away

  a meeting was arranged and when
bourlette beheld the vivacious beauty
of madames daughter he decided that
his prosperity would adorn her ad-
mirably the news of the forthcoming
marriage of these two was an occasion
for much cynicism in the village

   she is young and she has a charm-
the madame aubertin



ing face bourlette heard himself con-
gratulated and truer sterner friends
he would not heed

   she is cunning like her mother
you have heard the rumor i suppose
of the late m aubertin

  bourlette grunted annoyed  i
look upon the litter and you show me
the sow what have the mothers
affairs to do with the character of my
yvette answer me that

   but my dear bourlette isnt it a
fact that the woman poisoned her hus-
band 

   mv friend your venerable beard
ought to restrain such witless gossip it
is not a fact and if it were you could
not prove it you are positively out
of your senses to repeat such gossip
even to a friend

   bourlette said the other irrita-
bly  i open my mouth wide to tell
you you are a fool she is young and
you are old and there you have my
opinion

   and you came the answer  are
altogether a confirmed cynic you are
well aware that i love the wench and
she is also if i may say it fond enough
of me

   of you scoffed the friend with a
grimace  bourlette i would save
you from this misstep even at the cost
of our friendship you are certainly
not what you might call a cavalier
you are certainly not young as a
matter of fact you are old besides
that you are fat you have three teeth
missing and the others will soon drop
out

   you may be rich after a fashion
but by all the saints you havent a hair
on your smooth flat empty pate and
there you have my opinion and the
opinion of every one else if that mat-
ters to you

  that year  yvette came into

possession of the butcher as his law-
fully wedded wife

ii

ourlette chose a spacious
house in which the couple went
to live perhaps he looked for-
ward some day to making a hostelry
of it for the rooms were numerous
in the meantime he did not let them
go to waste within a short time after
his marriage the butcher let it become
known that he would let some of his
rooms to a few  select genteel 
boarders

  soon the house was filled with a
convivial spirit merchants from the
cities gentlemen from the south and
foreigners from over the german
border came and found rest there and
yvette smiled on them all

  one whispered  how does it
happen so pretty a girl should be the
avife of this eye-sore of a butcher his
naked skull is the color of a skinned
ox and there is more lard in him than
in a full tub of his hog-fat

  a gentleman from paris shrugged
with such expressiveness that his eyes
shut

   she has a lover he stated posi-
tively though he had arrived only the
day before bourlette himself became
aware that this was the actual state of
affairs

  but he did not fly into a rage dis-
creetly he took one of his younger
 genteel  boarders aside and ad-
monished him in a respectable manner

   sir he said   beg of you to
leave this house and if you prove
swine enough to linger three blinks of
an eye by the sacred name of a rabid
dog-

  bourlette had come out of his shop
and a cleaver was in his hand the
young boarder left


detective fiction weekly

  later when the couple were alone
the butcher had no other cudgel than
his large right hand which without a
single word of explanation he used
vigorously across the mouth of his
wife

  bourlette had distinct cause to re-
member the day that followed when
evening came he relished his onion
soup with customary keenness and
after supper sat down to read

  it wras not long before he forsook
his chair for the floor ten thousand
demons began to torment his mid-
regions his face was screwed up in
pain he gasped he retched and called
for water

  name of a name i am dying
he choked  curse you and your
mother together with the mother that
begot her yvette you have poisoned
me  swear

  pale faced yvette protested that he
lied she brought the wrater he craved
bourlette gulped great draughts which
only for the moment quenched the
terrible fires that burned within him

   by all the saints the butcher went
on when he was at last able to gasp the
avords  i have married into a family
of poisoners what my friend warned
me against has come true and may you
be struck by a thousand thunders

   you lie it is not true

  spasm after spasm seized the un-
fortunate bourlette while his wife
merely looked on with staring malevo-
lent eyes

  strange as it may seem the fit
passed and bourlette did not die
yvette it was who suffered then for
in the next few days her husband
watched her like a hawk he would
not let her prepare his food he spied
upon her wherever she went peeped
suspiciously into every pot and pan
until furious she packed her things

and left him without so much as a
good-by where she went he did not
know

  bourlette now at peace relaxed his
vigilance but only to his cost a
week later a similar malady though
not as violent as the first brought him
low during the days that followed
he became well and ill by turns one
day he lay gasping and the next he
was up and fuming at the base
treachery that pursued him in his own
household

  he discharged his servants one after
another he got rid of a cook a
gardener a stable boy and finally
every last boarder but even these
expedients did not seem to help the
fearful attacks came nevertheless
despairing at last he wrote to his
wifes mother the madame aubertin

    if you know where yvette is tell
  her to come to her bourlette i am
  suffering from some malady of the
  stomach terrible and there is no one
  in the house to help me i accused her
  but now i know it could not be her
  fault because she has been gone for
  the past two weeks now tell her to
  forgive me for my unjust treatment of
  her and to come to me for gods sake

  yvette came and her mother with
her tears protestations and forgive-
ness poured like rainfall after which
mother and daughter settled down to
nurse their invalid back to health

   for a week you must eat nothing
but gruel madame laid down the
lawr  too much meat and strong
seasoning have caused your sickness
at the end of a weeks time-behold
what a difference

 the butcher submitted meekly to
their ministrations while the inex-
perienced hand of the daughter was
aided by the proven skill of the mother
not the end of the week but four days
the madame aubertin

was the limit of bourlettes endurance
the knowledge which the younger
woman did not have the other supplied
during the fourth day bourlette passed
into the beyond too weak in his final
hour to voice further suspicion or to
invoke a single curse

ill

this time the villagers did not
stand idly by some one de-
manded that a doctor from the
city be taken to view the remains of
bourlette no sooner had the physi-
cian arrived at the village than a hun-
dred tales were poured into his startled
ears stories flocked upon him from
all neighborhoods of these one more
than all the rest was later to count
heavily against the pair

  it was to the effect that during the
time the young madame bourlette was
away her mother the madame auber-
tin was seen to prowl at night at the
back door of bourlettes house she
had kept her presence secret and then
had departed

  did she have possession of her
daughters key and did she enter the
house by this means if this were
probable then indeed she could have
had opportunity to scatter poison like
dust to the four winds over every
article within her reach

  the villagers waited breathlessly to
hear what the physician would report
a prompt examination was made
arsenic-tons of it-was found in the
stomach contents of the corpse

  confronted with a direct accusation
by the police yvette wailed we have
had no luck here at all no sooner
do we settle down to live in a neighbor-
hood but people begin to die about us
like flies one day they are here and
the next day-piff paff-they are
gone

  heaven only knows what further
accusations were laid against madame
aubertin and what other deaths could
be accounted to her

  the butcher the baker-the indict-
ment pointed to these two only mean-
while where was-to complete the
verse-the candlestick maker that
is to say did hennezal the second
husband of madame aubertin have a
hand in this reign of agony convul-
sion and death hennezal maker of
goblets and ornaments and candle-
sticks of glass

  it was to him as a matter of fact
that the arsenic was actually traced
was not arsenic used in the making of
glassware 

  where else indeed could madame
aubertin have obtained her instrument
of destruction 

  upon all this evidence both mother
and daughter were tried despite their
protests convicted and sentenced to
death

  but m grevy a kind and over-
compassionate man who was also
death on capital punishment after-
ward pardoned madame aubertin and
the young widow yvette and they
never paid

have a habit of spreading your thoughts
in all directions your power of con-

found in the fact that while you have
many splendid qualities you do not en-

thought except when absolutely neces-
sary is not pleasant and easy for you

  i would say that you have strong in-
tuitive powers which help you tremen-

little for bridge parties or anything
pertaining to society you are a home
loving person and once inside your

interest in life is rather narrow the
big world of commerce with its mani-

about them you live in a little world
all by yourself and to you that is life

            and argue and everyone speaks up his mmd

id you ever hear of the gim-
mick 

  probably not its not adver-
tised its the little device that takes
away the element of chance the
gimmick fixes things so you cant
win

  youve all had experiences with the
innocent-looking games in the carnival
parks  put yr money on a number
folks-win a five-pound box of choco-
lates they are called games of
chance but there isnt any chance
the gimmick takes care of that

  the gimmick is the gadget on the
games that the operator can work-
unseen by you-and control chance
and your pocketbook too the gim-
mick is the thing that makes it so you
cant win

  heres a chance to learn about these
ingenious devices - before carnival
season costs you too much money be-
ginning next week detective fic-
tion weekly will run a series of arti-
cles on carnival games and how they
can be and often are  fixed  to
 take  the public the author of the
series is a man who has traveled across

  country for years-with carnivals
  fairs and circuses he knows what he
  is talking about his name is mark
  mellen

     look for the first of his series next
  week- the spindle racket

     dont take any notice of th grousers who

  dear editor

      have been a reader of your magazine
  though irregular since i read your very first
  copy flynns

  well heres my story first of all i like
a good true murder story the first few years
of your magazines existence i got them and
in plenty and  took your magazine regularly

flashes from readers



even though i couldnt go the fiction in it at
all but then the true stories fell off and
went to the dogs entirely and  stopped taking
your magazine

  once in a while id take a copy and i kept
noticing that the fiction was improving until
it got so good within the last year that 
started taking your magazine more regularly
and lately now i find the fiction very very
much improved in fact it cant be beat in any
magazine at any price so im a regular once
again

  keep up the good work of course as i
said before i like first of all a good fact
story-preferably murder but these seem to
have died a natural death by the way i see
that the new picture type of true detective
story magazines are hashing up stories that
have already been covered by detective fic-
tion weekly

  detective fiction weekly gives as muh
and more and much better reading than maga-
zines almost triple its price

solving cipher secrets

one of the best meth-
ods for the instruction
of beginners in cipher
solving is that of identifying
short words prefixes and
suffixes which have letters in
common in last weeks ci-
pher no  for example
the two-letter word dy is
used as a prefix to word 
with the symbols also occur-
ring in the endings -dye
and -vday and thereby
hangs a tale

 gvday

 lion

  by far the commonest two-letter
word used in this way is in and the
chances are strongly in favor of the
above affixes being in- -ing and -lion
the correctness of these guesses in this
instance can be checked at once by sub-
stituting these letters throughout the
message as shown in fact this done
the cipher is practically solved

  thus word  with only the two
last letters unknown is evidently ini-
tial substituting i for h word 
becomes l-tt- suggesting letters

other words and at length
the whole message follows in
a similar manner this crypt
can also be solved by trying
with and the for odvs and
vst word  is then
guessed as letters and so on
full answer on page 

  try the method above
outlined on this weeks ci-
phers the lot of five is ar-
ranged according to diffi-
culty with the easiest com-
ing first clews may therefore not be
so easy to interpret and apply in the last
two or three but if the solver will put
 his thinking cap he should come
through with flying colors

  in m l ts no  for example
the repetition of oos suggests that it
may signify a common word guess-
ing this word correctly will give the
middle and last letters of bzoobs
and the missing letters should be easy
to fill in this crypt also affords the
one-letter word r and several other
short words rmx zm zq and ems
to help you along

  try to identify the three-letter
words bko and vbk in m i span-
glers cipher through the digraph bk
which they have in common krki
with the repeated k should come next
then bwi of which you will now have
all but one letter the above words
will supply all but three letters in word
 and you should quickly get these
by comparing with hfij

  in mabel verona mckeowns con-
tribution you will observe that every
letter in the three-letter group byo
occurs in the four-letter group boys
also note that the initial digraph of

jerry lassiter looked down at the orchestra that was blaring
broadways latest hits and the close-packed colorful crowd dancing
in the flickering spotlights the peking palace seemed to be just
another commercialized chinese place made to order for the public
the only chinese he could see were the waiters and attendants

    he turned to the girl who sat opposite him in the booth

     its the new chinatown observed the secret service ace then he
fell silent  i wonder he finally resumed  if that really could have been
san lee we saw on broadway joan if it was-you realize what that means
  know said the girl  it means-li wan may be alive too

     a silence fell between them tense

     in a small office on the floor below a smooth-faced yellow man sat at
a teakwood desk with a head-set clamped over his ears his eyes were slits
beside him sat a lovely chinese girl the yellow man listening intently smiled

     yes my friends he muttered softly   hear you li wan is alive
but you will not know it until the blow falls and then it will be too late
there was a light tap on the door to the office  open it san lee
said the chinaman and the girl glided like a tigress across the room
an oriental dressed in a waiters uniform stood there

     it has been done yueng joy he said  the tea has been drugged
 good said yueng joy  long island is large and it will not be
the first time it has known a mystery of doom they wont live to spoil
my plans

    his face became blank again as he listened suddenly he said  the
white girl asks  shall i pour your tea 

     who is the sinister yueng joy what is the plot devised by his diabolic
cunning here is a new adventure of that ace of secret service agents jerry
lassiter-hero of  lure of the poppy back again and pitted against a
