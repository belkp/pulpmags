dicky

by henry c rowland
author of  the rubber man   the film huntersetc

        one of the greatest charms of the popular complete novel is the
   variety presented to the reader perhaps yu have noticed that we do nt
   stick to any given type of story and as long as it isvital and interesting
   we do not care whether the tale ke laid in the salmon canneries in the vast
   spaces of earth or in the counting huse and this unique and fascinating
   novel of rowlands proves our variety dicky is a character that will please
   and pique your understanding with his utter unconventionally his ancient
   greek attitude toward life his unlimited money for which he cares nothing
   and his capacity to love it is safe to predict that you will never forget him
   as long as you live he stays in your mind as persistently as a portrait
   by some great master

a complete novel

the first time that i laid eyes on
dicky was at one of those dis-
quieting epochs in the life of a
university when the alumni and
well-wishers of my alma mater -were
shaking their heads and asking one an-
other  whats the matter with yale
for several months the rival cohorts
had been exulting in their sinful pride
and trampling the blue in a manner
to make the campus elm trees look like
weeping willows

  at a considerable sacrifice of per-
sonal interests i put aside my blue
prints and descended on the fostering
mother to coach her baby crewr babies
they looked too as compared with the
fierce and hairy stalwarts of my former
ia p

boat and the first time i bent my brows
upon them my argus eyes fastened on
dicky and i snorted with rage and
pain they were all pink and pretty
enough and seemed healthy and well
grown for their ages but they did not
resemble the massive athletes of my
own time who were wont to break train-
ing in a wild and reckless manner one
day and all the oars and records and
things the next

  what is this anyhow i asked the
trainer a yale crew or a beauty 
show 

  both sor he answered - they are
good lads strong and willing hair
on the body is no proof of the strenth
beneath


the pocpular magazine

   hope so i said sourly have
they learned yet what those long sticks
with flat ends they are holding in their
hands are for 

  not yet sor they are waiting for
you to tell them but you must not be
hasty here now is a slim lad that
might make good at stroke if he would
work and he ducked his head at
dicky who was playing with his oar
and making little whirlpools

  i looked dicky over and felt pretty
tired not a bone in sight nor a mus-
cle either he looked like a trimly
built ten-year-old boy multiplied by
two he was masculine enough but
not manly so far as his appearance was
concerned he had a wide boyish face
with big gray eyes and a short straight
nose and lips rolling back a little when
he grinned which wras most of the time
and he seemed to be taking the whole
business myself included as a sort of
joke

  it did not take me very long to dis-
cover dickys qualities there may
have been stronger men in the boat but
there was not one who had anything
like his tireless endurance he seemed
if anything to get stronger as he went
on and when the rest of the eight
would be ready to flop he was fresh and
cool and smiling and making imperti-
nent remarks on their exhaustion the
trainer had the right of it

  the lad has great organs said he
his muscles rest while they work and
all there is to him is of use look now
at his arms and legs as smooth and
soft and round as a girls but the mus-
cle fiber is long and has great power
of contraction

  dickys personal habits were also
unique he abominated fresh meat
and could not be made to touch it
though he would sometimes toy with
a little corned beef or bacon and was
fond of fish - his whole diet though
was light to the point of what would
have been fasting to the others but

he was inordinately fond of fruit and
nuts and usually had a five-pound box
of candy in his room another peculi-
arity was his indifference to heat and
cold he slept under a single blanket
when his water pitcher skimmed with
ice and i doubt if he ever had on a
sweater in his life the contact of
fresh air on his skin seemed to give
him a sort of voluptuous delight i
learned from one of the chaps whose
family he had visited during summer
vacation that it was hard work to keep
him from scandalizing the neighbor-
hood by going around half naked when-
ever opportunity offered and often
when it did not

  he was not very sociable nor as pop-
ular as one might have expected ap-
pearing to enjoy his own company more
than that of others and he roomed
alone with quite a menagerie of pets
principally wild things which he had
tamed birds and squirrels and at one
time he had a fox which perfumed the
dormitory until he was obliged to dis-
pose of it but he did not appear to
have any particular affection for these
companions which enjoyed perfect lib-
erty and went in and out of the open
windows as they pleased one de-
bauched old crow made a great nuisance
of itself but was tolerated because of its
amusing habits

  although a good enough athlete
dicky never appeared to care particu-
larly for sports and games and only
went in for them because strongly
urged and even more than that for
the opportunity they gave him to spend
so much of his time undressed he
was often accused of liking to show his
shape but it was not that he was too
utterly natural to be conceited and
never posed so far as one could ob-
serve he was at all times utterly and
absolutely indifferent to popular opin-
ion whether favorable or the reverse

  well we had a corking fine crew that
year and the one following and ki my
dicky 



opinion as well as that of the trainer
dicky was about the most useful man
in the boat then he graduated and
the next i heard of him was two years
later when out in california where i
was wrestling with a big development
and funding company of which i was
chief engineer and a considerable stock-
holder and out of which i had hopes
of one day making a decent little for-
tune with which to start my two kids
in life and give them the opportunities
which their relative five and seven years
of sturdy girlhood and boyhood seemed
to warrant the boy going to yale of
course and the girl going to a yale
man

and if it is a girl sir well dress her up in
       blue

and send her down to saltonstall to coach
      the freshman crew

and if it is a boy sir well put him on the
      crew

and he shall wax the hav-vards like his
      daddy used to do   

  just at that moment the daddy was
trying to wax a railroad crowd that
threatened to dump the apple cart and
wipe out the savings of ten hard-work-
ing years what made it even worse
the prime pirate was a man named
maitland the president of the road who
had been a schoolmate of mine at an-
dover and manager of the football team
on which i played center we were old
enemies and id never liked maitland
though i had a lot of respect for his
abilities he had managed the team
at a profit to everybody himself in-
cluded and you can bet that the hotel
keepers and livery stables and sporting-
goods people never got any more profit
than they were strictly entitled to we
were never skimped on anything either
maitland also was the business editor
of the class book and a wonder at get-
ting advertisements he put that pub-
lication on a profitable basis too and
sold typewriters and skates and trans-
atlantic ferry tickets at reduced rates

 most of the boys admiii him a lot
 and he stood well with everybody the
 faculty included because he wtas smart
 as a whip in class though when he
 studied i cant imagine

   physically he was about the best-look-
 ing boy n school medium height well
 built with wide shoulders and slim hips
 black hair and blue eyes with an alert
 clean-cut face and that sort of repose-
 ful expression which seemed to patro-
 nize us overgrown kids i made him
 come out on the field one day-i was
 captain of the football team-just to
 see what he had in him he had it

   it did not surprise me a bit when i
  heard indirectly that maitland had mar-
 ried the daughter of a well-known finan-
 cier whose name i need not mention
 and whose affairs maitland managed to
 haul out of the junk heap maitland
 married when they were both very
 young he was about twenty-four and
 she eighteen or thereabouts they had
 a daughter diana who through mait-
 lands excellent business ability inher-
 ited a couple di millions from her
 grandmother i had seen a picture of
 her with other new york debutantes
 in a sunday newspaper and she was
 very beautiful

   it was just about the time that we
 were having our fight for water rights
 with maitland and his crowd that i got
 a letter from dicky urgently asking for
  a job at the moment i had about as
 much need of another engineer as i had
 of an extra leg but our camp was way
 off in the backwoods and as it looked
 as though i should have to spend a
 good deal of the next two or three
 months in san francisco fighting our
 case i decided that it might be just as
 well to have a young chap whom i could
 trust to look after things in my ab-
 sence and incidentally play watchdog
 for my motherless kiddies the little
 daughter having been born in a mexi-
 can mining camp and at the cost of
 my vifes life they were at an age


the popular magazine

 which required a lot of herding and
 were more than a handful for their fat
 sleepy old creole nurse manuela

  so i wrote to dicky explaining the
situation and telling him that he might
sign on with the outfit at seventy-five
per month and found if that interested
him with the promise of a raise to a
hundred as soon as we won our suit
there was no doubt in my mind that
we were sure to win eventually if we
could raise money enough to stick it
out dicky wired back to say that he
was coming immediately i rather won-
dered at his strong desire to get a job
under me first because i had never
known him very well nor treated him
with any great amount of gentleness
and second because i knew that he had
inherited plenty of money from a male
parent that nobody seemed to know
much about in fact there was mys-
tery and doubt as to dickys origin but
as it never appeared to bother him and
he being singularly free of friends or
enemies the question of his right to be
alive was never questioned to my knowl-
edge a benevolent old gentleman with
eyebrows supposed to be his guardian
came once to new haven in a small
steam yacht in the middle of winter
and while he was there dicky took up
his quarters aboard flatly refusing to
go near the training table while she
was in port neither did he invite any
of us aboard i stretched a point in
dickys case knowing how he abomi-
nated wines liquors and cigars and
he went on with her to new london
whence she cleared for nassau dicky
returning in time for morning chapel
he never strained the college entente
cordiale which should really obtain be-
tween the faculty and undergraduate
body nor do i think that he was
highly esteemed for this observance of
university regulations he had no in-
timacy with either faculty or students

  i must say that i rather admired
dickys utter indifference to popularity

he might have been so extremely pop-
ular if he had cared to be but he
never showed the slightest need of any
close sympathy from a living soul to
me he seemed extremely young in
spite of his resilient physique-just a
grown-up little boy-and i fear that i
am giving myself away in so describ-
ing him thinking of my own kiddies

i could never help but feel what a dif-
ference it might have made in dicky
to have crawled up on his papas or
mammas knee and been told a story
when he was very small and very tired
though it was hard to conceive of
dickys ever having been very tired
even when small

   well out he came and i went to the
station to meet him with my team of
wiry little red mules he hadnt
changed the slightest particle but was
as boyishly handsome as ever and with
that alert interested way of taking in
his surroundings which had about it an
air of childish inquiry and eagerness
it was a hot day and as usual he was
half undressed his coat on his arm
sleeves rolled up and shirt open at the
neck he looked more like a school-
boy off for a vacation than a serious-
minded hydraulic engineer

  what have you been up to since i
saw you last i asked when we had
stowred his scant luggage and started
off

  traveling mostly he answered
bicycling on the continent and yacht-
ing in the mediterranean last winter
all through the greek archipelago with
some friends greeks mostly and re-
lations of mine

  i didnt know you had any greek
relations said i

   oh yes quite a lot he answered
indifferently i didnt know it myself
until last winter afterward i went
to nice and then to paris

  all this sounds as if youd been
having a pretty good time i observed

  so i have said dicky looking
dicky



brightly around him as we spun along
i always have a good time

  how long were you in paris

  a little over a month those mules
can go cant they

  pretty well i admitted what
did you do with yourself in paris 
oh i fooled around played tennis
and golf and rode in the bois

  all alone

  no not often i rode with an
american girl i met there or rather
i met her at nice i went to paris
because she was going to be there her
name is diana maitland shes here
now

  where i asked and the mules
bolted we bounced through a few
ruts and roots and things before i got
them quiet dicky pushed back his
sleeves

  here in a sanitarium or something
of the sort he answered shes go-
ing to be here all summer thats the
feason i wrote to you asking for a
job

  oh it is is it said-i reefing in
the mules so your object in coming
here is not to work for the golden gate
funding and development companies
but to be near diana maitland

  yes said dicky and reached down
for a peach which was in a basket be-
tween his knees shes going to be
locked up all summer in this sanitarium
place and i promised to come out to
see her

  in that case i told him it is my
unpleasant duty to inform you that you
are fired on the spot

  why asked dicky bathing his
face in a large and succulent peach

  i maltreated the mules for a mo-
ment before answering then once the
intelligent little beasts discovered that
they were to walk quietly i said to
dicky that he was a fraud

  but im not a fraud he protested
ill do whatever you tellme to you
can pay me seventy-five dollars or sev-

enty-five cents i dont care ill make
good just you wait and see

  but its foolish said i if you
come here as an employee of the com-
pany that is the basis on which you
are to work besides this man mait-
land the father of your inamorata is
our worst enemy barring one and that
is old professor van rippen

  that nature-cure sanitarium man 
yes you cant have a foot in both
camps dicky i swore van rippen
is even worse than maitland he has
this big reservation just below us and
most of this railroad crowd own a lot
of stock in it though the professor
has managed to hang onto the control-
ling interest but he seems to be their
tool more or less and just now hes
got an injunction holding us up on the
riparian rights and it looks as though
we were in fa no end of trouble and
expense they know that our fund-
ing the water would be of great benefit
to this sanitarium plant which is merely
an advertising stunt for the land boom
to come later at this moment van
rippen has it in his power to stall our
operations for some time to come
maitland hasnt but he may have be-
cause hes got all sorts of money and
influence back of him all the same
id rather take my chances with van
rippen than maitland

  why dicky asked chirping at the
off mule in a peculiar way that made
the little beast waggle its ears

  because hes a bigger man mait-
land is smart as a steel trap but the
old professor thinks all around him
maitland stands a good chance q
spoiling this scheme for all of us be-
cause he is greedy the bird-in-the-
hand thing and then go catch another
bird in some other bush thats mait-
land hes afraid that once we get
our source of water power well be
trying to parallel his line with an elec-
tric railroad and so we shall we can
manage it in the end if we sit tight and


the popuuir magazine

keep our eye on the ball but its going
to take some doing meanwhile this is
an armed camp and the sanitarium is
the strategic point so if your coming
here is simply to be near maitlands
daughter you can just consider all dip-
lomatic relations to be closed

  all right dicky looked at me a
good deal as my little boy does when he
feels that im out of patience with him
then ill go away

  very well said i but meanwhile
it cant do any harm for you to visit
me for a few days and call on miss
maitland at the sanitarium

  thanks said dicky id like to
visit you but theres no use of my call-
ing at the sanitarium i wouldnt be let
in

  why not

  well maitland has set his heart on
his daughter marrying a british title
he brought her over here to get her
away from me

  oh he did then how are you go-
ing to manage to see her 

  ill climb the fence or something
he answered cheerfully

  youll get yourself filled full of
shot or something i snapped this
van rippen back-to-nature place is not
like most such establishments for one
thing the inmates consist only of young
and healthy women and girls between
the ages of fourteen and thirty he
absolutely refuses to receive a person
with any illness or infirmity his par-
ticular crankism is to prepare young
women physically for matrimony and
future maternity and his graduates get
a diploma certifying to their capacity
to produce prize specimens of their kind
with the regularity of a plum tree and
the unfailing accuracy of a patent mul-
tiplier his establishment entertains at
this moment about eighty fair daugh-
ters of the plutocratic class whose
course of training costs three hundred
dollars a month per capita payable in
advance for each term of three months

these ladies clad only in sandals and
short tunics range over fifty acres of
park and meadow surrounded by a ten-
foot wire fence patrolled on the out-
side by elderly gamekeepers with sour
dispositions and double-barreled shot-
guns inside the inclosure there are
a number of large police dogs which
are trained to regard anything in pants
as their particular prey except for
certain grave and learned members of
the faculty of medicine it is probable
that the only male persons admitted to
the sacred premises during the past four
years were the state hydraulic engi-
neer and myself each a pere de famille
and we made our inspection of the
brook and dianas pool with downcast
eyes and mantling color also we nar-
rowly escaped being devoured by some
sort of ferocious beast which looked
like a cross between a spotted hyena and
a wa-wa dog with a possible baton sin-
tstre referring to some early mesalli-
ance between a tasmanian wolf and a
harlequin dane

  dicky did not look particularly im-
pressed he took a luscious pear from
the fruit basket between his knees and
began to eat it with relish i threw
away the stump of my favorite brand
of sun-kissed cigar

  so you want to marry diana mait-
land i observed

  why no he said as if surprised
by the question i dont want to marry
her at least i dont think that i do
i dont want to marry anybody he
appeared to reflect i just want to
see her

  you must want to see her pretty
badly to come thousands of miles and
climb a wire fence to manage it i
remarked

  well i guess i must he admitted
and reached for another pear why
shouldnt i shes a bully girl about
the only one i ever knew that i liked
to be with

  does she like to be with you
dicky



  of course she does why shouldnt
she we have a lot of fun together
we like the same things in paris i
bought a touring car and we used to
go out to the forests of marly and
rambouillet and spend the whole after-
noon fooling around and playing with
the hares and rabbits and things
very amusing said i who went
with you 

  her chaperon the countess de
rosoy a nice old thing she is eng-
lish herself and pretty hard up i guess
when i came away i gave her the
car

 that was a kind thought you
must have inherited money dicky

  i have is that the fence around the
sanitarium 

  yes i told him were almost
home youll see the lake when we
turn the bend ahead where did you
put up in paris  i liked to hear him
talk about paris because i had spent
my own honeymoon there

  oh i stopped with a chap that is
sort of a relation of mine said dicky
hes a secretary or something in the
british embassy thats a pretty lake
any in it 

  some rainbow trout all of this
land will be under water when we build
our projected dam ive got a gang at
work now cutting out the timber the
spillway empties into old van rippens
brookj heretofore its been nearly dry
for three months of the year and ive
pointed out to him the advantage he can
expcct in having the flood water funded
and a contract from our company to
keep his mean level the same the year
round he understands it well enough
maitland is the fly in the amber

  what does maitland want dicky
asked as though bored

  oh nothing much i answered bit-
terly only a controlling interest in
our company of which i happen to be
the main guy at this moment if he
gets what he asks for it means that all

of my work here resolves itself into
that of a rather underpaid hydraulic
engineer expert if it werent for my
kids id sell out for even less to some
other bandit its possible that i may
have to do it anyhow

  why dicky asked

  through lack of funds with an-
other hundred thousand dollars i could
stick it out but goodness knows where
i can raise it and hang onto my inter-
est and i reined in the mules who
were beginning to smell their alfalfa

  oh dont bother about that tom
said dicky ill lend you the money
if you like

  i fetched up my two little red devils
so short that the nigh one began to
kick dicky clucked at him and he got
docile

  what are you trying to say i
asked have you come into a big pile
or what 

  ive always had a lot of money
dicky answered and stared out at the
lake me for a swim i like this
place he looked at me and laughed
dont bother about that money ques-
tion tom said he

  how can i help it i exclaimed
when i show you this proposition
youll understand there are millions
in it if we can only manage to swing
the business where did you get this
money you talk so easily about

  i got it from my father from my
mother too i own quite a big island
in the mediterranean but it isnt
worth much just now they tell me
it might be some day is that where
you live and dicky looked eagerly
at my little bungalow which was on
the edge of the lake and really noth-
ing more than a rough shack

  yes and the idlers were paying to
take a nature cure live in that long
shanty behind we are quite a family
party here dicky

  it must be nice to have a family


the pocpullcr magazine

said dicky i think id like to have
one myself

 well i answered when you
marry diana you might

  dicky nodded thats so i never
thought of that

  my two kiddies discovered us about
this moment and came tearing down
the trail old manuela sagging along in
their wake she threw away her corn-
husk cigarette and developed power
enough to keep tommy from falling
under the feet of the mules they
swarmed up over us but instead of ask-
ing for the little things which i always
brought them on coming back from
town they began to examine dicky
they seemed to think that he was the
big new toy dicky responded to these
advances graciously enough for a few
minutes but being a child himself other
children did not amuse him very much
he caught sight of a cub wolf chained
to a kennel and went over to exam-
ine it the kiddies trailing at his heels
manuela had taught them not to go
near that half-grown little devil

 look out said tommy he
bites

  does he dicky looked at me
the cub was nuzzling his legs and
pinching at his ankles the little brute
respected me but others had to feed
him with a stick when i happened to
be away what if i let him loose
dicky asked

  all right i said that means
that weve seen the last of him but i
dont care hes a nasty little devil
let him go

  dicky unhitched him and that half-
grown cub proceeded to go crazy he
tore around in circles rushed at the
children and knocked them both over
swiping their faces with his tongue
which was far out when manuela
tried to rescue them he made a dash
for her skirt and romped off with
the best part of it fearing that he
might snap at one of the kids in his

wild exuberance i let fly at him with
a pine knot and caught him in the
ribs he let out a snarling yelp and
i fully expected to see him start for
the tall timber and was quite willing
that he should but not a bit of it he
hovered about with a wary eye on me
and an hour later when i came back
from inspecting some gear he was sit-
ting on his haunches watching dicky
disport himself in the lake none of
the rest of us could get within less
than ten feet of him but that evening
he ate some scraps from dickys hand
and permitted himself to be chained up
with perfect docility which was wise
of him as i did not propose to take
any chances with his interest in my
poultry once night approached

  for the next three or four days
dicky roamed about the place in knick-
ers bare legs and a sleeveless shirt
sandaled and bareheaded with my two
kiddies tagging constantly at his heels
and ki-yi the cub coyote never far
away in the new interests of the place
dicky appeared to have forgot about
diana maitland he played around
like a little boy dug up the material
from somewhere and built a sort of
eskimo kayak in which he disported
himself on the lake to the great delight
of the children and such of the hands
as happened to be loitering about he
got acquainted with the men immedi-
ately and while failing quite to make
him out they appeared to admire him
and to enjoy his society i was cutting
out timber at that moment on the other
side of the lake and dicky lent himself
to this labor with great enthusiasm
where he ever learned to handle an
ax i couldnt say the chances are
that he never had learned until then
but the beautiful coordination of eye
and muscle backed by his absolute un-
tiring strength quickly won the esteem
of my crabbed old gang boss

  all hands regarded dicky as a freak
but a pleasant one and after their first
dicky



reticence had worn off which was in
about an hour they became very
chummy too much so i thought he
knew them all and they called him
dicky and their attitude toward him
was much the same as the one with
which they favored tommy and jua-
nita both beloved and petted i must
say that i might have let several of
them go if it hadnt been that the kids
would have grieved at such a breaking
up of our family party

  then one day when i came back
from town cross and discouraged after
an interview with a local attorney
whom i suspected strongly of having
a foot in the enemies camp i saw
dicky paddling up from the provisional
dam which we had thrown across the
gorge at the foot of the lake he
flopped out of his kayak thing and
came up dripping from his plunge and
sat down on the edge of the porch

  well what have you been up to
i asked batting the pipe cinders off
the front of my sweater you had
better go in and rub down

  dicky just sat and breathed hard
there was a cool north wind blowing
but he didnt seem to notice it

  how did you get all scratched up
like that i asked looking at his arms
and shoulders

  in the culvert dicky answered
it was choked up but i managed to
squirm through i thought it would be
easier to go that way than to try to
climb the fence

  what are you talking about i
cried

  ive been to see diana said he
i sent her a note yesterday asking
her how to manage it manuela took
the note for me but there was nothing
doing she told me though that diana
and some of the others went to swim
every afternoon in the pool just below
the fence where your brook goes
through the culvert  underneath the
trail so i paddled down there and

left the kayak beside the dam then
swam downstream and went through
the culvert

  you young idiot was all that i
could say

  it wasnt so easy as i thought
dicky admitted the place was all
choked up with brush the heavy
grillage that you put at the mouth of
it has been ripped loose and is all over
the place but i got through the
brook widens out just beyond the fence
there is a big pool and just below a
sort of sluice i stopped to rest in the
pool and while i was leaning there on
a tree trunk an old fellow in pajamas
asked me where id come from he
asked me in greek not modern greek
but homeric he must have been look-
ing at my ears and thought that he was
seeing a faun or something like that
what did you say  i asked

  i said- and dick rattled off

something which was all greek to me

  that was a very good answer said

i	and where did you learn greek
not at sheff 

  i never learned it dicky looked
out across the little lake which the
night was beginning to cover up i
just know it not modern greek of
course well tom this old chap van

rippen-

  van rippen i interrupted

 yes he told me his name he
was sitting there in his pajamas eating
thin slices of bread writh honey smeared
on em he gave me some i like
honey i dont see why you shouldnt
raise some bees--

  never mind the bees i snapped
what then 

  oh nothing much while we were
talking some hens came down the bank

and began to swim around-

 what-

  yes it sounds funny but they
looked just like ordinary hens all but
their feet he told me that he had


the potpular magazine

bred them with a poule deau not the
sort you see in france but the oriental
variety the old mans fad seems to
be like professor burbanks principles
but applied to animals instead of plants
and things he told me all about it
the trouble is it takes so long while
we were sitting on the bank eating our
bread and honey and talking greek--
he seemed to like talking greek-we
heard the most awful racket behind
us a regular dog fight we looked
around and saw ki-yi getting chewed
up by some sort of an animal jd never
seen it had rings over its back and
down its tail and a lot of young ones

i rescued ki-yi and the young ones
scuttled up and took a dive into the
pouch of this beast if was a marsupial
wolf ki-yi had followed me through
the culvert or else managed to get over
the fence he was scared and ran
away i havent seen him since

  i have said i he is under your
bed

  then its all right said dicky ap-
parently relieved i was afraid that
one of the keepers might have shot him
as i heard the sound of a gun and a
yelp well old van rippen asked me
a lot of questions and i told him that
id come to see diana he laughed and
told me to think of actaeon

  all this in homeric greek i
asked

  yes he didnt speak it very well
like a cockney dropping his hs and
sticking them on in the wrong places
anyhow i understood him then he
asked me in english if i realized that
i was trespassing and subject to pros-
ecution and heavy fines and i told him
that i hadnt thought about it but that
no doubt it was true but that i didnt
care as i had money enough to pay
the fines there are lots of birds in
that place mostly wood pigeons they
were all over us while we sat there
one of them snatched a piece of bread
out of my hand and flew away these

ring-tailed puppies were a nuisance
too

  you had better go in and put on
some clothes said i you can tell
me the rest at supper

  im not cold besides there isnt
much more to tell he looked up at
me and laughed i think ive man-
aged to do you a good turn tom

  indeed

  yes said dicky it may not
come to anything but then again it
might old van rippen is crazy about
landscape gardening he must have
been sitting there thinking about how
he could make that brook very beauti-
ful when i came paddling down he
had a big portfolio under his arm and
he fished out some of his plans they
werent any good - his idea was to
dam the low places thats dutch
thrift but i showed him how much
more beautiful the effect would be if
he were to bank up the water in the
high places such as the pool where
we were sitting and drain the low ones
so as to have dry pastures he said
that would take a lot more water and
i told him that you were prepared to
furnish him with all the water he
needed hes coming to see you about
it

  and maitland  i asked

  he doesnt like maitland any more
than you do dicky answered

  how about yourself

  dicky looked rather surprised

  ive never laid eyes on him said
he

  well you had better i told him
when a man is in love with a girl
and wants to marry her it cant do any
great amount of harm to make the ac-
quaintance of her father

  thats what van rippen said
dicky replied he talked a good seal
the way you do tom i like diana
of course how could i help it but
i must say i cant see any sense in
this marrying stuff
dicky

  all right i retorted then some-
body else has got to teach you that
sort of sense one of these days now
listen to me dicky and tell me the
truth do you want to marry this
diana girl or do you not because
i tell you frankly that im not going
to have you here swimming through
culverts or climbing over wire fences
for the purpose of philandering that
sort of business doesnt go in this part
of the country imno lover of mait-
land nor of maitlands daughter but
all the same ive got some respect for
modern conventions if you want to
marry the girl go about it in a respec-
table manner tell maitland who you
are and what youve got and all the
rest of the thing but tell me first or
else keep away from diana as long
as you are here with me do you get
that 

  yes dicky answered i guess id
better not try to see her at all

  i guess so too said i especially
if you feel that way about it what
i cant make out is why you followed
her way out here unless youre really
in love with her

  i told her id come said dicky
maybe i am in love with her i dont
know shes an awfully nice girl wait
until you see her tom the chances
are youll cut me out she likes old
men

  oh go to the devil i snapped not
much caring to be put on the retired
list at forty  if she looks like the pic-
ture i saw of her in the sunday maga-
zine you may have your work cut out
for you my little boy let me tell you
ive made the girls take notice in my
time

  dicky went singing off about some
sort of play tommy and juanita trot-
ting after him as usual and ki-yi scout-
ing on the flanks of the party dicky
seemed to enjoy the society of the kid-
dies though no more demonstrative of
any particular affection for them than

he had ever showed toward others
while lovable in a way i doubted that
he possessed any deep emotions of the
heart it was evident enough that he
was not the least in love with diana
maitland the chances were i
thought that he had greatly enjoyed
her society in paris and being rich
and free as air had decided to follow
her to california no doubt he had
found paris rather dull without her
it was merely the case of a child miss-
ing its playmate and resolving to go find
her he knew that i was in the same
immediate locality and being fond of
me in his immature way and rather in-
terested in the sort of work upon which
i was engaged had made up his mind
to try active occupation for a change
incidentally being near his pretty pal

  but once arrived at my camp he had
found the surrounding conditions so
pleasantly suited to his childish nature
that he no longer felt any great need
of his former playmate and she being
particularly difficult of access he had
accepted the situation with the calm
indifference of a little boy to prohibited
playthings when plentifully supplied
with all his juvenile interests require
dicky had the constructive mind and
he grasped the big principles of our
elaborate proposition with amazing acu-
men for one whose knowledge was
merely theoretical my carefully de-
tailed plans for funding the water sup-
ply principally torrential and diverting
it to industrial enterprises gave him the
keen delight which an alert youngster
might be expected to take in a mam-
moth toy incidentally he threw in sev-
eral excellent suggestions which quickly
proved to me that the company would
lose nothing by taking him on officially
as an assistant hydraulic engineer once
it cut through the jungle of legal com-
plications

  meanwhile dicky appeared to be
perfectly happy playing about the place
half naked he loved the water like


the opular magazine

an otter hound and was usually on or
about the little lake with the kiddies
with ki-yi watching their maneuvers
from the shore and occasionally dashing
into the woods on business of his own
but i soon discovered that dickys
promenades had a purposeful object

  you can improve a whole lot on
those plans of yours tom said he
one evening

  indeed i exclaimed with a touch
of irony in my voice

  yes he went on the way they
are now you stand to lose a lot of water
in the deeper alluvials you are count-
ing on the torrential water from the
hills to keep up the level when you
build your dam in the gorge it strikes
me that it would be a lot better to divert
all that muddy stuff by a big spillway
so as not to clog your reservoir with
silt then instead of putting your dam
where you have planned you might
spend a little more money on caisson
work and throw a low masonry core
dam abovit a mile downstream so as to
control the deeper alluvial currents
which are constant the year around
better water and no clay and stuff to
clean out

  how do you know they are there
i demanded

  they must be there with this for-
mation you dont need deep borings
to know that most of the water runs
off naturally in flood times but an
awful lot of it seeps down into the deep
alluvials doesnt it

  what is the basis of your knowl-
edge a hazel wand

  no dicky smiled i never tried
that but you know why it works
dont you

  probably because there is water un-
der the ground almost everywhere
dicky nodded thats it theres
water almost everywhere if you were
to scratch a little in the sahara desert
youd find water most places look at
the people that have died of thirst in

 these american deserts with the water
 about a fathom under their feet the
 texas panhandle for instance the
 staked plains

   true i said but your scheme has
 its disadvantages the place where
 you propose to build this dam is in the
 sanitarium grounds and we dont hap-
 pen to control them

   you might thouglj suggested
 dicky and looked thoughtful

   how 

   well in the first place nobody in
 this country has the right to stop big
 schemes for development

   they can stop them long enough to
 bust the developers sometimes i said
 bitterly for this was the burden of my
 thought at the moment

   sometimes dicky admitted but
 in your case i think you are borrowing
 trouble

   no doubt i answered dryly too
 bad that money cant be borrowed at
 the same rates

   you can borrow money if you like
 said dicky

   from you

   yes and from old van rippen
   are you crazy i asked

   no he told me so himself this
 morning

   this morning where did you see
 him 

   down the brook in the sanitarium
 grounds where i saw him the other
 day i saw diana too

   the deuce you did 

   yes it was very early about six
 i went down through the culvert again
 i didnt go to see diana but i felt
 curious to see what the place was like
 farther down and i thought that no-
 body would be about so early then
 i slid down through a sort of natural
 sluice into a big pool and there were
 diana and two other girls in bathing
 they were frightened at first but diana
 introduced me so it was all right
dicky



  quite so i said how were these
young ladies clad

  oh i dont know they werent
naked though if thats what you mean
i apologized for butting in and went
on downstream coming back i met
the old man and we had quite a talk
he was a little grouchy at first but i
explained that i hadnt expected to see
anybody and pretty soon he cheered
up we got talking about this dam
thing and i described your position in
the matter

  you mean that you told him i was
hard up

  not exactly i told him that you
were worried about the money end of
it and the lawsuit and the lost time and
all that but there was no need of it
as rather than see the scheme fall
through for lack of funds id lend you
all you needed myself a couple of
millions if necessary pounds i mean
not dollars i told him how we were
old friends and the same fraternity and
all and he seemed to understand he
questioned me about the plan ive been
telling you for the big dam and the
end of it was he liked the idea what
seemed to please him most was that it
would be an awful joke on maitland
just what the trouble is i dont know
but ive got an idea hes awful sore with
maitland ill tell you the rest of it
later is there anything to eat some
bread and butter and milk or some-
thing im empty as a hollow log
naturally this information gave me
food for thought dickys plan for so
enormously increasing the contents of
our reservoir had never really occurred
to me possibly because the increased
cost of such a project would have
seemed prohibitive on the face of it
besides it meant the inundation as
closely as i could figure it which i
immediately proceeded to attempt of
about half the area of the sanitarium
it could never have entered my head
that old professor van rippen could

have possibly been brought to discuss
such a scheme

  there were a thousand and other de-
tails to consider naturally and i was
giving myself up to a sort of folie de
grandeur in which i saw myself a mil-
lionaire and dicky a prince de monte
cristo-for somehow it never occurred
to me to doubt his statement in regard
to his financial resources-when there
came from outdoors certain sounds
which fetched me up all standing
these consisted of a long rippling peal
of laughter as sweetly modulated as it
is possible to imagine followed by
noises suggesting a number of smoothly
running motor cars of which the en-
gines had been set in motion at the
same instant interspersed were gut-
tural ejaculations in a fat voice not
difficult to recognize as van rippens

  i stepped to the window and beheld
a curious sight about two hundred
yards away on the shore of the lake
stood dicky in his pale-green bathing
suit and a measure of corn in his hand
overhead the boughs of the trees were
bent down almost to the point of break-
ing with a great multitude of big wood
pigeons which in later years have for
some reason become so rare he was
apparently trying to coax them down
by tossing handfuls of the yellow grain
while at some distance tommy and
juanita were watching his maneuvers
with breathless interest and ki-yi near
them sitting very erect head slightly
cocked and brushy tail curled around
his toes

  but it was not this arcadian group
which caught and held my attention
just outside my door stood what
seemed to me the most beautiful girl
i had ever seen it is quite impossible
to describe just how she impressed me
pausing there in the late creamy sun-
light and of a cameo vividness and del-
icacy against the turquoise lake she
was like some exquisite goddess a crea-
ture utterly removed from the gross


the cpocpulacr magazine

material world her costume too was
singular and enhanced this effect be-
ing the last note of simplicity but grace-
ful in the extreme such a light diapha-
nous and sensitively draped tunic as
seemed to caress rather than conceal
the lovely form to which it clung the
long round dazzling arms were bare
from the shoulder and the delicious
neck was exposed by an oval opening
rather low between the shoulders this
shimmering snowy gown fell nearly to
the ankles of which the nudity was
modified by broad bands crossing as
they rose from the open sandals incas-
ing the small bare rosy feet the pro-
fusion of very fine silvery golden hair
was twisted up in a psyche knot and
held by a double filet which looked like
mother-of-pearl

  a few paccs away stood the fat old
professor rotund and ridiculous in some
sort of a costume of which the material
looked like coarse homespun pongee
silk and the cut capable of claiming
kin with anything from a suit of pa-
jamas to a sentry box

  he was bareheaded and his bald
brown pate might have been used as a
heliograph but he carried a hat in his
hand a very fine panama with a broad
puggaree his feet very small for his
enormous bulk were beautifully shod
in a curious buckskin moccasin laced
up to the huge bulging calf and con-
taining the lower extremities of his
baggy trousers he was armed with a
stout alpine climbing stick and wore
a pair of great shell-rimmed amber-
tinted goggles

  the far west is so full of a num-
ber of things that im sure we should
all be as happy as kings to quote
that faithful companion of my many
months of loneliness r l s what
with converting and diverting and per-
verting and animadverting at the profit
or loss of all the animate or inanimate
matter within reach the dweller of these
parts has no reasonable excuse for be-

ing taken by surprise all the same i
was surprises are like floods you
can handle them when they come with
some warning and not too fast and fre-
quent but there are limits

  while i was gaping at the goddess
with the tail of my eye on dicky the
kids ki-yi and the professor there
came another spectacle which passed in
the flash of a second from the sublime
to the ridiculous i say sublime because
it began by a peep through the curtain
which cuts off our vision of some won-
derful age which must have suggested
the return of the millennium an age
when there was no war nor feelings of
fear and hatred and suspicion and dis-
trust between cognate beings high or
low when a man might have trod on
an ant without meaning to do so and
been forgiven by that ants immediate
family and political affiliations

  because it became quickly evident
that these migrating pigeons had no
fear whatever of dicky and desired to
profit b his hospitality but were de-
terred by the propinquity of others
about whom they were not so sure
perhaps it may have been ki-yi at
any rate they suddenly decided to take
a chance and at some sign from their
flight commander the whole vast flock
took wing and came crashing down like
a cloudburst and the beat of their wings
was what i have already mentioned--
like the whir of many motors they
deluged dicky and it was really a won-
derful thing to see

  then came the ridiculous as often
occurs this violent rain of pigeons
was more than ki-yis furtive nature
could stand he started for dickys
room in the bungalow voicing his name
as he went his wild stampede started
a panic with the kids but they rallied
round the colors and hoofed it for
dicky not quite sure but that he might
be in danger of getting eaten with his
corn and that scared the pigeons
when there came another general move-
dicky



ment this time an actual rout and they
made a racket about it

  the next thing was diana maitland
screaming with laughter and the pro-
fessor blasting out remarks and i re-
alized that this same thing had hap-
pened before while i was poring over
my plans i should have gone out at
once and welcomed my guests but for
some reason i felt upset so instead
i went in and intrenched myself be-
hind my desk and waited for some
official information that i had guests
it was not the professor nor what
dicky had told me that made me feel
that way it was something that struck
through me at that last glimpse i had
of diana up on her tiptoes and shriek-
ing with joy and clapping her hands

  well i said to myself while sit-
ting there dicky is certainly a darling
of the gods then it occurred to me
that id never heard any reports of his
being a darling of the goddesses and
i tried to feel sorry that he was so
childish and incapable of profiting by
his gifts

  nobody came to announce that i had
guests so i cursed my chinaman in
my heart and got up to investigate
a reconnoissance from the window of
the office showed all hands barring
ki-yi talking very happily so i woke
up manuela and sent her to tell chang
to get tea- and be quick about it then
i went out and found diana being
closely examined by my two kiddies and
apparently enjoying their appreciation
of her i did not wait for any formal
introduction from dicky or van rip-
pen but took the small strong hand
which she offered me and welcomed
her as best i could while speaking
to her i observed that the portrait which
i had considered so very beautiful was
actually slanderous in its shortcomings
also that she was a less ethereal crea-
ture than my first glimpse of her had
led me to suppose she being quite
sufficiently palpable to withstand the

buffets of this rough world of ours
and even to return them should the
occasion require it

  she gave me a very intent look from
her sea-green eyes and her charming
mouth which twisted up a little at one
corner wore an amused expression

  you dont look like the ogre id
expected said she

  who has been maligning me  i
asked

  dicky and the father and professor
van rippen when i asked dicky what
you were like he said like the devil
when he gets after a chap and acts the
part too father says that you are
the only man he ever met he felt shy
of having trouble with and the pro-
fessor said that in some dispute you
had with them about your water power
you made him feel thin that was
when you lost your temper and called

him a greasy old tub of dutch-

she looked away with a demure smile

  never mind i said the word
was inelegant and unjust i spoke
hastily

  the professor interrupted us this
is a most informal call said he its
object is neighborly i wished to ask
if you and your friend this adolescent
pan who swims through culverts and
charms wolves and pigeons and other
creatures would give me the pleasure
of lunching with me to-morrow and
afterward taking a stroll about the
place

  that is a very great honor i as-
sured him we should be delighted
i am sure

  good at noon then if the hour
suits your convenience look at him
do you think that he is entirely hu-
man 

  possibly a little more than that i
answered glancing at dicky who after
a brief word with diana had dropped
down on the trunk of a tree and ap-
peared to be looking for something in-
side it his search was soon rewarded


the populacr magazine

in the appearance of a timber cat a
large chipmunk which emerged from
a hole and proceeded to fill its cheeks
with the kernels of grain offered it

  go put on some clothes said i
sternly and come up for tea

  all right said dicky and started
for the boathouse where he was in the
habit of changing one scanty costume
for another all the luggage which he
had brought consisted of a kit bag and
a very large box of books the latter
a curious collection among which were
the most recent set of encyclopedia in
their light bindings a large parcel of
french plays published in feuilleton
form by iillustration a collection of
handsome colored plates of the birds of
all countries of the world some techni-
cal handbooks on different branches of
my own profession and a lot of de-
scriptive travel books dicky had the
same fondness for reading to be found
in a schoolboy but curiously enough
or perhaps not so curious as-natural
he much preferred natural sciences to
fiction when he observed the pleasure
i took in the beautiful encyclopedia he
presented it to me on the spot saying
that he was tired of lugging it around

  diana lingered with the kiddies who
insisted on her making the rounds of
the place and observing their various
interests i wanted to corral them and
turn them over to manuela that they
might be properly polished for tea but
both diana and the professor requested
their liberty so i refrained rather sus-
pecting a conspiracy on the part of
van rippen our relations having been
purely antagonistic i wondered at his
having brought diana with him but
decided as we strolled up to the house
that the girl had forced his hand prob-
ably being in love with dicky and wish-
ing to see what possible attraction our
camp could hold for him if not for its
propinquity to herself

  but nothing transpired to show any
reason for this idea dicky came up

immediately decently enough clad and
a fewminutes later ke children re-
turned chattering to dfana and we had
our tea and toast and muffins and honey
and things in the most ordinary way
imaginable then as night approached
diana and the professor took tfieir de-
parture on foot it being scarcely a mile
to the sanitarium

  we dined always at half past seven
and after dinner while sitting on the
porch i said to dicky

  that suggestion of yours must have
stirred up the old marra lot

  why shouldnt it  dicky asked
its a perfectly good idea

  its a pretty big idea i answered
youre sure that you could lay your
hands on the money to back it

  of course otherwise i would
never have proposed it when the time
comes for your wanting to capitalize
the business well write to my london
bankers they can furnish all- the as-
surance necessary

  why do you want to go into it i
asked theres always a certain
amount of risk attached and you have
money enough now

  i like to see things like that de-
velop he answered and id like to
have a hand in it

  i	thought i understood here was
the little boy again playing on the beach
and damming the water as the tide
went out or building miniature lakes
in brooks for the fun of changing the
original order of things

  i have an idea that if we were to
tackle it wed have a good fight on our
hands with maitland i observed

  what of it dicky asked you
have now havent you  crowd him
out if you can thats what hed do
to you

  how about diana

  oh she cant suffer said dicky in-
differently shes got plenty of money
of her own she once told me so
even then i ventured its no
dicky



apt to help yeur popularity with her
look here dicky i wish you would tell
me something and tell it straight
ill tell you anything i know said
dicky and pointed at the moon just
rising above the treetops on the other
side of the lake

  i see it i spoke impatiently
very fine moon what i want to know
is are you in love with diana maitland
or are you not and if not why not
how can you help it and if you are
why do you offer to help hand her
father one in the eye if we put
through this scheme you propose we
can knock his lines local traffic galley -
west and kill all his schemes for town
traction and lighting companies dead as
a hundred-year-old chinese egg its
not going to help you with maitland
my son with a bigger man it might
but not with him

 oh he be hanged exclaimed
dicky dont you worry about me
tom

  then you must be pretty sure of
yourself-and of her i observed
now tell the truth dont you want
to marry her did you ever meet a
more lovely girl or one whose whole
nature and personality appeared to
promise as much shes a wonder
dicky looked at me with an impu-
dent boyish grin which made me feel
like giving him a back-handed slap
across the mouth

  i thought youd fall in love with
her you old troglodyte said he

  dont be an ass i snapped here
am i a widower twice her age and
with two well-grown kids her father
and i were in the same class at an-
dover

 what of it dicky demanded
years dont count with a man of your
strength

  good lord i groaned to hear
you talk one might think you wanted
me to marry her -

  so i do he replied i like her

  	a p

and i like you and i dont like mait-
land just from what ive heard about
him theres no use bothering about
maitland though

  but dont you want to marry her
yourself i shot at him yes or no
havent you ever thought that you
wanted to marry her 

  no dicky answered id rather
be free to do whatever i feel like doing
whenever i feel like doing it

  a great many people feel that way
at times i commented

  yes said dicky but most of them
feel it too late

  yes most and i was chewing
th is remark on the end of my pipe when
there came a sound from the dark still-
ness all about which brought back cer-
tain memories which i had thought to
be dead and buried dicky and i turned
our heads to listen

  do you have nightingales here he
asked

  no i answered but that sounds
like one doesnt it

  yes said he and imitated it per-
fectly with a low whistle from the root
of his tongue there was no response
then ki-yi began to yelp i had in-
sisted on dickys chaining him up every
night

  weve got to get rid of that cub
said i he keeps everybody awake
when theres a moon

  ill try to quiet him said dicky
and slipped off into the shadows

  i waited a few minutes smoking my
pipe and thinking of a good many
things ki-yi stopped barking but
dicky did not come back presently
i went into my office and told chang
to make me a pot of strong coffee and
then go to bed i felt sleepless and i
was excited over this idea of dickys
and wanted to work the business out
more thoroughly before seeing van
rippen the following day because i
was quite sure that he was thinking
about it as hard as i and that his in-


the popular magazine

vitation for luncheon was not based en-
tirely on the neighborly motive which
he had indicated

  so i got out my maps and had just
started to pick up the thread interrupted
that afternoon when there came a rap
on the door

  come in i said and looked around
to see old manuela

  what do you want i growled
why dont you go to bed and not dis-
turb me i spoke to her in spanish
and the conversation was continued in
the same tongue manuelas english be-
ing rather worse than my spanish

  i feel it my duty to tell the senor
something said she

  then hurry up about it

  i have a confession to make said
manuela i hope that the senor may
oe so kind as to forgive me there
seemed to be no harm in it and senor
ricardo is so very kind

  have you been taking any more
notes to the sanitarium i asked

  manuela ducked her head yes i
have taken a note every day since senor
ricardo has been here i thought there
could be no harm in it besides the
senorita is so much in love with him and
he with her

  true i felt myself beginning to
boil inside and what sort of a serv-
ant do you consider yourself to come
to me with this tittle-tattle about my
guest who has no doubt paid you very
well to keep your silly old mouth shut
you make me sick you get out of
here to-morrow dont let me lay my
eyes on you again

  she began to gesticulate oh she
wailed if the senor could only imag-
ine how much they love-these two
children-and how difficult it is for
them--

  shut up your mouth and get out
i roared

  but oh senor here am i telling you
all about it-

  i dont want to hear- i snarled

at her and she began to weep

  a hot wave of anger and disgust
swept through me here apparently
was dicky not only lying to me but
trying to make a fool of me into the
bargain and old van rippen false to
his sacred charge and probably schem-
ing to use diana maitland as a fulcrum
to pry himself loose from her father
and here was manuela the nourrice of
my little daughter and as i thought
a faithful and devoted servant playing
the sneak-it was unbearable i was
so disgusted that for a moment i fairly
saw red

  you old pig i snarled at manuela
is this the way you return all the kind-
ness that you have had from me

  she began to blubber oh senor
she wailed what was the harm and
she so beautiful with her great black
eyes so sorrowful--

  have you gone crazy i demanded
black eyes  youll be talking next

about her black hair-

  blacker than mine sobbed man-
uela and she so far from her native
land with nobody who- speaks her own

tongue-

 what i asked who are you
talking about old fool 

  she bridled up who should i be
talking about but her excellency the
princess  she retorted the princess
maria who came from across the sea
with the senorita maitland and poor
don ricardo who is so kind and so

  all right manuela i said now
go to bed and let me continue my work
it was very wrong of you to deceive
me and carry notes from one of my
guests to a person in the sanitarium i
shall demand an explanation later

  but manuela declined to be dis-
missed she hovered about looking
very much distressed

  well why dont you go i barked
dcky



  oh senor i think that i ought to
tell you that they are out there-

  out where 

  in the woods they meet there
every night-

  all right i interrupted now go
to bed manuela and remind me to give
tommy a dose of castor oil to-morrow
morning stop your silly noise and go
to bed i am very busy

  so manuela paddled off to her room
which was next that of the kids and
i turned my mind to the effort of ad-
justing the information which she had
cackled out to my preformed idea of
things this was not very easy be-
cause it so upset all of my calculations
while at the same time explaining a lot
that had completely puzzled me it
struck me that i had heard somewhere
of miss maitland having arrived at the
sanitarium with two or three other
guests but this fact had not impressed
me neither was i particularly dis-
turbed at the idea of dickys being out
in the woods with some black-haired
princess who had come to the sani-
tarium with diana he had my per-
mission to remain in the woods with her
for the rest of their lives

  i gathered some sense after a bit
and began to get a line on things di-
ana was not dickys ladylove at all and
never had been but was no doubt do-
ing her best to help along an amo-
rous affair between dicky and some
high-born young female person whom
he had encountered in his travels and
chosen to be reticent about it made
me rather sore at first to think that
dicky should have kept me in the dark
and bribed manuela to carry his mes-
sages but i reflected that after all
there was no great harm in that to me
and mine neither dicky nor i were
given to heart-to-heart talks

  it struck me that all things consid-
ered the joke was on whoever was
responsible for the discreet behavior of
the black-haired princess i got up and

stepped out onto the porch it was a
soft balmy night the air sweet and
still and a great mellow moon hung
over the lace i reflected that i should
not care to have a daughter of mine
keeping a tryst under such conditions
with as handsome and self-willed a
young pagan as dicky so far as i
knew his moral behavior had always
been without reproach but still one can
never tell dicky had never given any
indications of having principles or a
code of ethics which might control the
sudden sway of a strong natural im-
pulse and if ever surroundings seemed
rife with soft suggestions of an amo-
rous character those silent woods with
their dark shadows and mysterious
aisles were replete with them more-
over dick had acted irt a furtive man-
ner which betokened primitive stealth
and his princess must have been irre-
sistibly attracted to him to have made
her escape from the carefully guarded
sanitarium and braved the unknown
dangers of her lonely promenade to the
edge of our clearing

  i shook my head and walking to
where the trail entered the big timber
stood for a few moments listening
there was not a sound and i was about
to return when a dark figure slipped
across a band of moonlight some fifty
yards ahead of me i stepped back be-
hind the trunk of a great tree and
waited a twig snapped there was the
faint rustle of a garment and i stepped
out to confront this solitary prowler
my square bulk must have loomed
startling against the brilliant moonlight
of the clearing there was a smoth-
ered scream and the figure stopped and
swayed and i caught the flash of bare
white arms thrown out in terror

  who is that i asked sharply

  there was an instants silence then
a gasping voice answered

  it is i-diana maitland is that
you mr nelson

  yes i answered good lord


the popuur magazine

miss maitland what are you doing here
alone at this time of night

  i came to find you-to ask your

help-- her voice was low and

tremulous

  what is wrong

  where is dicky  she asked
somewhere in the woods i told
her we were sitting on the porch
when we heard what sounded like the
beginning of a nightingales song dick
went to investigate it and as he did not
return i walked down here to see if
i could find him-or the nightingale
she leaned back against the tree and
placed her hands against the smooth
trunk

  you know dont you said she

  i have my suspicions i answered
that the nightingale is some foolish
bird of european species which has
flown the fence of the sanitarium

  the nightingale is- and she

told me the name of this indiscreet
young person which i immediately rec-
ognized and whom i shall refer to as
the princess alessandra

  we must find them at once diana
said it is all my fault because i am
responsible in a way having presented
dicky to her in paris and afterward
urging her to come here with me of
course you know who dicky really is
mr nelson

  no i told her i only know what
he is and thats a tricky young whelp
id like to baste and maybe shall he
has abused my hospitality

  dickys father is of the higher brit-
ish nobility said diana and his
mother royalty though not british i
cant tell you any more than that she
hesitated then added dickys birth
was-morganatic or something of that
sort

   something of that sort appears to
be cropping out in dicky i observed
what part have you in this clandes-
tine affair

  none-at least not in alessandras

slipping out to-night replied diana
i knew that he had been coming to
see her at night in the sanitarium
grounds but either her companion or
i was always with her

  how did you-all manage it i
asked

  he cut a hole through the fence
where the rhododendron is thick we
have our apartments on the ground
floor so it wasnt hard to slip out and
go down to the brook through the vine-
yards there didnt seem to be any
harm because dicky and alessandra
are such children and it was fun to
know that we were fooling old rip
who thinks himself so clever with his
dogs and watchmen and things the
dogs never so much as growled at
dicky they treated him like an old
friend but we must find them mr
nelson i can tell you all this some
other time

  wait a minute i said how did
you get here to-night and why did you
come  what difference does it make
whether they see each other here or in
the grounds of the sanitarium you
werent in the habit of sitting between
them were you  i must say i dont
see anything to be so distressed about
lovers usually manage to see each other
in every walk of life whether they
happen to be royalty or ragpickers

  diana let go the tree which she had
been leaning against like a dryad just
freed and not quite sure about the outer
world she seemed quite recovered
from the shock of our meeting

  mr tom said she its not the
propriety of the thing that is worrying
me all of that is their own lookout
and after all they are grown-up chil-
dren dicky was to have come to-night
and when it got late and there was still
no sign of him alessandra was wild
she was sure that something terrible
had happened to him so she went
through the fence and came here to see
lady cardogan tried to prevent her
dicky



but it was no use because alessandra
would not listen to her so lady car-
dogan hurried back and told me be-
cause alessandra-

  why did alessandra think that
something terrible had happened to
dicky  i interrupted diana was get-
ting incoherent

  because she is sure that she is be-
ing watched by her cousin dimitri and
his servant alessandra came in awfully
upset the other day and said that she
had seen a man looking through the
fence where the brook goes under the
road he limped off when he saw that
she had seen him and dimitris serv-
ant josef limps it must have been
josef

  most tramps limp i answered
and a good many traipse by at this
season on their way south to pick
oranges but why should dimitri want
to make trouble

  diana waved her hands oh be-
cause he is madly in love with alessan-
dra and alessandra is madly in love
with dicky and dicky is not madly in
love with anybody so far as i can
make out

  he tried to make me believe that
he had come out here to be near you
i observed

  did he said she that sounds
like dicky but what are we going to
do about it all mr tom

  just this miss diana i shall pro-
ceed to conduct you back to the hole
in the fence and there dismiss you with
my fatherly blessing after that i pur-
pose to scout the premises for dicky
but by that time he may be mur-
dered diana objected they might
both be murdered alessandra says
that dimitri is a terrible man and would
stop at nothing she came here to get
away from him he swore to kill her
if she refused to marry him and when
i told her about the sanitarium she said
that would be just the place she did

 not believe that dimitri would follow
 her way over here

   i dont believe he has the sight
 of a lame tramp looking through a fence
 is not much as evidence

   but that is not all said she al-
 essandra had a letter from a friend not
 long ago saying that dimitri had dis-
 appeared and nobody appeared to know
 what had become of him he has a
 double reason for wanting to marry al-
 essandra hes not only mad about her
 but she is enormously rich and dimi-
 tri has gone through his fortune and
 is heavily in debt do let us try to
 find them mr tom and her white
 fltace looked up at me appealingly

   very well i answered but i must
 say i dont just see how we are going
 about it if we start hollering through
 the woods theyll hide all the closer
 it wouldnt do for you to call out and
 would probably bring some of the
 hands from the bunk house and we
 dont care to have any scandal per-
 haps the best thing would be to look
 quietly about stopping once in a while
 to listen its so still that sounds carry
 a good way

   diana agreed to this and the woods
 being open with scattered clumps of
 underbrush here and there we started
 to steal quietly through the hushed dark-
 ness reflecting that lovers like to con-
 template the moon on water i thought
 it probable they might be somewhere
 along the shore of the lake and so
 turned obliquely in that direction
 coming presently to a place where no
 light to speak of filtered through i
 took dianas hand which nestled in
 mine most pleasantly every few min-
 utes we stood for some time straining
 our ears to catch the murmur of voices
 but the only sound was the soft breath-
 ing of the girl beside me

    a nice situation i thought for a staid
 and sober-minded engineer and the
 father of a family to be stealing through
 the woods at night with the loveliest


the popular magazine

girl in the world and the daughter of
my worst business enemy who was at
that time trying his best to ruin me
stalking a pair of lovers otie of whom
was royalty in order to warn them of
possible assassination by a bloodthirsty
lord of the levant i did not for the
moment have the slightest belief that
this dimitri person was within five
thousand miles of the place and was
certain that were we to stumble upon
dicky and his princess they would be
extremely sore it might even cost me
dickys friendship and his promise of
financial backing but there was no re-
fusing dianas appeal

  my own pulses were by no means
sluggish at the contact of her firm little
hand and the faint sweet fragrance of
her when occasionally we paused close
together listening and trying to pene-
trate the gloom she had slipped a dark
blue kimono over her white tunic and
her hair hung over either shoulder
in two heavy braids as she had ar-
ranged it for bed i fancy the hours
at the sanitarium being those of small
children supper at six and their day
beginning at about the same hour of
the morning any person objecting to
this regime was not required to remain
old van rippens discipline was flaw-
less he himself an ex-professor of
the faculty of medicine and as i had
learned a brilliant surgeon in his day
lived quite apart dining well and win-
ing well also for that matter when
with my scientific colleague i had
lunched with him one day the repast
had proved a delicate and delicious ban-
quet with the rarest of food and drink
the chef de cuisine of the establish-
ment was a cordon bleu and no expense
was spared on the table of his inmates
while yet conducted on lines of strict
hygiene the fat grew heavy on all
parts of van rippen excepting his
clever old brain

  weaving through the woods with
diana i wondered what the old boy

would have felt if he could have known
what was going on and the idea
brought an inward chuckle which could
not have been entirely suppressed for
diana whispered in my ear to ask what
amused me

  all this folly i whispered back
and she gave my hand a little squeeze

  its dear of you anyhow she mur-
mured i knew that i could count
on you

  presently we came out on the north
side of the lake where the bank was
rather precipitous there was a fath-
omless silence all about one could
almost have heard a heart beat seven
yards away i had borne up in this
direction because i knew that from
there we could get an extended view of
the shore and the light being now so
brilliant we could discover any object
as though in broad day and my logic
proved fruitful for as i scanned the
top of the little beach i saw the gleam
of some moving shapes just under the
shadow of the trees looking closer
two dark figures became apparent com-
ing slowly in our direction

  there they are i whispered my
lips so close to dianas ear that i could
feel the tendrils of her hair against my
cheek

  for some reason probably the sense
of protection it gave her she had not
withdrawn her hand from my clasp
and now i felt her fingers tighten a little
as she drew back scarcely breathing
we watched the pair approach the
bank on which we stood was ten or
twelve feet high and they were on the
beach partly in the shadow but occa-
sionally emerging under the full radi-
ance of the moon dickys arm was
about the girls waist and her head on
his shoulder their faces together no
doubt in their rapture they forgot that
they were walking at all but felt them-
selves to be floating onward borne by
invisible etheric currents

  i felt diana quiver and heard her
dicky



bredth coming quickly it was a beauti-
ful idyllic scene these two passionate
lovers drifting along on the gleaming
shore of that mystic lake in the benign
effulgence of the moon prosaic as i
am it affected me and made me forget
that i was playing the part of a peeping
tom  diana too seemed spellbound
and fascinated there was something
in the clinging grace of that love-drunk
girl and a suggestion of heaven-sent
oblivion in the slow gliding rhythm of
their forward steps which was like an
exquisite passion dance a lovers min-
uet

  i was the first to recover from the
spectacle and leaned toward diana
this time my lips actually brushed her
ear as she lifted her face to listen her
shoulder against my chest

  we cant disturb them i said it
would be a crime theyd never for-
give us we had better go away

  she seemed to hesitate she was
leaning forward her breath coming
quickly between her parted lips like a
child watching the fairies

  the lovers had reached a spot where
a dead and branchless tree had fallen
across the beach and here their lagging
steps lingered then paused with
dickys arm still about her waist and
his hand holding hers the princess sank
down on the tree trunk drawing him
beside her

  dianas hold on my hand tightened
come she whispered

  but at that second my eyes were
caught by some stirring object in the
shadow of the bank almost abreast of
the fallen tree where our lovers were
sitting it seemed to be quadruped arfd
with a hunched back like a hog or
hyena so far as i could outline its vague
shape but i did not waste much time
in such analysis for the creature what-
ever it might be was slinking behind
the tree trunk toward the pair

  look out dicky i yelled and over
the brink i went scuffling and rolling

down in a small avalanche of loose
earth i heard dicky give a sort of
shout and as i sprang up saw him scuf-
fling with a man then came another
assailant from the same black recess
and i took a running dive at him clean
across the tree and tackled him around
the knees good old football tactics
they are sometimes useful in later life
over and over we went i clawing up his
body and trying to clamp his arms and
he jabbing at me with a knife three
times i felt the bite of it in my shoul-
der and ribs then i managed to get
his wrist and shifting my hold i gave
his arm a jujutsu wrench he squalled
like a lynx in a jaw trap and i loosed
his arm and grabbed for his throat
but he knew the game and broke my
hold scrambling to his feet i hopped
up the same time and for a second
we stood there panting face to face
he had hung onto his knife and was
just getting ready for another try when
a thick voice behind me said

  stop all this or i shall shoot and
we stopped

  in a scrimmage like that it is impos-
sible to tell how things happen it is
like a football game when the umpire
blows his whistle and all hands disen-
tangle and get up here was old van
rippen with a double-barreled shotgun
and his little spaniel was dashing
around i cant describe precisely what
he said or how he said it but it was
something like this

  let go of that man dicky and get
up is anybody hurt  what a pack
of idiots what a scandal how
lucky that i came what a nuisance 
stop crying alessandra diana you
have betrayed my confidence in your
discretion but it was my fault i
should have known better than to be-
lieve in the discretion of anybody
dont dare to move you bandits or
i  shall shoot you what a mess
dont one of you dare to speak a word
are any of you hurt answer me


the popular magazine

  nobody said anything the profes-
sors remarks appeared to have a very
soothing effect on all hands he was
quite impressive standing there in the
blaze of the moon with his shotgun
and he appeared quite to understand
the strategic value of his position

  why dont you answer me he de-
manded

  because you have just told us to
shut up i made bold to answer and
sat down on the trunk of the tree
you have the floor professor go
ahead the pleasure is ours

  old van rippen did not waste much
time about the business i remember
hearing him telling count dimitri that
he would give him and his servant
twenty-four hours to get out of the
place and that if they lingered after
that he would have them up on a charge
of assault with intent to kill dimitri
answered with a bravado that i could
not help but admire that the princess
was his promised wife betrothed to him
in childhood and that he would kill any
man who tried to usurp his rights also
that he would leave the country when
it suited his convenience

  very well said the professor in
that case i shall march you to the jail
and the chances are that you will re-
main in the country permanently

  no court in east or west would
convict me for what i have done di-
mitri stated

  you are right answered the pro-
fessor especially about the west no
court in this part of the country would
ever get the chance to convict you
when it was learned by the local pop-
ulation that you had tried to assassi-
nate a young and lovely girl a mob
would escort you from the jail to the
nearest tree and there strangle you like
the murderous dog you are come we
shall soon know march on ahead of
me if you try to turn your head or
to escape i will shoot you as i would

a wild pig in your own beech forests
and i am a very good shot

  this information rather staggered
dimitri who had no doubt heard of
western necktie parties

  you would not dare he answered
i am a prince of the blood royal
you will soon be of the blood coag-
ulated snapped the professor of
the many lynchings which have occurred
in this region i do not believe that the
star performer has ever been royalty
and the opportunity to vindicate democ-
racy would be considered as too splen-
did to be neglected as for myself
i should ask nothing better than a good
excuse to get such free world-wide ad-
vertising for my establishment

  old van rippens voice had the cold-
blooded cut of the surgeons knife
dimitri weakened

  very wtell he answered indiffer-
ently i accept your terms

  then go away said the professor
and keep on continuing to go away
such primitive actions as yours have
no place in this day and age particu-
larly in such a part of the world as
this where the people are peaceful and
law-abiding and would break into the
jail and take you out and hang you
from a tree if they were to know of
the crime which you have attempted
the fact of its being a crime passionelle
would have no influence upon their
judgment because they are honest folk
now go or i shall be compelled to
shoot my gun at you there is nothing
more to be said go 

  so they bowed to us and went for
while the professors way of summing
up the case may have been slightly in-
consistent the tone of his voice was
very convincing

  during this brief discussion my knife
cuts must have been bleeding quite
freely for i suddenly became very
faint nobody had observed that i was
wounded nor had i thought much about
it myself but all at once the moon
dicky



began to weave peculiar parabolas and
then became totally eclipsed

  when i came round a little later i
found myself lying on my back with
my head in dianas lap and she bath-
ing my face with cold water sitting
on the tree trunk were the princess and
the professor conversing in low tones
i lay still listening and feeling none
too badly the professor got up and
seeing my eyes wide open nodded his
big head

  zo said he you are feeling bet-
ter good what a scandal you
have three bad knife wounds but not
dangerous especially to a man of your
physique what a business what a
scandal-

  there neednt be any scandal about
it i interrupted i can lie up for a
few days and give it out that ive got
appendicitis or a liver attack or any-
thing you say

  true said the professor no
scandal for the ladies sakes that is
why i let these people go what i told
them was rot of course but it seemed
best

  how did you happen to get here
i asked

  countess cardogan could no longer
contain her anxiety and told me what
had happened i took my gun and my
little dog rover which is part beagle
hound and has been taught to follow
a trail without yelping i put him on
the scent at the hole which this precious
young scoundrel dicky cut in my
fence and he tracked diana she having
been the last and also a great friend of
rover a nice chase she led me i
must say i arrived in the height of
the struggle

  was dicky hurt i asked

  no he met the attack of the serv-
ant with a kick in the hypogastric region
which rendered the fellow practically
hors de combat the knife flew out of
his hand and into the lake which was
lucky for him as otherwise he would

certainly have got a dose of his own
medicine as it was dicky had him
nearly throttled when i arrived the
brute was all but finished as for your
own affair that might have ended less
happily but for my timely arrival

  the princess alessandra leaned over
and shyly offered me her hand

  thank you for saving my life mr
tom said she in a singularly sweet
and liquid voice with a slightly foreign
accent

  i rejoice to have been of service
to your royal highness i answered
and raised her hand to my lips where-
upon for some reason diana appeared
to consider that my face no longer had
need of her kind attentions but she
did not shift my head from its most
agreeable resting place nor did i offer
to remove it

  when mr tom went over my head
i thought that a tiger had leaped from
the bushes said alessandra it is a
wonder that dimitri had a bone un-
broken but he is very strong

  he is a dangerous man growled
the professor you will have to be
very careful

  i am not afraid she answered
once i am married it is not probable
that he will continue to molest me

  i was not so sure about this but
made no remark personally i consid-
ered the professor to have done very
wrong in dismissing two very sincere
would-be assassins with his dutch bless-
ing i realized of course that nothing
would so delight the press as the trial
of such a case and that the fair fame
of all concerned in it would suffer a
good many hard knocks but all the
same it seemed a very poor procedure
to permit such a person as dimitri who
had taken all the trouble to come sev-
eral thousand miles for the express pur-
pose of murdering a pair of young and
ardent lovers to escape unpunished
and he promising a better job of it the
next time


the popular magazine

  the chances were i thought that
van rippen had been thinking a lot less
about the reputations of diana and al-
essandra than of his sanitarium he
had no desire for the particular sort of
advertising to be had from such an ex-
ploitation the old chap was not ava-
ricious nor in any sense a fake his
establishment was his pride and joy
no doubt the fulfillment of long-cher-
ished ideas and he did not want it
smirched he rejoiced in this garden
of paradise which he had created with
all of its adamless eves and no doubt
he had favored dickys scheme of a
lovely lake with a water line which
should be constant less for its com-
mercial possibilities than because he saw
that it was bound to enhance the beau-
ties of his reservation

  these ideas were milling around in
my head when diana leaned over and
asked

  how do you feel mr tom

  sleepy i told her and awfully
thirsty i think ill go down to the
lake and get a drink

  you shall drink nothing for the next
few hours said the professor it
would only make you bleed some more
when the vessels are secured yes
otherwise no many a wounded man
has been killed by being given water
too soon the blood you have lost
can do you no harm but you must
keep quiet

  realizing that my head must be get-
ting heavy i started to raise it but
diana laid her hand on my forehead
and pushed it gently back at that mo-
ment we heard the sound o oars and
presently dicky arrived with the skiff
i managed to get aboard without faint-
ing again though i came pretty near
it so we said good night to the ladies
and started for camp where dicky got
me up to the house and to bed with-
out disturbing anybody an hour or
so later the professor arrived- in his
buckboard bringing a good-sized bale

of dressings and proceeded with
dickys assistance to-sew up the crease
over my shoulder blade the other
two were stab wounds inflicted with
the point so he merely inserted drains
and strapped them snugly

  though not considering my condi-
tion dangerous the professor said that
i must resign myself tc at least a fort-
night of bed it did not matter par-
ticularly so far as loss of time was
concerned the engineering work being
suspended until our case should be de-
cided and such few hands as i had
kept on being engaged in cutting out
timber on the tract to be inundated
later and my gang boss was steady
and reliable i was supposed to have
an attack of appendicitis and to be un-
der the care of van rippen who un-
dertook to dress my wounds daily and
remove the dressings in his valise

  we shall try to make your captiv-
ity as pleasant as possible said he
miss maitland may come with me to
see you and as soon as i decide that
it is safe the princess also but-
he turned and shook his finger at
dicky-there are to be no more philan-
derings she has told me all about the
affair and appears determined to forego
her claims in order to marry you but
this cannot be managed until she comes
of age which will not be for nearly a
year

  i was too much used up to have it
out with dicky that night but i gave
him a bad quarter of an hour the next
morning at least i tried to though
dicky did not appear to be particularly
repentant

  what made you he to me i asked

  i didnt he protested i never
said that i was in love with diana i
said that i wanted to be near her which
was true because she helped me to see
alessandra

  then why couldnt you have said
 i demanded

  because i was afraid you wouldnt
dicky



let me stay here if you had thought
that i had come to carry on a love
affair with a royal princess that sort
of thing always sounds so shady my
wishing to see more of a nice american
girl id got to know in paris was dif-
ferent

  i fail to see the difference when
it comes to swimming through culverts
and cutting holes in fences i re-
marked crossly are you very much
in love with your princess

  an indescribable look swept across
dickys boyish face for the first time
i saw beyond that limpid juvenile ex-
pression of childish simplicity and got
a glimpse of the intense primitively
pagan nature beneath for an instant
he looked scarcely human vital pas-
sionate untamed as a faun or per-
haps it would express more accurately
the impression i got to say that in that
fleeting second he suggested a young
demigod caught in the flame of some
olympian supermortal impulse there
was something so hot so vital an in-
candescence that glowed up out of him
that i almost caught my breath then
suddenly the rich red blood suffused
his face and his eyes filled he turned
away his head

  i beg your pardon dicky i said
gently you see my boy i have never
really known you

  nobody has he replied in a low
voice nobody ever could i dont
know myself sometimes i think
theres no such person that im just
an idea or an element like fire or water
-or a mass of senses without any soul
and wrapped up in a perfect physical
machine i get horribly lonely i have
all my life put i never noticed it
particularly until i met her perhaps
she is my soul i know that my body
would die if i should lose her shes
the only one that ever understood me
inside the way birds and animals and
things like that have always done we
must have been in love with each other

before ever we met because we both
knew it the minute we laid eyes on each
other shes my life-all of my lives

- and he turned suddenly and

rushed out like some wild creature

  well here was a primordial passion
but ill contained in the person of what
i and others had fatuously taken to be
an immature child who would probably
never entirely grow up it was such
a love as poets and painters and philos-
ophers try so vainly to explain and
which perhaps musicians come nearest
to suggesting remotely a sort of an
ecstasy of soul which heavy mortal
senses serve rather to hamper than to
interpret a divine fire a glory of
vibrating delight-words are impossi-
ble how describe in speech something
of which one has only the vaguest ap-
preciation of the mere existence as
well try to describe the fourth dimen-
sion which possibly it occupies

  van rippen came in the afternoon
bringing diana with him he took my
temperature and reading it to his sat-
isfaction decided not to change the
dressings until the next day finding
me rather uncommunicative-brer di-
mitris cuts were giving me more pain
than i cared to admit-he said that i
might talk with diana for half an hour
while he smoked a cigar and drank a
bottle of steam beer and conversed with
dicky who was playing around the
boathouse with the kiddies precisely as
though nothing at all had happened to
upset anybody

  you are suffering arent you mr
tom asked diana drawing a wicker
chair to the side of my bed

  not now i told her

  she looked at me with a curious lit-
tle smile on her crooked mouth

  rip told me that if your bones and
muscles had not been so thick and
strong we might all have been slaugh-
tered said she

  rip is an old fraud i countered
you wouldnt have been slaughtered


the pcpuljcr magazine

at all dicky would have made that
pqir of thugs look like a canary bird
caught in an electric fan i know his
work hes as quick as a heliograph
and at the same time as cool as-i
hunted my mind for an apt simile-as
your father

  diana nodded perhaps dicky is
something of an unknown quantity
all the same im glad that you were
there mr tom and she leaned over
me and smiled that same peculiar
smile so is alessandra said she

  youve got it all wrong said i
it was my being there and rushing
down the bank that made dimitri think
hed- fallen into a trap otherwise he
would have let his servant finish dicky

and then- i stopped

  well said diana what then
oh almost anything since it did
not happen theres no use to bother
about it i mean that dimitri would
not have tried to kill the princess if i
hadnt come spilling ofif the top of the
bank he had it all fixed up for ste-
phan or imri or mohammet or what-
ever his name is to do the dirty work
but when he saw me boiling down he
thought it time to get busy

  he was right said diana and got
up and brought me a glass of orange
juice and soda she saw that my lips
and mouth were pretty dry dont
lets talk about it any more mr tom
doctors orders

  ah right but i should like to tell
you something that i learned this morn-
ing from dicky if you care to listen
tell me said diana

  so i told her just as i have tried to
describe it all i told her how i had
started to scold dicky and what he had
said and how it impressed me per-
haps i exaggerated diana did not lis-
ten very well what i said seemed
to upset her she got up and walked
around the room and then cams back
and stared at me

  do you think that love like that is
possible mr tom  she asked

  it might be i answered i dont
know

  but in your own case she insisted
can you imagine such love as that
could you possibly feel it

  i feel it every day for my kiddies
said i perhaps that may be the
strongest love of all

  diana turned and stared down at me
i dont think there is any perhaps
about it mr tom said she i wish
that i were one of your kiddies not
that i mean that i dont love my father
nofhe me but it must be nice to be
loved every minute-and close to that
love after all love is the greatest
thing in the world isnt it mr tom
dont you think it is  dont you think
that if there was enough love nothing
very bad could ever happen i must

go now- she looked through the

window here comes rip-and
dicky looking very penitent and naked
she wheeled about alessandra told
me to give you her love and a kiss
said she heres the kiss mr tom

  she dropped it on the top of my
head and went out

  unlike most lovers dicky said no
more to me about his state of heart
nor did he make any attempt to see
alessandra clandestinely he went fre-
quently to the sanitarium as the guest
of van rippen who now lent himself
actively to the scheme of the big reser-
voir we decided to give maitland the
chance of coming in though doubting
that he would be satisfied with the lim-
ited interest we proposed to offer him
it did not greatly matter though as
it was certain that with van rippens
opposition withdrawn and the prospec-
tus of the enterprise on such a grand
scale to which it was now augmented
nothing could hinder its progress my
own company would i felt sure be
quick to appreciate the advantage of the
dicky



new plans and lend it their support
especially as it did not necessitate the
finding of more capital on our part

  this not being the history of the
sierra funding and development com-
pany i will only say that matters pro-
ceeded satisfactorily enough the only
hitch being a certain cupidity displayed
on the part of the professor himself
which however by argument and con-
cessions on either side i managed to
control within reasonable limits mean-
while my own condition left nothing
to be desired which was to be expected
in such a climate and with a man of
my physique the days passed pleas-
antly and busily for there was a great
deal of correspondence

  diana came to see me almost every
day and needless to say i quickly re-
alized what a barren desert the rest of
my life was destined to be if obliged
to traverse it without her and yet i
shrank from letting her know the depth
of my feeling for her  i could not
help but see that she was beginning
really to care for me and seemed to
ask nothing better than to be with me
but i reflected that such attractions for
older men were not unusual in very
young girls it seemed to me wrong
to take advantage of it here was
diana barely eighteen and i a widower
turned forty and with two small chil-
dren it is true that she was devoted
to the kiddies and they to her while
i was a youthful man for my age like
all of my race younger i really be-
lieve than most men of thirty but
still that extra ten years was always
there to my debit and diana was pos-
sessed of such uncommon richness of
soul and heart and body and estate
too for that matter that she was en-
titled to the very best life had to offer
so i tried to possess my soul in as
much peace as possible and at least to
make no present attempt to win her
i should have felt unworthy and un-
dignified in doing so the mere fact

of her fortune did not enter into the
question as i was convinced that the
venture in which i had staked all i pos-
sessed could not help but reap a golden
reward

  therefore i masked my state of heart
under a direct and natural big-brother
manner quite free of all gallantry and
delicate attention or obvious attempts
to please her i spoke often of my
early married life and ambitions for
the children and referred to myself as
a man whose youthful dreams and aspi-
rations were things of the past this
seemed always rather to irritate diana

  why do you speak like that mr
tom said she one day drawing down
her pretty brows is it a pose or
what you know in your heart that
youll not be old for another thirty
years and probably not then you
havent a gray hair in your head nor
a line in your face except the lines of
character a strong man should have
and i dont believe you ever paid a dol-
lar to a dentist to hear you maunder
along one might think you had one foot
in the grave she examined me with
those limpid multicolored eyes which
i had already discovered held more
wisdom than her years entitled i
dont believe that you talk to other peo-
ple that way said she with her puz-
zling smile which was half tender half
mocking do i make you feel as old
as that  its not very complimentary
mr tom

  your own extreme youth is such a
violent comparison i explained

  diana nodded yes i havent been
born very long she admitted but im
not as young as you may think years
are as elastic as consciences or bubbles
or promissory notes they really stand
terrific strains

  until they burst i answered you
can never tell when that might hap-
pen

  fortunately diana agreed other-
wise it would seem hardly worth while


the popular magazine

to grow up we would all die when
we were babies and then think of all
that we should miss

  in happiness or unhappiness  i
asked

  both it must be better to have
been something than never to have been
anything otherwise there would be
nothing but a great empty space in noth-
ing fortunately there appears always
to be something in something like
rain in the clouds and sun in the sky

beyond and-

   and a nightingale in the forest and
hope in ones soul  i quoted translat-
ing the verse

  precisely said diana i am glad
to see that you are becoming vibrant
again mr tom the weight of years
has fallen from your shoulders and
so has your bandage let me put it
right you have very strong shoulders
for such an ancient man mr tom
please dont wriggle or i shall pin the
bandage into the outside of your earthly
envelope

  she secured the loose gear over my
shoulder then sat down on the luxuri-
ous divan of which the chassis was
canned-goods boxes and the upholster-
ing a mattress crammed with bay leaves
and covered by mohave blankets this
perfectly practical place of repose was
across the room and against the win-
dows which looked on the lake the
sun reflection striking in silhouetted
diana most wonderfully she looked
like a water nymph who had flitted in
to mock me gently and ask what i was
going to do about her doman

  she turned to the window there
is papa rip sitting under a tree with
his pipe watching dicky walk on his
hands for the edification of tommy and
juanita said she tommy is trying

it too -

  who is coming i interrupted for
i heard the rattle of a wagon

  she rested her elbows on the window

sill and looked out then sprang to her
feet

  its father she cried

  oh is it well run out and ask
him to come in

  diana hesitated i didnt know that
he was coming

  nor i sorry i cant do the honors
you might tell dicky to stop walking
on his hands and act for me

  all right mr tom said she and
went out

  i lay there in bed enjoying my
amusement over the situation mait-
land had been advised of what was
afoot and must have been pretty well
jarred by the situation which promised
to kill all of his projects for local de-
velopment of the country to be pene-
trated by his branch lines no doubt
he had come hotfoot from san fran-
cisco to learnmore definitely what was
doing and it struck me as decidedly
humorous that he should have happened
to arrive at a moment to see the prin-
cipal capitalizer of the scheme walking
along the beach on his hands for the
edification of two kids and a mongrel
coyote while the two persons who
shared the controlling interest were re-
spectively sitting on a canned-beef box
smoking a porcelain pipe and reclining
in a brass bedstead strewn with blue
prints and entertained during the inter-
vals of their examination by his own
daughter

  however nobody appeared to find
the position embarrassing in the least
there wrere a few brief moments of
conversation outside and then maitland
came in with his usual brisk manner
accompanied only by van rippen

  maitland was a handsome man with
an active well-knit figure and alert
clean-cut features his eyes were
gray very intelligent and observant
although never in any sense a popular
man he undoubtedly possessed an un-
usual amount of magnetism as he
seemed always to get what he went
vicky



after and to induce people to carry
out his wishes personally i had never
liked him from our school days sensing
in him always a cold determined self-
ishness which character backed by a
quick calculating brain had made him
a dangerous business enemy but i
had always felt that he might prove
even more selfish as a business asso-
ciate however although in hostile
positions to each other we had never
quarreled and our attitude was friendly
enough

  hello tom said he sorry to
find you laid up

  hello john i greeted him glad
to see you looking so fit yourself sit
down have a smoke have a drink

  thanks he answered but i just
finished a cigar and scarcely ever take
anything i just ran up from town to
have a little business talk with you he
turned to van rippen sure it cant
do him any harm doctor

  it will do him good the old man
put in

  well said maitland it looks as
if you had us on the go id never
counted on the professors drowning us
out he said this with no hint of ac-
rimony

  you should have thought of it when
you tried to smoke me out observed
van rippen referring to maitlands at-
tempt to run a branch line through his
reservation

  thats so maitland agreed its
a perfectly open game what i want
to know is where i come in on the
deal

  just as i stated in my letter i an-
swered

  he shook his head not good
enough he answered is that the
best you can do tom

   fraid it is john weve got too
much respect for your talents to give
you room to swing a sledge in

  you know i can knock you pretty
hard from the outside he observed

  it would be a waste of time and
money john i insisted you might
have hung up the first scheme indefi-
nitely as you know we hadnt much
money but weve got millions back of
us now

  he looked incredulous which was to
be expected as he knew that the prop-
osition was of very recent origin and
would naturally require some time to
finance not seeing that it could do the
slightest harm to convince him i said

  this is no bluff john you can
have the proof if you like i dont
mind telling you anything you want to
know besides what we had already
and the professors interest weve got
the sure promise of backing up to five
million pounds sterling

  whos the goat he asked

  the young gentleman whom you
may have observed half naked walking
on his hands as you drove up i an-
swered he is an intimate friend of
mine and has great faith in this scheme
the more so as it is all his own he
is a very intelligent engineer and he
not only saw the possibilities at a glance
but managed to convince professor van
rippen of them in about as quick a
time

  maitland glanced through the win-
dow and following his gaze we saw
dicky hanging from the limb of a tree
by his legs and swinging juanita to and
fro a one-ring circus whereof the
audience was composed of diana
tommy and the ever-aloof ki-yi

  where is his keeper maitland
asked

  here in bed at present i answered
he is playful but harmless entirely
sane and enormously rich if it would
induce you to draw in your horns and
not try to butt in on our little game i
can put you in possession of full in-
formation as to his resources the pro-
fessor and i are naturally supplied with
the data you have only to say the
word


the popular magazine

  maitland looked thoughtful he was
a keen judge of men and believed me
to be telling the truth besides he was
too keen a promoter and had too quick
a perception of big-business possibil-
ities not to see that we had a very mag-
nificent proposition by the tail i knew
that he had sunk a fortune in his new
and expensive branch line and hoped
to reap his harvest from local develop-
ments along its course if we were now
to parallel him with an electric system
which it would cost us practically noth-
ing to operate and an irrigation sys-
tem he was quick to see that he would
be left with a very pretty toy railroad
on his hands and nothing much to carry
on it his stock was already much di-
luted and the mere knowledge of what
we were up to getting about would
make his real-estate investments and
prospective town lots and other prop-
erty along the line look like a long
island pleasure beach on new years
day

  but i had  idea how hard he was
really hit until presently van rippen
got up and left saying that he was ex-
pecting some new guests by the four-
oclock train and must be getting back
he took diana with him as maitland
wtas to spend the night at the sanitarium
diana had a friend in the arriving
party whom she wished to welcome
when they were gone maitland lighted
a cigar and sat for a moment smok-
ing and looking through the open win-
dow

  would you consider an offer to sell
you my road tom he asked pres-
ently without looking around

  i wouldnt take your road as a gift
i said bluntly its about the worst
planned and expensively built and ruin-
ous to run of all the little lines that
i ever saw youve already had some
nasty slides and washouts and lost your
beautiful bridge i dont say that the
scheme might not have proved a good
one but for us plenty of possibilities

in the country itself and all that but
wait until you see the freight rates
that well be able to offer and the train
service and the little its going to cost
weve got-you stung john

  it looks that way he admitted
but what makes me sore is the way
ive been played for a sucker by this
infernal old dutchman i knew of
course that he wasnt all fat but i
thought i could count on him to play-
the game without fishing one out of his
sleeve

  you got his dutch dander up when
you tried to shove your branch line
through the sanitarium grounds i told
him

  that was as much to his interest
as mine said maitland but he
couldnt be made to see it in that light
so i tried to run over him to our joint
profit how was i to know that he
was so stuck on his cussed old pre-
serve 

  you should have stopped to think
i retorted just as a man ought to
remember that he has jammed a rock
under the front wheel of his car before
he tries to start

  i guess thats right maitland
agreed to tell the truth i gave in
to the controlling interest he stood out
for because this first funding scheme
of yours had been talked about already
and i thought he would be a good use-
ful block so he was too until he
saw the chance of springing a new one
its like a game of chess the old coot
is chucking his interest in my little road
because he sees the chance of getting
it all back and more besides on this
new proposition he has swapped his
knight for a bishop on the chance of
a checkmate

  well i countered isnt that play-
ing the game 

  yes said maitland i cant kick
about that what jars my liver is get-
ting beaten at my own game
vicky



  that might do your system a lot of
good i suggested

  it wont though said he any more
than it will do yours good when you
find that youve been flimflammed by
this old duck of course i dont know
how you stand relatively in the deal
but im quite willing to bet you a thou-
sand dollars that when it comes to the
show-down youll find that youve been
done if hed double cross me he will
do the same for you if he gets a chance
and you bet it wont take him long to
find the chance if he cant find one
hell make one

 such a possibility as this had already
occurred to me i had never been a
brilliant business man though always
able to see opportunities in connection
with my technical work for the finan-
cial end of it however it would not
have taken a morgan or a harriman
or a hill to have outwitted me at this
moment i was not altogether pleased
with van rippens attitude nor did i
have any overwhelming confidence in
his good faith but in answer to mait-
lands remarks i merely said

  oh well ill have to take a chance
on that i suppose ill try to get things
nailed down so that nobody can lift
out any planks

  maitland appeared to reflect for a
moment sitting on the edge of the
window seat and swinging one leg

  see here tom said he why not
take over our road it would be useful
in your construction work and later on
you could change the power to elec-
tricity it neednt interfere with your
building another of your own to open
up the country to the south you
can have the road for a song and pay
for it in stock

  but i dont want your road at any
price john i answered i dont con-
sider it a good road i consider it
badly planned and worse constructed
if you had given me the job when i
applied for it and let me build it my-
ap

self id feel differently about it as
the case stands id no more think of
buying it than i would a jerry-built
house or a rotten ship or a salted mine
in my professional opinion its a bum
property

  oh not quite as bad as all that
he said rather lifelessly ill admit
though youve got it in your power to
kick the props from under it once
this new project of yours is announced
nobody would touch it with a ten-foot
pole it will be worth about as much
as an ice plant at the north pole

  he talked a little while longer but
finding me inflexible said good night
and drove lck to the sanitarium there
as i presumed to get to work on van
rippen but i had no fear of his ac-
complishing anything in that direction
the professor disliked maitland and
distrusted him with good reason from
what he had told me maitland had
tried to serve van rippen just as van
rippen now proposed to serve mait-
land and other interests aside i felt
confident that the old dutchmans set
and obstinate nature would effectually
bar even the consideration of any of
maitlands suggestions

  i cannot say that it gave me any sat-
isfaction to turn maitland down so hard
and the prospect of costing him a con-
siderable fortune was rather painful
i was never revengeful and the fact
of his being dianas father would have
been enough to make me let him in on
a good basis if there had not been the
interests of others at stake as well as
my own as it was there seemed no
other course to take he had got no
doubt the answer he really expected
and i doubted that he would try to
make us any more bother he was not
vindictive but merely a cold-blooded
business man

  consequently i was rather surprised
when the next morning at about ten
he drove up again he looked rather
badly i thought and like a man who


the votpulacr magazine

had not slept and his manner was
nervous and ill at ease but with his
usual businesslike directness he went
straight at the point

  look here tom said he standing
by the foot of my bed and with his
keen observant eyes fastened on my
face are you in love with my daugh-
ter diana

 i stared at him for a moment in

silence then- yes i answered

  oh you are are you  he snapped
and began to pace up and down well
what do you expect to do about it 
nothing i answered

  he shot me a look of quick surprise
eh what

 nothing she is too young and
lovely a girl to throw herself away on
a widower of forty with a pair of chil-
dren i dont think that it would be
right for her to marry me even in the
very improbable event of her being able
to care for me

 hmph he grunted i guess
there wouldnt be much trouble about
that

  what makes you think so  i asked
because shes in love with you al-
ready said he she told me so
naturally she hardly expected me to
tell you but i dont think it would
bother her much if she knew i had
how did she happen to tell you

i asked trying to keep my voice steady
and natural and to control the thump-
ing of my heart

  i wanted to take her away from the
sanitarium to send her back east the
old man and i had rather a warm ses-
sion last night and after certain things
which were said i decided to quit the
ring for the present when i told
diana to get her things packed she told
me that she would rather stay where
she was naturally i was a bit sur-
prised seeing as she came out here to
be near me you see weve always
been good chums more like brother
and sister than father and daughter

so when id explained that my business
was finished and found her still de-
termined to stay on i began to have
suspicions then i thought of this
young dicky person and it suddenly
occurred to me that he might be the
chap who had been hanging around her
in paris so i asked her point-blank if
shed gone and fallen in love with some-
body out here im afraid i have
says she diana is a peculiar girl in
some ways i was never in love be-
fore says she so i cant be sure but
one thing is certain and that is that i
dont want to go east just yet  he
looked at me with a peculiar expres-
sion

  go on said i what then
well i asked her why she hadnt
told me about it and she said i didnt
think there was any hurry about it
especially as he has never said that he
cared for me though ive got an idea
that he does care and cares a lot but
has a silly notion that just because hes
so much older and has two children
its not to be thought of good lord
i said you dont mean to tell me its
tom yes she answered with that
twisted little smile of hers its tom 
god bless her heart i almost cried
raising up on my pillows then sank
back again but its no use john
take my word you neednt add that
to your list of worries shes too sweet
and lovely a girl for an old cove like
me tell her so if you like and take
her back east with you

  maitland did not answer but stood
there studying me with a curious in-
tentness of expression that i found
rather annoying

  well i demanded irritably dont
you believe me

  yes he answered i believe you
i know your sort how did it happen
anyhow 

  oh i said rather crossly van
rippen brought her with him one day
and she seemed to like us all and enjoy
tflcky



 seeing dicky perform and playing with
 the kids then since ive been laid up
 shes come with him almost every day
 and stopped a while to talk to me while
 dicky and the old man went over maps
 and things i never so much as
 squeezed her hand but we seemed to
 understand each other pretty well from
 the first such things happen some-
 times i suppose though not often
 where theres such disparity of age
 still as you say diana is an uncommon
 girl and her mind is very mature for
 her age however shell soon forget
 about me once she gets away what
 are you staring at me that way for
 as if i were a sea serpent or some-
 thing i demanded resentfully

   i beg your pardon said maitland
quietly and glanced away i think
you must be pretty hard hit old chap
 fraid i am i answered and the
more fool i considering my age and
condition

   oh i dont know said maitland
reflectively you and i are the same
age both widowers and i have a
grown-up daughter but that wouldnt
prevent my marrying an eighteen-year-
okl girl like diana if i happened to fall
in love with her and she with me a
man of forty is apt to make a darn
sight better husband than one of
twenty-four

  i looked at him in astonishment
pleavens and earth man youre not
in favoy of it are you 

   why not he said wearily ive
got dianas happiness at heart and a
lot of respect for you as a man and
no end of confidence in your future
success he rested his elbows on the
foot rail of the bed and stared at me
thoughtfully did you know that
diana inherited a million from her
mothers estate lie asked

   yes but of course that hadnt any-
 thing to do with it she might have
 two million or two cents for all id
 care

  well said maitland dryly and i
noticed that his face had whitened a
little she hasnt got even the two cents
now

  i stared at him uncomprehendingly
wrhat do you mean i asked

  just that he answered dianas
fortune is all sunk in that railroad
scheme of mine his mouth tight-
ened

  but how did you have the right
i demanded

  i didnt that is not the legal right
i considered at the time that i had the
moral right first because the money
was of my making and got through
my manipulation of a busted concern
that million and a lot besides in the
second place i considered the railroad
proposition as such a dead-sure thing
that i felt justified in using dianas for-
tune to slam it through but the law
would call it the misplacement of trust
funds and invite me for a nice long
visit at an institution which has not the
luxury of van rippens that may
happen yet

  but great jupiter i gasped
havent you millions of your own

  i havent a million cents maitland
answered and im mortgaged up to
the ears diana is not the only victim
there are other members of the family
who are apt to want an accounting
within a few months for the last sev-
eral years they have been quite well
satisfied with their-dividends but two
of my nieces by marriage are due to
be married in the spring and then there
has got to be a show-down id hoped
to have everything in apple-pie order
by that time but now that you have
gone and dumped the apple cart there
is apt to be a corner in apples he
gave his short little laugh

  and then what i asked

  no pie he answered and then
with a significant gesture this for
mine stripes were never becoming to


the cpocpulacr magazine

me id rather be measured for a suit
of pine planks but get it straight
tom im not telling you this sad
story of my business career in the hope
of softening your heart ive heard
em too many times from other people
and they never softened mine a fel-
low ought to play the game without
turning on water power when it comes
time to cash in lets cut out my part
of it and talk about diana she thinks
that shes in love with you and theres
no question about your being in love
with her and im convinced that you
would make hera darn good husband
so go ahead and dont be foolish you
are bound to make trainloads of money
out of this thing if you keep your eye
on the ball and dont let somebody steal
your bone while you are half asleep

  does diana know about this john
i asked

  no-nor anybody else but you the
others will find out soon enough but
between you and me and this brass bed-
post i dont give a darn about the
others they took me into the family
under protest and treated me like a
poor relation at first then when they
discovered that i could make money
they began to get polite i made a lot
for them-scads ofit-and it was well
done thou good and faithful servant
and a pat on the head i never minded
much it was the game that interested
me not the people and not having any
money of my own i played it with
their stakes thats a perfectly all right
game when you win but a rotten one
when you lose

  most games are like that john
said i

  yes-especially when playing with
other peoples money even when they
do give you a verbal carte blanche
there are worse places than the poor-
house but to get back to diana the
thought of her future has been the
toughest thing for me in this business
granted that shes uncommonly pretty

and talented and all the rest of it just
the same life doesnt offer much for
the eighteen-year-old daughter of a
busted embezzler the family would
be the first to knock her and i have
no real friends myself never did have
to my knowledge the men ive helped
to make fortunes know that i never
did it out of love he gave a bitter
little laugh i know of one bunch
that will probably hold a praise service
when it learns that im down and out
so you see tom you neednt hang back
about marrying my daughter on her
account

  he walked to the window and stood
for a moment looking out across the
little lake while i lay there with my
mind in a whirl somehow it never
occured to me to blame maitland for
his illegal actions in my association
with promoting schemes i had known
of a good many such cases and under-
stood that often they had their miti-
gating circumstances a man who has
built up a big fortune out of trust
funds is often apt to regard himself
as privileged to use the capital as if
it were his own its not so much the
money that he wants as the use of it
to further his schemes and it is only
when the crash comes that he wakes
up to the fact that he is a thief in the
eyes of the law

  so here we were this former busi-
ness enemy of mine and myself at the
two extremities of fortune maitland
facing ruin disgrace and death-for
i had little doubt he would fulfill his
threat of suicide rather than go to
prison-and i with the only obstacle
to the promise of great wealth removed
and free to woo and win the girl i
loved and yet i was not conscious
of any wild elation the sight of
maitlands drawn tired face and his
quiet manly acceptance of the situa-
tion aroused in me a sympathy which
i would not have felt if he had come
whining and whimpering and begging
dicky



me to help him out for his daughters
sake

  look here john i said what can
i do to help you out of this mess 

  nothing he answered promptly
if you were to take over my road and
marry my daughter it would be dis-
honest to your other shareholders and
give you a black eye that would never
clear up besides van rippen wouldnt
stand for it as you say the road is no
good to you nor anybody else with your
proposition in sight youve got a bully
scheme tom i went down and looked
at your site for a dam therell be
some caisson work but nothing enor-
mous and with that five-hundred-foot
drop into the gorge for your flume you
will have power to burn no theres
nothing you can do old man thanks
all the same well i must be getting
along im starting east  to-morrow
on a sort of forlorn hope and i shall
leave diana at the sanitarium we
wont say anything to her about this
talk no use to bother her until the
bell rings and i hope that by that time
shell have your strong arm to hold her
up good-by and good luck-

  so out he went leaving me in a reg-
ular whirlpool of conflicting ideas for
about an hour i lay there scarcely
budging while my brain studied on the
situation but it was no use there
was no way that i could think of for
tiding maitland over his crisis he was
too deeply in the mire as he said i
couldnt sacrifice the interests confided
in me simply to save my prospective
wifes father from destruction i
couldnt and what was more i
wouldnt if i could

  my prospective wife that set
off another alarm clock it was lucky
for me my wounds were about healed
or id have probably been down with
fever then dicky came in lightly
clad as was his wont to ask ifi needed
anything i did i needed s counselor
and knowing that dicky would be an

absolutely safe confidant and failing to
see how it could do the slightest pos-
sible harm i told him the whole story
all about myself and diana and mait-
lands predicament the whole business
he listened without a word looking
out the window and at times scarcely
appearing to have his mind on what
i was saying

  when i had finished he looked
around with his boyish expression of
mild interest

  well youre to be congratulated
tom said he dianas a peach

  is that all you can say i asked
impatiently do you think its a cheer-
ful thing to marry the girl you love
over her fathers dead body

  i wish i could marry the one i
love over the dead bodies of her whole
blooming family said he

  oh go to the devil i snapped dis-
gustedly this is different diana is
really devoted to her father besides
shes a proud girl and the disgrace will
break her heart she thinks like every-
body else that hes a financial genius
and a multimillionaire think of what
it will do to her when she learns that
hes a common garden variety of
everyday embezzler

  pretty tough dicky admitted as
though commenting on the breaking of
a favorite meerschaum you had bet-
ter get married before that happens

  i dont know yet that shell marry
me when it comes right down to brass
tacks

  then ask her and find out he sug-
gested and began to look for a thorn
in his knee

  youre a darn fine spiritual ad-
viser i sneered supposing she does
consent and we get married its going
to be a cheerful honeymoon for me
waiting every day to hear that my
brides father has blown his brains out
and not knowing how she may be af-
fected by the news i tell you she loves
her father


the ovular magazine

  dicky found the thorn extracted it
examined it with interest and flicked
it away

  what do you want me to do he
asked lend him a couple of mil-
lions 

  i want you to go to halifax i
said really angry why should you
lend him a couple of millions hes
got no claim on you i only told you
this because you have your flashes of
human intelligence at rare intervals and
i thought you might have something to
suggest if you havent clear out of
here and go hang by your legs or stand
on your head and leave me to try to
dope out the business the best i can

 dicky looked at me pityingly
youre getting peevish from lying so
long in bed he observed old rip
says you can sit up to-morrow dont
fret about maitland tom hes a
pretty slick article and i guess hell be
able to wriggle out of it somehow

  thank you so much for your kind
words of comfort and cheer i growled
and picked up a letter from the sheaf
which had been brought me just before
maitlands arrival i was pretty sore
with dicky a couple of weeks earlier
i should never have thought of taking
him into my confidence at all consid-
ering him as i did a mere undeveloped
irresponsible child but after that
glimpse which id got at his deeper na-
ture i felt that i had a right to expect
better things in the way of interest and
sympathy

  he sat there for a few minutes tap-
ping his sandaled feet on the floor and
humming a little tune then slipped off
the window seat and going to the cen-
ter table helped himself to a handful of
sugared almonds which he carried back
to the divan and proceeded to munch
i had never seen him eat what one
might call an actual meal but he was
always chewing at something between-
times-fruit or cakes or nuts or candy
with which he took care to keep the

place supplied feeding them also to the
kiddies in spite of my injunctions to
the contrary it may have affected
their appetites though if it did they
gave no symptoms of it pretty soon
a flutter of wings around the window
sill announced that the birds had dis-
covered dicky and his treasure-trove
and were demanding a hand-out their
pipings and his crunchings interfered
with my perusal of a very important
mail and i was about to tell him to
clear out when he swung round and
said

  im going to town for a couple of
days tom got to see the correspond-
ents of my bankers besides ive got
to buy some clothes

  far be it from me to interfere with
the latter errand i said when are
you going

  this afternoon anything i can do
for you while i am there

  if it had been any one but dicky i
could have given him a staggering bur-
den of commissions as it was i an-
swered 

  why yes you might look up mait-
land to-night at the palace and ask him
for a special permit for a special at any
time that we might care to look over
his line i never thought about it when
he was here

  all right said dicky ill remem-
ber

  so off he went to town where in-
stead of two days he spent two weeks
van rippen and i were of course up
to the ears in work but i saw diana
almost every day maitland had told
him that i had asked his permission
to marry her if she would have me
and that he had given it the profes-
sor informed me of this fact in a man-
ner none too flattering

  perhaps he thinks that as your
father-in-law you might manage to get
him a slice in our affair said the old
fellow or maybe he did not believe
that she would accept you at any
vicky



rate he knows that you will be rich

one of these days

  but in spite of the open road which
now lay before me my manner toward
diana underwent no change except
perhaps for a little added tenderness
which i could not help knowing the
sorrow which menaced her life her
very joyousness cut me deeply some-
times gave me what the french call
le cocitr gros often as i listened to
her gay bantering talk and rippling
laughter i could feel my heart swell
and a hot sensation about the eyes and
i would have to turn away quickly and
pretend to busy myself about some
thing in order to pull myself together
but i did not make love to her in any
sense i wished to wait a little first
in order to give her time to get over
what might have been a mere transient
romantic attraction and second to clinch
the promise of our big scheme as any-
thing which might have arisen to thwart
it would have meant financial ruin and
a fresh start for me i knew that i
had still some months of leeway where
maitlands affairs were concerned and
i was hoping against hope that dickys
suggestion that maitland might yet find
some way out of his troubles would
come about

  my wounds were soon entirely healed
and gave me no trouble whatever of
course i wxas constantly in and about
the sanitarium and occasionally had a
few words with alessandra whom the
professor kept very close she was cer-
tainly a very lovely and charming girl
and i did not wonder at dickys con-
suming passion for her

  some peculiar change appeared to
have been wrought in dicky by his trip
to town he was less communicative
than ever and thoughtful and preoc-
cupied very then one day he an-
nounced that it would be necessary for
him to go east and that he might be
away for a couple of months but could
not be sure his former guardian was

going to be in new york and he had a
good many affairs which required his
attention so off he went handsomely
dressed in the suit with which he had
supplemented his wardrobe while in
town and for some few days follow-
ing he was sorely missed by tommy and
juanita and ki-yi and old manuela and
a few others at the camp sundry birds
and chipmunks and pigeons and things
included

  so far as our work was concerned
i did not consider the lack of dicky
any great loss and thought it far bet-
ter that he should occupy himself in
making sure that there be no hitch in
the money supply in case of accident
it was dicky of course who had struck
on our present scheme and done most
to make it realizable but i was inclined
to regard his suggestion for the dam
as more of a lucky shot than anything
else and his conquest of old van rip-
pen as the affinity between two imprac-
tical cranks his wealth seemed to
be another fortunate accident and as
i saw it our whole position was one
evolved of singular luck and circum-
stance i had absolutely no respect
whatever for dicky as a promoter en-
gineer financier or person of any depth
of thought-though willing to concede
him plenty of depth of feeling of a
jdrimitive or pagan sort i doubted that
this feeling could possibly extend be-
yond the limits of his own desires any
more than could that of any other pa-
gan

  something of this i told diana but
she was not of my opinion

  nobody could love like dicky and
not have a tremendous lot of soul said
she thats what soul means love
is soul mind is different

  dont you think they go together
i asked

  they ought to she answered but
it doesnt always happen sometimes
ones mind is developed at the cost of


the vovulatr magazine

soul-she gave me a mischievous side-
long look-just as it may be developed
at the cost of common sense ske
added old rip says you have an
excellent mind mr tom

  indeed i exclaimed that is
very amiable of him and what should
you say it was developed at the cost
of in this case

  she gave me a demure look and said
with that little smile which pushed out
her delicate upper lip so charmingly
certainly not soul mr tom

  this was sunday afternoon and we
had gone for a stroll around the lake
and were now sitting on the same tree
trunk which had been the scene of our
scrimmage with dimitri and his hench-
man van rippen had followed with
the kiddies the trio having struck up a
most intimate friendship and they had
now wandered off into the woods for
an ambling lesson in natural history
not according to the dicky school but
more academic and usually of a botani-
cal character it was one of those lam-
bent days when the air seems highly
charged with all the ingredients of life
so thin and fine and solvent as to have
absorbed the forces of gravity them-
selves and one moves about with no
slightest sense of weight it would not
have surprised me greatly to discover
that our footsteps were leaving no
traces in the sand

  diana however appeared to have
materialized in these latter days and
become more of the mortal maid her
costumes also were less unconventional
and she wore shoes and stockings when
she left the sacred precincts of the sani-
tarium instead of sandals and bare
ankles but she was always lithe and
supple and swaying with her exquisite
figure free and unconfined except for
a high girdle usually a band of pale
green which was her favorite color
the green of very early foliage i have
not attempted to describe her face as
that would be impossible but its ex-

pression suggested that of a thoughtful
grown-up little girl there was a cer-
tain wisdom in her long eyes which
were of a pale slaty gray with a curi-
ous amber tone in certain lights un-
like most girls faces the telltale qual-
ity was not in the eyes but in the lines
about her rather wide but sensitive
mouth which was mobile in the ex-
treme with usually a quiver near its
corners and never set in lines of prim
control altogether it was a sensuous
face and like ail the rest of her seemed
constantly to thrill and vibrate under
the perception of a multitude of im-
pulses whether from within or with-
out

  looking at her now i turned coward
again it was inconceivable to my
mind that so lovely and wonderfully
fashioned a masterpiece of gods handi-
work should be given over to the ten-
der mercies of such an animated lump
of clay as myself because i could
not help but feel that if diana were
mine she was bound to be very much
mine a very tremendously total quan-
tity of mine to me i could not im-
agine myself in the light of a self-ob-
literating protective genius worshiping
from an adoring distance and crawling
into her sacred presence on all fours
after a course of fasting and prayer
no once diana was married to me
i knew that she would find herself mar-
ried from the bottom of her spiritual
body to the top of her physical one and
i wondered how much of this she could
possibly realize

  such ideas as these were milling
around my cemented depths under a
surface current of trivial talk whereof
the topic was dicky when diana with
one of those swift impulses which were
like an overcharged induction circuit
observed

  i know what you are thinking about
mr tom

  of course you do i answered so
do i f
dicky



 do you want me to tell you she
asked and leaned toward me

  no ill tell you myself-when the
time comes

  in that case i shall tell you now
said she it is always better to take
time by the scythe dont you see
mr tom that father time is our very
best friend and for that single reason
might be our very worst enemy lets
take away his scythe without his
scythe he would be nothing but a harm-
less old bore just as cupid without his
bow and arrows would be a harmless
little love of a baby she raised her
chin and her mouth laughed and the
amber gleam came into her eyes there
was no fly in that amber

  you might disarm cupid first i
suggested

  too late said diana and shook
her head sadly his shaft is sped
i love you mr tom

  i love you diana i echoed

  i know you do said she if i
hadnt i would not have said it first
i might have though will you marry
me mr tom she dropped her
hands on my shoulders and turning
on the log stared into my eyes i took
her hands and holding her at arms
length stared back

  are you sure diana i asked

  she threw back her head and laughed
some birds in the treetops answered
i did not feel like laughing myself the
chances are that if my race had been
latin instead of norse i might have
wept

  sure about your love for me she
answered of course i am mr tom
be still let me have my say i can
feel love just as i can smell flowers
or hear music if i had not been sure
do you think you silly mr tom that
i would have proposed to you in this
shameless way i know what you feel
before you do be still mr tom-
and dont squeeze my wrists so hard

-thats better hold them if you like
but dont hurt me i could feel you
loving me that first day when old rip
and i were watching dicky play with
the wild pigeons-and you were looking
out through the window something
began to sing in my heart and i stood
there and let it sing without looking
round i have felt it before but never
the same way-without discords and-
bad sounds i want to be loved that
way mr tom i have always wanted
to be loved that way-every woman
does-but no one so much as-as i
do-

  diana i interrupted of course
i love you and of course you being
you you couldnt help but know it

  all the time you were there in bed
and talking to me it poured out of you
like water over one of your dams-

  but thats not the question i in-
terrupted again are you sure of your
love for me stop and think-or dont
think let me do the thinking for you
do you realize-

  i realize you you seem very real
to me mr tom-

  the shadows were screening the
lights in the lake when we walked back
to the camp where we found van rip-
pen having tea with the kiddies he
turned his back on us when we came
in and devoted himself to juanita who
was sleepy and spilling her chocolate
one might have thought that he dared
not look at us for fear of being struck
blind nor had he anything to say
but climbed into his buckboard when
it was brought from the stable and left
me to help diana in as best i could
with his restive little broncho backing
and filling and threatening to capsize
the contraption they drove off and
i stood watching them and wondering
why so fat and phlegmatic a person as
van rippen liked to drive half-trained
horses then i started after them
afoot merely to satisfy my mind that


the pocpulpr magazine

they had arrived at the sanitarium with-
out accident

 van rippen came over the next
morning at about ten with a large port-
folio of correspondence which required
our joint attention for a couple of
hours just as he was leaving he
handed me an envelope

  diana asked me to give you this
said he the state engineer is com-
ing to-morrow and i shall expect you
for dejeuner at twelve good-by and
he spun off down the trail

  i ripped open the envelope and this
is what i read

  mr tom you are a silly old fool and i
am a silly young fool they say that there
is no fool like an old fool but sophistries
are the excuses of lazy minds old fools
usually know pretty well what they are
about

  this is a polite way of saying that i regret
what happened yesterday and of having for
some weeks past cajoled you so shame-
lessly but it was really pretty dull here
for an eighteen-year-old girl who is a flirt
by nature and accustomed to a great deal of
masculine attention you see you were the
only man available and i wanted to keep
my hand in as to the ethics of my be-
havior you must remember that i am my
fathers - own daughter

  please spare me the unpleasantness of re-
proaches and dont try to see me again i
am leaving for the east to-morrow a man
of your age and experience ought not to be
so easily taken in let us hope that the
experience may prove of value to you with
best wishes for your future success

diana maitland

  i read this letter through a second
time and smiled sadly to myself not
for the fraction of a second did it de-
ceive me poor girl i thought she
must have learned by her evenings mail
of her fathers ruin and disgrace and
the blow to her faith and affection and
pride had for the moment upset her
mental balance for her to reflect on
the avowal which she had made to me
and asking me to marry her and she
at that very moment the penniless
daughter of a defaulter was more than

she could stand her heart was no
doubt bursting with shame and she
assumed to herself the dishonor of her
fathers act that phrase-you must
remember that i am my fathers own
daughter-betrayed her of course
she could not guess that i knew all
about maitlands position and she had
sent me this bitter mocking -note as
the quickest and most efficient way of
breaking our new relations

  i hurried to the stables threw a sad-
dle on my mare and a moment later
was loping along the trail for the sani-
tarium to the precincts of which i was
now admitted at any time without ques-
tion tossing the reins to a servant
i walked around the house to the broad
tiled terrace on which dianas apart-
ment opened i did not bother to have
myself announced knowing that she
would decline to see me it was then
the luncheon hour for the guests and
there was nobody about but i did not
believe that diana would be in the big
refectory my judgment proved to be
correct for as i stepped up to the long
french blinds of her door i heard from
within the sound of sobbing i drew
the butt of my riding crop down the
slanting shutters and the sobbing
ceased

  who is there came a low stran-
gling voice please go away i am
ill and do not wish to see anybody
its i-tom i srtswered open

the blinds dear

  i

  there came a gasp a rustle as though

she were suddenly rising then- 

  oh-its you may i ask you to be
so kind as to leave me alone wasnt
my note enough for you

  open the blinds i commanded
how dare you come to my room like
this she cried if you dont go
away at once i shall ring for the serv-
ants do you want to compromise me
or have you merely come to strangle

  my answer was to shove my riding
dicky



crop into the slight opening between
the door blinds knock up the hook and
fling the blinds open in the sudden
light which flooded the place i saw
diana sitting on the side of her bed
in a kimono her hair was disordered
and her face flushed and wet with tears
she sprang to her feet

  are you crazy she demanded fu-
riously and took a step toward me her
small hands clenched what do you
mean bursting into my room-

  sh-h-hl i whispered no need
to make a row when did you learn
about your father

  the question struck her like a blow
one hand flew up to her throat and
she stared at me wildly

 what do you know about my
father she demanded

  i know all about him more than
you do i imagine he told me him-
self he is not so much to blame as
you may think what he did was done
in all sincerity for the best interest of
those whose affairs he had been man-
aging cant you give him the benefit
of the doubt and did you think for
a moment that i was such a fool as
to be deceived by your silly note  come
here come here to me-or must i go
to you

  she stood there staring and choking
come i said sternly but in a low
voice for an instant she struggled to
resist the force of will which i was
projecting toward her then writh
wide frightened eyes and lagging steps
she began to move in my direction
come i repeated holding out my
arms she paused raised both lrnnds
in a protesting gesture but like a per-
son in a trance continued to approach
almost to me she tottered swayed for-
ward and flung herself upon my chest
where i held her close her pliant body
crushed in my clasp i kissed her hair
and eyes soothed her petted her as i
might have caressed and comforted my
own baby daughter she did not try to

speak but rested there breathing con-
vulsively her bare arms twined about
my neck

  i do not know how long we remained
in this close embrace but presently she
grew calmer and loosed herself gently
her hands dropped on my shoulders
and she held me at arms length look-
ing into my eyes

  oh mr tom she whispered isnt
it terrible and to think that you
knew why didnt you tell me  why
couldnt you have prepared me in some
way

  because i have been hoping against
hope that there might be some way out
of the business i answered how
did you learn

  a letter from an aunt some of
them grew uneasy and they have been
investigating fathers affairs he may
have to go to prison oh they are all
so bitter-so cruel i would rather
have learned that he had been killed
i must go to him at once poor poor
father i know he did not mean to
be dishonest i must go to him and
tell him so i am leaving to-night
then ill go with you i said

  but how can you

  i can and will thats all whats
more if you feel that you really must
go you shall go as my wife

  she shook her head that is not to
be thought of any longer mr tom
not much longer said i just
long enough to get the knot tied tied
good and hard too my darling

  she shook her drooping head and i
took her in my arms again at the
same moment there came a sharp rap
at the door diana sprang back
who is there she called

  a telegram for you miss maitland
came a womans voice

  i stepped out upon the terrace and
drew the blind in front of me diana
crossed the room took the telegram
from the maid then closed and locked
her door she came to the window the


the cpocpular magazine

message in her hand her face as white
as chalk my own could not have held
much more color as i fully expected
the wire to announce maitlands death
not stopping to reflect that such ill tid-
ings would probably have been ad-
dressed to the professor diana -held
out the telegram with a trembling hand

  see what it says mr tom she
faltered and leaned against the window
casement i ripped it open glanced it
through then looked at her with a smile
and the sweat breaking out on my fore-
head

  good news i said and stepping
inside i put my arm around her shoul-
ders and drew her to me as i read

  dont be disturbed by rumors or letters of
bad news matters clearing up and nothing
to fear best love	father

 thank god i murmured and
kissed her bright hair as her head fell
on my shoulder she twisted about
slipped her arms about my neck and
crushed her wet face against mine

  i adore you mr tom she whis-
pered you do love me dont you

  back i rode to camp feeling rather
limp but with a singing heart it had
turned hot again and i was sitting at
my desk busily filling my waste-paper
basket with torn-up unfinished letters
when there came the rattle of a loose-
jointed trap-all of this was before the
time of motor cars-and i looked out
and saw dicky disentangling a wad of
bills to present one to the driver he
gathered his loose clothes under one
arm and came in

  hello tom said he everything
all right how are the kids

 fine and dandy i answered
why didnt you let me know that
you were coming

  oh i thought id go straight
through to frisco but it was so hot on
the train i decided to get off and have
a swim besides i wanted to relieve
your mind about maitland

  that was kind of you i said gather
ironically when did you see mait-
land

  in new york dicky was divest-
ing himself of his negligee shirt and
trousers refreshingly costumed in
abbreviated underclothes he seated
himself on the divan and looked at
me with a grin ive bought his
blooming railroad said he

 you have-excuse me-what i
exclaimed

  fve bought his road he slipped
off the window seat and going to the
fruit basket which the chinaman had
brought in with his other scant effects
selected a luscious peach in which he
proceeded to bathe-

  that is very interesting i observed
tell me about it

  well said dicky his mouth full
of peach whent went to frisco that
last time i looked up maitland and
asked him to show me his property
he didnt seem to think it worth while
at first but i told him that if i could
see my way clear to buy it without too
great a loss there might be something
doing he asked me why i wanted
to buy it at all and i told him that it
was on your account

  why on my account i asked
because he is dianas father of
course and you want to marry diana
he answered you explained all that
no use going all over it again but
from what i had heard about the prop-
erty i got sort of an idea that it might
be just my business so it was too as

it turned out-

  wait a minute i interrupted tell
me why his being dianas father and
my wanting to marry diana should
have made you consider the purchase
of an absolutely worthless property and
one which your interests here were
bound to push even deeper into the
soup

  dicky threw away what was left of
his peach he turned his square boy-
dicky



ish face toward me and i caught an-
other of those flashes which were like
the flame from a short-circuited high-
tension wire just for a second though

   you saved alessandras life he ex-
plained

  i said nothing dicky looked out
across the lake and continued talking
his voice sounded strained for a mo-
ment or two but soon returned to its
usual boyish tone

  i told maitland that i thought his
road was punk from all id heard about
it said he but that if i could see
the possibilities for a scheme i had in
mind i might buy it first on your ac-
count as ive said-

  what did he say about that i
asked

  oh-he wanted to know where you
came in and i told him that you wrere
in love with his daughter and would
like to feel that you hadnt busted up
her fathers pet scheme and that i felt
that i owed you a lot for certain things
that you had done for me he didnt
seem to take much stock in all that but
he changed his mind and stopped over
to take me out to see the property it
turned out to be just what i wanted
and when i had told him why he was
like a kid with a new toy

  what was the why if its not a
secret 

  it might be better to say nothing
about it outside just yet dicky an-
swered but you see tom my scheme
is this i propose to transplant about
a thousand families of greek peasants
-small farmers-and stake em out
along that line on the tracts which it
controls you know i told you once
that i inherited a good-sized island in
the greek archipelago well im the
hereditary lord of that pile of dirt and
so i naturally feel sort of responsible
for the good of the people that live
there they have a pretty tough time
of it to get along i guess but they are
a thrifty industrious bunch and really

a mighty decent lot taking em all
around so far the dam place hasnt
paid me anything at all to speak of
on the contrary ive had to help em
out from time to time but the people
are really good people hard-working
and well behaved and all that once
they get a fair chance theyll make
things hum you wait and see

  for a moment i sat and stared at this
nearly naked youth with feelings im-
possible to describe dicky helped him-
self to another peach

  wrhy not have staked them out on
our own prospective grants i asked

  oh stop and think a minute tom
you know as well as i do that it w-ould
have put all the surrounding country
on the bum these greeks of mine
are all right but any big immigrant
colony knocks the value of surrounding
real estate that is it does at first
until they get americanized and it usu-
ally takes the second generation to do
that since maitlands road was a dead
issue and as it struck me that the coun-
try thereabouts would be just the meat
for my greeks i thought i could see
a way of killing two birds with one
stone-or three maybe in the first
place my buying the road saves mait-
land from disaster second it may
prove a land of canaan for my starv-
ing crowd third i stand to make a
lot out of it in the end when they get
well rooted maitland thinks so and so
does my former guardian and so does

dimitri-

  so does-dimitri i gasped hold
on dicky  dont fling it in too fast and
frequent or youll have me sitting on
the floor playing with paper dolls i
mopped my brow it seemed to me
as though i had already stood as many
shocks that day as was good for a white
man dimitri  my friend 

  yes dicky answered flinging his
peach pit through the window the
birds had already discovered his return
and were fluttering all about fortu-


the tpocpulacr magazine

nately the children had not returned
from the district school dimitri is
a sort of cousin of mine i knew where
to find him in frisco ive been keep-
ing tabs on him through a detective
agency ever since he tried to get gay
i felt sort of sorry for dimitri because
-oh for a lot of reasons all the
same that wouldnt have kept me from
sticking a knife into his throat if i
got a good chance dimitris kick
wasnt so much jealousy through love
as it was being sore at seeing a rank
outsider and what he thought to be just
an ordinary everyday american fellow
come along and cut him out of his girl
and no end of money when i went
to see him this last time and proved
to him who i was it gave him no end
of a jolt he turned green and stefan
nearly had a fit got down and grov-
eled

  did you go to see them alone i
asked

  yes he answered i knew that
there was no danger they were flat
broke and living in the attic of a rotten
sailors boarding house you must
have given his arm a darn good wrench
as he still had it in a sling well i
told dimitri that while he didnt de-
serve it i was willing to put him in a
way to make a fortune if hed behave
himself and stick to business then i
explained my scheme and he was keen
about it and promised to be good
dicky clapped his hands and chang
came in look in my valise and bring
me that big box of candy

  i leaned back in my chair and stared
at him with wonder chang brought
the candy and dicky began to munch
nougat feeding the birds little morsels
which they pecked from his fingers
it seemed to me that there was a sort
of radiance about him which was
brighter than the sunlight streaming in

  go on i said in-a subdued voice
what then

  oh i took them up over the prop-

erty and showed them all the possibili-
ties of the business and then we went
to new york where we met maitland
and worked the proposition out in de-
tail maitland was really in the devil
of a mess but i got him out of that by
advancing him money on his shares
we formed a syndicate of which i am
president with a controlling interest
maitland is to run the railroad and
land  business and dimitri will have
charge of the colonists and all that part
of it we are going to charter a ship
to fetch these people out and dimitri
is going over on her to round up the
bunch

  you are sure theyll come i asked

  you bet theyll come theyd go to
the north pole on my say-so besides
dimitri has a lot of influence and so
has my former guardian mr constant
hes in the syndicate too and hes go-
ing out with dimitri maitland is com-
ing here in about a fortnight and hes
going to look after this end of it here
come the kids--and dicky ran
out just as he was to greet them

  chang i shouted saddle nelly
and bring her up-and be quick about
it

  it allee same lunch time-

  do what i say and get a move on
you i bellowed and five minutes
later wtas tearing back over the road
to the sanitarium

  the rest of the tale is quickly tolcl
that is as much as requires the telling
diana and i were married a month
later and left for the east where there
was much business to transact

  dicky and alessandra were married
about a year later and finally settled
on their palatial estate in california
there to rear an interesting family we
are all rich people now but when i
contemplate my golden goddess and our
sturdy flock i feel myself to be the
richest of them all
for brodies benefit

by charles e van loan

author of a job for the pitcher   the crabetc

   this joyous tale filled with the well-known van loan brand of rough
humor opens with a spirited scrap between a boxer and the portrait of the
next heavyweight champion the aftermath of the unequal contest will
get you up on your toes van loan knows the fight game and-as the
populars six years acquaintance with him has demonstrated-he knows
how to tell a good story this is one

big tom oconnor strolled
into shaughnessys place about
ten minutes after the proprietor
finished decorating the west wall
of the establishment with his most
recently acquired work of art the
same being a full-length life-size por-
trait of robert emmet brodie heavy-
weight done in oils and also to a turn
that the artist had never seen his vic-
tim might possibly be regarded in the
light of a mitigating circumstance at
any rate he had drawn brodies classic
outlines from a half tone in a pink illus-
trated weekly and his inspiration from
a quart bottle kindly furnished by
shaughnessy the result of these two
drawings caused tom oconnor to gasp
and pass his hand before his eyes
and me off the hard stuff for a
week said big tom what have
you there denny  is it a fighter or is
it a spanish omelet

  have yer joke tom responded
shaughnessy with a nervous grin for
big toms jokes were often akin to vio-
lence have yer joke lad ye will
annyhow but i take it hard ye do not
recognize bob brodie when ye see him
on the wall

  bob brodie  howled oconnor
brodie and what right has he got
to be hangin on a wall id like to
know  brodie a great big four-
flushin piece of cheese like him who
did he ever lick

  he put away a lot of them boys in
the east said shaughnessy have a
drink tom

  oconnor waved away this friendly
invitation

  yeh he put away a lot of dub
growled big tom eying the work of art
truculently dubs all dubs brodie
never licked a good man in his life and
you know it why he cant even lick
me

  ah well said shaughnessy wisely
avoiding the personal note in the argu-
ment maybe it aint so much what he
has done as what hes goiri to do
youre whistlin remarked ocon-
nor shortly and im the lad can tell
you what hes goin to do hes cornin
down off that wall hes cornin down
if i have to pull him down

  now tom dont be gettin rough
pleaded shaughnessy who was a small
man and informed of his weak heart


the popular magazuti

dont be startin anything in here

theres a good-

  hes cornin down i tell you  re-
peated oconnor in tones which
reached the street only a champion
of the world has got a right to be in a
gold frame with a brass plate under
him will you take him down yourself

  shaughnessy squeaked and made a
dash for the street door to summon as-
sistance but big tom executed a sur-
prisingly swift flank movement and cut
him off herding the terrified proprie-
tor to the rear of the saloon where he
took refuge among the empty beer kegs
this little matter attended to the censor
of art turned his attention to the of-
fending portrait he dragged it from
the wall and balanced it against a table

  plainly oconnors first impulse was
to kick several holes in the canvas but
as he stood facing the life-size and
shrimp-pink prize representation of a
fighter a change came over his mood
and his lip curled in scornful amuse-
ment wtith mocking deliberation big
tom copied the painted pose left hand
advanced right arm drawn back a
thunderbolt in reserve he feinted and
skipped and side-stepped now creeping
up on the portrait now retreating as
from an attack and his clumsy left jabs
grazed brodies pink nose while thus
employed he addressed the portrait as
follows

  huh think youre a whale of a
feller eh think youre a fighter
dont you been talkin about fightin
the heavyweight champ aint you hey
you-make-me-sick  they tell me
youre clever with your mitts-but im
givin you a tip lay off of me
brodie yes lay off of me you big
bum-because if i ever git you in a
barroom an nobody to yell foul or
call time ill beat you to death yes
thats what i said-to death ill lick
you the same as i used to lick you when
we was kids in school maybe i

couldnt do it in a ring-but in a bar-
room  why listen to me you ugly
mans dog-in a barroom-id murder
you alive think not hey well
smell of this once

  having talked himself into a state
of mind demanding more physical ex-
pression than may be found in futile
left jabs big tom feinted twice in
rapid succession and stepping in let
fly with the heavy artillery his right
fist shot forward with two hundred
pounds of oconnor behind it full into
the painted countenance of robert em-
met brodie there followed a dull
thump a splitting tearing crash a wail
from the wretched shaughnessy dodg-
ing among the empty beer kegs and
big tom oconnor strode out into the
street blowing upon his knuckles the
canvas had been reenforced with a
backing of pine boards

  shaughnessys next customer found
him mourning over the life-size por-
trait of a fighter without a face

  save us from harm ejaculated
mr casey peering at the ruin has
the germans been usin that thing for a
target or what an whose picture
was it before the bombardment come
off

  it was bob brodies replied
shaughnessy

  mr casey sucked in his breath with
a clucking noise

  an a grand likeness said he
the legs is done fine you couldal-
most tell em annywhere who busted
him 

  tom oconnor took a punch at it
just for meanness said shaughnessy
bitterly he was showin me how he
could lick brodie-in a barroom

  mr casey brightened visibly

  has tom got a spite agin brodie
he asked

  look at what he done to the oil
paintin an ask me that

  but what for persisted casey

  how should i know by what i
for brodes benefit



could make out he used to lick brodie
when they was kids in school

  ah he did that chuckled mr
casey an like as not hes sore be-
cause he cant lick him now it makes
him mad to be stickin in the gas house
when brodies gone up in the world
what you goin to do about it

  i was thinkin i might have him
pinched said shaughnessy thought-
fully as he surveyed the headless gladi-
ator

  no said casey dont do that
they would only let him go with a
small fine an then some night when
hes got a skate on hell come in here
an move the saloon out into the alley
theres a better way

  tell it to me

  put the picture in the back room
just as it is jerry brodie has had
a letter from bob an hes cornin home
for a visit when he gets here well
show him the insult that has been done

on him hell go out-

  an knock the face off the big
bully chirped shaughnessy oho
but thatll be better than havin him
pinched an when they come together
-may i be there to see 

  im wonderin mused the crafty
casey im wonderin if there aint a
way to fix it sos we can all be there

case the actor returning from metro-

bers him only as old man jones boy

pleasing the critics who sang with her
in the old church choir the author-oh
well an author gets no credit anywhere
and pays cash or goes without-but the
home-coming gladiator ah here we
a p

have one hero who is sure of an admir-
ing populace

  for two days robert emmet brodie
did little else but shake warm kindly
hands and listen to words of praise fie
was a large overdressed bejeweled
lop-eared young man with a deep dent
where the bridge of his nose should
have been and he spoke briefly if at all
out of the extreme corner of his mouth
somewhere on his travels he had ac-
quired the art of listening without vis-
ible embarrassment to middle-aged men
who wished to tell him how much he
reminded them of the great and only
john lawrence sullivan in his prime
it is only fair to brodie to state that
he usually dissented from this opinion
in manner as follows

  listen to me guy youre way off
there-way off i seen a picture of
john l when i was a kid an he had
a miwtache you dont see no mns-
tache on me do you and that aint
the only difference either from what
they tell me sullivan was a rough
knck-em-dead slugger--no science no
fancy stuff no cleverness nothin but
the big wallop in the belly or on the
jawr an good night i dont see where
you git that stuff bout me bein like
him now i aint that kind of a
fighter at all i box em i do i jab
the faces off of em an then-wham

  from robert emmets unwillingness
to be compared with john l sullivan
the reader will deduce at least one de-
duction-at least we hope so it will
save us the trouble of saying that un-
der no circumstances would robert em-
met ever become extremely bored with
himself he lorded it over the young-
men of his home town and in conver-
sation with his manager referred to
them as hicks and jaspers the
young men enjoyed his patronizing
manner and continued to feed his van-
ity until mr brodie came near the
bursting point

  on the evening of the second day it


the popular magazine

suited him to favor denny shaugh-
nessys saloon with a visit robert em-
met brought his greek chorus with him
and the silver dollar which he slammed
on the bar bounded at least two feet
into the air

  see what everybodyll have to
take ordered brodie let em all in
on it denny an git in yourself

  now one of those who was let in on
it was casey who edged his way to
brodies side

  we got something in the back room
to show you bob said he with an in-
gratiating smile an oil painting aint
we denny

  we have so answered the pro-
prietor

 robert emmet yawned ostenta-
tiously openly as openly as the end of
the hoosac tunnel

  i seen a lot of them things when i
was east said he oil paintings is
old stuff to me

  come over here a minute said
casey tugging at robert emmets
sleeve come over here an listen
this aint the kind of an oil paintin ye
think it is at all he lowered his voice
to a whisper its a paintin of you
bob

  eh what exclaimed brodie be-
ginning to show signs of interest who
done it

  ye mean who painted it asked
casey and robert emmet nodded

  it aint so much a question of who
done it explained casey as who done
something to it a dirty black shame
an a disgrace come on an ill show
it to ye no never mind callin the
gang bob tis a private exhibition-
for reasons we got

  his curiosity roused robert emmet
entered a back room and the language
which burst from his lips when he be-
held the desecration of art was all that
casey had hoped for-and more

  accident  chirped shaughnessy
from the doorway ye can bet your

sweet life it wasnt an accident it was
done a-purpose a friend of yours
come in here one day just after i hung
it on the wall an he put a right swing
through it-if ye call that an accident
who was it demanded brodie
tell me his name an ill beat him to a
pulp ill lick him within an inch of
his life

 it was thomas oconnor-big
tom said casey an what was it he
said about bob when he done it
shaughnessy 

  he said ye never licked a good man
an never will he said he used to
make ye quit when he was a kid an he
could do it anny time he said ye al-
ways had a streak as wide as the mis-
sissippi river an-

  he said enough interrupted rob-
ert emmet from the extreme corner of
his mouth he said a-plenty big
tom hey so he done that to me pic-
ture humph i aint seen him yet
where does he keep himself

  oh hes round about somewheres
answered casey

  likely stayin out of yer way sup-
plemented shaughnessy

 but where does he hang out 
where can i find the big bum

  well this was the way we figured
it all out explained the diplomatic
casey suppose ye ketch him in a sa-
loon an tear his block off the bar-
tender will have a treat but the rest
of usll miss it suppose ye pile into
him on the street only them that hap-
pens to be takin a walk will see the
show now what ought to happen to
tom oconnor is a public lickin-the
more public the better now this is
what we was thinkin of next friday
night the boys is goin to pull off a
benefit for ye down to freemans hall
yeh growled brodie shortly i
know go on

  we was goin to have some boxin
on the program continued casey an
we thought it would be just the ticket
for brodibs benefit



to rib oconnor up to go on an spar
four rounds with ye

  make it six interrupted brodie
an eager sparkle in his eye gimme
time to cut him up till his own mother
wouldnt know him ill jab his face to
ribbons an then knock him out
well then six rounds ye can act
friendly when ye meet him an hell
never suspect theres annything doin
in the way of a job then with the
whole town lookin on ye can play even
for this here outrage

  yes said shaughnessy give him
a lovely trimmin an let him guess
why

   it listens good enough said rob-
ert emmet with deep corrugations on
his brow which had he the gray ma-
terial necessary would have indicated
thought it sounds all right but how
do you know this big bum will fall for
it chances are he aint lookin for
even a friendly bout with a real scrap-
per

   dont be woriyin on that score
said shaughnessy the joke of it is
bob oconnor really thinks he can
 lick ye

   brodie laughed uproariously

  plenty more of em have had the
same notion said he i knocked it
out of their fool heads in jig time
now heres the frame-up ill meet
tom and i wont let on that im sore
ill even let him bluff me a little if he
wants to then casey you go to him
an tell him you can fix it for him to
get on with me at the benefit tell him
im all out of trainin an hell have to
promise not to tear into me rough
hell eat that up and when i get him
into the ring-well say robert em-
met completed the sentence with a very
effective bit of pantomime consisting of
three left jabs and an annihilating right
cross which placed in the right spot
would have jarred the entire oconnor
family for generations

  the next day casey the fixer called
at the gas works and found big tom
oconnor raking coke out of the
furnace

  your pal bob brodie is back in
town said casey after remarking on
the state of the wreather

  so ive just heard said oconnor
gruffly

  i was wonderin if i could git ye to
do something for him

  big tom rose wiped his grimy hands
on his stiff shock of hair and essayed
a bit of shadow boxing mostly com-
posed of giant swings when satisfied
that his right arm was in working trim
he tried his right leg and went through
the motions of putting the boots to a
fallen foe

will i do something for him he
repeated breathing hard from his exer-
tions with all the pleasure in life
where is the big bum keepin himself
casey seemed astonished

 why i thought you boys was
friends said he

  big tom tossed his forelock out of
his eyes and his lower lip protruded

  if im a friend to that stiff he bet-
ter pray never to have an enemy said
he

  but couldnt you forget that for a
while asked casey

  when im down among the daisies
maybe not till then

  too bad said casey sighing we
all thought youd be just the man
the man for what

  why the boys are givin brodie a
benefit next friday night at freemans

hall-

  the big bum dont need no benefit
interrupted oconnor hes big
enough to work

  well be that as it may tom we
want a man to go on an spar with
him six rounds

  ychf

  a man that wont be too rough
  whats the idea


the oular magazine

wind to speak of hed want to go

this ill will yed be doin bob a favor
an the committee a favor an every-
body a favor

barroom said tom

  youre sure he aint just wantin to
show me up

  i tell ye he dont want to show any-
body up he aint able

thats different again said big
tom thoughtfully ill take a chance
remember now said casey as he
took his leave no rough stuff its a
benefit

  yeh said big tom but to him-
self he said ill benefit him the big
bum ill benefit him till he hollers for
the police 

 and when robert emmet brodie
heard that the despoiler of art was will-
ing to crawl through the ropes with
him he smiled a smile which threatened
to engulf his lopped ears and advised
all his friends to secure front seats

iii

  the brodie benefit judging by the
attendance promised to be a brilliant
success for freemans hall was
crowded long before the opening num-
ber on the program the overture from
william tell was executed in cold
blood by the local orchestra fully half
the spectators were women and the star
of the evening grinned as he looked
through the peephole in the curtain

  so much the better said brodie to
isaac marx his manager

  better leave the tea-lead out of
the bandages then advised isaac
women dont like the sight of blood
and when you start cutting him up

  with that left hand theyll make trou-
ble

  they got no business here then
said brodie the tea-lead goes and i
only wish i could slip a horseshoe in
the right mitt

  youre bloodthirsty to-night said
isaac

  this big tramp thinks he can lick
me said robert emmet an im goin
to change his notions if i have to kill
him to do it

  an outsider with knowledge of ring-
craft would have been amazed could he
have peeped into two dressing rooms
and seen the preparations being made
for this friendly six-round sparring
bout for points he might even have
thought that mutilation and murder
were among the points desired for in
one dressing room isaac marx was
binding adhesive tape about brodies
left hand and putting a strip of tea-
lead under each wrapping now a left
jab reenforced by a sufficient amount
of tea-lead will gash the human coun-
tenance even through a heavy boxing
glove-and it was brodies intention to
wear the lightest gloves permitted by
law in another dressing room red
eddie oday retired bantamweight
boxer and bosom friend of the ponder-
ous oconnor was also busy wtith
bandages but he scorned anything as
coarse and brutal as tea-lead-oh my
yes he dipped inch-wide strips of
cloth into a bowl containing a pasty
white substance and bound them about
oconnors hands the soft wet cov-
ering thus secured looked innocent
enough and would remain innocent un-
til the plaster of paris had time to
harden when the soft bandage would
become a deadly weapon needless to
say the only witnesses to these activi-
ties have been mentioned

 the gladiators met in the wings
shortly before going on the stage they
did not shake hands probably because
of the boxing gloves but robert em-
for brodies beneft



met smiled in a very friendly fash-
ion

  youre lookin fit big feller said
he his glance taking in the massive de-
tails of oconnors undraped figure

  ah-r-r growled tom wishing he
had a turkey-red bath robe like bro-
dies

  dont be scared of the crowd con-
tinued robert emmet patronizingly
dont pay no tention to the audience
at all

  huh  snorted big tom tossing his
heavy forelock

  and whatever you do dont get mad
an start roughin it

  it was at this point that tom grinned
and five minutes later he was blinking
at the footlights and hearing himself
mentioned by casey the official an-
nouncer as big tom oconnor the
pride of the gas house there was a
thin sputter of applause for tom was
no public idol and he allowed red ed-
die to lead him to his corner where he
sat down to wait for brodie

  robert emmet had a fair sense of the
fitness of things he knew that a cer-
tain amount of delay whets the public
appetite too much delay leads to im-
patient demonstrations he timed his
entrance to the exact second and
marched upon the stage with a flourish
of the tail of his turkey-red bath robe
the house rose at him and he bowed
three times but refused to respond to
the loud yells for a speech casey in-
troduced him as the man who needed
no introduction-the next heavyweight
champion of the world and big tom
snorted in his corner

  brodie tossed off his bath robe and
skipped lightly about the ring pivoting
on his toes and shooting tentative left
jabs into the air big tom watched
this display of agility with a curling lip

  pipe the big stiff showin off he
whispered to oday

  he aint showin off answered
oday hes testin the floor

  hell test it with his head when i git
a smash at his jaw said big tom

  butch dillon the referee motioned
the men to the middle of the ring and
delivered his instructions with a spe-
cial clause for oconnor butch had
not been let in on the secret

  you wanna box nice now tom
said he warningly remember theys
ladies present

  sure grunted oconnor rolling
his eyes toward the footlights sure
butch

  dillon then took the referees privi-
lege and made the final announcement
dwelling at length upon the friendliness
of the bout and mentioning the marquis
of queen sberry in complimentary
terms big tom listened to this in his
corner gloves on his hips red eddie
whispered in his ear

  right off the reel now big guy
right off the reel beat him to the
punch an youve got him

  as the gong clanged big tom walked
slowly to the middle of the ring his
right hand carried carelessly at his side
now according to custom all friendly
bouts for points and many bouts which
are not friendly begin with a hand-
shake but as robert emmet advanced
he noted the position of oconnors
right hand and read violence in his eyes

  he thinks he can sneak one over
the big stiff thought robert emmet

if thats his notion-

  thus it happened that the friendly
bout for points began with two terrific
right-hand blows delivered simultane-
ously robert emmets uppercut
crashed against oconnors chin but
robert emmet did not duck his head
soon enough to avoid the plaster of
paris entirely and big toms sturdy
haymaker landed full on brodies ear
if it had found a spot only two inches
lower the entertainment would have
been jolted to an abrupt close as it was
the first five seconds of this friendly
bout found both principals on the floor


the cpocpulacr magazine

-brodie on his face near the ropes and
oconnor on his haunches in the middle
of the ring slightly puzzled as to how
he got there

  butch dillon did not know how to
meet such an emergency or which man
to favor with the count and in his ex-
citement he made a serious error he
rushed over to oconnor and shook his
fist at him

  that aint boxin for points he
yelled what you tryin to do-kill
somebody 

  now no man should argue with an
irishman named oconnor who has
been knocked down by a trick which he
hoped to practice himself big tom
rose to his feet and cuffed dillon
soundly with his open glove knocking
him fiat a tremendous uproar came
from the audience and there was no
note of commendation in it tom
started for the ropes with a hazy idea
of explaining his position but on the
way he encountered a wild-eyed human
thunderbolt which in sane moments
passed for robert emmet brodie the
tea-leaded left caught him fairly on the
bridge of his nose and big tom began
to fight

  some who were in the front of the
house remember that women fainted
and strong men raced up and down the
aisles whooping deliriously a very
few recall that butch dillon found his
feet and tried to force his way between
the infuriated gladiators and butchs
memories of the evening ended abruptly
at that point none can tell who fa-
thered the cruel stroke which knocked
him headfirst through the ropes and out
into the orchestra pit where he put his
right shoulder through the bull fiddle
above the shrill screams of hysterical
women and the shouts of excited men
big tom heard one voice-that of his
second and adviser red eddie oday

  tear into um boy dont let um
get set on toppa him alia time tom
thassa stuff

  and in the midst of all this riot and
turmoil and clamor robert emmet bro-
die and thomas martin oconnor de-
voted themselves each to the other with
an increasing devotion there had been
a referee there had been certain rules
of combat perhaps even ethics but
these they cast into the discard there
was still a gong which clanged wildly
under the trembling hand of isaac
marx but they paid not the slightest at-
tention to it they had forgotten the
signal to cease firing

  it is a fact that when fighters lose
their heads they forget the left hand
and the science its use demands em-
ploying it if at all as a flail brodie
and oconnor stood toe to toe in the
middle of the ring and battered each
other with wild swings once the plas-
ter of paris connected solidly with the
chin and brodie dropped to the floor
but was up again before oconnor could
kick him in the face once big tom
went reeling to the ropes but when
robert emmet rushed after him he
stepped squarely into a pile-driving
right swing which had no particular
aim and for that reason caught brodie
in the pit of the stomach and made
him very sick for a few seconds

  downstairs tom the belly the
belly shrieked oday but oconnor
was past advice past everything but the
red desire for slaughter so instead of
following up an advantage he plastered
robert emmet heavily about the head
until he ducked his jaws below his
shoulders and so weathered the storm

  big toms face suffered terribly but
he fought doggedly on with his left eye
closed to a blue slit and brodie was un-
able to find a vulnerable spot though he
found all the others and left his auto-
graph upon them

  nobody knows how long that first
round lasted upon that subject the offi-
cial timekeeper is dumb to robert
emmet it seemed an eternity he was
used to three minutes of fighting and
fqcr brodies benefit

one minute of rest tom oconnor was
hardened to barroom brawls with no
call of time but he found this en-
counter quite long enough for his liking
robert emmet began to give ground
oconnor crowded him to the ropes and
brodie clinched oconnor lowered his
head and drove short rights and lefts
crashing into unprotected territory be-
low the breastbone he literally ham-
mered brodie out of the clinch and for
a second the men stood facing each
other each with the right hand poised
it was the last shot in robert emmets
locker and he knew it as his eye
caught the first movement of ocon-
nors fist he threw every remaining
ounce of vitality into an attempt to
beat him to the punch so intent was
he on sending his own blow home that
he made not the slightest attempt to
protect himself in the exchange

  six seconds later tom oconnor
awoke from a troubled dream and lifted
his battered face from the canvas as
if from a great distance he heard men
yelling and women screaming blink-
ing his one undamaged eye he looked
about for brodie and discovered a hu-
man leg tangled with his arms his
first impression was that the leg be-
longed to him slowly he turned his
head and there beside him on the can-
vas a thousand fathoms deep in merci-
ful oblivion was robert emmet brodie
the next heavyweight champion of the
world for the present unavoidably de-
layed

  sig tom oconnor hoisted himself
to his feet and stood erect swaying un-
steadily he looked at brodie again

oddly enough without any desire to kick
him for once in his life tom ocon-
nor had had all the fighting he wanted
-perhaps more than he really needed
his face felt that way at least he
helped several men to carry the uncon-
scious brodie to his corner and then
heaved himself through the ropes and
disappeared

  while red eddie was ministering to
his battler the door of the dressing room
opened and isaac marx looked in

  ill make you a business proposi-
tion said he with commendable brev-
ity let me be your manager and ill
get you more coin that you ever saw
you can fill the dates i had fixed up for
brodie

  let brodie fill his own dates mum-
bled big tom through his swollen lips

  he cant said marx that last
punch you took at him busted his jaw
like an eggshell maybe he wont never
be no good again

  big tom oconnor stared at marx
for several seconds then he began to
laugh rocking himself back and forth
in his chair

  ho ho he chuckled i guess i
done wrhat i started out to do at that
ho ho

  and what did you start out to do
asked marx

  i wanted to fix this big bum so hed
need a benefit and i guess i done it

  correct as hell said marx but
how about this proposition i made
you 

  forget it said oconnor i got a
steady job down to the gas house

the old-timers tip

jb okie a sheepman of lost cabin wyoming who lives in the midst of
 his acres like a feudal baron tells of an old-timer who gave the following
advice to his only son when he was starting out to make his fortune

    bill said the wise father dont steal unless you have to but if yuh
must steal steal from a feller thats so rich he wont miss it or from one thats
so poor he cant foller ye

chapter i

the man with a gun

the peace of midday lay upon
gunsight broken only by the
distant chang chang of bells
as a ten-mule ore team came
toiling in from the mines in the cool
depths of the umbrella tree in front of
the companys office a mexican ground
dove crooned endlessly his ancient song
of love but gunsight took no notice
its thoughts were not of love but of
money

  the dusty team of mules passed
down the street dragging their double-
trees reluctantly and took their cursing
meekly as they made the turn at the
tracks a switch engine bumped along
the sidings snaking ore cars down to
the bins and bunting them up to the
chutes but except for its bangings and
clamor the town was still an aged
mexican armed with a long bunch of
willow brush swept idly at the sprin-

kled street and old hassayamp hicks
the proprietor of the alamo saloon
leaned back in his rawhide chair and
watched him with good-natured con-
tempt

  the town was dead after a manner
of speaking and yet it was not dead
in the gunsight hotel where the offi-
cials of the company left their women-
folks to idle and fret and gossip there
was a restless flash of white from the
upper veranda and in the office below
andrew mcbain the aggressive presi-
dent of the gunsight mining and de-
velopment company paced nervously
to and fro as he dictated letters to a
typist he paused and as the clacking
stopped a woman who had been read-
ing a novel on the veranda rose up
noiselessly and listened over the rail-
ing the new typist was really quite
deaf-one could hear every word that
was said she was pretty too and-
well she dressed too well for one
thing
rimroo jones



  but mcbain was not making love to
his typist he had stopped with a
word on his lips and stood gazingout
the window the new typist had
learned to read faces and she followed
his glance with a start who was this
man that andrew mcbain was afraid
of he came riding in from the des-
ert a young man burly and master-
ful mounted on a buckskin horse and
with a pistol slung low on his leg mc-
bain turned white his stern lips drew
tighter and he stood where he had
stopped in his stride like a wolf that
has seen a fierce dog then suddenly he
swung forward again and his voice
rang out harsh and defiant the new
typist took the words down at haphaz-
ard for her thoughts were not on her
work she was thinking of the man
with a gun he had gone by without a
glance and yet mcbain was afraid of
him

  a couple of card players came out of
the alamo and stopped to talk with
hassayamp

  well bless my soul exclaimed the
watchful hassayamp as he suddenly
brought his chair down with a bump
if hyer dont come that locoed scoun-
drel rimrock say that boys crazy
dont you know he is-jest look at that
big sack of rocks

  he rose up heavily and stepped out
into the street shading his eyes from
the glare of the sun

  hello thar rimmy he rumbled
bluffly as the horseman waved his
hand whar you been so long and
nothin heard of you theres been a
woman hyer inquirin for you most
every day for a month now

   s that so responded rimrock
guardedly well say boys ijve struck
it rich

  he leaned back to untie a sack of
ore but old hassayamp was not to
be deterred

  yes sir he went on opening up
his eyes triumphantly a widde woman

-says you owe her two bits for some
bread

  he laughed uproariously at this
pointed jest and clambered back to the
plank sidewalk where he sat down
convulsed in his chair

  aw you make me tired said rim-
rock shortly you know i dont owe
no woman

  you owe every one else though
came back hassayamp with a texas
yupe i got you there boy you
shore caint git around that

 huh grunted rimrock as he
swung lightly to the ground two
bits maybe four bits a couple of
dollars whats that to talk about
when a man is out after millions  is
my credit good for the drinks well
come on in then boys and ill show
you something good

  he led the way through the swing-
ing doors and hassayamp followed
ponderously the card players fol-
lowed also and several cowboys ap-
pearing as if by miracle lined up along
with the rest old hassayamp looked
them over grimly breathed hard and
spread out the glasses

  well all right rim he observed
between friends-but dont bid in the
whole town

  when i drink my friends drink
answered rimrock and tossed off his
first drink in a month now he went
on fetching out his sack ill show
you something good

  he poured out a pile of blue-gray
sand and stood away from it admir-
ingly

  old hassayamp drew out his glasses
and balanced them on his nose then
he gazed at the pile of sand

  well he said what is it any-
way 

  its copper by grab mighty nigh
ten per cent copper and you can scoop
it up with a shovel theres worlds of
it hassayamp-a whole dog-goned
mountain thats the trouble-theres


the cpovulatr magazine

almost too much i cant handle it
man itll take millions to do it but
believe me the millions are there all
i need is a stake now just a couple of

thousand dollars-

  huh grunted hassayamp looking
up over his glasses you dont reckon
ive got that much do you to sink in
a pile of sand

  if not you then somebody else re-
plied rimrock confidently some fel-
ler thats out looking for sand i heard
about a sport over in london that tried
on a bet to sell five-pound notes for a
shilling thats like me offering to sell
you twenty-five dollars for the english
equivalent of two bits and dye think
he could get any one to take em he
stood up on a soap box and waved those
notes in the air but dye think he could
get anybody to buy

  he paused with a cynical smile and
looked hassayamp in the eye

 well-no conceded hassayamp
weakly

 you bet your life he could
snapped back rimrock a guy came
along that knowed he took one look
at those five-pound notes and handed
up fifty cents

   ill take two of em he says and
walks off with fifty dollars

  rimrock scooped up his despised
sand and poured it back into the bag
after which he turned on his heel as
the doors swung to behind him old
hassayamp looked at his customers and
shook his head impressively from the
street outside rimrock could be heard
telling a mexican in spanish to take
his horse to the corrals he was master
of gunsight yet though all his money
had vanished and his credit would buy
nothing but the drinks

  well what dye know about that
observed hassayamp meditatively by
george sometimes i almost think that
boy is right

  he cleared his throat and hobbled to-

ward the door and the crowd took the
hint to disperse

  on the edge of the shady sidewalk
rimrock jones the follower after big
dreams sat silent balancing the sack
of ore in a bronzed and rock-scarred
hand he was a powerful man with
the broad square-set shoulders that
come from much swinging of a double
jack or cranking at a windlass the
curling beard of youth half covered
his hard-bitten face and his head was
unconsciously thrust forward as if he
still glimpsed his vision and was eager
to follow it farther the crowd set-
tled down and gazed at him curiously
for they knew he had a story to tell
and at last the great rimrock sighed
and looked at his work-worn hands

  hard going he said glancing up
at hassayamp ive got a ten-foot
hole to sink on twenty different claims
no powder and nothing but mexicans
for help but i sure turned up some
good ore-she gets richer the deeper
you go

  any gold inquired hassayamp
hopefully

  yes but pockety i leave all that
chloriding to the mexicans while i do
my discovery work theyve got some
picked rock on the dump

  why dont you quit that dead work
and do a little chloriding yourself
pound out a little gold-thats the way
to get a stake

  old hassayamp spat the words out
impatiently but rimrock seemed
hardly to hear

  nope he said no pocket mining
for me theres copper there millions
of tons of it ill make my winning
yet

 huh grunted hassayamp and
rimrock came out of his trance

  you dont think so hey he chal-
lenged and then his face softened to
a slow reminiscent smile

  say hassayamp he said didyou
ever hear about that prospector that
rimrock jones



found a thousand pounds of gold in
one chunk  he was lost on the desert
plumb out of water and forty miles
from nowhere he couldnt take the
chunk along with him and if he left
it there the sand would cover it up
now what was that poor feller to do
well what did he do inquired
hassayamp cautiously

  he couldnt make up his mind an-
swered rimrock so he stayed there
till he starved to death

  youre plumb full of these sayings
and parables aint you  remarked
hassayamp sarcastically whats that
got to do with the case 

  well began rimrock sitting down
on the edge of the sidewalk and looking
absently up the street take me for
instance i go out across the desert
to the tecolotes and find a whole moun-
tain of copper you dont have to chop
it out with chisels like that native cop-
per around the great lakes and you
dont have to go underground and do
timbering like they do around bisbee
and cananea all you have to do is
to shoot it down and scoop it up with
a steam shovel now ive located the
whole danged mountain and done most
of my discovery work but if some fel-
ler dont give me a boost like taking
that prospector a canteen of water ive
either got to lose my mine or sit down
and starve to death if id never done
anything itd be different but you
know that i made the gunsight

  he leaned forward and fixed the
saloon keeper with his earnest eyes and
old hassayamp held up both hands

  yes yes boy i know he broke
out hurriedly dont talk to me--im
convinced but by george rim you
can spend more money and have less
to show for it than any man i know
whats the use thats what we all
say whats the use of staking you
when youll turn right around in front
of us and throw the money away

aint i staked you aint l w staked
you 

  yes and he broke me too an-
swered rimrock raising his voice to
a defiant boom here he comes now
the blue-faced old dastard

  he thrust out his jaw and glared up
the street where l w lockhart the
local banker came stumping down the
sidewalk l w was tall and rangy
with a bulldog jaw clamped down on
a black cigar and an air of absolutede-
tachment from his surroundings

  yes i mean you shouted rim-
rock insultingly as l w went grimly
past you claim to be a white man
and then stand in with that lawyer to
beat me out of my mine i made you
you old nickel pincher and now you go
by me and dont even say have a
drink 

  youre drunk retorted lockhart
looking back over his shoulder and
rimrock jumped to his feet

  ill show you he cried starting
angrily after him and l w turned
swiftly to meet him

  youll show me zvhatf he de-
manded coldly as rimrock put his
hand to his gun

  never mind answered rimrock
you know you jobbed me i let you
in on a good thing and you sold me
out to mcbain i want some money
and if you dont give it to me ill-ill
go over and collect from him

  oh you want some money hey
repeated lockhart i thought you was
going to show me somethiitg

  the banker scowled as he rolled his
crgar but there was a twinkle far back
in his eyes youre bad now aint
you he continued tauntingly youre
just feeling awful youre going to
jump on lon lockhart and stomp him
into the ground  huh 

  aw shut your mouth answered
rimrock defiantly i never said a
word about fight

  uhhr grunted l w and put his


the vovulatr magazine

hand in his pocket at which rimrock
became suddenly expectant

  henry jones began the banker
i knowed your father and he was an
honorable hard-working man youre
nothing but a bum and youre getting
worse why dont you go and put up
that gun

  i dont have to retorted rimrock
but he moved up closer and there was
a wheedling turn to his voice just
two thousand dollars lon-thats all
i ask of you-and ill give you a share
in my mine didnt i come to you first
when i discovered the gunsight and
give you the very best claim and
you iitched me l w dad-burn you
you know it you sold me out to mc-
bain but ive got something now that
runs up into millions all it needs is
a little more work

  yes and forty miles of railroad
put in l w intolerantly i wouldnt
take- the whole works for a gift

  no but lon im lucky-you know
that yourself-i can go east and sell
the old mine

  oh youre lucky are you  inter-
rupted l w well how come then
that youre standing here broke but
here ive got business ill give you ten
dollars-and remember its the last
that you get

  he drew out a bill but rimrock
stood looking at him with a slow and
contemptuous smile

  yes you dog-goned old screw he
answered ungraciously what good will
ten dollars do

  you can get just as drunk on that
replied l w pointedly as you could
on a hundred thousand

  a change came over rimrocks face
the swift mirroring of some great idea
and he reached out for the money

  where you going demanded l
w as he started across the street

  none of your business answered
rimrock curtly but he headed straight
for the mint

chapter ii

when riches fly

  the mint was gunsights only gam-
bling house it had a bar of course
and a mexican string band that played
from eight oclock on besides a rou-
lette wheel a crap table two faro lay-
outs and monte for the mexicans but
the afternoon was dull and the faro
dealer was idly shuffling a double stack
of chips when rimrock brushed in
through the door half an hour after-
ward the place was crowded and all
the games were running big such is
the force of example-especially when
you win

  rimrock threw his bill on the table
bought a stack of white chips placed
it on the queen and told the dealer to
turn em the queen won and rimrock
took his chips and played as the spirit
moved he won more for the house
was unlucky from the start and soon
others began to ride his bets if he
bet on the seven eager hands reached
over his shoulder and placed more chips
on the seven petty winners drifted
off to try their luck at monte the sports
took a flyer at roulette and as the gam-
bling spirit so subtly fed began to rise
to a fever rimrock jones the cause
of all this heat bet more and more-
and still won

  it was at the height of the excite-
ment when with half the checks in the
rack in front of him rimrock was los-
ing and winning by turns that the bull-
like rumble of l w lockhart came
drifting in to him above the clamor of
the crowd

  why dont you quit you fool the
deep voice demanded cash in and
quit-youve got your stake 

  rimrock made a gesture of absent-
minded impatience and watched the
slow turn of the cards not even the
dealer or the hawk-eyed lookout was
more intently absorbed in the game
he knew every card that had been
rimrock jones



played and he bet where the odds were
best every so often a long yellow
hand reached past him and laid a bet
by his stake it was the hand of a
chinaman those most passionate of
faro players and at such times seeing
it follow his luck the face of rimrock
lightened up with the semblance of a
smile he called the last turn and they
paused for the drinks while the dealer
mopped his brow

  wheres ike he demanded well
somebody call him-hes hiding out
asleep upstairs

  yes wake him up shouted rim-
rock boastfully tell him rimrock
jones is here

  aw pull out you sucker blared
l w in his ear but rimrock only
shoved out his bets

  ten on the ace droned the anx-
ious dealer the jack is coppered all
down 

  he held up his hand and as the bet-
ting ceased he slowly pushed out the
two cards

  trey loses ace wins he an-
nounced and rimrock won again

  then he straightened up purpose-
fully and looked about as he sorted his
winnings into piles

  the whole works on the queen he
said to the dealer and a hush fell upon
the crowd

  wheres ike shrilled the dealer
but the boss was not to be found and
he dealt unwillingly for a queen but
the fear was on him and his thin hands
trembled for ike bray was not the
type of your frozen-faced gambler-
he expected his dealers to win the
dealer shoved them out and an oath
slipped past his lips

  queen wins he quavered the
bank is broke and he turned the box
on its side

  a shout went up-the glad yell of
the multitude-and rimrock rose up
grinning

  who said to pull out  he demanded

arrogantly looking about for the glow-
ering l w huh huh he chuckled
quit your luck when youre winning
quit your luck and your luck will quit
you-the drinks for the house bar-
keep

  he was standing at the bar stuffing
money into his pockets when ike bray
the proprietor appeared rimrock
turned all smiles as he heard his voice
on the stairs and lolled back against
the bar more than once in the past
bray had taken his roll but now it was
his turn to laugh

  lemme see he remarked as he
felt brays eyes upon him i wonder
how much i win

  he drew out the bills from his faded
overalls and began laboriously to count
them out into his hat

  ike bray stopped and looked at him
a little twisted man with his hair still
rumpled from the bed

  wheres that dealer he shrilled
in his high complaining voice ill kill
the danged piker-that bank aint broke
yet-i got a big roll right here

  he waved it in the air and came limp-
ing forward until he stood facing rim-
rock jones

  you think you broke me do you
he demanded insolently as rimrock
looked up from his count

  you can see for yourself answered
rimrock contentedly and held out his
well-filled hat

  youre a piker yelled bray you
dont dare to come back at me ill
play you one turn win or lose-for
your pile

  a hundred voices rang out at once
giving rimrock all kinds of advice but
l ws rose above them all

  dont you do it he roared hell
clean you for a certainty but rim-
rocks blue eyes were aflame

  all right mr man he answered
on the instant and went over and sat
down in his chair but bring a new


the populatr magazine

pack and shuffle em clean and ill do
the cutting myself

  ahhr snarled bray who was in
villainous humor as he hurled himself
into his place y neednt make no
cracks-im on the square and ill take
no lip from anybody

  well shuffle em up then an-
swered rimrock quietly and when i
feel like it ill make my bet

  it was the middle of the night as
brays days were divided and even yet
he was hardly awake but he shuffled
the cards until rimrock was satisfied
and then locked them into the box the
case keeper sat opposite to keep track
of the cards and a lookout on the stand
at one end and while a mob of surging
onlookers fought at their backs they
watched the slow turning of the cards

  why dont you bet  snapped bray
but rimrock jerked his head and beck-
oned him to go on

  yes and lose half on splits he an-
swered grimly ill bet when it comes
the last turn

  the deal went on till only three cards
remained in the bottom of the box by
the record of the case keeper they were
the deuce and the jack-the top card
already shown did not count

  the jack said rimrock and piled
up his money on the enameled card on
the board

  you lose rasped out bray with-
out waiting for the turn and then drey
off the upper card the jack lay a
loser in the box below and as he
shoved it slowly out the deuce appeared
underneath

  howd you know flashed back
rimrock as bray reached for his
money but the gambler laughed in his
face

  i outlucked you you yap he an-
swered harshly that dealer-he
wasnt worth hell room

  gimme a fiver to eat on demanded
rimrock as bray banked the money
but he flipped him fifty cents it was

the customary stake the sop thrown by
the gambler to the man who has lost
his last cent and bray sloughed it with-
out losing his count

  go on now he said still keeping
to the formula go back and polish
a drill

  it was the form of dismissal for the
hard-rock miners whose earnings he
was wont to take but rimrock was not
particular

  all right ike he said and as he
drifted out the door his prosperity
friends disappeared only l w re-
mained a scornful twist to his lips and
the sight of him left rimrock sick

  yes rub it in he said defiantly
and l w too walked away

  in his sober moments-when he was
out on the desert or slugging away un-
derground-rimrock jones was neither
childish nor a fool he was a serious
man wtith great hopes before him and
a past not ignoble behind but after
months of solitude of hard yegging
work and hopes deferred the town set
his nerves all atingle-even gunsight
a mere dot on the map--and he was
drunk before he took his first drink-
drunk with mischief and spontaneous
laughter drunk with good stories un-
told new ideas great thoughts high
ambitions but now he had had his
fling

  with fifty cents to eat on and one
more faro game behind him rimrock
stood thoughtfully on the corner and
asked the old question what next 
he had won and he had lost he had
made the stake that would have taken
him far toward his destiny and then
he had dropped it foolishly by playing
another mans game he could see it
now but then we all can-the ques-
tion was what next 

  well ill eat he said at last and
went across the street to woo chongs
the american restaurant was the
way the sign read but americans dont
run restaurants in arizona they dont
rimrock jones



know how woo chong had fed forty
miners when he ran the cookhouse for
rimrock for half what a white man
could and when rimrock had lost his
mine at the end of a long lawsuit woo
chong had followed him to town
there was a long tally on the wall the
longest of all which told how many
meals rimrock owed him for but rim-
rock knew he was welcome adversity
had its uses and he had learned among
other things that his best friends were
now chinamen and mexicans to
them at least he was still el patron-
the boss

  hello there woo he shouted at
the doorway and a rapid fire of chi-
nese ceased the dining room was de-
serted but from the kitchen in the rear
he could hear the shuffling slippers of
woo

 howdy-do misse jones ex-
claimed woo in great excitement as
he came hurrying out to meet him i
see you-few minutes ago-ove ike
blays place you blakum falo bank
no

  no i lose answered rimrock hon-
estly ike bray he gave me this to
eat on

  he showed the fifty-cent piece and
sat down at a table whereat woo
chong began to giggle hysterically

  aww allee time foolee me he
grinned facetiously you no see me
the  me playum too win ten dolla
you bet

  well all right woo said rim-
rock just give me something to eat
-we wont quarrel about who won

  he leaned back in his chair and woo
chong said no more till he appeared
again with a t-bone steak

  you ketchum mine pletty soon he
questioned anxiously all lite me
come back and cook

  rimrock sighed and went to eating
and woo remembered the coffee but
somehow even that failed to cheer

  a shadow of doubt came across woos

watchful face and he hurried away for
more bread

  you no blakum bank he inquired
at last and rimrock shook his head

  no woo he said ike bray he
came down and win all my money
back

  aw too bad breathed woo chong
and slipped quietly away but after a
while he came back

  too bad he repeated you my
fliend misse jones and he laid five
dollars by his hand

  ah no no protested rimrock
rising up from his place as if he had
suffered a blow no money woo
you give me my grub and thats
enough-i havent got down to that

 woo chong went away-he knew
how to make gifts easy-and rimrock
stood looking at the gold then he
picked it up slowly and as slowly
walked out and stood leaning against a
post

  there is one street in gunsight run-
ning grandly down to the station but
the rest is mostly vacant lots and scat-
tered adobe houses creeping out into
the infinitude of the desert at noon
when he had come to town the street
was deserted but now it was coming to
life wild-eyed mexican boys mounted
on barebacked ponies came galloping
up from the corrals freight wagons
drifted past hauling supplies to dis-
tant mining camps and at last as he
stood there thinking the women began
to come out of the hotel

  all day they stayed there idle use-
less on the shaded veranda above the
street and then when the sun was low
they came forth like indolent butterflies
to float up and down the street they
sauntered by in pairs half hidden be-
neath silk parasols and their skirts
swished softly as they passed rim-
rock eyed them sullenly for a black
mood was on him-he was thinking of
his lost mine their faces were pow-
dered to an unnatural whiteness and


the cpocpulacr magazine

their hair was elaborately coiffed their
dresses too were white and filmy and
their high heels clacked as they walked
but who was keeping these women
these wives of officials and superintend-
ents and mining engineers did they
glance at the man who had discovered
their mine and built up the town where
they lived well probably they did
but not so as he could notice it and take
off his battered old hat

  rimrock looked up the road and
far out across the desert he could see
his own pack train coming in there
was money to be got to buy powder and
grub but who would trust rimrock
jones now not the gunsight crowd
not mcbain and his hirelings-they
needed the money for their women
he gazed at them scowling as they
went pacing by him with their eyes
fixed demurely on space and all too
well he knew that beneath their lashes
they watched him and knew him well
yes and spoke to each other when
they were off up the street of what a
bum he had become that was women
-he knew it-the idle kind-they
judged a man by his roll

  the pack train strung by each burro
with his sawhorse saddle and old juan
and his boy behind

  el corral directed rimrock as
they looked at him expectantly-and
then he remembered something

  oyez juan he beckoned calling
his manservant up to him heres five
dollars-go buy some beans and flour
it is nothing juanito ill have more
pretty soon-and heres four bits you
can buy you a drink

  he smiled benevolently and juan
touched his hat and went sidling off
like a crab and then once more the
black devil came back to plague him
hissing money money money he
looked up the street and a plan long
formless took sudden shape in his
brain there was yet mcbain the
horse leech of a lawyer who had beaten

him out of his claim more than once
in black moments he had threatened
to kill him but now he was glad he had
not men even raised skunks when the
bounty on them was high enough and
took the pay out of their hides it was
the same with mcbain if he didnt

come through--rimrock shook up

his six-shooter and stalked resolutely
off up the street

  the office of the company was on
the ground floor of the hotel-the cor-
ner room with a rented office beyond-
and as rimrock came toward it he saw
a small sign jutting out from the far-
ther door

mary roget fortune

typewriting

  he glanced at it absently for strange
emotions came over him as he peered
in through that plate-glass window it
had been his office this same expensive
room and he had been robbed of it
under cover of the law he shaded his
eyes from the glare of the street and
looked in at the mahogany desk it was
vacant-the whole place was vacant-
and silently he tried the door that
was locked mcbain had seen him and
slipped away till he should get out of
town

  the sneaking cur muttered rim-
rock in a fury and a passing woman
drew away and half screamed he
ignored her pondering darkly and then
to his ears there came a familiar voice
he listened intently and raised his head
then tiptoed along the wall that voice
and he knew it belonged to andrew
mcbain the man that stole mines for
a living he paused at the door where
mary fortune had her sign then sud-
denly forced his way in

  without thinking impulsively he had
moved toward that voice as a man fol-
lows some irresistible call he opened
the door and stood blinking in the door-
way his hand on the pistol at his side
then he blinked again for in the gloom
rimroci jonbs



of the back office there was nothing but
a desk and a girl she wore a harness
over her head like a telephone oper-
ator and rose up to meet him tremu-
lously

  is there anything you wish she
asked him quietly and rimrock fum-
bled and ttok off his hat

  yes-i was looking for a man he
said at last i thought i heard him-
just now

  he came down toward her still look-
ing about him and there was a stir
from behind the desk

  no i think youre mistaken she
answered bravely but he could see the
telltale fear in her eyes

  you know who i mean he broke
out roughly and i guess you know
why ive come

  no i dont she answered but-
but this is my office and i hope you
wont make any trouble

  the words came with a rush once
she found her courage but the appeal
was lost upon rimrock

  hes here then he said well
you tell him to come out id like to
talk with him on business-alone

  he took a step forward and then
suddenly from behind the desk a
shadow rose up and fled it was an-
drew mcbain and as he dashed for
the rear door the girl valiantly covered
his retreat there was a quick slap
of the latch a scuffle behind her and
the door came shut with a bang

  oho said rimrock as she faced
him panting he must be a friend
of yourn

  no he isnt she answered in-
stantly and then a smile crept into her
eyes but hes-well hes my prin-
cipal customer

  oh said rimrock grimly well
ill let him live then good-by

  he turned away still intent on his
purpose but at the door she called him
back

  whats that he asked as if awak-
  a p

ened from a dream why yes if you
dont mind i will

chapter iii

miss fortune

  it was very informal to say the least
for mary fortune to invite him to sfcty
to be sure she knew him-he was the
man with the gun the man of whom
mcbain was afraid-but that was all
the more reason to a reasoning woman
why she should keep silent and let him
depart but there was a businesslike
brevity about him a single-minded di-
rectness that struck her as really
unique quite apart from the fact that
it might save mcbain she wanted him
to stay there and talk at least so she
explained it the evening afterward to
her censorious other self what she
did was spontaneous on the impulse of
the moment and without any reason-
whatever

  oh wont you sit down a moment
she had murmured politely and the
savage fascinating westerner after
one long look had with equal polite-
ness accepted

  yes indeed he answered when he
had got his wits together youre very
kind to ask me im sure

  he came back then a huge brown
ragged animal and sat down very care-
fully in her spare chair why he did
so when his business not to mention
a just revenge was urgently calling him
thence was a question never raised by
rimrock jones perhaps he was sur-
prised beyond the point of resistance
but it is still more likely that without
his knowing it he was hungry to hear
a womans voice his black mood left
him he forgot what he had come there
for and sat down to wonder and ad-
mire

  he looked at her curiously and his
eyes for one brief moment took in the
details of the headband over her ear
then he smiled to himself in his mas-


the votpuulcr magazine

terful way as if the sight of her pleased
him well there was nothing about
her to remind him of those women who
stalked up and down the street she
was tall and slim with swift capable
hands and every line of her spoke
subtly of style nor was she lacking
in those qualities of beauty which we
have come to associate with her craft
she had quiet brown eyes that lit up
when she smiled a high nose and
masses of hair but across that brown
hair that a duchess might have envied
lay the metal clip of her ear phone
and in her dark eyes bright and steady
as they were was that anxious look of
the deaf

  i hope i wasnt rude she stam-
mered nervously as she sat down and
met his glance

  oh no he said with the same
carefree directness it was me i
reckon that was rude i certainly
didnt count on meeting a lady when i
came in here looking for-well mc-
bain he wont be back i reckon
kind of interferes with business dont
it 

  he paused and glanced at the rear
door and the typist smiled discreetly

  oh no she said and then low-
ering her voice have you had
trouble with mr mcbain

  yes i have he answered you
may have heard of me-my name is
henry jones

  oh-rimrock jones

  her eyes brightened instantly as he
slowly nodded his head

  thats me he said i used to
run this whole town-im the man that
discovered the mines

  what-the gunsight mines why

i thought mr mcbain-

  mcbain what

  why i thought he discovered the
mines

  rimrock straightened up angrily
then he sat back in his chair and shook
his head at her cynically

  he didnt need to he answered
all he had to do was to discover an
error in the way i laid out my claim
then he went before a judge that was
as crooked as he was and the rest you
can see for yourself

  he thrust his thumb scornfully
through a hole in his shirt and waved
a hand in the direction of the office

  no he cleaned me out using a
friend of mine and now im down to
nothing what do you think of a law
that will take away a mans mine be-
cause it apexes on another mans claim 
i discovered this mine and i formed
the company keeping fifty-one per cent
of the stock i opened her up and she
was paying big when andy mcbain
comes along a shyster lawyer-thats
the best you can say for him-but he
cleaned me down to a cent

  i dont understand she said at last
as he seemed to expect some reply
about these apexes-what are they
anyway ive only been west a few
months

  well ive been west all my life
and ive hired some smart lawyers and
i dont know what an apex is yet but
in a general way its the high point of
an ore body-the highest place where
it shows above ground but the law
works out like this every time a man
finds a mine and opens it up till it
pays these apex sharps locate the high
ground above him and contest the title
to his claim you cant do that in mex-
ico nor in canada nor in china-this
is the only country in the world where
a mining claim dont go straight down
but under the law when you locate a
lode you can follow that vein within
an extension of your headlines under
anybodys ground anybodys

  he shifted his chair a little closer
and fixed her with his fighting blue
eyes

  now just to show you how it
works he went on take me for in-
stance i was just an ordinary ranch
rimrock jones



kid brought up so far back in the
mountains that the boys all called me
rimrock and i found a rich ledge of
rock i staked out a claim for myself
and the rest for my folks and my
friends and then we organized the
gunsight mining company thats the
way we all do out here-one man dont
hog it all he does something for his
friends well the mine paid big and
if i didnt manage it just right i cer-
tainly never meant any harm of
course i spent lots of money-some ob-
jected to that-but i made the old gun-
sight pay

  then-he raised his finger and
held it up impressively as he marked
the moment of his downfall-then this
mcbain came along and edged into the
company and right from that day i
lose he took on as attorney but it
wasnt but a minute till he was trying
to be the whole show you cant stop
that man short of killing him dead and
i havent got around to that yet but
he bucked me from the start and set
everybody against me and finally he
cut out lon lockhart there was a
man by joe that id stake my life on
it hed never go back on a friend but
he threw in with this lawyer and
brought a suit against me and just nat-
urally took-away-my-mine 

  rimrocks breast was heaving with
an excitement so powerful that the girl
instinctively drew away but he went
on scarcely noticing and with a fixed
glare m his eyes that was akin to the
stare of a madman

  yes took it away and heres how
they did it he went on suddenly striv-
ing to be calm the first man i staked
for after my father and kinfolks was
l w lockhart over here he was a
cowman then and he had some money
and i figured on bidding him in so i
staked him a good claim above mine
on the mountain and sure enough he
came into the company he financed
me from the start but he kept this

claim for himself without putting it in
with the rest well as luck would have
it when we sank on the ledge it turned
at right angles up the hill up and
down she went-it was the main lode
of quartz and wed been following in
on a stringer and rich oh my it
was rotten

  he paused and smiled wanly then
his eyes became fixed again and he
hurried on with his tale

  i was standing out in front of my
office one day when tuck edwards
the boy i had in charge of the mine
came riding up and says

  rim theyve jumped you
whos jumped me i says
andrew mcbain and l w he
says and i thought at first he was
crazy

  jumped our mine i says how
can they jump it when its part their
own already

   theyve jumped it all he says
they had a mining expert out there
for a week and hes made a report
that the lode apexes on l ws claim
i couldnt believe it l w id
made him he used to be nothing but
a cowman and here he was in town
a banker no i couldnt believe it
and when i did it was too late theyd
taken possession of the property and
had a court order restraining me from
going onto the grounds not only did
they claim the minebut every dollar
it had produced-the mill the hotel
everything and the judge backed
them up in it what kind of a law is
that 

  he leaned forward and looked her
in the eyes and mary fortune realized
that she was being addressed not as a
woman but impersonally as a human
being

  what kind of a law is that he
demanded sternly and took the answer
for granted

  that cured me he said after
this heres the only law i know


the popular magazine

  he tapped his pistol and leaned back
in his chair smiling grimly as she gazed
at him aghast

  yes i know he went on it dont
sound very good but its that or lay
down to mcbain the judges are no
better-theyre just promoted lawyers

  he checked himself for she had risen
from her chair and her eyes were no
longer scared

  excuse me she said my father
was a judge and rimrock reached
for his hat

  whereabouts he asked groping
for a chance to square himself

  oh-back east she said evasively
and rimrock heaved a sigh of relief

  aw thats different he answered
i was just talking about the terri-
tory well say ill be moving along

  he rose up quickly but as he started
for the door a rifle cartridge fell from
his torn pocket it rolled in a circle
and as he stooped swiftly to catch it
the bullet came out like a cork and let
spill a thin yellow line 

  whats that she asked as he
dropped to his knees and he an-
swered briefly

  gold

  what-real gold she cried rap-
turouslv gold from a mine oh
id like-

  she stopped short and rimrock
chuckled as he scooped up the elusive
dust

  all right he said as he rose to
his feet ill make you a present of
it then and he held out the cartridge
of gold

  oh i couldnt she thrilled but he
only smiled encouragingly and poured
out the gold in her hand

  its nothing he said just the
clean-up from a pocket i run across
a little once in a while

  a panic came over her as she felt
the telltale weight of it and she hastily
poured it back

  i cant take it of course she said
with dignity but it was awful good
of you to offer it im sure

  aw what do we care  he protested
lightly but she handed the corked
cartridge back then she stood off and
looked at him and the huge man in
overalls became suddenly a croesus in
her eyes

  is that from your mine she asked
at last and of a sudden his bronzed
face lighted up

  you bet it is-but look at this
and he fetched a polished rock from
his pocket thats azurite he said-
nearly forty per cent copper im not
telling everybody but i find big chunks
of that and ive got a whole mountain
of low grade whats a gold mine com-
pared to that

  he gave her the rich rock with its
peacock-blue coloring and plunged
forthwith into a description of his find
now at last he was himself and to
his natural enthusiasm was added the
stimulus of her spellbound wondering
eyes he talked on and on giving all
the details and she listened like one
entranced he told of his long trips
across the desert his discovery of the
neglected mountain of low-grade cop-
per ore and then of his enthusiasm
when in making a cut he encountered
a pocket of the precious peacock-blue
azurite and then of his scheming and
hiring american-born mexicans to lo-
cate the whole body of ore after which
he engaged them to do the discovery
work and later transfer the claims to
him and now half finished with no
money to pay them and not even food
to keep them content the mexicans had
quit work and unless he brought back
provisions all his claims would go by
default

  ive got a chance he went on
fiercely to make millions if i can only
get title to those claims and now by
grab after all ive done for em these
pikers wont advance me a cent
rimjck jones



 how much would it cost she
asked him quickly to finish the work
and pay off the men 

  two thousand dollars he answered
wearily but it might as well be a
million

  would-would four hundred dol-
lars help you

  she asked it eagerly impulsively al-
most in his ear and he turned as if he
had been struck

  dont speak so loud she implored
him nervously these women in the
hotel-theyre listening to everything
you say i can hear all right if you only
whisper would four hundred dollars
help you out

 not of your money answered
rimrock hoarsely no-ill never
come to that

  he started away but she caught him
by the arm and held him back till he
stopped

  but i want to do it she persisted
its a good thing-i believe in it-and
ive got the money

  he stopped and looked at her al-
most tempted by her offer then he
shook his great head like a bull

  no he said talking half to him-
self i wont do it-ive sunk low
enough but a woman nope i wont
do it

  oh quit your foolishness she
burst out impatiently i guess i know
my own mind i came out to this coun-
try to try and recoup myself and i
want to get in on this mine no
sentiment understand me im talking
straight business and ive got the
money-right here 

  well what do you waht for it
he demanded roughly if thats the
deal whats your cut i never saw you
before nor you me how much do you
want-if we win

  i want a share in the mine she
answered instantly i dont care-
whatever you say

  well ill go you he said now

give me the money and ill try to make
both of us rich

  his voice was trembling and he fol-
lowed every movement as she stepped
behind her desk

  just look out the window she said
as he waited and rimrock turned his
head there was a rustle of skirts and
a moment later she laid a roll of bills
in his hand

  just give me a share she said
again and suddenly he met her eyes

  how about fifty-fifty-an undivided
half he asked with a dizzy smile

  too much she said im talking
business

  all right he said but so am i

chapter iv

as a loan

  rimrock jones left town with four
burroloads of powder some provisions
and a cargo of tools he paid cash for
his purchases and answered no ques-
tions beyond saying that he knew his
own business no one knew or could
guess where he had got his money-ex-
cept miss fortune and she would not
tell from the very first she had told
herself that the loan was nothing to
hide and yet she was too much of a
woman not to have read aright the bea-
con in rimrocks eyes he had spoken
impulsively and so had she and they
had parted as it turned out for months

  the dove that had crooned so long
in the umbrella tree built a nest there
and cooed on to his mate the clear
rainless winter gave place to spring and
the giant cactus burst into flower it
rained short and hard and the desert
floor took on suddenlya fine mat of
green and still he did not come he
was like the rain this wild man of the
desert-swift and fierce then gone and
forgotten once she saw his mexican
the old bearded juan with his string
of shaggy burros at the store but he
brought her no word and went off the


the cpocpulacr magazine

next day with more powder and pro-
visions in his packs

  it was all new to mary fortune this
stern and barren country and its peo-
ple were new to her too the women
for some reason had regarded her with
suspicion and her answer was a patri-
cian aloofness and reserve when the
days work was done she took off her
headband and sat reading in the lobby
alone as for the men of the hotel
the susceptible young mining men who
passed to and fro from gunsight they
found her pleasant but not quite what
they had expected-not quite what
dame rumor had painted her they
watched her from the distance for she
was undeniably good looking-and so
did the women upstairs they watched
and they listened which was not the
least of the reasons why mary fortune
laid her ear phone aside no person
can enjoy the intimacies of life when
they are shouted ill-advisedly to the
world

  but if when she first came to town
worn and tired from her journey she
had seemed more deaf than she was
mary fortune had learned as her hear-
ing improved to artfully conceal the
fact there was a certain advantage
in that unfriendly atmosphere in being
able to overhear chance remarks but
no permanent happiness can come from
small talk and listening to petty asides
and for better or worse mary took
off her harness and retired to the world
of good books she read and she
dreamed and quite unsuspected she
looked out the window for him

  the man there is always a man
some man for every woman who
dreams rimrock jones had come once
and gone as quickly but his absence was
rainbowed with romance he was out
on the desert far away to the south
sinking shafts on his claims-their
claims he had discovered a fortune
but strong as he was he had had to
accept help from her he would suc-

ceed this fierce ungovernable desert
man he would win the worlds con-
fidence as he had won her faith by his
strength and the bold look in his eyes
he would finish his discovery work and
record all his claims and then-well
then he would come back

  so she watched for him furtively
glancing quickly out the window when-
ever a horseman passed by and one
day behold as she looked up from
her typing he was there riding by on
his horse and as he passed he looked
in under the shadow of his hat and
touched a bag that was tied behind his
saddle he was more ragged than ever
and one hand had a bandage around it
but he was back and he would come
she abandoned her typewriting-one of
those interminable legal papers that mc-
bain was always leaving on her desk
-and stepped out to look down the
street

  the air warm and soft was spiced
with green odors and the resinous tang
of the greasewood the ground dove in
his tree seemed- swooning with passion
as he crooned his throaty kwoo kwooo
it was the breath of spring but trop-
ical sense stealing it lulled the brain
and bade the heart leap and thrill this
vagabond this rough horseman with his
pistol and torn clothing and the round
sack of ore lashed behind who would
ever dream that an adventurer like him
could make her forget who she was 
but he came from the mine she had
helped him to save and the sack might
be heavy with gold so she watched
half concealed until he stopped at the
bank and went striding in with the bag

  as for rimrock jones he rode by
the saloon and went direct to l w
the banker it was life or death as far
as the tecolote was concerned for his
four hundred dollars was gone that
had given him the powder to shoot out
his holes to the ten feet required by
law and enough actual cash to pay his
mexican locators and make a legal
rimcrock jones



transfer of the claims but four hun-
dred dollars will not last a lifetime and
rimrock jones was broke he needed
more money and he went perforce to
the only man who could give it it
would be a fight for l w wras stub-
born  but rimrock was stubborn him-
self

  l w he said when he found the
banker in his private office in the rear
you used to be white and i want you
to listen before you spit out what youve
got in your craw you may have a
grievance and i dont deny it but re-
member ive got one too no it isnt
about my mine-i wouldnt sell you
one share in it for your whole little jim-
crow bank ive done my first work
and ive recorded my claims and ill
offer them-somewheres else all you
know is gold and before we go any
further just run your eyes over that
he dumped the contents of his bag
on the polished desk and l w blinked
as he looked it was picked gold quartz
of the richest kind with jewelry speci-
mens on top and as l w ran his
hand through it his tight mouth relaxed
from its bulldog grip on the cigar

  whered you get it he grunted
and rimrocks eyes flashed-as he an-
swered shortly

  my mine

  how much more you got

  l w asked it suspiciously but the
gold gleam had gone to his heart

  about two tons of the best scat-
tered around on the different dumps
and a whole scad more that will ship
i knew you wouldnt lend on anything
but gold ore and i need money to pay
off my mexicans ive got to have
some ore bags to sack that picked rock
in and hire freighters to haul it in
then theres the freight and the mill-
ing and with one thing and another i
need about two thousand dollars
oh two thousand dollars seems
to me observed l w ive heard
that sum mentioned before

  you have dad-burn ye and this
time i want it whats the matter-
aint that ore good for it ail 

  it is if youve got it but ive come
to the point where i dont place abso-
lute confidence in your word

  oh you have said rimrock sar-
castically that sounds like some law-
yer talk you mightve learned it from
apex mcbain when you was associated
with him in a deal i wont say what
deal but refreshing your memory now
aint my word as good as yours 

  he gazed intently at the hard-visaged
l w whose face slowly turned brick
red

  now to get down to business went
on rimrock quietly i tell you that ore
is there if youll loan me the money
to haul in that rock ill pay you back
from my check and ill give you my
note at one per cent a month com-
pounded monthly and all that i guess
a man that can show title to twenty
claims that turn out picked ore like that
-well hes entitled perhaps to a little
more consideration than you boys have
been showing me of late

  l w sat silent his burning eyes on
the gold the cigar clutched fiercely in
his teeth-then without a word he
wrote out a check and threw it across
the desk

  much obliged said rimrock and
without further words he stepped out
and cashed the check and then rim-
rock jones disappeared

  the last person in gunsight to hear
what had happened was mary fortune
she worked at her desk that day in a
fever of expectation now stopping to
wonder at the strange madness that pos-
sessed her now pounding the harder to
still her tumultuous thoughts she did
not know what it was that she ex-
pected only something great and rtewt
and wonderful something to lift her
at last from the drudgery of her work
and make her feel young and gay
something to rouse her up to the wild


the popular magazine

joy of living and make her forget her
misfortunes to be poor and deaf and
alone--all these were new things to
mary fortune but she was none of
them when he was near what need
had she to hear when she could read
in his eyes that instant admiration that
a woman values most and poor
the money that she had given had
helped him perhaps to gain millions

  she worked late that afternoon and
again in the evening she made an ex-
cuse to keep her office lit up still he
did not come and she paced up the
street even listened as she passed by
the saloons-then overwhelmed with
shame that she had seemed to seek him
she fled to her room and wept the
next day and the next she watched and
listened and at last she overheard the
truth it was andrew mcbain the
hard fighting scotchman who told the
dreadful news-and she hated him for
it always

  well im glad hes gone he had
replied to l w who had beckoned him
out to the door hes a dangerous
man-ive been afraid of him-youre
lucky to get off at that

  lucky yelled l w suddenly for-
getting his caution he touched me
for two thousand dollars  do you call
that lucky  and heres the latest-
he hasnt got a pound of picked ore
even took away what he had and that
old whiskered mexican says he up and
borrowed that from him 

  thats a criminal act exclaimed
mcbain exultantly as he signaled l
w to be calm sh-h-h not so loud
the girl might hear you let him go
and hold it over his head

  no ill kill the dastard howled
l w rebelliously and slammed the
door in a rage

  a swooning sickness came over mary
fortune as she sat waiting stonily at
her deck but when mcbain came back
and sat down beside her she typed on
automatically as he spoke then she

woke at last as if from a dream to
hear his harsh discordant voice and a
sudden resentment a fierce passionate
hatred swept over her as he shouted
in her ear a hundred times she had
informed him politely that she was not
deaf when she wore her ear phone and
a hundred times he had listened impa-
tiently and gone on in his sharp rasp-
ing snarl she drew away shudder-
ing as he looked over some papers and
cleared his throat for a fresh start and
then without reason that he could ever
divine she burst into tears and fled

  she came back later but the moment
he began dictating she pushed back her
chair and rose up

  mr mcbain she said tremulously
you dont need to shout at me i give
you notice-i shall leave you on the
first

  it was plainly a tantrum such as he
had observed in women a case pure
and simple of nerves but andrew
mcbain let it pass she could spell-
a rare quality in typists-and was fa-
miliar with legal forms

  ah my dear miss fortune he
began propitiatingly i hope you will
reconsider im sure its a habit i
have when dictating a brief to speak
as though addressing the court per-
haps under the circumstances you
could take off your instrument and my
voice would be-ahem-just about
right

  no it drives me crazy she cried
in a passion it makes everybody
think im so deaf

  she broke down at that and mcbain
discreetly withdrew and was gone for
the rest of the day it was best he
had learned when young women be-
came emotional to absent himself for
a time and the next day sure enough
she came back smiling cheerfully and
said no more of leaving her job she
was in fact more obliging than before
and he judged that the tantrum had
passed
rimrock jones



  with l w however the case was
different he claimed to be an indian
in his hates and a mining engineer
dropping in from new york told a
story that staggered belief rimrock
jones was there the talk of the town
reputed to be enormously rich he
smoked fifty-cent cigars wore an enor-
mous black hat and put up at the wal-
dorf hotel not only that but he was
in all the papers as associating with
the kings of finance so great was his
prestige that the engineer in fact had
been requested to report on his mine

  a report  shouted l w what
-a report on the tecolotes well i
can save you a long dusty trip in the
first place rimrock jones is a thor-
oughpaced scoundrel not only a liar
but a crook and in the second place
these claims are forty miles across the
desert with just two sunk wells on the
road i wouldnt own his mines if you
would make me a present of them and
a million dollars to boot i wouldnt
take them for a gift if that mountain
was pure gold hows he going to haul
the ore to the railroad now listen
my friend ive known that boy since
he stood knee-high to a toad and of all
the liars in arizona he stands out pre-
eminently as the worst

  you question his veracity then 
inquired the engineer as he fumbled
for some papers in his coat

  question nothing raved l w
im making a statement hes not
only a liar-hes a thief he robbed
me the dastard he got two thousand
dollars of my money without giving me
the scratch of a pen

  well thats curious broke in the
engineer as he stared at a paper hes
got your name down here as a refer-
ence

chapter v

the prodigals return

  it is an engineers duty when he is
sent out to examine a mine to make a

report on the property regardless the
fact that the owner is a liar and a thief
does not necessarily invalidate his
claims and an all-wise providence has
on several occasions allowed such crea-
tures to discover bonanzas so the en-
gineer hired a team and disappeared on
the horizon and l w went off buying
cattle

  a month passed by in which the der-
elictions of rimrock were capped by
the machinations of a rival cattle buyer
who beat l w out of a buy that would
have netted him up into the thousands
disgusted with everything l w
boarded the westbound at bowie junc-
tion and flung himself into a seat in
the half-empty smoker without looking
to the right or left he was mad-
mad clear through-and the last of his
cigars was mashed to a pulp in his vest
he had just made this discovery when
another cigar was thrust under his nose
and a familiar voice said

  try one of mine

  l w looked at the cigar which
was undoubtedly expensive and then
glanced hastily across the aisle there
smiling sociably was rimrock jones

  l w squinted his eyes yes rim-
rock jones in a large black hat a
checked suit rather loud and high
boots his legs were crossed and with
an air of elegant enjoyment he was
smoking a similar cigar

  dont want it snarled l w and
rising up in a fury he moved off to-
ward the far end of the car

  oh all right observed rimrock
ill smoke it myself then and l
w grunted contemptuously

  they rode on for some hours across
a flat joyless country without either
man making a move but as the train
neared gunsight rimrock rose up and
went forward to where l w sat

  well whatre you all bowed up
about  he inquired bluffly has your
girl gone back on you or what 

  go on away answered l w dan-


the popular magazine

gerously i dont want to talk to you
you thief

oh thats whats the matter with
you-youre thinking about the money
eh  well you always did-hate to lose
an insulting epithet burst from l
ws set lips but rimrock let it pass

  oh thats all right he said never
mind my feelings say how much do
you figure i owe you 

  you dont owe me nothing cried
l w half rising you stole from
me you scoundrel-i can put you in
the pen for this

  aw you wouldnt do that an-
swered rimrock easily i know you
too well for that

  say you go away panted l w
in a frenzy or ill throw you out of
this car

  no you wont either said rim-
rock truculently youll have to eat
some more beans before you can put
me on my back

  rimrock squared his great shoulders
and his eyes sparkled dangerously as
he faced l w in the aisle

  now listen  he went on after a
tense moment of silence whats the
use of making a row i know i lied to
you-i had to do it in order to get the
money i just framed that on pur-
pose so i could get back to new york
where a proposition like mine would
be appreciated i was a bum in gun-
sight but back in new york where
they think in millions they treated me
like a king

  i dont want to talk to you rum-
bled l w moving off you lied once
too often and ive quit ye

  all right answered rimrock that
suits me too all i ask is-whats the
damage 

  thirty-seven hundred and fifty-five
dollars snapped back l w venom-
ously and id sell out for thirty-seven
cents

you wont have to said rimrock

with business directness and flashed a
great roll of bills

  theres four thousand he said
peeling off four bills you can keep
the change for pilon

  there was one thing about l w-
he was a poker player of renown and
accustomed to thinking quick tie took
one look at that roll of bills and waved
the money away

  nope keep it he said i dont
want your money-just let me in on
this deal

  huh grunted rimrock for four
thousand dollars you must think ive
been played for a sucker no four
hundred thousand dollars wouldnt give
you a look-in on the pot that ive
opened this trip

  wy you lucky tool exclaimed l
w incredulously his eyes still glued
to the roll whats the proposition
rimmy  say you know me rim 
yeh sure i do answered rim-
rock dryly and l w turned from
bronze to dull red i know the whole
bunch of you from the dog robber up
and this time i play my own hand i
was a sucker once but the only friends
ive got now are the ones that stayed
with me when i was down

  but  helped you rim cried l w
appealingly didnt i lend you money
time and again

  yes and here it is replied rim-
rock indifferently as he held out the
four yellow bills you loaned me
money but you treated me like dirt-
now take it or ill fam it down your
throat

  l w took the money and stood
gnawing his cigar as the train slowed
down for gunsight

  say come over to the bank-i want
to speak to you he said as they
dropped off the train

  nope cant stop answered rim-
rock curtly got to go and see my
friends

  he strode off down the street and
rimrdck jones



l w followed after him beckoning
feverishly to every one he met

  say rimrocks struck it rich he
announced behind his hand and the
procession fell in behind

  straight down the street rimrock
went to the alamo where old hassa-
yamp stood shading his eyes and while
the crowcj gathered around them he
took hassayamps hand and shook it
again and again

  heres the best man in town he
began with great feeling an old-
time arizona sport there never was
a time when i was down and out that
my word wasnt good for the drinks

 and hassayamp hicks divining
some great piece of good fortune in-
vited him in for one more

  heres to rimrock jones he said
to the crowd the livest boy in this
town

  they drank and then rimrock drew
out his roll and peeled off an impres-
sive yellow bill

  just take out what i owe you he
said to old hassayamp and let the
boys drink up the rest

  with that he was gone and the
crowd scarce believing stayed behind
and drank to his health not a word
was said by rimrock or his friends as
to the source of this sudden wealth
for once in his life rimrock jones was
reticent but the roll of bills spoke for
itself he came out of wroo chongs
restaurant with a broad grin on his
face and looked about for the next
man he owed

  you can talk all you want to he
observed to the onlookers but a chink
is as white as they make em and any
man in this crowd he added impres-
sively that ever loaned me a cent all
he has to do is to step out and say so
and he gets his money back-and then
some

  the crowd surged about but no one
stepped forward strange stories were

in the air resurrected from the past
of rimrock and the way he paid when
the gunsight mine after many diffi-
culties began to pay back what it had
cost rimrock had appeared on the
street with a roll and then as now
he had announced his willingness to
pay any bill good or bad that he owed
he stood there waiting with the bills
in his hand and he paid every man
who applied he even paid men who
slipped in meanly with stories of loans
when he was drunk but he noted them
well and from that day forward they
received no favors from him

  ah theres the very man im look-
ing for exclaimed rimrock in span-
ish as he spied old juan in the crowd
and striding forward he held out his
hand and greeted him ceremoniously
old juan it was of whom he had bor-
rowed the gold ore that had coaxed the
two thousand dollars from l w-and
he had never sent the picked rock back

  how are you juan  he inquired
politely in the formula that all mex-
icans love and your wife rosita
is she well also yes thank god i
am well myself where is rico now
he is a good boy truly will you do
one more thing for me juan

  si si senor answered juan def-
erentially

  rimrock smiled as he patted his
shoulder you are a good man juan
he said a good friend of mine-i
will remember it now get me an ore
sack-a strong one-like the one that
contained the picked gold

  un momento smiled juan hurry-
ing off toward the store and the mex-
icans began to swarm to and fro some
reward they knew was to be given to
juan to compensate him for the loss
of his gold his gold and his labor and
all the unpaid debt that was owing to
him and his son and the rest the
streets began to clatter with flying hoofs
as they rode off to summon el pueblo


the populah magazine

and by the time old juan returned with
his sack all mexican town was there

  muy bien pronounced rimrock as
he inspected the ore sack now come
with me amigo

  amigo juan went and all his friends
after him to see what el patron would
do something generous and magnifi-
cent they knew very well for el
patron was a gentleman muy caballero
he led the way to the bank still in-
quiring most solicitously about juans
relations his children his burros and
so on and juan sweating like a packed
jack under the stress of the excitement
answered courteously as one should to
el patron and clung eagerly to his
sack the crowd entered the bank
and as l w came out rimrock placed
juans sack on the table

 bring out new silver dollars fresh
from the mint he said and fill up
this sack for juan

  santa maria exclaimed juan fer-
vently as the cashier came staggering
forth with a sack and rimrock took
the bag containing a thousand bulging
dollars and set it down before him he
broke the seal and as the shining silver
burst forth he spilled it in a huge wind-
row on the table

  now fill up your ore sack he said
to juan and all you can stuff into it
is yours

  for a gift faltered juan and as
rimrock nodded he buried his hands in
the coin the dollars clanged and rat-
tled as they spilled on the table and a
great silence came over the crowd
they gazed at old juan as if he were
an aladdin or ali baba in his treasure
cave old gray-bearded juan who
hauled wood for a living or packed
cargas on his burros for el patron
yes here he was with his fists full
of dollars piling them faster and faster
into his bag

  now shake the bag down sug-
gested el patron and perhaps you can
get in some more

  some more panted juan and
quite mad with great riches he stuffed
the sack to the top

  very well said rimrock now
take them home and give part of the
money to rosita then take what is
left in this other bag and give a fiesta
to the boys who worked for me
make way cried juan and as the
crowd parted before him he went
staggering into the street a few shiny
dollars heaped high on the top fell off
and were picked up by his friends
they went off together old juan and
his amigos and l w came over to
rimrock

  now listen to me flenry jones he
began  but rimrock waved him away 

  i dont need to he said i know
what youll say-but juan there has
been my friend

  well you dont need to spoil him-
to break his back with money when
ten dollars will do just as well

  yes i do said rimrock didnt
i borrow his picked rock  well keep
out hen i know my friends hell
be drunk for a month and at the end
of his fiesta he wont have a dollar to
his name but as long as he lives he can
tell the other hombres about that big
sack of money he had

  rimrock laid down one big bill which
paid for all the dollars and walked out
of the bank on air he was feeling rich
-that wealthy feeling that penny
pinchers never know-and all the world
except l w lockhart seemed respon-
sive to his smile men who had shunned
him for years now shook his hand and
refused to take back what they had
lent they even claimed they had for-
gotten all about it or had intended their
loans as stakes with his pockets full
of money it was suddenly impossible
for rimrock to spend a dollar in the
alamo saloon where his friends were
all gathered in a determined assault on
the bar his popularity was so intense
rmrck jonbs



that the drinks fairly jumped at him
and he slipped out the back way to
escape there was one duty more-
both a duty and a pleasure-and he
headed for the gunsight hotel

  the news of his success whatever it
was had preceded him hours before
andrew mcbain had hid out the idle
women were all atwitter but mary
roget fortune was calm she had
heard the news from the very first
moment when l w had dropped in
on mcbain but the more she heard
of his riotous prodigality the more it
left her cold his return to town re-
minded her painfully of that other time
when he had come she had watched
for him then her knight from the des-
ert worn and ragged but with his sack
full of gold but he had passed her by
without a word and now she did not
care

  she looked up sharply as he came
at last a huge form half blocking the
door and rimrock noticed the change
perhaps his sudden popularity had
made him unduly sensitive-he felt in-
stinctively that she did not approve

  do you mind my cigar he asked
stopping awkwardly halfway to her
desk and he suddenly came to life as
she answered

  why yes since you ask me i do

  that was straight enough and rim-
rock cast his fifty-cent cigar like a sto-
gie out of the door then he came
back toward her with his big head
thrust out and a searching look in his
eyes she had greeted him politely but
it was not the manner of the girl he had
expected to see somehow without
knowing why he had expected her to
meet him with a different look in her
eyes it had been there before but now
it was absent-a look that he liked very
much in fact he had remembered it
and thought apropos of nothing that
it was a pity she was so deaf he
looked again and smiled very slightly
but no the look had fled

chapter vi

rimrock passes

  in the big moments of life whenwe
have triumphed over difficulties and
quaffed the heady wine of success there
is always something-or the lack of
something-to bring us back to earth
rimrock jones had returned in a
christmas spirit and had taken gun-
sight by storm he had rewarded his
friends and rebuked his enemies and
all those who grind down the poor he
had humbled l w and driven mcbain
into hiding and now this girl this deaf
friendless typist had snatched the cup
from his lips the neatly turned speech
-the few well-chosen words in which
he had intended to express his appre-
ciation for her help-were effaced from
his memory and in their place there
came a doubt a dim questioning of his
own worth what had he done or
neglected to do that had taken that
look from her eyes he sank down in
a chair and regarded her intently as she
sat there composed and still

  well its been quite a while he
said at last since ive been round to
see you

  yes it has she replied and the
way she said it raised a more poignant
question in his mind was she miffed
perhaps because he had failed to call
on her that time when he came back to
town  he had borrowed her money-
she might have been worried that time
when he went to new york

  i just got in a little while ago-
been back to new york about my mine
well its doing all right now and ive
come around to see you and pay back
that money i owe

  oh that four hundred dollars
why i dont want it back you were
to give me a share in your mine

  rimrock stopped with his roll half
out of his pocket and gazed at her like
a man struck dumb a share in his
mine he put the money back and


the populjr magazine

mopped the sudden sweat from his
brow

  well now say he began ive
made other arrangements ive sold a
big share already but ill give you
the money-itll come to the same
thing he whipped out his roll and
smiled at her hopefully but she drew
back and shook her head

  no she said i dont want your
money i want a share in that mine
she faced him determined and rim-
rock went weak for he remembered
that she had his word he had given
his word and unless she excused him
he would have to make it good and
if he did-well right there he would
lose control of his mine

  say now listen a minute he be-
gan mysteriously im not telling this

on the street-

  well dont tell it here then she
interrupted hastily theyre listening
most of the time

  she pointed toward the door that led
to the hotel lobby and rimrock tip-
toed toward it he was just in time
as he snatched it open to see mcbain
bounding up the back stairs and a
woman in a rocker after a guilty stare
rose up and moved hastily away

  well well observed rimrock as
he banged the door i dont know
which is worse these women or peeping
andrew mcbain are you still work-
ing for that fellow he inquired con-
fidentially as he sat down and spoke
low in her phone and for the first time
that day the smile came back and dwelt
for a moment in her eyes

  yes she answered i still do his
work for him whats the matter-
dont you fully approve

  her gaze was a challenge and he let
it pass with a grin and a jerk of the
head

  just sorry for you he said youd
better take this money and get a job
with a man thats half white

  he drew out his roll and counted out

four thousand dollars and laid them be-
fore her on the desk

  now listen he began that four
hundred then was worth four thousand
to me now i had to have it and i sure
appreciate it-now just accept that as
a payment in part

  he pushed over the money but she
shook her head and met his gaze with
resolute eyes

  not much she said i dont want
your money and whats more i wont
accept it i gave you four hundred dol-
lars-all the mofley i had-to get me a
share in that mine and now i want it
i dont care how much but i want a
share in that mine

  rimrock shoved back his chair and
once more the sweat appeared on his
troubled brow he rose up softly and
peeped out the door then came back
and sat very close

  whats the idea he asked has
some one been telling you who ive got
in with me on this deal well whats
the matter then  why wont you take
the money ill give you more than
you could get for the stock

  no all my life its been my ambition
to own a share in a mine thats why
i gave you the last of my money-i had
confidence in your mine from the start
well what did you think then in-
quired rimrock sardonically when i
jumped out of  town without seeing
you youd have sold out cheap if
idve come to you then but now every-
body knows ive won

  never mind what i thought she
answered darkly i took a chance and
i won

  say youre strictly business now
aint you observed rimrock and mut-
tered under his breath how much of
a share do you expect me to give you 
he asked after a long anxious pause
and her eyes lit up and were veiled

  whatever you say she answered
quietly and then i believe you men-
tioned fifty-fifty-an undivided half
rimrdck jones



 my-god exclaimed rimrock
starting wildly to his feet you dont
-say you didnt think i meant that
why no she said with a faint
flicker of venom i didnt to tell you
the truth thats why i told you i was
talking business but you said  well
so am i 

  well holy jehosophrats cursed
rimrock to himself and turned to look
her straight in the eyes

  now lets get down to business
he went on sternly what do you
want and where am i at

  i want a share in that mine she
answered evenly-whatever you think
is right

  oh thats the deal you dont want
fifty-fifty you leave what it is to
me

  thats -what i said from the very
first and as for fifty-fifty-no cer-
tainly i donot

  there were tears half of anger gath-
ering back in her eyes but rimrock
took no thought of that

  oh you dont like my style eh
he came back resentfully all you
want out of me is my money

  no i dont she retorted i dont
want your money i want a share in
that mine 

  say who are you anyway burst
out rimrock explosively are you
some wise one thats on the inside
thats none of your business she
answered sharply you were satisfied
when you took all my money

  thats right agreed rimrock rub-
bing his jaw reflectively thats right
it was no questions asked now say
im excited-i ought not to talk that
way-i want to explain to you just how
im fixed i went back to new york
and organized a company and gave one
man forty-nine per cent of my stock
he puts up the money and i put up
the mine-and run it absolutely if i
give you any stock i lose control of

my mine so im going to ask you to
let me off

  he drew out his roll-that banded
sheaf of yellow notes that he loved so
dearly to flash-and began slowly to
count off the bills

  when you think its enough he
went on ponderously you can say so
but i need all that stock

  he laid out the bills one after an-
other and the girl settled back in her
chair thats ten -he observed-
these are thousand-dollar bills-well
theres twelve then-ill make it thir-
teen he glanced up expectantly but
she gave no sign and rimrock dealt
impassively on well fourteen-lots
of money say how much do you
want fifteen thousand-you only
gave me four hundred sixteen seven-
teen-well you get the whole roll but
say girl i cant give you that stock
he threw down the last bill and faced
her appealingly but she answered with
a hard little laugh

  youve got to she said i dont
want your money i want one per cent
of your stock

  what-of what ive got left oh
of the whole capital stock well that
only leaves me fifty per cent

  thats one way of looking at it
now look at it another way dont you
think im entitled to that  dont you
think if id said when i gave you that
money all i want is one per cent of
your mine-dont you think now hon-
estly that youd have said all right
and agreed to it on the spot

  she looked at him squarely and the
fair-fighting rimrock had to agree
though reluctantly that she was right

  well now that youve won when
nobody expected you to now that
youve got money enough to get the
whole town drunk is that any reason
why you should come to a poor typist
and ask her to give up her rights im
putting it frankly and unless you can


the cppulacr magazine

answer me i want you to give me that
stock

  well all right ill do it answered
rimrock impulsively i promised you
and thats enough but youve got to
agree not to sell that stock-and to vote
it with me every time

  very well she said ill agree not
to sell it-at least not to any one but
you and as far as the voting goes
i think we can arrange that ill vote
for whatever seems right

  no right or wrong challenged
rimrock instantly im not going to
be beat out of my mine

  what do you mean  she demanded

i hope you dont think-

  never mind what i think an-
swered rimrock grimly i got bit
once and thats enough i lost the old
gunsight just by trusting my friends
and this time im not trusting any-
body

  oh youre one of these cynics these
worldly-wise fellows that have lost all
their faith in mankind ive seen
them before but it wasnt much trou-
ble to find somebody else that theyd
wronged

  she said the words bitterly with a
lash to her tongue that cut rimrock
jones to the quick it had always been
his boast that there was no man or
woman that could claim he had done
them a wrong and he answered back
sharply while the anger was upon him
that he was not and there was no such
thing

  well if thats the case then she
suggested delicately but with a touch
of malice in her smile it seems rather
personal to begin now with me and
take away my right to vote did this
man in new york when he bought into
your company agree to vote with you
right or wrong well then why should
i wasnt my money just as necessary

when i gave it to you as his was when
he gave it later

 oh- rimrock choked back an

oath and then fell back on personalities
to refute her maddening logic

  say your father was a judge he
burst out insultingly was he a pro-
moted lawyer too or did you learn that
line of talk from mcbain

 never mind about that you
havent answered my question wasnt
my money just as necessary as his it
was yes you know it well then
why should you choose me for the very
first person that you ever intentionally
wronged 

  well by grab moaned rimrock
slumping down in his chair as he saw
his last argument gone it was a black
day for me when i took that four hun-
dred from you id have done a heap
better to have held up some chinaman
or made old l w come through and
to be trimmed by a woman well
gimme your paper and ill sign what-
ever you write

  she drew in her lips and gazed at
him resentfully then sitting down at
her typewriter she thought for a min-
ute and rattled off a single sentence
rimrock took the paper and signed it
blindly then stopped and read what it
was

  i henry rimrock jones for value re-
ceived hereby agree to give to mary roget
fortune one per cent of the total capital
stock of the tecolote mining company

  yes all right he said youll get
your stock just as soon as i get it from
the east and now i hope youre sat-
isfied

  yes i am she answered and
smiled cryptically

  well i pass he exploded and
struggling to his feet he lurched out

the peppercorn entail

by frederick irving anderson
author of sterling exchange  the mouse hole etc

concerning a young master of one hundred millions in securities and one thousand
millions in directorates whose immediate object was the restoration of what he con-
ceived to be the piratical gains of his illustrious sires a story of new york of to-day

a few steps off broadway and
a stones throw from that part
of fifth avenue known as the
trough-since the myriad gar-
ment workers of the neighborhood have
taken to congregating there in tribal
units the while they consume their mid-
day meal-stands an unpretentious red
brick building of one story and attic
wearing a nicely polished brass plate
with the magic legend-the ayles-
worth estate

  it is a matter of notable surprise
even to the seasoned new yorker to
encounter this staring yet dignified sign
in this by-street otherwise entirely con-
sumed with the shouts of truck drivers
the rattle and slam of packing cases the
whir of sewing machines from open
windows and the cry of hucksters in
many tongues beguiling the noonday
throng into unwonted extravagance

  yet the legend speaks for itself
there is only one aylesworth family
as has been the case for eight genera-
tions-since the first aylesworth was a
gardener on the old chelsea road
which has long since been wiped out of
existence almost of tradition for
eight generations the aylesworth fam-
ily has passed itself and its fortunes on
to an only son and its fortunes hav-
ing grown quite considerable-into in-
terests in fact-the aylesworth name
inevitably arrests the eye and challenges
speculation to the casual metropolitan
a p

the name calls up a somber magnificwjit
yet smoky edifice somewhat like ttit
bank of england in wall street where
the reigning aylesworth has from time
immemorial sat in state in his swivel
chair and nodded or turned down his
thumbs as his spirit or his spleen moved
him

  at one oclock in the afternoon on
the eighteenth of august of the present
year a young man tall and slender and
swinging a stick a little overdressed
the look of the world in his eyes and a
quizzical expression playing about the
corners of his mouth stood on the pave-
ment contemplating first the immacu-
lately polished white marble steps-as
prim as a quaker entry-and second
the mirrorlike brass sign with its por-
tentous legend his satirical survey
took in the barred windows the nail-
studded door even the well-scoured
bricks before he deliberately mounted
the steps and entered

  in the seclusion of an inner office sat
a second young man before a mahogany
desk engrossed in the consideration of
a bowl of brown milk and a tin of pa-
tent predigested biscuits the milk on
its silver salver had been brought to
this table for this hour at a cost that
would sustain any soul among the two
hundred thousand nibbling onions
cheese and dried fish at the other end
of the block for a week the biscuits
bore the imprint of a well-known manu-


the popular magazine

facturer who could he have guessed
that his product was the sole solid food
served dailv to this man would have

   m	j

spent a years profits in advertising that
fact for this sallow puffy and alto-
gether insignificant individual was none
other than francklyn aylesworth
eighth of the line and sole master of
a great many millions his father re-
cently dead had been a grim humorist
during the greater part of his life but
in nothing had he been so grim as in
naming this son his residuary legatee
after the tradition of the aylesworths

  the second generation usually solves
the problem of hoarded wealth by
playing ducks and drakes with it very
seldom do millions constituting a fam-
ily name persevere after the third gen-
eration the aylesworth fortune dis-
tinguished from other great fortunes in
many things differed from them in
nothing so much as having persisted in-
tact now to the eighth generation

  the eighth of the line however
seemed to offer a prospect for the ducks
and drakes francklyn aylesworth wras
not the gilded youth commonly associ-
ated with such contingencies he was
quite the reverse the family lawyers
mcwethy milson  hatch in pri-
vate diagnosed his weakness as in-
growing conscience and with their
fences in repair were calmly awaiting
the catastrophe young mr ayles-
worth master of one hundred millions
in securities and one thousand millions
in directorates shunned the grimy mar-
ble palace downtown but instead at
his desk in this by-street he was con-
triving the most astounding plans for
pulling down the pillars of the temple so
carefully reared by his ancestors his
immediate concern was the restoration
of what he conceived to be the piratical
gains of his illustrious sires franck-
lyn the eighth lacked the humor even
in its grimness of his predecessors

  the somewhat flamboyant visitor to
the outer office found himself con-

fronted by a wall of brass wicker simi-
lar in its proportions to the entry to the
tombs-with which he was not un-
familiar on the opposite side of the
window sat a youth at a table the
young man passed in his card with the
information that his business was with
mr francklyn aylesworth

  concerning what asked the youth
at the table without looking up from
his task which was sheet writing for
the office baseball pool

  i wish to know said the young
man if by any chance he possesses a
lock which will fit this key

  he drew from an inner pocket a
metal case itself notable for an elabo-
rate lock which fastened its two halves
together opening this he produced a
great key of wrought iron evidently
fashioned at some remote period by a
blacksmith with the crude tools of a
forge the youth took the proffered
key and still without looking up he
called loudly a second youth ap-
peared

  james he said can you tell me
offhand how many doors mr ayles-
worth possesses 

  thirteen hundred and forty-six
responded janies as solemn as an owl
stealing a look at the flashy young man
at the wicket it was the truth or at
least approximately so this little of-
fice was the funnel through which fil-
tered the rents of some thirteen hun-
dred domiciles business and domestic
which constituted a considerable
though not a major portion of the
aylesworth fortune

  please see if this key fits any of the
locks said the sheet writer passing
over the ponderous bit of metal the
young man will wait

  thank you said the caller on the
other side of the wicket taking off his
hat and fanning himself as he looked
for a seat and at the same time he
added from a corner where he found
graceful repose will you please give
the teppecrcocrn entail



me a statement of my account in pep-
percorns compounded to date

  huh said the youth at the table
now for the first time looking up and
examining the caller he was im-
pressed regardless of his gay attire
the young man challenged attention be-
cause of his build-broad and spare at
the shoulders narrow at the hips with
ears laid close to the skull and tight
curly hair it was the cut of a light-
weight aspirant which the youth in-
stantly recognized

  peppercorns he said
peppercorns repeated the caller
from over a morning paper which he
was now reading the youth shoved
aside his tally sheets and went over to
the head bookkeeper with whom he
held whispered converse occasionally
glancing at the caller and significantly
tapping his brow together they ex-
amined the engraved card

  peppercorns  said the bookkeeper
and he straightway sought out the office
manager

  peppercorns said the office man-
ager peering out through a crack in the
door at the languid figure in the corner
he at length tapped lightly on the door
leading to the outer defenses of the
young man at that moment sorrowfully
sipping his brown milk and nibbling his
patent biscuit mr priestly secretary
to the head of the house took the card
and the key listened to the whispered
explanation and in turn ejaculated
peppercorns  peppercorns

  he too tiptoed out for a glimpse of
the extraordinary caller who to all ap-
pearance was content to await the test-
ing of the key and the compounding of
his tally in peppercorns until the crack
of doom

  then softly the secretary tapped on
the mahogany panels and at the sound
of a soft-spoken enter admitted
himself to the inner shrine there was
no occasion for whispering yet priestly

whispered holding the card under the
nose of mr francklyn aylesworth as
he confided his message

  francklyn aylesworth did not wait
for him to finish he rose with such
precipitation as to all but upset his bowl
of certified milk and snatched the key
from the hands of his man his fingers
were trembling as he held it up to the
light of the window he took a second
key from his office safe and compared
the two critically they were identical
-except for one detail the key which
the young man had produced from its
elaborate strong box bore the unmistak-
able signs of age great age the ring
was all but parted at its outer arc as
though the constant caressing of salty
fingers had slowly burned a way
through the iron of which it was fash-
ioned aylesworths key had been
forged by modern skill and tools
though its design was ancient and a
replica of the other calmness in the
face of great emergencies was the domi-
nant characteristic of eight generations
of this house no aylesworth had ever
before faced an emergency such at this
though in their time they had wrecked
railroads and browbeaten kings
francklyn aylesworth carefully put
away his own key laid the second at his
elbow and sat down to his biscuits and
milk

  i will see him he said show
him in

  then rising with sudden determina-
tion no i will bring him myself

  for all his ingrowing conscience
francklyn aylesworth was not with-
out guile he could not have been the
son of the mighty seven who had gone
before without possessing guile his
unusual procedure in seeking out the
caller instead of awaiting him in his
sanctum in state with his back to the
light was a compromise between his in-
growing conscience and his genetic
guile he strode through the corridors
through the brass gate to the corner


the pocpular magazine

where the somewhat overdressed young
man was still immersed in his paper

  mister-ah- began the head of

the house of aylesworth and then as
if the name had slipped him-which it
had not-he consulted the card mis-
ter stewart calthorpe  he inquired

  the young man continued reading to
the end of some absorbing bit of news
before he turned

  yes he said i have sent my card
to mister francklyn aylesworth

  i am francklyn aylesworth

  the young man apparently was ill
prepared for this announcement as he
surveyed the soft yellow personage be-
fore him at first as though in surprise
then obviously with a sudden embar-
rassment for the moment he continued
seated then he sprang to his feet and
began lamely

  i beg your pardon  i beg your par-
don  i-i-i- you understand-

i think i have never seen your picture

now-your father- he ran on

getting better use of his tongue now
your father-i was familiar with his
face and bearing

  with undisguised impertinence he
took stock of this master of millions be-
fore him the recent francklyn ayles-
worth was a great bull of a man beside
whom his son was as so much over-
weaned veal the son of the great
house saw the look appraised it and
was not offended as a matter of fact
he rather took pride in his flabbiness
played on it in his self-appointed role
of jesuitical justice so he reached out
and took this young man who had come
with a key seeking peppercorns by the
arm and led him into the innermost
sanctum and begged him to be seated
they sat for some time neither speak-
ing regarding each other the master of
the ayleswrorth millions peering out
through eyes that glistened earnestly
with the call of his conscience and the
claimant of peppercorns waiting with

a languorous ease of some confident
feline

  so you are stewart calthorpe

  the caller admitted it with a nod and
a smile

  you are-the-eighth--of the line

  the seventh we have been longer-
lived than the aylesworths

  the assumption of equality was per-
fect

 undoubtedly you have your
proofs

  that goes without saying said the
other easily this is what has de-
layed me otherwise he smiled i
should have been here earlier i had
the proofs he said lounging deeper
into his chair and balancing one elbow
 top of his slender cane eight
months ago but and again he smiled
oddly i studied your fathers picture
-and i decided it were more prudent
to wait

  for me

  stewart calthorpe nodded

  yet we have been waiting for you
a long time said the young master not
insensible to the subtle flattery since
-let me see-since 

   corrected the caller

  yes quite true -two hundred
and four years there have been great
changes since that time you will
scarcely recognize the place i am
afraid

  for the first time young francklyn
aylesworth permitted himself to smile
and his visitor noting the smile drew
himself together a little closer they
surveyed each other again in silence
aylesworths gaze sought a framed map
of the island of manhattan on the wall
before him calthorpe followed his
eyes and studied the thing attentively
toward the lower end of the island
enveloping fourteenth street north and
south and extending from union
square well over to the north river an
irregular section had been blocked out
in red ink it consisted possibly of
the vewetrcocrn entail



four hundred acres though one seldom
thinks of new york real estate in terms
of acres any more than one thinks of
cut diamonds in terms of pounds it
was this demesne which had been
turned over some two centuries before
by the notorious pirate calthorpe to the
keeping of his francklyn ayleswythe
for a consideration of twenty pepper-
corns per annum aylesworth turned
from his contemplation of this kingdom
on which the fortunes of his house were
founded and took from a drawer a
neatly bound bundle of papers

  you were born the seventeenth of
november  he said reading

  the sixteenth of june  cor-
rected the visitor still intent on the
map

  your father was the reverend stew-
art calthorpe curate in the village of
wolden surrey he died in  at
the age of seventy-two his son was
educated against his own inclinations
for the church and in  following
a series of escapades the last one of
such a nature as to shock the elder cal-
thorpe into a stroke of apoplexy he
was withdrawn and for several years
nothing was known of his whereabouts
we have another record here begin-
ning with the boer war when stewart
calthorpe enlisted in the th surrey
y eomanry-

  northumberland corrected the
young man

  and-following some details which
i shall not recount-he was listed
among the missing at maegersfontein

  i deserted and came scot-free
through johannesburg

  yes yes so it appears this stew-
art calthorpe was five feet ten in his
stockings he weighed one hundred and
sixty-five pounds he had light-blue
eyes brown hair a scar from a bolo
on his left thigh and a strawberry mark
under the hair just forward of his right
ear you see mr calthorpe we have
pursued some rather diligent inquiries

during the last eight months seeking a
possible heir to the ancestral-ah-
freebooter shall we say

  you seem to have acquired a con-
siderable mass of misinformation said
the visitor imperturbably the straw-
berry mark is in front of the left ear
-and the bolo wound on the right leg
you put me at a disadvantage sir
francklyn aylesworth rubbed his
hands and wrinkled his flabby face in
another smile at which the young man
in the chair tightened his muscles again
imperceptibly

  and now said the sole heir and
residuary legatee of the leaseholds in-
closed in the blood-red square on the
map of the city i suppose you have
come for your peppercorns

  yes

  only twenty a year so the-ah-
tradition runs compound twenty for
two hundred and four years said
francklyn aylesworth ruminatively
gazing intently at the bronze ceiling
do you know he said leaning for-
ward and smiling you remind me of
the wise man who when the king
sought to reward him for a great serv-
ice said sire place one grain of wheat
on the first square of the chessboard
two on the second four on the third 
and so on through the sixty-four we
have a big wheat crop this year mr
calthorpe but it would not have satis-
fied him possibly we can make ac-
counting in some other medium than
peppercorns

  he laughed aloud at his own jest
your great-grandfather fifth re-
moved sailed for england in  his
ship never touched shore

  seventeen-twelve corrected the
peppercorn claimant imperturbably
his ship never touched shore but he
was not lost at sea

  indeed i have spent a great deal
of money trying to establish that fact
mr calthorpe

  i could have saved you the trouble


the popular magazine

responded the young man and he took
a packet of papers from his pocket and
laid them before the young master
you will find it all there those docu-
ments of course are duplicates he
added with an almost imperceptible
curl of the lip

  duplicates naturally said the
young master and he pushed the packet
into an open drawer you have no
idea how much you interest me

  he was shipwrecked-touched shore
-made one of those horrible journeys
across continents to which sailors of
the old days were subject-and he sur-
vived long enough to leave a son-and
a story of possessions in the new
world-the story which has been
handed down from father to son as a
tradition is to the effect that he made
a deed of rent in writing and confided
it to the security of a vault on the
premises

  a deed of rent-in writing ex-
claimed francklyn aylesworth sud-
denly sitting erect calthorpe nodded

  a vault on the premises it is in a
vault on the premises 

  it was-so the story runs
aylesworth let the implication pass
the peppercorn claimant all his cards
face up on the table was calmly study-
ing the map on the wall

  you are a very-pardon me-a very
ingenuous person mr calthorpe we
have always had records of course of
our original ancestor religiously paying
twenty peppercorns each year to a
rather phantom fund entitled cal-
thorpe but we never had a record
of a deed of rent being actually in ex-
istence in writing how does it hap
pen he went on with an encouraging
smile that you have waited until a
time when five million people settled
around the old plantation before com-
ing forward

 because said the young man
blandly i am the first calthorpe with
wit enough to identify the francklyn

named ayles wythe with francklyn
aylesworth the money king of the pres-
ent day if i had any doubt it would
have been removed instantly by the dis-
covery that your agents were looking up
us calthorpes in england lately

  i feel this is going to be simple
said francklyn aylesworth rising
we are going to be of great help to
each other you say you are stewart
calthorpe the only lineal descendant of
this-sindbad the sailor i believe
you i admit i have tested you the
strawberry mark is on vour left leg
and the bolo scar is above your right
ear

  the peppercorn claimant let this last
slip pass with rather a wry smile

  now i ask you to leave your proofs
and give us time-say a week or so do
you need funds for immediate wants
i am pleased to advance them

  for just the fraction of a second in-
decision played about the eyes of the
caller

  no i am prepared for immediate
necessities in another minute he
was in the street again examining the
front of the building bearing the sign
the aylesworth estate

  hes not the safest of the family 
he was humming to himself as he
strode off down the street in blissful
unconsciousness-or seemingly so-of
the fact that two men of the office force
of the building he had just quitted had
suddenly and innocently found business
in the direction he was pursuing

ii

  the whole affair was of course gro-
tesque absurd any one who took the
pains to inquire could have learned that
the aylesworths did not own the land
in the heart of new york upon which
they had paid taxes for two hundred
years that in every pernicious instru-
ment of ground rent negotiated by them
in the last century their name had in-
the vetfxpetrcocrn entail



variably appeared as trustee still
there are laws of adverse possession
statutes of limitation and a hundred
and one usages in equity by which time
is made a means to destroy obligation

  yet francklyn the eighth as he
dropped two keys in his pocketadjusted
his hard-boiled hat and left his office
an hour later was thinking neither
of discriminatory laws nor of the ab-
surdity of the situation he was think-
ing- that he was very much pleased with
himself in the beginning he had fore-
seen that his quixotic campaign of res-
titution for the sins of his fathers must
needs be prosecuted with secrecy and
guile-even with stealth and he was
thinking sadly of how the young man
who had come like a ghost out of the
past had insisted that he had been born
on the sixteenth of june and he was
also thinking as he strode along that
hewould have to fight all alone in this
first battle of the campaign his law-
yers who regarded him somewhat as
an inexplainable runt in an otherwise
true litter would fight him to the death
with commissions in lunacy if neces-
sary

  a few minutes brisk walk brought
him to the home of his fathers it still
stands the manor house of the old plan-
tation in the midst of a neighborhood
that crowds grudgingly on all sides
with tall office buildings shoulder to
shoulder

  twenty peppercorns -was probably a
very fair valuation of the barren plan-
tation itself in the old days during
the early period there had come to be
a road cut through the alternate ridges
of rock and slough cesspools of this
part of the island connecting the old
village of greenwich with the newer
house-hewn in incongruous magnifi-
cence out of stone by english artisans
who had learned their trade over cen-
turies of building abbeys and castles
and machicolated towers-then looked
out over a dusty neighborly highway in-

stead of scrubby fields of grain the
road took a little twist at this stage so
that the fine old house erected by the
original calthorpe might face it
squarely but the originators of the
present city plan-during the fourth
generation of the tenant aylesworths-
were less considerate in their mania
to erase the circuitous cowpaths that
had come in time to affect the dignity
of streets they disregarded line fences
and ridgepoles they ran streets east
and west and avenues north and south
just a point or two off the compass and
to effect their purpose they lopped a
corner off the mansion and ran an
avenue through the grand saloon on the
first floor this mutilation was accom-
plished notwithstanding the righteous
indignation of the tenant aylesworths
who straightway turned the key in the
lock and deserted the home of their
fathers

  it still stands to-day this dog-eared
mansion viewing the passing city life
from an angle of seven degrees west
of north an ugly side wall to show
where the desecrating ax fell a stout
picket fence surrounding a dismantled
garden upon which stare sullenly four
floors of grimy windows each of many
and very small panes leaded together

  aylesworth applied a key to the rusty
lock of the gate and admitted himself
to the garden as he picked his way
among the paths-once to judge from
the outcroppings lined with brilliant
fragments of quartz and rare shells
now all but lost under the dust of ages
-passers-by stopped and peered
through the pickets wondering what
ghosts of long ago must be called to life
by the clang of the great front door
creaking on its hinges the key fitted
that of course was of little conse-
quence any one in the darkness of
night behind the shrubbery might fash-

the cpocpular magazine

simulate the effects of salty fingers ca-
ressing it over ages of time the rever-
berations were still ringing through the
dusty corridors when francklyn ayles-
worth slammed the door behind him
and advanced and peered up the great
stair well

  at five oclock that afternoon a
starved rat-after waiting for ages for
a silent figure seemingly asleep in an old
chair to show some sign of life-risked
a journey across the drawing-room
floor at midnight the same rat risked
a like journey at six in the morning
when the sun forced a sallow ray
through a dirty fanlight in the door the
young master of the house of ayles-
worth was still sitting in his chair at
nine he was back in his office in the by-
street calling for the old mayhew map
of the island of manhattan dated 
this map set forth if francklyn re-
membered with accuracy the fact that
a salt-water creek navigable by a long-
boat at high tide once poked its nose
into the very heart of the present city
of new york that estuary if tradi-
tion were correct was a very important
item in the original stewart calthorpes
traffic in rum and molasses after night-
fall it was very important in the pres-
ent emergency

  but the map was not in its usual
place nor did a long search of the
office files reveal it

  it is of no importance said franck-
lyn aylesworth if i require it i can
find a copy in marleybones surveys
which will be in the library priestly
i am going away for a time-a week--
two weeks-i dont know for how long
while i am gone relax your vigilance
over our friend say in a day or two
treat him well surfeit him with good
things-anything that money can buy
i think he is a very interesting young
man and he will probably be of great
service to us if we treat him right
and priestly put those documents in
that safe and have the safe people

change the combination keep the com-
bination in your head till i come back
so saying he walked out of the office
at the first corner he paused

  the only question in my mind he
mused pleased with the new logical
trend of his thoughts in the last few
hours is as to the confederate the
confederate as i see it must be some-
thing of an-- he paused and
smiled yes that is it he must be
something of an ass

  he caught sight of his own reflection
in a show window and he smiled
again francklyn the eighth was
slowly but inevitably acquiring some of
the grim humor of his fathers

iii

  on the fifth day following the dis-
appearance-for it was no less than a
disappearance so the legal firm of mc-
wethy milson  hatch anxiously de-
cided-of francklyn aylesworth the
young man seeking peppercorns pre-
sented himself again at the brass wicket
of the little office in the by-street he
was told politely by mr priestly that
mr aylesworth was out of town but
that the matter of his account was be-
ing pursued vigorously none the less
meantime and that he might not be put
to inconvenience by the delay incident
to cabling et cetera et cetera an ac-
count had been placed to his name in
the aylesworth bank and he was at lib-
erty to draw to such an extent as his
personal requirements necessitated if
he would put aside any objections on
the grounds of delicacy in this regard
the young master would regard it as a
personal favor

  it was ten days later that stewart
calthorpe again entered the offices of
the aylesworth estate his restless
spirit had begun to chafe

  my affairs are beginning to press
he confided to priestly i am afraid
i may be forced to put my claim into
the pevpercorn entail



the hands of attorneys unless something
definite develops shortly

  there was a veiled threat in the softly
spoken words

  i was about to suggest that course
myself said the gracious priestly if
you will pick out a firm we will be very
glad to attend to the matter of fees

  stewart calthorpe did not nominate
a firm instead he strode away con-
scious of the fact that the taste in his
mouth which had been bitter for some
time now was growing more bitter
the young man was still at the same
hotel fie had moved into more com-
modious quarters but his windows still
looked out on humdrum city life such
as one encounters in the back eddies on
either side of the main thoroughfares
one versed in the ways--and the ap-
pearances-of the world would not
have set down stewart calthorpe as a
bookish young man yet through these
weeks he had devoted himself assidu-
ously to books-though it must be con-
fessed that the reading was not of the
weightier sort calculated to improve
ones mind he saw no one except the
occasional haberdashers representa-
tives from fifth avenue sent by
priestly to urge him to profane ex-
travagances in the way of outfits of ap-
parel priestly in his endeavor to drive
the claimant out of his seclusion had
gone the length of assigning one of his
happy-days men-professional enter-
tainers attached to all great firms but
calthorpe though he recognized a fel-
low craftsman in the glorious youth
who called abstained

  all his bills were mysteriously paid
all his wants were miraculously sup-
plied if anything could have drawn
him forth from his perusal of french
novels the temptations strewn in his
path by the artful hand of priestly
should have done so but they did not
one thing only one calthorpe ac-
cepted that was the use of a racing
runabout from the aylesworth garage

it was a low-slung sportive-looking
thing stripped for action calthorpe
came out of his hermitage and tested it
out it was like flying with shrewd
eyes that saw yet seemed to see noth-
ing he had scurried hither and yon in
the popping monster he was not being
watched-so much was plain no one
could follow with such an engine at his
command this removed his last sus-
picious doubt

  but as he moved away now from the
too-obliging priestly every sense was
again on the alert with eyes in the
back of his head but outwardly still
bearing his indolent air he began the
slow task of throwing off a possible
shadow he lost himself repeatedly in
department-store crowds doubling and
redoubling on his trail a taxicab took
him to columbus circle and from a
second cab he emerged at sixteenth
street and fifth avenue and started at
a brisk walk toward the north river
some distance over he abruptly de-
scended a flight of steps into a base-
ment beer saloon dignified with the
sign the funnel it was an untidy
place with a beery smell in the air un-
clean sawdust on the floor and flies
clustering about greasy tables he took
a seat and rapped sharply with a piece
of money the funnel was not ex-
actly a thriving business center in
fact even the entry of the lone cus-
tomer did not arouse the fat german
balanced on one elbow on the bar read-
ing a newspaper

  it was not until the customer uttered
a sharp command that the host looked
up he immediately gathered together
a collection of bottles and set them
before the impatient one calthorpe
looked at him questioningly the fat
german in the act of depositing
change in the center of a wet pool on
the table shook his head as though in
answer to some spoken question and
went back to his newspaper

  at length the young man aros he


the ovular magazine

went out not by the front door but by
the rear which let him into a small in-
closed yard on two sides of which
stood the bastionlike walls of loft
buildings on the third side the rear
stood a high board fence through the
cracks of which was to be had a view
of the dismantled garden of the old
aylesworth mansion

  he descended a flight of steps these
steps were interesting in themselves
to descend them one must first ascend
three rising blocks of granite the
steps were arched over with a groin of
masonry of unusual proportions in
fact the shabby old building that housed
the funnel looked like a mere house of
straws to the massive foundations on
which it rested at the bottom of the
steps the young man paused and ex-
amined a rusty padlock on the door mi-
nutely then he opened the door not
by unlocking the thing but by the sim-
ple expedient of removing a section of
the hasp which came away easily from
the rotten wood in which it was sunk
inside there was the unmistakable smell
of salt water something a thousand
years of time cannot eradicate from
moldy timber and clay he stood still
for a long time listening but no sound
came except from the tenant rats
when he started forward it was with
the aid of a pocket torch to guide him
he came to a pile of rotten timbers in
a corner which he began removing un-
der the timbers was an old iron grating
and under the grating was a short reach
of decaying steps down which he
crawled into a subcellar so foul with
damp stenches that he breathed with
difficulty what he sought hung on the
wet wall jt was a rusty iron door
held by hinges and a lock rendered so
fragile from the ravages of time that a
slight blow would have crumbled them
to bits with the minutest care he ex-
amined the door and its fastening he
drew a sigh of disappointment he
threw the light ahead of him it re-

vealed the fact that the arched vault in
which he stood came to an abrupt end
an arms length away shut in by an
irregular wall of stone bricks and
earth evidently dumped in from above
if one consulted the old mayhew map
of manhattan island it would have re-
vealed the interesting fact that at one
time a subterranean passage connected
this spot with the manor house in the
adjoining yard doubtless the original
calthorpe had uses for such a means
of egress which connected with a water
gate by which he might put out to the
river in a longboat at high tide

  five minutes later the peppercorn
claimant had replaced the iron grating
and the pile of decaying timbers on the
cellar floor and carefully reset the hasp
of the unsprung padlock

  the taproom of the funnel had in
his brief absence lost its lonesome air
seated at the tables or lounging against
the bar now wtere perhaps a dozen
porters men in blue jeans who had been
busy trundling trucks in the street when
calthorpe had entered a short time be-
fore they did not appear to be par-
ticularly intelligent men nor curious
either but it would be just as wrell not
to give them grounds for curiosity
this resolve was strengthened by a
movement on the part of the now busy
german he caught sight of the peer-
ing face of the young man in the rear
door and he cautiously batted one eye
two hundred years ago old sindbad
the sailor who for reasons of his own
constructed this retreat had more than
one way out when he felt honest he
could leave by the front door the
peppercorn claimant at the present mo-
ment felt honest and the impetuous
young rnan in another moment had
vaulted the rear fence and let him-
self in to the old mansion fronting on
the next street as he entered the
main corridor on the drawing-room
floor he was thrilled by a discovery as
momentous to him as must have been
the cpecppercocrn entail



the discovery of the footprint by old
robinson crusoe on his desert island
for there on the floor in this old rook-
ery so long tenanted only by rats lay
a scattered heap of empty condensed-
milk tins also a handful of empty bis-
cuit tins

  and peering cautiously round the
door jamb he was electrified by an even
more momentous discovery a figure
which could be none other than that of
young francklyn aylesworth lay at
rest in a fnusty old easy-chair his hat
drawn over his eyes as though he were
asleep

  stewart calthorpe was stealthily re-
volving for flight on tiptoe when the
well-known voice of aylesworth broke
the silence

  well well said the voice at
last i had begun to think mr cal-
thorpe that this business about a mur-
derer revisiting the scene of his crime
was all bosh did you find the vault in-
tact mr calthorpe 

  the person addressed thus languidly
by francklyn aylesworth who was
stretching and yawning in his chair
stood rooted to the floor dumb for a
precious second there was only one
way out now with a bellow of rage
and a bound he was at the side of the
soft young master pinioning him the
task of overpowering one of francklyn
aylesworths physical capacity was
childs play for this lightweight aspir-
ant aylesworth did not attempt to
struggle instead when his assailant
holding him fast finally came to rest
menacingly over him francklyn said 

  if you will take the trouble to go to
that window you will see two men in
blue jeans astride a pushcart outside
the gate across the street in front of
the cigar store is a third there are
two more under the porch whom you
cannot see there are several more at
the-ah-the postern gate they all
have instructions to let you in-but not
out mr calthorpe

  the peppercorn claimant released his
fierce hold and stepped to the window
it was true there were the men in
blue jeans innocent-looking porters
there was no way out now

  well he said airily forcing a
laugh what are you going to do about
it  

  what am i going to do about it
what are you going to do about it you
mean calthorpe-or whatever your
name is-you can leave this house
alone if you want to by either gate
if you do those men have business
with you if you leave with me they
have instructions to let you go sit
down and make yourself at home in
the old place

  distinctly there was no humor in the
situation the peppercorn claimant
continued to glare savagely if there
were only a hole to crawl through he
would cheerfully have turned himself
into a worm aylesworth resumed his
seat and produced a paper from a
pocket sullenly calthorpe sat down

  here we have the deed of rent said
the young man holding the dirty paper
at arms length and surveying it crit-
ically as an antique it is admirable
except for one fact old sindbad who
was shipwrecked and suffered a hor-
rible journey across uninhabited conti-
nents before reaching his beloved eng-
land was careless enough to sign his
name in prussian blue ink now
maybe you dont know it mr cal-
thorpe but prussian blue precipitate is
a comparatively recent invention for
use as ink and howt old sindbad got
hold of it two hundred years ago is
more than i can make out

 the recent stewart calthorpe
squirmed in his chair but still he said
nothing

  would you mind telling me mr
calthorpe how you managed to secrete
this paper inside of that musty old vault
without removing the hinges no
you wont tell me very well i will


the cpopulacr magazine

tell you how i took it out without re-
moving the hinges i dug out the wall
sir and i hired a mason to put the
wall back the mason made a most re-
markable discovery the wall had been
taken out once before and put back
with portland cement very careless
of old sindbad on the second count
cement like prussian blue ink is of
comparatively recent history on man-
hattan island and how the old pirate
got hold of it before its time is more
than i can make out

  again he placed a quizzical eye on the
recent stewart calthorpe the latter
muttered something under his breath
and looked out of the window

  no calthorpe i am sorry to say
that you are not constituted tempera-
mentally for the profession you have
sought to follow in the first place
said the young master spreading out his
fingers to keep tally of his points you
were not born on the sixteenth of june
it was very wrong of you to suggest
-insist on it when you helped your-
self to the calthorpe documents which
i spent so much money to gather you
carelessly got hold of a copy full of
clerical errors mistake number one
in the second place in helping yourself
to my old  map of manhattan
island to locate your deed of rent you
forgot to return it mistake number
two number three is the grade of ink
to which we have already alluded
number four is your prehistoric use of
portland cement i ask you mr cal-
thorpe if you do not think you have
been very careless you have failed to
make allowances for accident igno-
rance and carelessness there is only
one feature in the whole affair on which
i can compliment you for astuteness

  he paused expectantly but the pep-
percorn claimant had no question to
ask

  you embarrass me said franck-
lyn aylesworth i congratulate you
on your choice of a confederate

 confederate the peppercorn
claimant looked up puzzled you
dont mean old dutch louey-the sa-
loon keeper-

  no no not dutch louey poor old
louey didnt know what you dragged
him in for i refer to the other one
the other one

  in spite of his dilemma the late cal-
thorpe could not help being curious

  yes the other one i refer to the
consummate ass you had in mind to
help you-the flabby milksop se- ob-
sessed with the idea of justice that he
wrould excavate all manhattan island
if he thought he could find a deed o
rent that would disinherit him from his
landed possessions i refer to myself
mr calthorpe

  the prisoner stared at first unbeliev-
ing at francklyn aylesworth then he
broke into a laugh in spite of himself

  i seem to have picked the wrong
generation of aylesworths he ex-
claimed writh conviction he looked at
young francklyn now with different
eyes there was nothing to do but take
his medicine well whats the dam-
age he said curtly

 damage exclaimed francklyn
aylesworth damage wthy my
dear sir there is no damage in fact
quite the reverse the diversion you
provided has been very entertaining-
and quite flattering too i assure you to
my sense of vanity i am in your debt
indeed yes will you take a little stroll
with me sir  wre will talk over your
prospects i really believe you are des-
tined for a career of honest endeavqrs
with my assistance mr-ah - - by
the way what is your name

  stewart-angus stewart

  a few minutes later the squadron of
carelessly placed guards disguised as
porters picked up their tools and dis-
persed on seeing young francklyn
aylesworth and angus stewart stroll
down the steps and up the avenue chat-
ting in the most friendly fashion

soda and a box of candy he makes a tremendous sensation in the ring a
novelty in prize-fight stories one of the funniest we have had frm witwer

a little different from the other guy if
youre diggin streets dig yours with the
handle of the pick-anybody can dig

plete name-alias the millionaire
mauler followed that line of dope and
if hed been on the level hed have made
the standard oil company look like a
bush-league sick-benefit lodge as it
was he cleaned up enough in less than
a year to pay off the mexican army

  old doc reese claims im all wrong
about pel-even though he got took
himself the doc says it was a wallop

back of the ear that landed on pels
ephus doffus loffus or somethin like
that and it changed his disposition

marlboro buildin swears is a spacious
light and airy office suite one afternoon
--tryin to kid young daniels one of
my ex-meal tickets out of makin a
touch when the office boy butts in

  one of the chorus men from the
winter garden is outside he pipes
and he claims he wants to see you
young daniels snickers and i turns
on the kid

  hes probably got the wrong joint
i says did he say he was a chorus
man 

  he dont have to the kid comes
back wait till you give him the up
and down he looks like one of them
rough-and-ready guys that poses for the
figure and once had four ginger ales at
a crack without leavin the bar if his
name aint percival its probably al-
geron dye want a flash at him
shoo him in i tells the kid you
got me interested

  the kid goes outside and in a min-
ute hes back again i dont see nobody
with him right away so i bawls
well well-bring on the roughneck

where is-

  pardon me says a soft delicate
voice i stopped for a moment to ad-


the pocpulacr magazine

mire that painting of the former cham-
pion of the heavyweights it is really a
work of art-the execution is perfect 
so was his i says what brought
you here 

  he had eased himself all the way
into the room by this time and bo me
and young daniels had somethin to
gaze upon as they say  this guy was
a good six foot and he looked like a
two-hundred pounder offhand he had
on a light summer suit of some kind
of stuff that looked like silk and it fit
him like theyd poured him in it not
only that its so far ahead of any
clothes i ever seen that i guess its
what theyll be wearin in  he had
on white shoes and you could just get
an eyeful of white silk socks with what
looked like charlotte russes embroidered
on em here and there in one hand he
carried a panama hat turned down all
the way around sos the rainll run right
off it and he wore a cane in the other
he also was there writh a red tie that
would have made a tomato seem pale
his hair is light and wavy and his face
would have made one of them massage
creams famous or a chorus girl inde-
pendent

  he stands there lookin from me to
young daniels and then he says
wliich of you gentlemen is mister
burns the noted boxing impresario
ha ha  pipes young daniels to me
somebodys been knockin you
shut up i says i dont make
that impresario thing i answers the
tall person i been called a lot of dev-
ilish names butmostly in english  im
jack burns the fight manager if thats

on me may i speak with you
alone 

   oh this guys all right i says nod-
din to young daniels if he starts
anything rough ill have the office boy

hide his hat go ahead-what have you
got

  i suppose i had better introduce my-
self first he begins lookin at dan-
iels like he figgers hes takin a chance
at that he fusses around in his coat
drags out a little trick silver box and
deals me a card with this on it

pelham warrington d

university club

  is this you i says

  he nods his head and smiles some
more

  pelham warrington hey i reads
off the name it sounds like a country
home or a pullman car to me whats
the idea of the third 

  i am the third of my house bearing
the name he explains and as the
others are living we differentiate to
avoid confusion

  oh  thats it eh  i says i fig-
ured it meant you were favored for the
show money or it was like the stars on
the sportin finals now-

  that differentiate thing is what i
like butts in young daniels wtith a
grin the next time i fall off the
wagon im goin to have one of them
if it kills me

  the other guy smiles like he knows
hes bein kidded but whats the differ-
ence

  lay off i tells daniels anybody
would think from you that bein ig-
norant was a gift mister three-star
warrington i says meet young dan-
iels

  daniels gets up and sticks out his
hand but the other guy just bows and
passes it up daniels grunts and stands
in front of him

  hey fellah he says stickin out
his chin whats the matter--dont i
belong or what 

  pel smiles and gets off to another
start

  i have been passionately fond of
athletics all my life and--
prbtty soft



  in comes daniels again

  thats the tip-off he sings out
slappin my desk with his fist and givin
pel the laugh the athletics couldnt
beat a semipro team of seven men
why connie mack is through and

  i jumps up and stands over him

  now look here you big boob i
says i aint goin to warn you no
more this guy has been here fifteen
minutes and cant get no further than
showin his card on account of you i
asked you in a nice way to lay off be-
fore-the next time im gonna bean you
with a stool

  daniels growls and looks at pel like
he wished they had somethin instead
of the chair for murder

  all right pel i says that rough-
neck aint got no manners-hes just a
poor ignorant ale hound that dont even
know how to enter a room dont pay
no attention to him youre with me
go ahead i got you-youre crazy for
the red sox or the athletics i mean
and-

  im afraid you dont follow me
smiles pel perhaps this way it would
be clearer i am a comparatively rich
man and-

  daniels moves over to the door like
he cant keep it in no longer

  rich is right he hollers with his
hand on the knob he looks as rich as
a custard to me

  and he beats it

  who is that quaint character  asks
pel after the door banged

  young daniels i says he used
to be a pretty good heavy until he
turned bar fly and started to fight the
brew he aint much now because he
cant take em in the stomach--its all
gone

  i see says pel like hes filin away
that dope in his dome well to con-
tinue-i am a wealthy man and since i
graduated from-er--yale ive spent a
lot of money in the study of one branch

of athletics that has always had a fasci-
nation for me i refer to the manly
art of self-defense

  art i says that aint no art-
thats a plea do you mean box fight-
in 

  he nods his head and pulls that lovely
smile on me again

  i reaches in the desk and extracts a
cigar

  smoke this one on me pel i says
and well get down to figures

  no thanks  he pushes it away i
havent smoked in years i find it bad
for the wind

  the door opens about an inch all of
a sudden and young daniels sticks his
nose in

  hey he says are you guys
playin checkers on me or what
gimme that dough and ill duck he
shoots a side glance at pel and laughs
aint cutey a riot though eh he
says

  but pel goes right on like were
alone on the bridge

  in short he says-in short-i
wish to enter the prize ring as a com-
petitor for the heavyweight champion-
ship and i hereby place myself in your
charge

  wow it takes me right in the wind
and i fall back in the chair but young
daniels dashes in the room and lets out
a yell

  whce he hollers this bird is a
knock-out he wants to wallop some-
body eh honest hes laughin till
the tears is runnin down his face
you git a cream puff he yells at pel
and ill git a chocolate eclair and well
whale each others brains out all over
the office ha ha he says we have
with us to-night kid marshmallow-
the dashin smashin ice-cream-sody
champion of-

  pel waves me back and walks over to
young daniels

  my man  he says in that velvety
voice of his i have permitted your


the	magazine

uncouth pleasantries out of considera-
tion for mister burns if you do not
cease instantly i will be forced to take
measures to stop you 

  he lays his hat and cane on a chair
and daniels throws up his arms winkin
at me

  coises on you jack dalton he
says hes goin to strike muh

  pel frowns

  have i your permission mister
burns he says shootin a funny look

at me

  xow i didnt want this pelham guy
beat up in my office im funny about
them things-know what i mean  and
then the agent would probably be
around the next mornin tellin me to
rehearse my gunmen out at the trainin
camp so i sticks my hand in my
pocket and pulis out a five-case note

  here i says to young daniels
get the air i cant hold this guy back
any longer hes been drinkin raw tea
or somethin somewheres and hes got
to get action you know he can han-
dle himself-he admits it and-

  do you know what this big bonehead
does he grabs up pels hat and the
trick cane and starts to walk across the
floor-liftin up the tail of his coat like
a woman does with her skirt on a rainy
day or on a busy corner

  chase me boys he says in a high
female voice im a nut sundae

  he turns around as he passes pel and

  say i dont know what kind of a
wallop it was because i didnt get to see
it-but whatever it was believe me it
was a success the floor comes right
up and smacks young daniels in the
face and he lays there as cold as zero

  that was ample for me im up on
the top of the desk before pel can set
for another one

  fine i says great you dont
need to show me no more of your work
because i seen when you come in what
a wallop you packed now-

  he starts over to me wipin off his
hands on a silk handkerchief and if the
wall paper hadnt been so smooth id
have made the ceilin easy

  i must apologize he says for
being the innocent cause of this brawl
in your office the fellow was so vul-
garly insulting that i fear i lost con-
trol--

  i dont see a thing wrong with your
control i interrupted him not a
thing you got lots of speed and a
hopon your fast one which is a pretty
good layout if youll promise to keep
your hands in your pockets where they
cant do me  harm i wont make no
cracks thatll annoy you-and-

  young daniels opens his eyes and sits
up on the floor

  so this is heaven eh he says-

his voice is still kinda cracked and he

twists around and takes a slant at me

how did you git here he says i
    ff

  he sees pel and shuts up all of-a sud-
den meanwhile gettin on his feet he
acts like a guy just cornin out of the
ether after the operation-yes and he
looks it too he eases himself past
pel very careful gets around to me and
pulls down my head

  hey he whispers in my ear this
guy is stallin he jerks his thumb
over at pel dont let him hand you
that bunk about bein called pelham
whosthis-his name is probably cyclone
mcginnis or one-round murphy no
guy with a name like he give out here
could make me take a dive you know
that hes tryin to slip somethin over
on you with that trick make-up and i
hope you aint gonna fall for no such
coarse work as that

  you fell for him didnt you i
says

  he aint got nothin ready for that-
them lowbrows are always soft for an
intelligent feller-and then pel walks
over
pretty soft



  i trust you feel no ill effects he
says to daniels givin him the old smile

  im off you- daniels comes hack
edgin away from him i dont want
no part of you never mind how i feel
-you go your way and ill go mine i
dont like to start nothin in jacks of-
fice here or id bust you one at that-

  i grabs him and lead him to the
door

  stop it i says stop stealin this
guys stuff he cant be knockin you
dead here all afternoon me and him
wants to go into one of them conference
things i opens the door you got
no kick cornin-you got a long count
and the crowd was with you at the go-
in you dont class with this guy and
the only thing you can start is a fast
gallop for the elevator good-by and
good luck i winds up and eases him
out in the hall

  an hour later pel has signed up to
battle for me money and notoriety dur-
ing and wrhile the next twelve months is
with us i didnt make him sign for
more than a year because a lot of them
guys is champs in the gym and bums in
the ring carryin a hick fighter in
your stable is about like havin a bet on
the seventh horse at the finish you
dorfet-even get a chance to cheer for
your money-know what i mean 

  the next mornin i got pel out at
hawkins road house where all my
athletes train and in half an hour most
of the newspaper bunch is up to look
him over and go back and knock i get
em together at the bar and let em have
the works on pel when i get all
through they look at each other at me
and at the ceilin without sayin a word
one guy blows his nose and another
one starts to whistle

  theres a little guy from the gazette
there named higgins hed done time
in yale or harvard or one of them col-
 a p

lege joints and hes one of them birds
that figures everything is the bunk
know what i meau -you me con-
gress the corner grocery and the sub-
way-all wrong see  he thinks the
civil war was put on for the movies
and the allies has got germany framed
to fight a fast draw higgins winks at
the rest of the bunch and says to me

  lead on friend burns take us to
the safe-deposit vault where you keep
this highbrow mauler of yours and give
us a slant at him i heard of these gen-
tleman sluggers before-they usually
think keats endymion is a patent
medicine and a pearl-gray derby tan
shoes and yellow gloves about right for
evening wear if this one dont sg
dese dose and dem and refer to
us as youse guys ill purchase for the
party

  i dont say a word-i just give that
guy a look thats all and then i give
em the sign to follow me into the gym

  pel is wallopin the punchin bag so
fast that it sounds like a steam drill
manicurin rock and the handlers is
standin around watchin him very re-
spectful away over in the corner tak-
in it all in and tryin to hide behind the
medicine ball when he pipes me is-
young daniels

  i calls pel over and introduces him
to the newspaper guys and the way he
goes through the thing makes em all
pay attention

  all except higgins

  they tell me you are a scion of an
old and aristocratic family he says to
pel a college graduate and a man of
wealth so you will excise me if i ask
you a few easy ones just to make it
look good

  say-that little runt puts pel
through a civil-service examination that
would make the third degree and the
ellis island test look like a kids spellin
bee he asks him about things that
even i never heard of and pel just
stands there smilin-leadin and coun-


the vovulatr magazine

term until hes got higgins outpointed
from here to chicago now and then
higgins tries to sneak one over in
latin that will end the thing or hell
shoot over a couple of jabs in greek
and french but pel ducks and comes
back in spanish or poetry and at the
finish hes got higgins holdin on and
wavin for the bell

  he had pel in a bad way just once
that was when he uppercut with some-
thin about a guy called george b
shaw-but pel right crosses him with
some stuff from a wop named con-
fucius and higgins goes all but out
standin up

  as pel walks back to the bag hig-
gins turns to his gang which is givin
him the loud and merry giggle

  well he says tryin to luck out of
it he took me all right-hes there
sixty ways he turns around and
takes another slant at pel i guess
hell turn out to be yellow he says
thats probably what itll be 

  can you tie that there had to be
somethin wrong accordin to that guys
dope

  now boys i says to the gang you
all know young daniels here he was
a pretty good battler when he was right
and he can still tell a left jab from
the announcer just keep your seats
for a minute and ill have the million-
aire mauler go a round with young
daniels sos you can see the latest box-
in sensation has somethin besides his
good looks

  young daniels coughs and tries to
give me the wink but i make out i
dont get him he clears his throat a
couple of times and goes psst psst
but nothin doin-im deaf i know
whats the matter-he dont want to
fuss with pel but there aint a chance
for an out unless he quits cold in front
of the reporters so he lets out a sigh
and takes off his coat reaching up on
the wall for a pair of gloves

  pel is over at the other side of the

gym punchin away at the bag again
and just as i go to call him over he re-
leases a left swing it hints the bag and
the rope breaks i remembered at the
time it had worn through the day be-
fore and was only tied together in a
loose knot

  but what im gettin at is this-that
bag just sailed across the gym whizzes
past daniels head and hits the wall
just as he turns around so the picture
he gets is pci standin there lookin
after the bag which is a good fifty yards
away layin at his feet he looks at
pel and back at the bag a couple of
times and his mouth falls open like its
on a hinge

  some wallop says one of the
newspaper guys winkin at me as pel
starts over

  you said a handful chimes in an-
other catchin on and lookin at dan-
iels why he split the wood a foot
and hes got the brass bracket all
twisted out of shape

  psst psst goes daniels tryin to
catch my eye

  just then pel sees him for the first
time-standin there with the gloves on
and as far as he can see ready to mix

  well my man says pel frownin
what do you want

  daniels backs away lickin his lips
he looks at me at pel at the reporters
and back at that bag layin at his feet
he pulls a sick-lookin grin and shakes
off one glove

  ill take a cigar-thanks he chirps

  the newspaper bunch goes in hys-
terics

  why you big ham i yells are
you gonna quit cold on me

  i aint gonna quit no he says
shakin off the other glove i can beat
that-i aint even gonna start what
dye think i am the original fall guy
aint this man-killer of yours ever
gonna fight nobody but me let him
circulate around a little will you he
says
pretty soft



  well i sneers at him all i can
say is that youre so yellow you must
have come from the canary islands

  i aint yellah im careful he
grins back and theres just two lit-
tle words that keeps me from takin a
chance at that

  what are they asks one of the
reporters

  safety first says daniels-and
beats it away from there

  the newspaper bunch goes back to
their offices each with a picture of the
millionaire mauler in his pocket and
they just let their typewriters run wild

  all but higgins

  that ford writes that the bag was
framed to break and daniels and pel
were roommates and had probably re-
hearsed the act 

  say ill bet that guy thinks some-
body is pushin the water over niagara
falls

  the first regular brawl pel has is
with a guy called terrible teddy burke
burke was one of them guys that hav-
in nothin to deliver figures they can
win by makitv ferocious faces at the
other guy

  appearances mean absolutely nothin
get me take a lobster for instance
dye think the first guy that ever saw
one wanted to eat it

  well as its pels initial appearance
in the big town as we say at the hotel
and were only goin to get three hun-
dred dollars for our part in the quarrel
i go around to terrible teddys man-
ager who drives a milk wagon as a side
line and i says

  will you fight us for one hundred
dollars 

  yes he chirps your man and
any other guys you can pick up on the
way to the clubhouse

  fine i says theres just one
thing more i want to know dye think
terrible teddy can take a dive for

fifty dollars more-say m about the
third round

  make it seventy-five dollars he
says and if hes on his feet when the
bell rings for the fourth frame ill
knock him dead with the bucket

  i finally fixed it for sixty dollars
what dye mean crooked this was
pels first start wasnt it well a
guys got to have a little enouragemant
dont he

  we catch a good crowd for the mill
the society-boxer thing havin helped a
whole lot i see a sprinklin of hard-
boiled shirts in the boxes and some of
them guys has brung their lady friends
their crowd come to see the highbrow
beat the roughneck and the regulars is
there to enjoy the slaughter of the fifth
avenue hussy by one of their own set

  wrhen pel climbs through the ropes i
notice hes kinda pale and nervous
lookin but i put it down as stage fright
and let it go at that the guys in the
boxes gives him a hand and he turns
around and bows terrible teddy
climbs in and the boys in the gallery
lets go all they got i got spider
moran and skinny yerkes two of the
best handlers that ever swung a towel
in pels corner and im right there my-
self to see that we gets the breaks
while were waitin for the announcer
pel turns to me and whispers

  i say old fellow-what is that
weird-looking liquid in the bottle
there 

  thats all right i says well
give you a shot of that in case you slow

up and-

  pardon me  he cuts me off is
there a confectioner in the vicinity

   dont make you i says

  a candy store he explains i
wish to send out for something before
this contest begins

  spider moran looks at him and
laughs theres one of them ice-
cream-sodv dives on the corner he


the popular magazine

says i seen a guy stagger out of it on
the way over here

  the very thing says pel i want
you to run over there and get me a
chocolate ice-cream soda with plenty of
sirup and some whipped cream on the
top dont forget the straws-and if
you see any nice bonbons there fresh
you know get a half pound of those
the spider like to fell over the
bucket laughin

  aint he a rioth he says to me
always makin some comical crack
and-

  come  says pel lookin at the
wrist watch he insisted on wearin right
into the ring they will sound the gong
in a moment hasten 

  dye mean to say youre on the
level with that stuff yells the spider
lookin from pel to me

  well i certainly must have a stimu-
lant of some sort before i attack this
brute over there pipes pel very in-
dignant

  before i can make a crack a news-
paper guy which is sittin in the press
box and takin this all in reaches over
and grabs me by the arm

  make him get the soda he shoots
in my ear you big bonehead-this
guy is wasted on you if he sits in that
corner and drinks the stuff itll be worth
two columns to-morrow mornin get
wise to yourself-this fellow is as sim-
ple as a fox hes new hes different

  say in ten minutes pel is sittin
there in his corner drinkin one of them
soda things with a straw and eatin bon-
bons from a box with pink ribbon on
it the bunch in the gallery and stand-
in up in the back has gone nutty and
the reporters is writin like they got to
catch an edition with the assassination
of the president

  and they had somethin to write
about believe me

  can you picture it a heavyweight
sittin in his corner at a bowery fight

club waitin for the bell-sippin an ice-
cream soda eatin candy and wearin a
zvrist watch on his left arm

  thats the reason i always say no
matter what this guy did afterward
you got to hand it to him-he was
different

  terrible teddy is such an awkward-
lookin bum that he makes pel look like
jim corbett all teddy ever had was
a wallop and as that is tied up by my
money he was like a guy in a rowboat
without any oars

  he dives in the third round-doin a
trick fall that fooled everybody that
couldnt get in to see the fight

  the crowd though seen somebody
go doum and as that was what they
paid out their dough for everybody
was happy

  except higgins

  thats gettin away with arson he
yells up to me who was that-his
brother 

  ill bet that guy believes to this day
that washington bought off the eng-
lish 

  while were gettin off pels gloves
and the crowd is millin toward the ex-
its pel whispers in my ear

  go to the box office at once and get
the remuneration due me for my vic-
tory see that it is in small bills and
hurry back-quick dont stop now to
ask questions

  i didnt this guy is over my head
but hes gettin the notoriety and thats
all i want to know but as i come
back he walks to the middle of the ring
and faces the crowd which not bein
able to figure him stops goin out and
spreads around the ring

  one moment gentlemen says pel
if you will keep your seats for a few
seconds-ah he pipes me at the ring-
side and he leans down give me the
gold  he says

  i pass it over i done like he said
about gettin it small and its all in
ones twos and fives the crowd is
pretty soft



now six deep around the ring every-
body lookin like they knew somethin
phony was goin to be pulled but as
long as theyre here they might as well
stick

  gentlemen pel goes on again
holdin up this roll of bills which looks
like the fare to egypt i did not enter
the prize ring for financial gain but
purely for the love of the sport there-
fore i could not dream of accepting
money for merely gratifying a whim
he stops and throws out his hands
look alive there  he yells

  what did he do

  he throwed that whole handful of
dough my bit and all right over the
ropes into the crowd

  can you imagine it  three hundred
beans american money and he feeds it
to the hams out in front

  and i gotta slip terrible teddy
sixty iron men for layin down

  well for a second we all stand there
in a trance then a great big five-dol-
lar bill floatin through the air lands on
some guys hat

  say youve seen a lot of riots and
football games and the six-oclock mas-
sacre at the fourteenth street subway
station aint you  well all them
things are friendly arguments along-
side of what was had as they say
around that ring them guys went
after that dough with one short yell
that like to raised the roof and then
the thing settles down to a bitin snarl-
in knock-em-down-and-drag-em-out
gang fight half a dozen little private
quarrels over a five-dollar bill or a two-
spot starts here and there and in
lessen five minutes everybodys in the
game the referee pipes two bills layin
near one of the ring posts and tries a
quick snatch but somebody got him on
the chin and he went over the ropes like
a divin seal terrible teddys seconds
has left him flat and theyre down
there on the floor somewheres doin
their little best and then terrible

teddy which is hangin over in his
chair supposed to be unconscious from
the awful wallop he didnt get takes a
flash at whats cornin off and in an-
other minute hes in there tryin-
shootin over swings and hooks that
would have knocked pel out of the
state if hed used them a few seconds
before

  me im up against the ropes tryin
to clear my head while these guys is in
there battlin for my money the last
thing i heard was higgins going out
the door

  ill bet that dough is stage money
hes tellin a friend

  that guy dont believe lincoln was
shot-he thinks hes hidin some-
wheres 

  the reserves stopped the riot half an
hour later some of the losers went to
the hospital and the others wound up in
the night court

  outside the club pel takes out a lit-
tle notebook and a pencil and says

  i say you know i really couldnt
accept that money to-night old chap
im half sorry though that i stirred
those people to such an extent but

  yes i butts in i got you-i know
just how you feel you figured theyd
get together and hold a spellin bee with
the winner takin all now i didnt
get in that party back there myself not
bein invited or nothin-and i know
them guys didnt leave nothin on the
floor or id go back and look for it
what im gettin at is-where do i get
mine  the fight game may be the way
you get your pleasure but its different
with me-thats how i get my room
and board

  thats just what im marking down
here old fellow says pel smilin
pleasantly ill have my quarterly
check within a few days and i will at
once pay you your percentage on to-
nights adventure meanwhile im
afraid ill have to ask you to advance
f

the popular magazine

me a small sum say a thousand until
my next engagement

  i stops dead and looks at him but
hes as serious as typhoid fever

  do you think you can get by on a
thousand i asks him i gives him a
sarcastic look with it but he only
smiles back

  oh yes he chirps for a week or
so i should say i dont mind rough-
ing it a bit for a time-the training
camp has rather accustomed me to it
well pel i says i hate to dis-
appoint you but im afraid i cant quite
come through with a thousand i
never carry no small bills with me it
tips you off as a piker when you pull
em out but ill tell you what ill do
-ill stake you to a two-case note
until you get your alimony or what-
ever it is youre figurin on

  say he laughs and takes me by the
arm and all the way back to the camp
he gives me the work his stuff was
the greatest i ever heard on the level
that guy could have made a bartender
vote for prohibition

  what did i do  i slipped him a hun-
dred beans at the door of the gym and
if it had been two blocks farther away
hed have got my scarfpin

  the next mornin all the sports the
papers took any serious notice of was
pels first start the night before them
newspaper guys hadnt missed a trick
and most of them throwed in a few
acts that didnt come off sos to be sure
they got everything covered one guy
had pel placed as the young million-
aire that strangely disappeared after
leavin college and the amount of
dough he throwed away run all the way
from three hundred dollars to three
thousand accordin to what edition you
had

  that afternoon i get phone calls and
wires from every manager in the world
that had anything that looked like a
heavyweight in their stable they
wanted to fight pel all the way from

one round to a hundred-they knew
the mob that would turn out for a
chance at some of the change pel
throwed over the ropes would pay their
feed bills for the next couple of years

  i pick out three of the worst hams
that ever sat in a comer and signed pel
up with them

  pel goes to the post with the first
one before a crowd that could have
elected a socialist president our per-
centage calls for nine hundred dollars
and at the last minute i gets to this
guy-and for an extry one hundred and
fifty dollars he promises to call it a day
in the second round

  hey  well it was only his second
start wasnt it you gotta boost a guy
along at first you know

  but this boob wants to make it look
good as he aint goin to be there long
and he cops pel on the jaw in the first
round

  down goes the millionaire mauler
like a submarine

  he stays down the legal limit and
when he comes up hes got im look-
in for an out written all over his
face

  the other guys so surprised at the
success hes had he come near forget-
tin that one hundred and fifty dollars
and levelin em all from then on but
pel stalls through the round and
durin the short rest i get the other
guys eye

  he claims a foul and quits in the
next round

  but it was awful close believe me
and it got me thinkin i dont know
much about how to behave at a din-
ner and stuff like that but box fightin
is my dish this guy cant take it i
tells myself and whats more he
zvont

  the crowd has got in close around
the ring and front places is goin to
the guys with the best wallops i look
up from where im sittin and theres
the manager of the club climbin
pretty soft



through the ropes with a roll of bills in
each hand i tear around the side of
the ring to nail him but its too late
the mob lets out a terrible yell and i
know whats happened

  pel is feedin em that nine hundred
beans

  i cant find nobody in the box office
to strangle for givin pel that money
because theyre all takin part in the
battle royal around the ringside

  well thats the way it goes for the
next two scraps both of which is set-
ups for pel i cant get a nickel out
of him and he keeps stallin me with
that waitin-for-the-big-check stuff
hes got me stopped at every play i
make because i got so much dough
sunk in him already that im hangin
on hopin to break even on his next
start if i let him go theres a million
guys waitin to grab him up because
hes the greatest card that ever hit
broadway

  why every time he fpght the house
was sold out the day he signed articles
club managers fought writh each other
on the street for the honor of havin
him box at their club the papers was
full of him every day-he was the guy
he owned the town

  it didnt make no difference who
where or how he fought-tickets could
be from five to fifty dollars a copy and
everybody sent in

  you know the average guy is a riot
when you study him these birds
would part with say fifteen dollars to
see pel fight some bum because they
figured there was a chance of grabbin a
ten-spot maybe a handful of em when
he started to throw it awray never
mind the fact that they were goin
fifteen in the hole for the privilege of
fightin for this other money old pel
was goin to heave it away and you
never could tell what you might grab

  but pel had a new idea-brand-new
instead of him fightin he knocks cold

some bum which id paid off the day
before and the crowd that has got into
the rent money to see him perform
puts on the show themselves outside the
ring-scrappin for what was actually
my money

  and then one day pel comes to me
when i got him signed up to box terry
mitchell another ham for ten rounds

  i say he says i have decided not
to meet this mitchell person i have
toyed quite long enough with these sec-
ond-raters and i think i have demon-
strated my worth as a drawing card
par excellence to these coarse com-
mercial promoters i am about to grat-
ify my lifelong ambition in short i
want you to negotiate with the heavy-
weight champion of the world for a
finish contest with the title at stake i
will meet him as soon as he is ready
and by the way he goes on before
i get my breath i should think you
could arrange for a considerable sum
for my percentage-say fifty thousand
or so

  i started to laugh-and then i
stopped- short

  pel had remarked a pageful the
bout would draw everybody that was
this side of the cemetery and a purse
could be hung up that would stagger
europe the chance to see a worlds
champion pel and real money flooding
the arena after the scrap would have
guys breakin out of jails and hospitals
to get there

  wait-im cornin to that of
course i intended to see that pels
money-throwin arm got out of com-
mission in this particular quarrel this
was the one where it would all get
hurled at me in a hotel room some-
wheres

  but i didnt have to get my private
affairs on the billboards advertisin the
scrap did i 

  i knew we couldnt get fifty thousand
-but there was a great chance of us
grabbin twenty-five


the popular magazine

  i had a flash of pel bein advertised
to throw away twenty-five thousand
iron men to the crowd

  say would you have come to see that
scrap 

  ive always been a quick breaker-i
dont always cop but i never get left
when the gate goes up i grab my hat
and beat it up to steve lorimer the
biggest and gamest promoter in the
pastime in them days i let him have
it quick and he listens very quiet

  come around in the mornin he
says when ive shot the works and
ill let you know

  i did and he did he offers me
twenty-five thousand bones for our end
the fight is to be twenty rounds and
for the heavyweight championship of
the world the champions manager
had seen pel work and when lorimer
offered him fifty thousand he stopped
right on the street where lorimer was
talkin to him and signed the articles in
the doorway of a grocery store

  that fight comes on the fourth of
july and it was held in the open air
because that was the only place we
could get that would hold the crowd
that was willin to commit murder to
see it they tell me that trains come
rollin in for seven hours after it was
all over packed with come-ons that
wanted to be among those present

  in the dressin room i got eighty-
four handlers workin over pel and
tellin him how to fight the champ
pels noddin his head but hes got a
funny look on his face like hes thinkin
of some joke he heard last week and he
cant remember how it started off now
he makes me go out and get our
twenty-five thousand before hell start
for the ring he claims he dont want
no mix-up when the fights over and
have people which has come for miles
disappointed

  i get it and he fusses around and
packs it in a satchcl which is carried
into the ring with him

  the crowd goes crazy when they see
him and the dough bag

  after they had got the crowd where
they was ready to bite nails in half by
introducin everybody from the ward
leader to a couple of movie stars the
bell rings and the big fight is on the
crowd gives a long-drawn-out sigh of
joy and sits back to watch a fast hard-
fought battle

  one second later the fights all over

  say for one of the longest minutes
i ever lived there aint a sound and
then- well i understand a hun-
dred and six guys went deaf from the
racket

  i never seen nothin like it in my
life i get somethin in my eye and
winked-and when i look up again
pel is flat on the canvas and the
champion is walkin to his corner

  while the riot is at its height i hop
over the ropes and push through the
mob thats standin over pel in the mid-
dle of the ring nobody seen the wal-
lop nobody laiew what hit him-but
hes not only out-

  as far ast can see hes dead

  somebody yells to the crowd that
pel has croaked-the cops pour into
the ring and start to pinch everybody
in sight and theres an old-fashioned
stampede for the gates the crowd
gets out and mills around outside
swearin and threatenin

  we throw pel still dead to the
world in an auto and rush him out a
secret gate to old doc reese about the
greatest pill roller in the country

  its a fifteen-mile run and we work
over pel all the way but theres- nothin
doin i figured the champion must
have stabbed him in the heart

  well we get to the docs house and
by luck grab him in i guess he was
the only guy in the world that wasnt
at that fight the doc has pel laid on
a sofa andchases us out of the room
i grab the bag of dough and w-e get
back in the car and start for the bank
prbtty soft



with one of the handlers on each side
of me i breeze up to the cashiers win-
dow winded but happy i got twenty-
five thousand heaps in that bag and
there aint nobody can throw that away

  dont let anybody ever tell you you
cant live without breathin-i did for
three minutes

  wait there was twenty-five thou-
sand in that bag all right-twenty-five
thousand lead slugs

  we run over more guys on the way
back to doc reeses house than would
have got hit in that town in ten years
ordinarily-and we meet the old doc on
the steps

  the poor boy the poor boy he
says as i dashes up

  is he dead i yells

  no answers the doc thats -the
remarkable part of it-hes vanished

  i keels over on the steps all but out
cold

  in some manner the doc goes on
he climbed out a window while i had
left the room for a moment to melt a
tablet for a strychnine injection im
afraid hell wander around and some
harm will defall him and-

  hes probably passin sydney aus-
tralia now says a voice

  i look up and theres that higgins
guy

  well we go inside and the doc finds
that when pel climbed out that window
he had everything with him that wasnt
nailed

  i tells the doc the whole story then
just like i told it to you and when i

got all through he jumps up like hes
got the answer and it was a cinch

  thats a remarkable story he says
marvelous but i think i have the
correct diagnosis its quite beyond
reason to think that that boy-who so
generously gave his every penny to the

crowds at the ringside-is crooked-

  ha ha says higgins-pardon
me doc

  the solution is this goes on the
old doc frownin at higgins the
champion undoubtedly struck that poor
boy on the ephus doffus loffus-
thats the way it sounded to me any-
how-a nerve back of the ear and di-
rectly connected with the brain the
paralyzing of that important nerve ac-
counts for this startling change in his
character there are medical prece-
dents for my presumption

  higgins gets up looks at the doc
and yawns

  im sorry doc he says reachin
for his hat because you probably went
to a lot of trouble dopin that out also
it makes a crackajack yarn and your
diagnosis-will appear in my paper this
afternoon

  he turns around to us with his hand
on the doorknob

  but that gettin hit on the ephus
doffus loffus things is the bunk
that guy didnt get hit nowhere as
the champion pulled back his left for
the very first try-the well-known mil-
lionaire mauler took a dive

  dye know for once this guy had

author of tltjie saxons  wings of the windetc

   the first in the best series of detective stories we have had in popular
in years the plots center around raoul flack a french criminal who es-
capes from the lime pits of a tropical hell flies to america and gathers
about him a band of expert lawbreakers to make war on society

sapphires are the primordial
stones they hold in their depths
the glint of a glaciers heart a
thousand feet from sunlight
theirs the abysmal blue of that first sea
which was before a fabricator said
let there be a firmament in the midst
of the waters the chill of their birth
in the dark laboratories of earth stays
with them after they have been fash-
ioned for the eye of woman

  mrs edgerton miles was a lover of
sapphires they were in fact her pas-
sion a cold aloof woman who climbed
the social ladder with ruthless disre-
gard for fingers stepped on falterers
cast down into the darkness of sub-
merged impossibles she loved the
stone for its matching spirit the lights
in the heart of the sapphire were those
in the depths of her eyes-bitter cold
and with a rime of arctic frost amid
the glitter and gold of the horseshoe
at the opera there was no gorgeous
disdainful shadow of frozen color to
match that which was clasped about her
firm white neck the incomparable ed-
gerton miles sapphire collar was known
to have been bought for fifty thousand
dollars its stones had been gathered
by an expert in antwerp-this one rep-
resenting the sacrifice of a ruined fam-

ily to pride that once the gift of a
prince to a beloved dancer

  now these mute relics of tragedy
were all gathered together in a glitter-
ing wonder strung on gold mesh and
platinum with diamonds tucked in ara-
besques of precious metal to act as foils
for the more precious blue gems the
whole put together by a new york
jeweler to the elite represented the sac-
rifice of an american robber baron
upon an altar of chilled affections

  on a day in early november a week
before the opening of the opera season
the miles electric brougham threaded a
way through crowded traffic on nassau
street turned into maiden lane and
drew up at the curb before a jewel
house known to connoisseurs above all
the flash and pomp of larger establish-
ments on fifth avenue mrs edger-
ton miles stepped out and into a wait-
ing elevator a few minutes later she
was slipping her ermine stole from her
shoulders in the private office of the
head of the firm and that important
gentleman was hovering close in antici-
pation of her wishes mrs miles was
a good customer it was the firm of
sutton  sutton that had secured and
mounted the incomparable sapphire col-
lar

  mr sutton my husband insists that
i bring down the collar to have you ex-
amine the settings the lady spoke
tersely with proper aloofness

  mr sutton bowed admiration for mr
miles wise precaution

  of course ill have to have it for
thais next monday night you will
have it overhauled by that time i am
sure mr miles will call for it himself
id a great deal rather have him bring
it home than one of your men for in

case anything should happen- she

left unsaid the terrible weight of re-
sponsibility that would fall upon the
head of edgerton miles in case of dis-
aster

  i will insure it in my name while
it is with us mrs miles the head of
the firm hastened to assure a mere
precaution but the firm does not over-
look its responsibility he put out an
eager hand to receive the oblong rus-
sia-leather jewel case marked in gold
j c m wthich mrs miles brought
out from beneath her stole with a
flick of his thumb the cover popped up
and the full chill glory of the fifty
graded stones smote his eyes he had
not seen them except about the neck of
their owner in the horseshoe since they
left his establishment three years be-
fore just one satisfying peek he al-
lowed hitnself then turned toward the
vault in the rear of his office

  then i will tell mr miles to call
for the thing on monday afternoon
next the collars owner said in part-
ing

  everything will be finished-tight-
ened up and polished by that time mrs
miles

  before the door of the brougham had
closed behind the possessor of the fa-
mous sapphire collar mr sutton was
at his desk with a telephone receiver at
his ear he called for a number

  ah-mr miles this is mr sut-
ton i wished to tell you that-er-

you may come over to the office at any
time that suits your convenience and
we can talk over that little matter be-
tween us whats that oh yes she
brought it down she has just left
in fact right away very well mr
miles

  the senior partner of sutton  sut-
ton jewelers permitted himself a quiet
grin mr sutton did not object to
compounding a felony so long as an-
other man initiated it

  within fifteen minutes edgerton
miles stepped into his office with the
live gait of an eager man edgerton
miles was the perfect type of the gen-
teel buccaneer-as sweet a pirate as
ever scuttled a railroad or cut a divi-
dend pink and rosy tubbed mani-
cured barbered tailored with a cock-
sure eye and a booming voice edgerton
miles was a walking denial of the cate-
chism theorem of an outward and vis-
ible sign being indicative of an inward
and spiritual grace he had no inward
and spiritual grace whatever that
didnt go with his business or his moral
code

  mr sutton greeted him with the dark
smile of a conspirator closed and locked
his office door and brought out from
the vault the small russia-leather jewel
case mrs miles had just left also a
jewel tray with a blue velvet lining
upon wrhich reposed a small tissue-paper
bundle the bundle he unwrapped and
spilled from it a glittering heap of sap-
phires-fifty of them large and small
then he sprung back the top of the case
wherein reposed the sapphire collar

  uh-huh miles grunted with sat- 
isfaction i thought id never get my
wife to give up that collar business for
even a day now that youve got it
why-

  we can go right ahead mr sutton
purred mrs miles said you would
call for the collar next monday this is
tuesday so we have six full working
days ahead


the popular magazine

  miles put out a pink stubby finger
and stirred the loose sapphires gently

   theyre just the same he queried

  absolutely the senior partner af-
firmed by the greatest good luck ive
been able to get together what is prac-
tically a duplicate of the stones in mrs
miles collar now that we have the
model to work from we can turn out
a collar that mrs miles herself could
not distinguish from her own-and do
it in six days too

  well-er-the person whos inter-
ested in this business says she wont be
satisfied unless its just the same miles
mumbled you know what women
are-what they want they want but
sutton this is way on the low-down
you know if mrs m should ever get
wise-why good night for e miles
esquire

  my dear fellow mr sutton chided
you do not credit me with much dis-
cretion this little matter of business
will be absolutely confidential

  well rush it through miles rose
and buttoned his greatcoat about him
ill drop in monday afternoon and
deliver them both-in person he
gravely lowered one eyelid and made
for the door the senior partner fol-
lowed to the elevator to renew a pledge
of inviolate secrecy

  when the wall street buccaneer had
departed the senior partner seated him-
self at his desk and summoned by house
telephone his expert jewel setter the
artisan whose name wras henri en-
tered suttons office he was a squat
stolid fleming with the bowed shoul-
ders and squinting nearsighted eyes
that come from much peering through a
jewrelers glass over close work his
hands were those of an artist-delicate
sensitive instinct with the genius of
creation henri stood blinking before
his employer waiting commands

  henri i have a particularly impor-
tant and delicate piece of work for you
to do sutton began indicating with a

sweep of his hand the sapphire collar
in its box and the scattered gems on the
tray beside it here is a sapphire col-
lar of fifty matched stones here are
fifty loose stones as nearly like the orig-
inals in the setting as we can find them
i want you to duplicate this collar-
duplicate it down to the last platinum
link-and have the job done by next
monday afternoon take this collar
now for your model when you are
ready for the stones come to me

  the jewel setter tucked the russia-
leather case under his arm and started
for the door

  and henri his employer called in
afterthought you will be wise if you
say nothing about this job to the other
men in the factory henri gave a nod
of his bullet head and passed out

  because of his position as chief arti-
san of the sutton  sutton staff henri
enjoyed the dignity of a working office
cut off from the rest qfi the factory by
partitions there were his bench his
lathe melting pot and all the delicate
tools of his trade alone under the
strong light of a dazzling incandescent
henri screwed his glass into his right
eye and carefully examined the exqui-
site collar of sapphires the first dis-
covery he made was a triple line of
finely engraved script in the gold back-
ing of the three-stone pendant dropping
from the front of the collar though
this was no concern of henris-or
shouldnt have been-he took a memo-
randum from his pocket and copied on
a page therein what he read on the gold
surface

 juliana cope miles

                   east -th n y

  the second discovery was not long
in coming as he turned the collar
slowly and stone by stone under the
glass his lipspursed themselves into a
pucker and he softly whistled henris
brain was one peculiarly receptive to
matters beyond the province of his

trade because of that catholicity of
interest he had duly qualified as one
of llncomparables-a very competent
member of raoul flacks troupe of
expert lawbreakers now with mrs
miles sapphire collar slowly passing
under his sensitive eye and fingers this
quality of being able to see beyond the
rim of the cup suggested to him cer-
tain entertaining and profitable activi-
ties to follow upon the two discoveries
he had just made

  but as a conscientious workman for
sutton  sutton henri dismissed these
pleasing anticipations from his mind
and got down to the work in hand
plaster of paris became live clay under
his deft fingers a mold of all the in-
finite tracery of grape leaf and flower
twining about the jewtels in the collar
was baked in the electric oven then
with platinum and fine gold his fash-
ioning fingers were busy to make a
duplicate of mrs miles jeweled collar
within six days would require all of
henris craft and speed

  but henri did not work at night-
not at his bench that is after leav-
ing the maiden lane jewel establish-
ment at the close of the day when his
arduous task had been set for him
henri did some telephoning then took
the elevated to christopher street a
few minutes walk from the elevated
stairs brought him to the grape arbor
now the grape arbor is one of the
relics of greenwich villages elder day
before all the world flooded down into
that quiet and homy district to disrupt
its neighborhood intimacy and fill its
quaint streets with alien tongues its
ancient taproom has hot changed a cob-
web since the days when sailors-with
rings in their ears and barbarous oaths
on their tongues-used to swagger up
the crooked bypaths of the village from
the big clipper ships docked in north
river and pound their pewter mugs on
the stained oak of the bar faded lith-
ographs of the flying cloud the star

of the east and those other queens of
the tea fleet still hang above the por-
celain handles of the ale taps and the
tang of the brown liquor that comes
from the casks is as sharp as the tongue
of the crusty old glasgie man who is
the grape arbors present presiding
genius in all new york there is no
more intimate rendezvous

  henri was seated before his oysters
in the little back room when gaspard
detournelles came in the exquisite
had tempered his toilet to the demo-
cratic standards of the village there
was nothing about the man to mark him
as one more familiar with the casino
at newport than a tavern in the back-
wash of the new york docks when
the red-faced irish miss who is bar-
maid cook and waitress at the grape
arbor had served the newcomer and
they were alone in the cubby-hole called
a dining room henri went right to the
core of the matter that had prompted
the meeting he brought his memoran-
dum book from his pocket opened it
to the page whereon he had entered a
copy of the inscription on the sapphire
collar and thrust it under the others
eyes

  know her henri grunted de-
tournelles glanced at the name and ad-
dress

  assuredly i am on her social list
he answered

  do you know the jewels she wears
henri put the question as a challenge

  ofa surety

  a collar of sapphires worth say
forty or fifty thousand-you know
that the exquisites eyebrows raised
ever so slightly

  no i have never seen her wear
such a gem detournelles denied i
met her only during the summer sea-
son-last summer she was not wear-
ing her major jewels then of course
but tell me-does she possess such a
treasure a predatory flash lighted
iio

the cpocpulacr magazine

the tired eyes henri ignoring the oth-
ers question put one of his own

  your acquaintance with this miles
woman-how intimate

  sufficient detournelles gave his
shoulders a little shrug and a wry smile
turned down the corners of his mouth
-the mouth of a hunting animal
last summer she was very gracious

i	am listed for the first entertainment
she gives ches elle at her town house
here

  when is that henri inquired a
little strain of eagerness in his voice

  next monday night-the opening of
the opera a dinner at the home of
madame miles then her box in the
horseshoe

  henri almost choked on his ale he
set the mug dowrr spvittering

  next monday night you will be at
the miles house-of a surety

  come come little rabbit no more
mystery between us  detournelles at-
tempted to hide his impatience and cu-
riosity under a smile what about this
sapphire collar of mrs miles

  not a word-not a word  the lit-
the jewel setters fine hands were flut-
tering excitedly take me to the mas-
ter at once-to maitre raoul whom
you say you have seen and whose face
will be a benison for me only the
master can handle so great and so deli-
cate a situation come come we
go

  three houps later near midnight
three heads were gathered under the
grudging light of the student lamp in a
dark hotlse on one of staten islands
forgotten thoroughfares the great
wthite head of the phantom-head of an
ascetic an anchorite-nodded sagely at
each point in little henris narrative of
the afternoons affair in sutton  sut-
tons factory wrhen the fashioner of
jewels was finished the phantom spoke
very pretty-a very pretty case for
us my children

chapter ii

  on the monday set as the time limit
for its completion henri the little ar-
tificer of jewels set the finished collar
side by side with the model furnished
by mrs miles studiously lie com-
pared the two glittering wonders de-
tail by detail then nodded his head
his craftsmans soul was satisfied

  but not that other sly and predatory
instinct which dwelt in the same soul
chamber and which by its activities
had commended henri to membership
in the select circle of the incomparables
back in paris five years before a very
irregular detail of artificing had yet to
be accomplished before henri should
turn over the completed collar and the
model so irregular it was in fact
that his squinting -eyes peered like a
weasels around the corner of his office
workroom and assured him there were
no observers before he undertook it
a half hour later he trotted into mr
suttons office with two jewel cases-
the russia-leather one marked  c
m and a plain pigskin casket such as
the firm supplied for outgoing purchases
of value

  a cracking job was the vehement
approval voiced a few hours afterward
by edgerton miles when he opened the
two cases in suttons office and com-
pared the radiant twin jewels comes
high of course but got to be done
the senior partner privy to the wtall
street pirates secret motive for so ex-
pensive a deceit and mildly thrilled in
sympathy with his customers strata-
gem received a check for fifty thou-
sand dollars writh the air of a fellow
conspirator edgerton miles dropped
down in the elevator to his limousine
with the two jewel cases one in each
capacious pocket of his greatcoat

  before he went- to his home to de-
liver to the official lady of his heart
her sapphire collar edgerton miles di-
rected his chauffeur to take him else-

where in the discreet privacy of soft
lamplight he opened the pigskin case
and revealed to a cooing and platonic
helen the fulfillment of a promise more
extravagant than any made by perfidi-
ous paris

  mrs edgerton miles dinner that
evening was the perfection of an astute
hostess entertainment six guests sat
down to a wonderland of fern blos-
soms damask and silver wherein the
succession of courses was but incidental
magic and the procession of the vintage
a lure to visioning color there was on
the table but still more brilliant color
made an aura of changing lights above
the napery this from jewels about
white necks and on slim fingers daz-
zling the diamond luster and glowing
hot the heart of rubies but from the
head of the table where sat the hostess
the cold blue flames of sapphires out-
shone them all strand on strand about
mrs miles round firm neck lay the
sapphires of the famous collar dia-
monds glinting in thin pin points among
the interstices of the supporting chains

  gaspard detournelles viscount al-
laire who had the place at the hostess
right and whose attention wras franti-
cally bid for by a fluffy-headed near-
debutante and title worshiper at the
plate beyond counted that opportunity
precious which gave his eyes a feast on
the blue glory of the gems just beyond
his shoulder diplomatically he stood
off the debutante with clever verbal
fencing in order the better to bring
to bear upon mrs miles the light bat-
teries of his table talk detournelles
outdid his own clever self in the matter
of  airy banter and insidious flattery
with consummate grace he managed to
cut out for his own the almost undi-
vided attentions of the lady with the
sapphires edgerton miles from the
opposite end of the table observed with
a sardonic eye thesuccess of the grace-
ful frenchman and wished him luck

  when it came time to adjourn to the

  opera detournelles was the one to hand
mrs miles into her limousine and was
graciously invited to fill the seat beside
her a few minutes later they were
seated with the rest of the party in
the miles section of that glittering half
circle of puissance most coveted dis-
play space in america-the horseshoe
of the metropolitan musky darkness
about them and on the great stage far
down in fhe well of blackness hot love
of gypt swept to tragedy under nod-
ding palms

  detournelles had a seat directly be-
hind his hostess back of him the cur-
tains so close the great stones of the
collar that under fugitive tendrils of
hair he could see their squared sur-
faces now blue-black in the dusk of
the box

  the opera came to the final inter-
mission before the last act plumbs the
depths of tragic dissonances with
miles and the other gentlemen of the
party detournelles left the box for
the herding place of the metropol-
itans bored masculine contingent-the
lounge as he was passing the foyer
the frenchmans quick eye leaped for
an instant to a face in the crowd and
then away a most unusual and strik-
ing face it was dead white under a
high white pompadour of hair and
with a thin white goatee wire-waxed
shooting out from the heel of the chin
hollowed below the jaw sockets and
with cavernous shadows marking the
position of the eyes with all the evi-
dences of premature age and even de-
crepitude about the features there was
indomitable spirit in the carriage of
head and shoulders and the cold search-
ing gaze from the sunken eyes a but-
ton of the legion of honor in the lapel
of the black evening coat confirmed
the sharp impression of the mans for-
eign birth

his eyes met those of detournelles
as they passed in the foyer perhaps
there was just an instants swift com-

municauon in that sharp glance but
none would have been aware of it save
the one for whom the glance was meant
a short smoke and the gentlemen of
the miles party returned to the box

  when the curtain went up detour-
nelles was in his chair behind mrs
miles one arm thrown over the back
of the hostess chair he had removed
the white glove from his right hand

  the sweep of tragedy withits terri-
ble interpretation by the snarling
brasses and wailing flutes had even the
blase spectators of the horseshoe spell-
bound-all save gaspard detournelles
his eyes were not for the stage but
for the complex trickery of a jeweled
collars hasp in the light touch of his
trained fingers lay art as high as that of
massenet the burnished surfaces of
jewels now blue now black winked
invitation

  the final curtain dropped to the noise
of a great sigh over all the house
lights went up there was the rustle
and silken sweep of wraps gathered
from near-by chairs detournelles
quick to serve lifted mrs miles cloak
of silk and lace from the back of her


chair and threw it over her shoulders
he boggled the job and murmured
apology for his clumsiness for he had
the delicate confection of drapers art
turned wrong side out and while mrs
miles laughed ripplingly at a mans ig-
norance the gallant rectified his mis-
take then he stepped out of the box
ahead of the others

  the gentleman with the white hair
and legion of honor button whom
detournelles had seen in the foyer dur-
ing the final intermission stumbled
lightly against the latters shoulder in
missing a step to the level behind the
boxes for the fraction of an instant
his weight was on the younger mans
shoulder then the white-haired gen-
tleman begged pardon and passed
swiftly down the alley toward the grand
staircase detournelles turned to take

mrs miles arm he was murmuring
bits of criticism and commendation of
the performance just over

  all the gold and jewels of the horse-
shoe were flowing in a broad stream
down the staircase to the foyer and
the bedlam of the carriage starters on
the curb beyond when mrs miles put
a gloved hand to her throat and gave
a startled cry half-strangled gasp the
women of her party crowded close
about her questioning mutely she
pointed to her throat white and un-
adorned

  a little swirl in the foyer sharp ques-
tions passed over heads hurried exit
from the office of the management
press agent and head detective mrs
miles tried to hurry n to the side-
walk shaking her head mutely at the
interrogations of women crowding
about her but edgerton miles would
not let her dodge publicity he seized
her arm and brought her up sharply

  look-a-here juliana you cant
duck home this way he chided if
ouve been robbed you got to stick
around a while and give the house de-
tectives here a description of the
thing

  no no edgerton its nothing-
nothing i tell you mrs miles voice
shook with nascent hysteria ill ex-
plain to you when we get home come
the motors are waiting

  nothing a fifty-thousand-dollar
collar nothing youre talking non-
sense juliana

  a reporter began to worm his way
through the crowd he put a question
and mrs miles fled for refuge to the
dressing room the feminine contin-
gent of her box party all at sea and
knowing not what to do in the painful
circumstances followed her into retire-
ment miles his first surprise giving
way to hot anger began in a loud voice
to give the opera management an ap-
praisement both of the stolen jewels
and of the double-riveted son of sheol

who had lifted them while attend-
ants hurried to search every inch of the
miles box with electric torches the
manager of the house desirous of soft-
pedaling so painful an incident gently
insinuated miles and his male guests
into the office there they ranged
themselves in a fidgety group each man
casting dubious glances at his neighbor
all save miles suffering acute mortifi-
cation as for the evenings host he
raged without let

  the office door opened and mrs
miles in full possession of her chilling
calm stood there

  edgerton if youll calm yourself
and conduct our guests out to the mo-
tors i think we need stay here no
longer i have something to say to you

which will-

  theres nothing for you to say at
this time juliana the husband
snapped take the women home if
you like but we stay here for a while

  mrs edgerton miles was not one to
make a scene to carry a point-not in
public at least she turned to detour-
netles

  viscount will you be so good as to
escort me to my motor detournelles
bowed and stepped toward the door

 no you dont miles jumped
nimbly between his wife and his guest
facing the man with a nasty snarl on
his lips no you dont viscount al-
laire  your place is in this room with
the rest of us until we clean up this lit-
tle matter of the robbery

  mrs mics withered her husband
with a glance and closed the door de-
tournelles bowed punctiliously toward
his host and stepped back to his place
a sense of strain in the green-lit office
gripped every man there it wras in-
creased when the attendants returned
to report that there was no trace of
the missing collar in the box nor in
the alley leading to the stairs

  well miles began glowrering from
face to face of his three guests well
a p

maybe its not the proper thing in so-
ciety and it may look sort of rough
but theres only one thing to do in a

case like this and that-

  detournelles was the first to antici-
pate his meaning with a quiet smile
he shook himself out of his evening
coat passed it to the head detective
then stood in his waistcoat arms up to
be searched

  msieur miles is admirably direct-
though quite correct he murmured
in this america fifty thousand dollars
excuses-all

  the detective at a nod from miles
perfunctorily patted detournelles pock-
ets explored the evening coat and re-
turned it to him the other two men
were similarly treated when the op-
eration was finished miles vaguely
sensing the weight of insult he had
forced upon his guests essayed apol-
ogy

  of course gentlemen i may have
acted hastily but you wont hold it
against me i hope

  my dear msieur miles detour-
nelles was quick to take him up it is
my regret that you did not find the
valuable jewel on my person and so
have an end to your very natural dis-
tress

was gone-the major gear of the whole
miles machine of social flash missing
secondly he was in very bad with mrs
miles-a more or less constantly re-
curring situation but this time aggra-
vated because he knew he had invited
punishment by his boorish conduct in
the metropolitan office his lady wife
had not spoken to him since the inci-
dent and there was every promise of
an indefinite taboo on conversation be-
tween them the capstone of woe-to
throw a crumb of credit to a discred-
itable citizen-was the reflection that
only the day before he had sent the
mate to the stolen sapphire collar to a
greedy bit of fluff who had made a
monkey of him the fluff had a sap-
phire collar and edgerton miles wife
had none

  the office boy tiptoed into miles pri-
vate growling place and shoved a card
under his employers eye miles read

agency

 now roger boylan was known to
certain lawyers of high clientele as a
detective without any frills he had
no doctor to trail him on cases and ask
fool questions nor did he carry con-
cealed about his person a five-foot in-
strument for recording the blood pres-
sure of suspects under a third degree
he always refused to be all that hero
detectives are possibly because he
wanted to succeed in his business which
was detecting no piercing eye nor
gaunt nervous frame was boylans he
was well upholstered had an apple-
dumpling face with no strong points
to it whatever dressed and looked the
part of say the owner of a hardware
store in a town of ten thousand what
he did possess unqualifiedly was a rep-
utation for shrewd work a reputation
established with lawyers who had hired
him on delicate tasks one of these
miles own counsel had recommended

roger boylan to miles over the phone
and arranged this meeting

  the grouchy stock manipulator ac-
knowledged boylans greeting with
scant courtesy and indicated a chair
he plunged to the core of the inter-
view without preliminaries

  last night my wife was robbed of
a sapphire dewdab worth fifty thousand
dollars between the first act and final
curtain at the metropolitan can you
get it back for me

  i never make promises the detec-
tive answered the wrinkles of a smile
clustering about the corners of his blue
eyes why not tell me the circum-
stances then i may be able to judge of
the case

  well i havent told the police be-
cause theyll make a brass-band parade
about it miles grunted and i dont
want you to raise a hullabaloo either-
no pictures of yourself or of mrs
miles in the papers and all that sort
of stuff huh

  dont get me wrong mr miles
boylan cut him off i may not take
the case at all it depends upon whether
i think i can earn my fee now if
you dont mind describe this valuable
jewel tell me the circumstances of
your visit to the metropolitan and just
when mrs miles missed her sap-
phires

  miles his bluster blunted by the oth-
ers hint of indifference came down to
essentials he gave a description of
the collar glaringly masculine in its in-
adequacies enumerated the names and
social position of the box guests of the
night before so far as he was able-
he knew next to nothing about his wifes
friends as a matter of fact-and re-
cited the incident of the search in the
office of the metropolitan management

  you saw the collar about mrs
miles throat after you had taken your
seat in the box the detective inquired
sure miles assented gustily
stalemate

m

  did any of your guests leave the box
before the end of the opera

  huh  oh yes the men and i went
down to the lounge for a smoke before
the last act

  when you returned to the box did
you notice whether mrs miles still had
her collar

  i dont know i guess the curtain
was up when we got back and i couldnt
see

  who sat nearest to your wife if
you remember

  why that french viscount fellow
whod been playing poodle dog to her
all evening miles made no attempt
to hide his dislike for detournelles vis-
count allaire it was the inherent dis-
like of a social blunderer for a polished
squire of dames

  tell me something more about this
detournelles boylan was saying when
interruption violent as it was unex-
pected burst upon them first con-
fusion sounding from the main office
beyond the partition a womans shrill
voice crackling with anger then the
door opened with a catapult sudden-
ness and a woman-a handsome and
furious creature swathed in furs-
flounced into miles private office the
evil genius of that office nearly tipped
over with his chair at the sight with
a long stride the invader was at his
desk she slammed down upon it a
pigskin jewel case with such violence
that the cover jarred open and indigo
lights leaped from a sapphire collar re-
posing inside

  i might have known youd play the
cheap skate edgerton miles i ought
to have expected nothing better from
a four-flusher like you her voice
rasped like a dull saw and the look in
her eyes was deadly

  say look-a-here miles pulled
himself back to stability with hands
clawing at the edge of his desk who
let you in didnt i tell you never to
come down here whats all this--

  do you want tc know what this is
the flushed vixen swept a scornful fin-
ger toward the sheaf of blue lights in
the jewel case well ill tell you be-
cause of course you dont know this
is a neat bundle of paste junk-a fancy
package of near-sapphires worth just
five hundred and twenty-five dollars in
any department store-sign on them
take me home for five hundred and
twenty-five dollars this is edgerton
miles gift to a lady

  roger boylan who took a vivid in-
terest in this little colloquy unheeded
by both tried hard to keep his face
ironed out to a neutral pattern devel-
opments in the miles sapphire robbery
were interesting him mightily however
he saw a purple flush mount to miles
neck and heavy cheeks saw him reach
out to the jewel case and lift a blue
glory therefrom

  who told you these were phony
stones he snapped

  oh the expert up to tiffanys but
of course he dont know anything about
sapphires this with scorching scorn

  so you went to get the acid test
put on em eh miles face was a
thundercloud now

 considering the giver who
wouldnt a pretty nose was uptilted
to an outrageous angle one slim
booted foot tapped the floor in a men-
acing tattoo

  ya-ah consider the giver miles
mocked his lips trembling with rage
consider the duffer who separated
himself from fifty thousand bucks to
get a smile from a fancy yellow dande-
lion with a heart about as big as a two-
spot in a cold deck i guess you and
i just about separate on this corner
paste sapphires or no paste sapphires
on your way

  the vivid blond head under the fur
toque wavered on a stiff neck drooped
a little swiftly the light of battle sped
from round blue eyes and a languish-


the popular magazine

ing softness filled them red lips trem-
bled

  edgerton im sorry perhaps you
did get stung and didnt know it i

was so wrought up-

  stung is right the mans voice
was bitter theres a sign over that
door this way out

  now complete surrender came with
precipitation on the side the invader
cried copiously into a tiny square of
lace miles unheeding stepped to the
door and held it open one tear-
splashed appeal was shot at him through
wet lashes but he was adamant sud-
denly the drooping head snapped back
and a jeweled hand shot out to the pig-
skin jewel box on the desk

  ill take these along anyway the
lady said with decision

 mistake number two miles
snatched up the sapphire collar before
she could reach it and grinned malev-
olently first mistake bawling me
out second thinking you can get away
with the goods

 give me my property she
stamped her foot and made a futile
snatch at the jeweled collar

  your property-huh you just re-
turned this paste junk to me

  again tears-genuine article and
backed by whirlwind rage

  ill have my lawyer file suit for my
property youll hear from this
youll have to tell a court why you

robbed me of my property  i-i-

  file away little bright eyes re-
member ive got a witness-this gentle-
man here and good day 

  she was gone in a flurry of fox heads
and trailing silk miles shut the door
and turned to the detective

  that brings up another point con-
nected with this robbery business he
said with a weak smile i guess i
didnt quite explain all the details
well now go over and put the screws
on that hound sutton for selling me a
phony sapphire collar 

  fifteen minutes later the door of the
private office of sutton  sutton jew-
elers closed on the senior partner
miles and boylan miles wasted no
preliminaries

  ive come to get back that check for
fifty thousand dollars i gave you yes-
terday he said cocking a cigar like a
threatening bomb at the jeweler

  why-mr miles nothing unsat-
isfactory about the collar i hope
suttons thin hands fluttered nervously

  nothing cept the sapphires are
paste otherwise its a pretty little
toy

  sutton fell against the side of his
desk white as the alabastine ceiling

  impossible mr miles why i
chose every one of the fifty stones in
that collar myself id take my oath
on it theyre genuine

  take another look at em the
broker snorted tossing the woven
chains of gems on the jewelers desk
with a trembling hand sutton fumbled
in a drawer for his glass screwed it in
his eye and picked up the collar he
stepped to the window where light was
strongest and began turning the orna-
ment slowly under the glass boylan
watching him keenly saw little beads
of sweat start above the eyebrows
noted the increased trepidation of the
hands

  paste the admission came with
a groan paris paste every one of
them-even the diamond chips

  case of substitution then  boy-
lan put the question tentatively

  why it must be no other expla-
nation  the distraught senior partner
retorted

  look-a-here sutton did you sell
these stones to me for real or did you
know they were paste no monkey
business now straight talk miles
launched the question truculently
flushing to the eyes sutton turned
upon him

  youre insulting he managed to
stalemate



ejaculate i do not run a pawnshop
here

  the detective seeing the snarl miles
bullheadedness was likely to entail took
a hand

  mr miles has not told me when
he purchased this jeweled collar mr
sutton

  jt left the shop yesterday after it

had been constructed in duplicate-

sutton paused eying miles the lat-
ter nodded his head glumly after it
had beejn constructed in duplicate of one
in the possession of mrs miles

  which was stolen at the metropoli-
tan last night miles cut in the sen-
ior partner sat down hard his jaw fall-
ing stolen he murmured

  who did the work on this duplicate
collar boylan continued

  the best workman in my shop--a
flemish diamond setter i know only as
henri

  and he had mrs miles collar to
work from all the time	

  yes except of course i kept both
in the safe at night

  could he have had time to make
fifty paste sapphires-of this paris
paste as you call it-and set them in
the duplicate collar

  i dont see how he could sutton
answered the detective he had onty
six days in which to do the wrhole job
and he had to work at top speed to fin-
ish in that time

  well couldnt he have picked up
these paste stones somewhere among
the trade in xew york the detective
insisted theyre common enough
xo he could not have done any
such thing sutton answered with a
slight touch of asperity the stones
that went into the duplicate collar were
matched stone for stone with those
in mrs miles original or as near
matched as i could get them some
were of uncommon size anyway
french paste is not at all common in
the trade on this side of the water

jewelers here all go in for recon-
structed stones which are quite differ-
ent things

  that lets your little lady of the furs
out boylan said to the stock juggler
the latter who had followed with diffi-
culty the trend of the detectives ques-
tioning started with an inquiring
huh

  why if an expert diamond setter
familiar with the trade could not du-
plicate the stones in mrs miles collar
by paste ones in six days miss-er-
dandelion couldnt have taken good
stones out of her sapphire collar and
siibstituted false ones overnight miles
slowly turned this over in his mind and
nodded assent that possibility had not
occurred to him

  i think we will have a talk with this
henri if you please mr sutton boy-
lan addressed the senior partner the
latter quickly stepped to a house tele-
phone and spoke a few words into the
transmitter a knock sounded at the
door a few minutes later sutton ad-
mitted the round-shouldered artisan
who stood in his ticking work apron
squinting curiously from face to face
the detective looked up at him out of
his bland little eyes and addressed him
softly

  henri mr sutton says youre a
good judge of stones we want your
opinion on the value of some sapphires
look at these--he handed henri the
collar-and give us  your opinion on
their value

 with precise movements henri
stepped to the window picked up the
jewelers glass and with it in his eye
passed the collar in review stone by
stone after five minutes he looked

up   

  well what is your opinion henri

boylan asked

  paste the diamond setter answered
succinctly

  what kind of paste would you say 

  paris paste


the popular magazine

  you recognize this sapphire collar
do you not henri

  yes

  it is one you made just this week on
a rush order

  no

  just that monosyllable but it
straightened the backs of three men
boylan perilously near losing his poise
batted his cherubic eyes and bored in
again

  you tell us you didnt make this -
sapphire collar here in sutton  sut-
tons factory 

  i said that was henris grudging
answer

  w ell who do you suppose made it
then 

  i dont suppose i know henri
answered squinting hard at the detec-
tive franchon freres of paris made
this collar and the number is 
how do you know that boylan
wanted to know

  here is the name and number en-
graved very fine on the back of the
clasp the jewel fashioner returned
see for yourself he passed glass
and collar to the detective who found
the inscription as henri directed after
considerable search sutton was on
his feet now and must needs read the
manufacturers name too miles too
bewildered for words sat fanning him-
self with a ruler looking helplessly
from boylans face to suttons the
detective hesitated a minute then put
the question

  if this isnt the sapphire collar you

made then-

  it is the one given me to copy from
the stolid henri finished

  my wife wear paste sapphires you
say my wife wears phony jewels
miles was on his feet with a bound his
face purpling with outrage

  i dont know you-i dont know
your wife henri retorted without
heat i say this is the paste-jewel col-

lar mr sutton give me to make from
it a duplicate of genuine stones

chapter iv

  for a long minute therp was no fur-
ther word the sudden twist to the
mystery given by henris declaration
that the collar given him as a model-
mrs miles collar-contained paste
jewels left the inquisitors temporarily
groping the nimbler wits of the de-
tective were the first to draw signifi-
cant deduction from the new fact that
mrs miles should be robbed of a sap-
phire collar on the very night of its
return from the jewelers was an inter-
esting coincidence that if substitution
of genuine for imitation had not pre-
viously been made the thief would have
got paste jewels worth half a thousand
dollars instead of real stones valued
at fifty thousand was a still more strik-
ing coincidence granting as true the
jewel setters assertion that the collar
put into his hands to model from was
the false one there on suttons desk
substitution could have been made in
no other place than sutton  suttons

factory unless-

  mr miles-he turned to the
broker who was still growling to him-
self over henris revelation-do i un-
derstand that you took both collars
away from this office at the same time
and delivered them both the same aft-
ernoon-yesterday 

  miles nodded

  and you did not open either or both
of the cases-this pigskin one here or
the one in which you thought mrs
miles collar lay--from the time you
left this office until both were deliv-
ered 

  miles answered that he did not boy-
lan then turned again to henri

when you had finished with the du-
plicate collar what did you do with it 
put it in a pigskin case-one like
that the man answered indicating the
stalemate



opened casket on the desk and took
it along with the original in here to
mr sutton

  so you didnt make a mistake and
put the original collar the one with the
paste jewels in this pigskin case boy-
lan pressed

  henris eyes blinked owlishly

  why should i make a mistake when
the collar with the paris paste sapphires
was sitting all the time in a case with
the name of the owner marked inside
it-the ladys name 

 the ladys name eh boylan
seemed interested what was that
name 

   juliana cope miles no  east
-th new york henri quoted
glibly that was the inscription
the detectives eyes twinkled

  i think mr sutton we are through
with plenri he said to the senior part-
ner and the latter nodded the artificer
out of the office miles and sutton
looked expectantly into boylans bright
eyes

  well henri seems to have cleared
himself sutton ventured

  on the contrary the detective took
him up henri has proved himself one
of the crowd that got away with mrs
miles collar-that is the genuine col-
lar which was sent by design to mrs
miles in place of her paste collection
i dont make you miles cut in
first place i dont believe for a min-
ute my wife would lose a fifty-thou-
sand-dollar sapphire collar and then try
to get away with it by wearing phony
stuff shes not that kind

  mr sutton if youll give me a lit-
tle acid and a brush id like to try an
experiment boylan commanded ig-
noring the brokers challenge

  the jeweler rummaged for the re-
quired articles in a desk drawer bofy-
lan screwed the jewelers glass into his
right eye picked up the sapphire collar
and turned it to bring the gold back of
the three-stone pendant between his fin-

gers then lightly he began to touch
the surface with the brush wet in test-
ing acid the others watched him cu-
riously for several minutes the mans
roundjiead was bent to his task lit-
tle clucking noises of satisfaction came
from his lips

  i guess thats enough he said
finally and passed the glass and up-
turned pendant first to miles then to
sutton what they saw faint as hair
lines against the smeared face of the
gold was

iana c e m les

                 e th n y

  that should answer all doubt you
have about the character of mrs miles
sapphire collar boylan turned his
boyish smile on miles this was the
collar mrs miles gave you to bring
down to mr sutton to have the set-
tings tightened i thought from the
first henri wras telling the truth about
that i was positive when he rattled
off so easily the inscription which as
you see was on the collar not the case
and which he was careful to blot out
before he delivered the two collars to
mr sutton yesterday the full name
and address of a person entirely un-
known to our little jewel setter would
not have stuck in his memory unless
hed had reason to observe it carefully
he was so eager to prove his case that
he overplayed just at that point

  then this henri fella made the swap
in this shop sos one of his pals could
do the lifting at the metropolitan
miles ruminated heavily boylan
nodded

  but why swap at all the broker
continued so long as the gang knew
mrs miles sapphires were paste and
the others real why didnt they let the
real ones go-go where ltook em and
pinch the bunch there

  for one thing mr miles the de-
tective answered with a wrords-in-one-
syllable air the clever gang of which


the cpocpullcr magazine

henri is a member had a name and
address-the name and address of mrs
miles without question the man se-
lected to do the trick of lifting was
somebody acquainted with your wife-
the gang played in luck there so in-
stead of a wild-goose chase after-er
-miss dandelion-allowing they could
trace the real gems to her they played
safe by having henri make the substi-
tution right here

  then the thief was in my box last
night after all miles brought his
hand down on his knee with a slap
by gad i searched the three men at
least down to the bone and didnt
find a trace of that collar as for the

women-

  i think we can discount the women-
in this thing boylan interrupted
and you overlook the certain fact that
when the collar was slipped from mrs
miles neck the thief passed it to one
 of his pals either when you went down
to the lounge at the final intermission
or just as your party was leaving the
box who was the first man you
searched down in the managers office
why that fella detournelles the
viscount boy he offered himself to be
searched before i got the words out of
my mouth

  what is his address

  i dont know but i could get it
over the phone from my wifes social
secretary miles started for the tele-
phone but afterthought stopped him

   say look-a-here boylan he began
a sheepish grin slitting his features
youre such a clever detective youll
get me in a jam before i know it go-
ing too fast altogether thats what
youre doing i dont want anybody ar-
rested-dont want some geezer to get
on the witness stand in his own defense
and tell the wide world theres two sap-
phire collars one phony-which is the
wifes--and one genuine-which wasnt
intended to be the wifes whered i
be if all that came out-me with one

threatened suit likely to bawl me out
as it is

  boylan wiped away a smile with a
discreet hand

  i am not undertaking to arrest any-
body mr miles though henri would
look in his proper place behind bars
but if youll get me the address of this
detournelles i think it will go a long
way toward restoring the stolen sap-
phires

  miles turned to the telephone and
after a brief conversation was able to
give the detective the number of de-
tournelles smart lodgings in a street off
central park west

  sutton spoke up

  henri-you dont intend arresting
him then 

  not at all the detective assured
henri thinks hes cleared himself i
wouldnt change his opinion right now
for he may come in handy

  miles was drawing on his gloves
when his eye fell on the collar lying
by the side of the pigskin case he
swept his hand toward the false glitter
as he addressed the jeweler

  here keep this junk until every-
things straightened out i dont want
it-not now at least

  boylan stayed suttons hand

  i think if you dont mind mr
miles ill take care of this collar for
a while his eyes brightened in a
shrewd afterthought maybe if i can
lay hands on the real stones you
wouldnt care greatly if i had to sac-
rifice these to do it

  go the limit miles boomed and
as boylan pocketed the case with the
collar in it the broker playfully pushed
him out of the door

  parting with miles on maiden lane
boylan took his first step toward trac-
ing- the collar stolen in the horseshoe
to that as yet unknown and unsus-
pected third person to whom it had been
deftly passed- by the actual thief-by
detournelles as the detective was now
stalemate



reasonably certain he walked to a
telegraph office the nearest one to the
factory of sutton  sutton and conse-
quently the one which the astute henri
would naturally use were he to send a
telegram in emergency immediately
upon finishing his days work over the
bench there he filed a despatch to
gaspard detournelles no - west
ninety-first street a dispatch contain-
ing only a single word and unsigned

  do not forward that until after five
oclock this afternoon boylan in-
structed the clerk

  two chances the round-faced lit-
tle man assured himself as he went out
into the crowded street if our french
friend thinks this telegram is from
henri and acts accordingly weve got
him nailed as an accomplice and the
one who lifted the goods if he thinks
the other fellow-the man whos got
the sapphires now--is the sender why
all weve got to do is to stick to him
and hell lead us to the pretty blue
stones

chapter v

  on a hidden road in the heart of
unknown staten island where stages
still ply and the hoot of owls at night
breaks the silence of a desert stands
an ancient dwelling whose architecture
is of the early fifties-all scrollwork
and jigsaw gables over cathedral-
pointed windows its tottering chim-
neys are bound to the perpendicular by
heavy cables of vines trees-which
were not saplings when lord howe
went to treat with benjamin franklin
at tottenville-screen the decrepit man-
sion from the road wrap it in a mantle
of shadow day and night as far from
the knowledge of broadway as any la-
masery in tibet is this country house
of some long-dead manhattan aristo-
crat

  this was the temporary abiding place
of raoul flack once known to the
paris surete as the phantom and

thought to be enduring a living death
in the french penal colony of new cal-
edonia how the phantom escaped
from the lime pits of a tropical hell-
made a super hell by the ingenuity of
guards what the incidents of his flight
from one spice island to another
through all the dutch archipelago of
his burrowing into oblivion in the broad
expanse of america and his summon-
ing through the devious channels of the
underworld the remnant of his old band
of itncomparables-trite parisian po-
lice cognomen-this is a story which
some day may be written this will be
the narrative of a man whose body has
been well-nigh broken by society but
whose intellect sharpened by suffering
almost to the absolute of mathematical
logic is dedicated to a single object-
the compassing of revenge upon society
for five years of torture

  the phantom had but recently come
to make his abode-alone save for the
service of a doddering old housekeeper
-in the house on the wilderness road
his appearance at the metropolitan on
the night mrs miles sapphire collar
disappeared had been his first venture
abroad nor would he have dared that
had not necessity compelled

  a worm of lights which was the
new york train bound to the end of
the island crawled to a stop at the
packing-box station that lay a mile be-
low the phantoms house on the bay-
ward sweep of the highlands detour-
nelles viscount allaire was the only
passenger to step onto the dark plat-
form but just as the train began to get
under way again a blotch of shadow de-
tached itself from the last cars rear
platform dropped to the tracks and
there crouched in darkness until thejiol-
low footsteps on boards changed to the
noise of feet on a frosted turf detour-
nelles paused to light a cigar cast a
cautious look behind him and seeing
nothing but the shadow block of the
station swung into a sharp stride up


the vovulatr magazine

the road the noise of his own boots
on the road flinty and resounding un-
der the amalgam of frost drowned that
other almost inaudible rustle and whis-
per of broken weeds that kept pace
for pace with his stride behind him in
the pitchy maw of the forested thor-
oughfare had he looked back de-
tournelles would have seen nothing but
the far-off twin sparks of the highlands
lights and the two walls of the cloven
forest that marched writh him up the
hill impalpable as the breath of fog
off the marsh by the seas edge was the
trailing shadow

   it was nine oclock and the phantom
seated in the grudging circle of light
that fell from an inverted green shade
of a student lamp was engaged in an
absorbing task his back to the only
two windows through which unlikely
spying could be done before him the
blue-and-gold resplendence of the
stolen collar the master of the incom-
parables was absorbed in an appraise-
ment of the jewel stone by stone pen-
cil and paper lay to hand on the table
a strong reading glass was brought to
bear on each blue blot  the gold fili-
gree and the column of estimated val-
ues grew with every lowering of the
glass the face of the man white and
cold as the face of one dead was set
in lines of complete absorption

  a knock sounded hollowly the
phantom leaped to his feet and snatched
a black automatic from the hollow of
his armchair three other knocks came
accurately spaced he dropped the col-
lar in a pocket of his smoking gown
went to the front door and admitted
detournelles their hands clasped

   you see i have come the younger
man said the other led the way back
to the lighted library without speech
there he turned and challenged with
one word

  why 

   surprise registered on the face of the

visitor his eyebrows lifted in puzzled
inquiry

  your telegram he answered

  t have sent no telegram the phan-
tom denied with a flash of impatience
telegrams for all the world to read
bah v detournelles reached to his
breast pocket brought out a yellow tele-
graph form spread it on the table and
pointed to the typewritten message
there was his name and address and
below the single word come no
signature

  what time did you receive this
the phantom demanded

  it was waiting for me at my rooms
when i returned at six oclock this
evening detournelles answered he
looked closely at the form studying the
lines of hieroglyphics representing the
companys receiving frank and station
number see this says five-fifteen
that would be after henris working
hours-when he was able to leave his
office before five oclock he could not
send a telegram he would not tele-
graph except in necessity foolishly
i jumped at the first impulse and came
here believing you called me

  if they suspected henri- the

phantom began

  he would not dare telegraph me if
there was danger of the telegram being
traced if he was under suspicion

  yet why the telegram

  something we must know maitre
raoul-that he wrishes to tell us at once
you he cannot reach by telegraph only
through me can henri get word to you
this message nowr would it not include
you as well as myself  the white-
headed one honed his hollow cheek in
thought

  if it were a trick-some detectives
work-would he not have signed the
name henri or appointed some ren-
dezvous assuredly he would set a
trap by naming the hour and place of
meeting you were not followed to-
night 
stalemate



  detournelles laughed shortly

  if one followed me he had a hard
time of it two taxis and the elevated
train between my lodgings and the
ferry the phantom bent his head in
thought for a minute then

  i will accompany you to henri it
is safe and may be necessary

  before he stripped off his smoking
gown he took the jeweled collar from
the pocket and laid it on the table de-
tournelles pounced upon it eagerly held
it stretched between his fingers and
lovingly fondled with his gaze each soft
spot of royal color

 yes a good haul-a very good
haul the phantom commented as he
slipped his arms into jacket sleeves and
next buried himself in the lapping folds
of a heavy fur coat come we
will put the little beauty away for the
night

  he took the collar crossed the room
to where a heavy bust of demosthenes
looked down with sightless eyes from
the high top of a bookcase the phan-
tom gripped the bust with one hand
while with the other he put torsion on
the crown of the head the plaster skull
of the ancient worthy unscrewed just
above the fillet binding his brows and
the collar disappeared into a hollow
brainpan

  the phantom was screwing back into
place the detached headpiece when his
hand hesitated by ever so little a
sound came to his ears a sound so
faint that detournelles gave no heed
to it it wras the faint scratching of a
branch against the glass of one of three
windows looking out from the room
upon the clotted shapes of trees stand-
ing in guarding ranks about the ancient
mansion just that thin noise of ten-
der wood against a pane as if a heavy
wind were sweeping a bough tip up
against the glass yet the phantom
knew the night was quiet there was
no wind

  he did not turn his head toward the
windows nor betray by any gesture the
germ of suspicion that the squeaking
branch had planted instead he care-
lessly pocketed the automatic he had
left lying in a hollow of the armchair
blew out the lamp and hand on de-
tournelles arm piloted him to the front
door he closed it vith a resounding
bang which threw on a spring lock and
walked with his companion through the
jungle of small plants to the gate

  do not look around he cautioned
in a low voice as they passed out onto
the road do not even change your
pace at this first heavy cluster of trees
i will leave you and turn back con-
tinue on to the railroad station alone
no no i do not need you it may
be nothing i will explain later-if need
be now au revoir

  the room so lately quitted by the two
suddenly was shot through with a chill
rush of night air there was a faint
creak of rusty sash pulleys as one of
the three windows slowly lifted a
blocky figure hardly to be distinguished
from the surrounding shadow of leaves
slipped from a stout oak branch-to
which it had clung-onto the window
sill and thence noiselessly down to the
carpeted floor a faint click and a
round white eye sprang into being
the eye groped and groped about the
walls until it looked straight into the
dead eyes of demosthenes on his high
perch an invisible hand brought the
bust down there was a dry scraping
noise as the attic orators head was
halved the white eye rested for an
instant on the blue glory of jewels lifted
from the plaster well--

 bang a vivid red stab of flame
from the raised window clatter of
falling shards of plaster the trash of
a shattered demosthenes

  out flicked the white eye a thump
of a heavy body dropping to the floor
a second lighter thud over by the
opened window as of some one lightly

vaulting from sill to floor then si-
lence

  for a full minute this silence in the
black room menacing terrible then
from nowhere a voice strongly accented
with the french twist but dry as rus-
tling leaves

  you-msieur detective i have you
of course you cannot leave this house
except by the window-through which
you came and i followed to kill you
will be inconvenient for you to kill
me next to impossible you follow

  roger boylan face down on the floor
was too wise to betray his whereabouts
by an answer his eyes roved the dark-
ness straining straining-

  a chopped laugh sounded

  it is interesting yes but for the
noise of the branch against the glass
my dear msieur detective my folly in
leaving curtains up in this so desolate
place would have cost me the jewels
is it not so 

  boylans revolver slowly creeping
out of his pocket struck a button on
his jacket the click sounded loud as
the explosion of a thirty-two-centimeter
gun

  bang a bullet threw lint from the
carpet into boylans eyes swtift patter
of feet followed

  i said to kill you would be inconve-
nient the disembodied voice wras stu-
diously cold do you not accept
hints 

  to the detective glued to the floor
the hopelessness of the situation in this
strangling dark was overwhelmingly ap-
parent to attempt a duel with a man
familiar with the big room its several
ambushes and screens of furniture
would be to invite sudden death yet
to escape with that precious bundle of
hard points pressing against his chest
was-

  msieur my ultimatum again
that dry crackling voice crawl to the
table-vraiment you are on your knees
-do i not know it deposit there

your flash light with the light showing
deposit in that light the jewels you
took from the plaster head also your
weapon then go out by the window un-
harmed

  no move by the detective a chuckle
from the darkness

  until you make a light msieur de-
tective you cannot see my guarantee of
honorable intentions my weapon two
chambers exploded as you know will
be on the table if it is not-mark
your course accordingly

  boylan began to hitch himself along
the floor groping with his revolver tip
in the dark ahead the barrel struck
a wooden table leg with a sharp rap
the groping figure cautiously raised it-
self and holding the flash light at arms
length reached up and settled it on the
table top a finger pressed on the light
which went streaming like some spilled
incandescent liquid across the red cloth
cover

  now the sapphire collar dear
friend came instructions from the
dark

  with a crisp rustle and click of gold
filaments a glittering heap of yellow
and royal blue color spilled under the
light and lay sprawling there-an evil
toy to incite covetousness to inspire
murder even

  a-ha nov perfect guarantee of
your good faith-your weapon

  very slowly the blue barrel of boy-
lans gun crept into the zone of
light the fingers reluctantly unclasp-
ing from the butt one by one seemed
alive with caution hardly had they
loosed the stock when from out of the
dark a blunt ugly automatic clattered
down into the plane of radiance rolled
over once and brought up against the
heaped jewels

  perfect neutrality my friend the
laugh that sounded in boylans ears was
stripped of all quality save only vitriolic
cynicism now the arm of the law

breaking silence for the first time in
ten minutes which were centuries and
he went out of the window

  on the following night edgerton
miles returned from the office to his
home with a fine glow about his heart
and a sapphire collar in his overcoat
pocket he stood not upon the status
quo ante of strained relations but
breezed into his wifes boudoir surpris-
ing her inthe midst of her dinner toilet
with all the skipping grace of a trained
bear he stepped behind the chair where
she wras seated before her dressing ta-
ble brushed aside the maid who was
arranging her hair and with both hands
drew the gorgeous strands of peacock
tints about his wifes throat

  huh how about it  he roared
as he essayed a kiss on the chaste brow

  i hope you havent been to any trou-
ble edgerton in getting these paste
things back came the chilling re-
joinder if you had only listened to
reason at the opera the other night i
could have told you there was no great
loss the real collar is in- the safe-
deposit box miles pursed his lips
and his eyes went wide with surprise
i havent worn it once since i picked

up this very creditable imitation in
paris three years ago

  edgerton miles tiptoed from mrs
miles boudoir hastened downstairs to
the cellarette and poured himself four
fingers of finest bourbon

  heres to what some o us didnt
know-and what some of us dont
know yet he toasted himself in the
panel mirror

  which cryptic remark might have
been taken to cover certain facts
item

  that the sapphire collar he had just
clasped about mrs miles white throat
was the genuine one worth fifty thou-
sand dollars which detective roger
boylan had brought away from the
house of the phantom leaving in its
stead mrs miles own imitation stones
of paris paste

  that through the intervention of
some wonderfully astute criminals a
sapphire collar worth fifty thousand
dollars and designed for a perfectly
unworthy and now quite discredited
miss dandelion was now in the pos-
session of edgerton miles lady wife-
a duplicate but genuine of another
such in her safe-deposit box

  that-and this was the most impor-
tant fact of the three-the aforesaid
lady wife would never know she pos-
sessed one hundred thousand dollars
worth of sapphires

a cheerful giver

by henry rucker

some people like the story with a kick heres one with three of them a
yarn about a locomotive fireman who wanted to do a good turn to his fellows

i wish to state thus early in the
tragedy that ive got a new job in
a line i enjoy and that i am making
forty large wrinkled dollars a
week next month ill be drawing
down fifty and the prospects are lovely
for a man who has recently dropped a
coal shovel

  these statistics are shoved in here
to keep you from feeling sorry for me
because if you dont know how well
im doing now you are liable to leave
off in the middle of this and sob your-
self sick and remember too that the
old job only paid me fifty dollars a
month so you can see where im going
financially

  up to some time ago i held that
fifty-dollar-a-month job which was
nothing more or less than firing loco-
motives on the pomona  western
railroad with headquarters in pomona
during that fevered period i was
twenty-three years old and burdened
with the thoughtful intellect you will
find among the lower orders of the
sand dabs it was my first job on the
coal box of a locomotive and you can
consider yourself at liberty to tell all
your friends it will be my last

  the boys on the p  w were a con-
genial good-natured lot and i horned
into their councils from the beginning
whenever a social affair was organized
in pomona marty lee had a finger in
the pie and if there was a punch bowl
i was the general manager with full
authority to clean up what punch the
guests left unnoticed in the bottom

  there was one thing needed in po-
mona at the time the railway branch
of the y m c a was growing rap-
idly but the boys had no regular home
and what we wanted was a red brick
building with running water and flower-
pots so some months before the di-
vorce between me and the railroad busi-
ness we started to erect the railroad
mens y m c a and everybody was

glad

  like most sensible railroads the po-
mona  western was pleased to have
its employees belong to the y m c a
there is a reason for that if a man
leans toward y m c a customs and
follows what he hears he isnt so liable
to fill his hide full of rum and try to
do something humorous with a loaded
passenger train

  maybe you believe there never was
such a thing as a stewed engineer
there are none now and have been
none for many years but there used to
be-long ago i know i fired one
night on a passenger run between san
pasquale and pomona with an en-
gineer now out of the service who
didnt know whether he was running a
locomotive or a rowboat and if you
want to be entirely free from the lan-
guor of monotony just try firing a fast
train with a pickled gent at the throttle
i have gray hairs clean down my spine
that date back to that feverish night

  well we started out cheerfully to
build the new y m c a building and
the townspeople gave us kind words
and dollars
a cheerful giver



  the people of pomona were gener-
ous but the place is neither a large
town nor a wealthy one and soon we
began to see that we were going to run
out of citizens and money thereupon
we went after the big bugs and be-
tween firing locomotives and trying to
collect for the building fund we stokers
were about as busy as the worm-hole
borer in an antique-furniture factory

  there was a committee composed
exclusively of firemen and headed by
alvin monroe who was made chair-
man because he weighs three hundred
pounds and looks like a chairman i
was an active member of that commit-
tee looking back i can see that when
you called me an active member you
told no lie

  well we invented a system which
made the contributions more interest-
ing than just writing out a check for the
y m c a we fixed it up so that the
wealthy people of the town issued their
contributions in the form of prize
checks and these prizes were hung up
for the winners of various competi-
tions in which the pomona  western
firemen took part in other words
we made a game out of it the result
was the same and in the meantime we
kept up interest in the new and moral
structure and brightened the saturday
afternoons for the populace

  we had a five-mile race the prize
being a five-hundred-dollar check put
up by joe salisbury the automobile
man and rufus collins won that from
a field of about nine firemen he
turned it into the fund with name at-
tached in honorable mention three
thousand pomonans saw that race and
cheered the winner i will rtate that i
was in that contest part of the way
and when i quit you could have hung
your overcoat on my tongue no more
road races for marty lee i dont mind
five fast miles on a good locomotive
btit not on your crotched end

  martin  co came across with a

four-hundred-dollar check and we had
a pole vault for that won by joe hack-
ett he out-pole-vaulting the rest of us
by several feet the reason being that
joe weighs all of ninety pounds in his
winter underwear

  henry forrester donated a five-hun-
dred-dollar prize for the best hurdler
and ward snaiger hurdled himself into
prominence luke underhill won an-
other five hundred by throwing a base-
ball farther than any other coal shov-
eler on the road and luke would also
have won had the contest been for
throwing the bull any time its throw-
ing luke wins 

  so things progressed and the build-
ing fund mounted apace as you might
say somebody would offer a new do-
nation to the fund and the firemen
would cheerily go out and compete
whether they felt like it or not it
made the act of giving away money less
painful for the gents behind the foun-
tain pens and i do believe our com-
petitive system loosened up a num-
ber of citizens who otherwise would
have remained in close juxtaposition
to their dough

  in the course of time we used up
most of our prominent and cash-bear-
ing citizens and our eyes turned to-
ward simeon means who was then
and is yet king of the crabs i have
not mentioned simeon but i will now
state that he was the official town tight-
wad and while i have come across a
good many close-fisted and penurious
male objects i have never yet found
the equal of simeon means lie was
the worlds champion miser and dollar
pincher and he was skin-tight i would
say offhand he was so tight that when
he winked both his kneecaps moved
about an inch

  every town has its simeon means
and he usually looks and acts about the
same whether in sawtelle falls or her-
kimer new york our simeon was
medium in height and lean all over


the popular magazine

he looked like what you would expect
a mean penurious man to look like
his face was thin sour and wrinkled
up with a brownish parchment which
in other people would be skin his
cheek bones protruded and his eyes
squinted his legs wrere long care-
lessly mated and formed the largest
part of him he walked with the quick
nervous stride of a man desirous of
quitting the company of a sniffing dog
and if the old wretch owned the rocky
mountains he wouldnt give you a free
stone bruise

  he foreclosed mortgages whenever
he saw one open and if he failed to
commit usury before three oclock each
afternoon he felt that the day was
wasted a surgical operation might
have detached him from a dollar but
he would have charged the surgeon two
bucks for experimental services he
had his business headquarters in po-
monas proudest commercial block and
there he sat day by day in a second-
hand chair training the dollars so that
they would roll into his safe and play
dead you could borrow money from
him but you paid a high rate of in-
terest and you did pay if you failed
he had it in writing that you left your
right leg until the debt was canceled
that roughly is the kind of man
simeon means was

  well the pomona local took to con-
sidering simeon as a possible source
of supply and the ways and means
committee which i graced vith my
presence determined to stick the needle
into him and see what happened as i
said alvin monroe was the chairman
and besides myself there was barry
mulloy otto mohler and rufus col-
lins all firemen and all expert com-
mitteemen

  that old reptile said rufus when
we were discussing the situation has
got money and lots of it pie made it
here in pomona every penny first
he sold worthless land to the railroad

and then he put up those collapsible
houses and rented them to us helpless
railroaders every time we pay a gas
or water bill we put money into his
pocket for years we have been work-
ing and turning over part of our income
to him and now its time for him to do
us a favor i say we ought to walk
right into his office

  yes growled otto with the innate
pessimism of his race and lets leave
the door open because well be walking
right out again we wont stay in long
that old skunk wouldnt give a dime
to watch a nihilist chase the czar up
main street any time it comes to giv-
ing away money mr means is under
the chloroform cone

  all right i put in hopefully but
weve got to try

  and said alvin monroe well
start off with fair words if we cant
induce him with polite conversation
well stow away our inducer and give
him the rough work

  that being settled several of the
committee took occasion to drop in for
a formal call at mr means office he
welcomed the four of us as though we
were smallpox germs

  at thite point i had better explain i
was of course a member of the com-
mittee but i should have taken that
morning off the night before i had
attended a large and illuminated party
and so interesting were the various
events that i wholly neglected to go to
bed about breakfast time i began to
feel miserable so i sneaked into joes
place and conciliated my outraged sys-
tem with three life-savers foolish
sure but pm writing now about the
time when i was foolish and cheerfully
admit it

  when i joined my solemn-minded
committee for the call on mr means
my breath must have smelled like the
lot where the circus was yesterday
you could probably have propped up a
heavy automobile on my breath that
a cheerful giver



summer morn and removed both hind
wheels but nobody paid any atten-
tion to me and i blew into means of-
fice behind the others

  mr means alvin began standing
near the door and surrounded by the
rest of us all in uneasy attitudes we
are the ways and means committee for
the y m c a building fund as
you know we are going to erect a build-
ing which will be a credit to pomona
and the railroad men and i feel sure
you will not permit this opportunity
for doing a fine thing to pass you by
our host twisted in his chair and
looked at the committee with an icy
smile

  humph he snorted i suppose
you think you can hold me up eh
humph  alvin humphed right back
at him we dont think anything of
the kind we are not in the holdup
business mr means we are re-
spectable firemen and we represent the
railroad men of pomona i am chair-
man of the ways and means committee
and as such--

  and you want my money simeon
snapped with the cheerful manner of
an angry turtle you have decided to
come sneaking around and see whether
you can squeeze old simeon means
hey 

  no alvin went on restraining
himself from a violent outbreak you
dont get us right and besides you are
using bad words we are talking to
you politely and you are trying to in-
sult us the business men of pomona
as you are aware have contributed gen-
erously to the new y m c a build-
ing because they realize it is a laudable
enterprise which will result in the good
of all the town will profit and up
to this time you are the only citizen of
importance who has not contributed
and suppose i refuse to be held
up  simeon demanded squinting at
us suppose i wont be gouged or

bullied by a lot of-

  a p

  he went on for a minute using noth-
ing but offensive words

  i had been hovering about the out-
skirts of our timid group examining
with some interest a flock of exploding
stars which will sometimes appear in
the human eye on the morning after
and i had been paying but little atten-
tion to simeon means my reflections
had solely to do with whether or not
another shot of rum would cheer me
up a little-and then suddenly it oc-
curred to me that this man wtas treat-
ing us with scant courtesy i suddenly
came to life brushed the flying comets
from my vision and entered the dis-
cussion without preliminaries push-
ing alvin monroe to one side i strode
over to simeon means desk where x
could look him in the eye and breathe
on him and right there as i look
back was where s means must have
learned about my convivial habits i
thought nothing of it at the time but
i see now my breath was a give-away

  all right i said to mr means
weve been nice and kind with you
old man but it seems you have to
handle tar in a tarry and rough man-
ner we came over to see you about
getting five hundred dollars for the
building fund and were going to get
it you are the town miser and your
name is a hissing in peoples mouths
you have stung and cheated everybody
in pomona including the widows and
orphans and if you got what was com-
ing to you rightly some telegraph pole
around here would be holding up more
than wires your money comes from
us railroad men and five hundred dol-
lars is a joke to you compared with the
monthly loot you take away from us
if you dont come across with this do-
nation well take off your hide and
hang it on the fence for little boys to
write remarks on you are already
unpopular you old scorpion but you
are going to be more unpopular do
you get all this 


the popular magazine

  you would think after that general
statement of personal views the time
had arrived in my affairs when i would
be thrown out bodily by the office force
but no mr means leaned back in his
chair and actually sniggered my re-
marks seemed to hit him on the funny
bone and for the first time in mans
memory simeon means broke into a
series of facial contortions that passed
with him as laughter he continued to
look at me he even leaned a little
closer to me and i tried to hold in my
breath knowing that my bark was at
the moment a heap worse than my bite

  well boys he said after a time
i suppose you saw your duty and
you did it you came up here and
asked me for my money you did what
you could to gouge me and now its
about time for you to go away and stop
littering up the office im not mad
because i regard firemen as people you
have to be tolerant with the same as
young children and idiots you havent
much intelligence or you wouldnt be
firemen and furthermore i regard
the rest of this railroad outfit as a gang
of petty grafters so you can toddle
along to the man who gave you the
candy to do this and tell him that s
means refuses to be bled mind the
flowerpot on your way out

  we stumbled out into the clear light
of day in a dreary silence after i had
added a couple of useless insults to my
previous statements neither of which
caused mr means anything but mild
amusement otto mohler enlivened
the walk back to the roundhouse by re-
minding us that he had told us so
seeming to derive some comfort from
the thought

  for three days alvin monroe and
the rest of us spent the time in an ef-
fort to convince the people of pomona
that simeon means should be driven
from our midst what we said about
that old varmint would burn holes in
a stove lid yet he went along without

giving a sign of suffering on the
fourth day i wralked up the street from
the yards with my dinner pail on my
arm and i ran into simeon means it
was too late to cross the road and the
little man stopped me

  hello he said just as though i
hadnt called him anything on our pre-
vious meeting do you suppose you
could bring your committee around to
my office this afternoon

  what for i demanded

  i think i can give you some good
news

 you mean-

  never mind what i mean you
bring the committee

  he walked away leaving me to won-
der whether he intended to play some
new game on us when we got there i
told the gang about it and in the after-
noon the four of us returned ready for
anything including arrest for defama-
tion of character

  well simeon met us at the door and
i saw at once that he was a changed
man he walked around and shook
hands with us all and then addressed
most of his remarks to me although
alvin monroe was the chairman

  sit down boys he began i
presume you can guess why ive sent
for you

  no alvin answered we cant

  i have decided simeeon said to
me to accede to your request about
the contribution i am going to join
the other donors to the y m c a
fund

  thats mighty nice of you mr
means i answered somewhat
stunned because it wasnt what i ex-
pected

  i know that pomona regards me as
a heartless old villain without a spark
of generosity and i want to show my
townspeople that i am as liberal as any
ofle when you came here before i
was opposed to your enterprise but i
have investigated and i find that it will
a cheerful givecr



be a good thing for the town so i am
going to help

  the usual five hundred dollars  i
asked encouragingly

  no replied simeon i am going
to make it a thousand dollars

  rufus collins who had been prowl-
ing about uneasily walked into a door
i suppressed my own feelings and
otto mohler opened his mouth in teu-
tonic unbelief and kept it open dur-
ing the rest of the interview

  yes went  the liberal giver i
feel like being top man in this case
i believe one thousand dollars will be
the largest sum contributed will it
not

  it will be i said when you hand
us your check for one thousand dol-
lars until now six hundred dollars
leads

  what kind of contests have you had
so far he demanded

  i told him we had had several or-
dinary foot races a pole vault ball-
throwing exhibitions greased-pole
climbs hurdle races and jumping con-
tests

  well he said coming over with
the little brown check which said one
thousand dollars on it and placing it
in my hand ive been giving the sub-
ject of contests some thought and i
have decided  something new races
and jumping are all right but they have
nothing to do with firing locomotives
theyre outside your profession which
is the care and operation of engines
ive thought up an original contest and
its logical because it is part of your
daily work

  what is it  i asked

  then he outlined his contest and i
will state with due admiration for the
little runt it was a bird

  maybe you dont know anything
about railway roundhouses so ill tell
you a roundhouse is where the loco-
motives rest up between runs it is a
sort of locomotive livery stable with a

number of tracks leading in from the
turntable which is located out in the
yard the tracks spread fanwise from
the turntable when an engine comes
in from its daily schedule the engineer
gets down and feels around for hot
boxes and general trouble after which
he takes a chew of tobacco and tells his
fireman to run her into the house his
work for the day is ended the fire-
man finishes up the chores

   he sneaks the locomotive onto the
turntable and a couple of greasy yard
men in dirty overalls grab the handle
and push him and his engine around
until the pilot points to his regular
house track then he nudges the en-
gine gently into the house until the
stack is under a smoke hood where-
upon he climbs down and asks the
wipers how they feel to-day

   thats all and it is a matter of
vast pride with all decent firemen to
be able to drive a locomotive onto a
turntable and stop in the exact center
so that the weight balances on the turn-
ing pin one man can shove the table
and engine around with a fifty-ton load
if the engine is balanced exactly but
forty men cant budge it if the loco-
motive weight is on one end you can
figure that out for yourself some fire-
men get so expert that they can hit the
exact center almost every time which
means stopping in the space of an inch
or two

   well simeon means wasnt so des-
perately ignorant of the ways of fire-
men as you might think heres what
he doped out for a unique contest the
winner to grab off the thousand-dollar
check and have his name associated
with it in the building fund you know
these lanterns switchmen use theyre
like the kind you keep down cellar only
heavier with thicker glass simeons
contest was a lantern-smashing exhibi-
tion for firemen only using locomo-
tives as projectiles

   the lanterns were to hang from nails

t


the popular magazine

inside the roundhouse wall suspended
several inches above the track and each
lantern was to be set exactly between
the rails the contestants were to get
up there and drive their engines in from
the yard and with the steel-shod tip of
the pilot smash the lantern glass with-
out striking the wall get all that
quite a contest wasnt it

  you see to win this you would have
to drive in slowly and stop-bang
you had only one trial and the chances
were youd stop short on account of
fearing to hit the brick wall in other
words it was like stopping on the turn-
table but with a little added risk

  that affirmed simeon when he
had finished explaining is a game call-
ing for skill nerve and coordination
between brain and hand the fireman
who wins it will be known henceforth
to his fellow workers as a cool capable
person who can handle an engine un-
der delicate conditions

   delicate is right i said to simeon
when do you want this to take place
to-day is thursday make it sat-
urday afternoon

  we let it go at that i folded
simeons check into a compact wad
and pinned it in my pocket against sud-
den accidents we departed making
pretty speeches and i felt ashamed of
my former roughness

  saturday morning simeon means
sent word he wanted to see me per-
sonally and i went around to his of-
fice he began calling me marty im-
mediately and it appeared that he liked
me

  i want you to win this contest
marty he said and im going to help
you do it and just between us im
going to slip you a hundred dollars for
yourself if you do win

im a new fireman i told him but
i can run an engine better than most
of the boys maybe i will win
sure you will he continued if you
take my advice theres one mistake

they will all make theyll see the
lantern hanging there on the wall and
theyll stop their engines too short
they wont hit the lanterns at all be-
cause thats human nature and you
want to be sure to hit your lantern
marty you want to make certain you
dont stop too short

  and right about then mr means
bought me a drink i mean he went
over to a concealed cupboard and
brought to light as nifty a private bar
as ever i saw it had a number of
bottles and materials for making mixed
concoctions i brewed myself a fair-
sized shot and put it away and simeon
talked on in fact he continued to talk
for a long time punctuating his re-
marks by pointing out the desirability
of having one while the having was
good

  i went to lunch with him and we
frolicked around together like a couple
of pals until the middle of the after-
noon and along toward competition
time i was pretty thoroughly embalmed
and at intervals simeon impressed on
me the need of hitting the lantern and
not stopping short of it

  if theres one thing in this world
you dont need to worry about i
told him about the ninth dr ink its
whether i hit that lantern of mine ill
hit it all right

  that was my principal thought at
two oclock in the afternoon when i
wandered through the yard looking
for the old mogul i had been firing all
these weeks engineers and firemen
were scattered about in the round-
house and out among the tracks and
a couple of wipers had hung up the
lanterns it is needless to state that
the officials of the line did not know
we were about to play one-old-cat with
their roundhouse

  most of the engines that should have
been steaming peacefully under their
smoke hoods were sliding up and down
the yards and various firemen were
a cheerful give



practicing quick stops rufus collins
was the first contestant and he drove
in slowly approached his lantern and
stopped six inches too short i saw
simeon means just once that after-
noon and he was moving rapidly to-
ward the street that ran outside the
railroad property

  apparently nobody noticed that i had
no right to be fooling with the throttle
of a grown-up engine it occurred to
me that i was going to see two lanterns
when i drove in because i was seeing
two of everything including two
roundhouses and two locomotives both
numbered  i remembered what
simeon had said about not stopping too
short and when i climbed up into the
cab it was my firm intention to avoid
stopping before i had hit the lantern
or lanterns

  somebody called out my name and
i opened my eyes with a start grabbed
the throttle and started to smash my
lantern about halfway in i heard a
confused shouting and i noticed men
running in various directions i saw
the wall ahead but no lantern though
i knew where it must be and presently
i realized that i was driving my mogul
too fast for the short distance to be
covered-say about nineteen times too
fast

  all i remember was a loud crash
the end of my engine hit the lantern
all right and that wasnt all we went
right on through the wall bringing
down part of the roof i shut off
steam in a cloud of falling mortar
bricks girders chimneys smoke hoods
and window glass and found myself in
the clear light of day having passed
clean through the roundhouse and
smashed into a passenger coach on the
other side a piece of flying brick
caught me over the nose and about
then i decided that i had made a mis-
take and might as well go quietly
away somewhere and think it all over

  i didnt learn anything more about

the main facts that day because i was
principally elsewhere but the next day
i came back to earth and rret the del-
uge to begin with that lanrn com-
petition ended abruptly with my effort
nobody felt like going  with it and
the railroad officials began galloping
around in circles i have never yet
been torn limb from limb and that is
only because nobody could find me that
afternoon

  well i discovered that i had lost all
my friends i had also it appeared
dragged the y m c a into the bog
of disrepute and automatically that or-
ganization ceased to have anything to
do with me i was fired off the roster
for conduct unbecoming a member and
i deserved to be furthermore the po-
mona  western railroad decided that
it could struggle along without the serv-
ices of a fireman who gave himself over
to battering down roundhouses seven
engineers were suspended and nine
stokers were up on the carpet for in-
vestigation everybody who had a
hand in the competition was officially
censured but the only one who lost
his job was marty lee

  and when you figure it out in cold
blood i had it coming of course old
man means shouldnt have ed me into
temptation and filled me full of rum
that was wrong but still it was all up
to me simeon provided the libations
to be sure but he didnt force them
on me remember that it was all
my own fault and just to get it into
the records i have never touched liquor
since that day of competition and
wreckage

  i looked up simeon means as soon
as things quieted down intending to
give him a reproachful call but he was
out of town and by and by it occurred
to me that i might as well go and be
out of town myself pomona was no
longer a lovely village of the plain
everybody hated me because i had
got a lot of people into trouble and


the popular magazine

every time i met a member of the y
m c a he looked at me as though i
had murdered his mother the divi-
sion superintendent wrote me a letter
in which he called me a debauchee and
after looking up what debauchee meant
i decided that a new start in life was
necessary in pomona i was all
through my railroad career was fin-
ished and less than a week after the
excitement i started west alone un-
wept and unsung also a stern and
unyielding member of the prohibition
party

  anyway i never was intended by na-
ture to be a railroad fireman i thought
a lot of earnest reflections on the way
to the coast and when i reached los
angeles i had just about determined
that the serious time in my life had
arrived up to now life had been more
or less of a joke now it certainly had
ceased to be a joke because i was
nearly out of money and the first neces-
sity was a brand-new job

  i read an advertisement in a news-
paper about a week later and it went
on to say that one thousand active men
were needed to be the mob in a picture
of babylonian days you know los
angeles is the home of moving pic-
tures such citizens as got the jobs
would be paid a dollar and a half a
day

  all right i said to myself lets
go and get a job

  the next morning i rode twenty
miles on a street car and later on bat-
tled with several hundred infuriated
mobites who wanted that one-fifty a
day and wanted it bad enough to com-
mit several minor crimes

  after a while i fought my way into
the place where a man was giving out
jobs and i got mine i suppose i
must have been peculiarly adapted by
nature for the place because the man
took one look at me and then handed
me a lot of confused instructions a pair
of scarlet pants one tin helmet with a

brass cupola on it and a sleeveless shirt
trimmed with brass

  you go on over there and dress
said the man were going to have a
rehearsal at noon

  he waved his hand in the general
direction of a brick wall and when i
got there i found a row of wire animal
wagons and scenery but no place
where a gentleman could change his
clothes there is a certain lack of pri-
vacy about a wire animal wagon if
you have ever seen one so i tagged
along undecided with forty or fifty
other wondering souls all carrying an-
cient roman articles of clothing and
worried expressions

  pretty soon i concluded that my gang
of helmet carriers and pants bearers
didnt know any more about where
they were going than a horse knows
about harmony so i wandered off by
myself using my native wit and still
carrying my iron hat and the blushing
pants of a bygone era i clambered
over a paper wall and a wooden castle
with paper roses  it and pretty soon i
found a doorway that looked dark and
dismal enough for my simple purposes
i sneaked in and found myself in a
sort of subdued light where i could
trip over chairs and unseen objects
with great freedom

  i fumbled around in the half light
feeling for something to sit on and
before i could change into the bor-
rowed and barbaric habiliments of a
bygone age i heard a number of voices
talking and then came the sharp
familiar pur you always hear in a mov-
ing-picture theater when the operator
begins to tune up

  thats where i was-in a sort of
moving-picture theater though not a
regular one where the public is ad-
mitted this was one of these private
theaters or dark rooms where they
show off the new pictures before the
various officials and make changes in
a cheerful giver



them before shooting them at the great
unwashed at a nickel a throw

  i dropped my babylonian trousers on
the floor and while i was scurrying
around in the darkness they began
spraying a picture on the screen and
the men started talking about it some-
body with a loud voice was evidently
the boss because he kept saying this
was rotten and that was rotten and it
looked like the whole blasted thing
would have to le done over

  i will now state that it was a mighty
interesting picture to me because im
not an expert on such things like
these officials were somebody would
say joe thats terrible and all the
time it looked fine to me i temporarily
forgot about my dollar-and-a-half job
and the gladiator business went to pot
while i sat there and watched the pic-
ture

  every now and then the boss would
speak to joe and i gathered that joe
had taken the picture or dictated it or
whatever they call it then joe would
answer in an irritated wray and say
that hell could freeze over but so far
as he was concerned there would be no
retakes on that film

  it was no good to start with the
boss said it was always bad and i
was against the thing from the start
besides that its cost four times what
it should

  thats on account of the wreck
stuff joe answered thats all
right youll admin theres nothing
the matter with that is there wait
till that conies boys just watch that
wreck  aint it a bird dave 

  dave admitted it was a bird and i
went on sitting there with a shoe in
one hand and a feeling that i was pry-
ing into other peoples affairs still the
picture wasnt bad it was named the
firemans sweetheart and that inter-
ested me because all the firemen i
knew were married men the story
was about an honest young fireman who

was in love with the daughter of a
prominent railway official and she
loved him too though there was no
sensible explanation of why that was
i know a lot about the railroad busi-
ness and i never heard of any promi-
nent officials daughter being in love
with a fireman anyway she loved the
lad who was too handsome for the
firing business and there was also a
vicious young devil in the picture
named montmorency who loved the
girl and this guy had a strong drag
with the high-up officials

  montmorency seeing how things
were going spent all his time trying
to put the fireman on the bum and
finally having failed to separate him
from his rich sweetheart by ordinary
deviltry he grew desperate and hired
a confederate he had the confederate
kidnap the rich girl tie her up in her
fathers private car which he thought-
fully arranged so it would be smashed
and then he fixed it so the limited
would run into the private car and kill
everybody the joke was that the
honest young fireman was on the lim-
ited so thus the villain had the lover
kill his own sweetheart he was a
grand little villain he left nothing
uftdone that might contribute to any-
bodys discomfort

  the star scene was where the lim-
ited comes along through the night and
kills the girl only it didnt kill her
the picture fluttered along down to
that scene with dave saying it was
rotten and joe defending it then
came the line  a fiendish vengeance
right after that you saw the wreck
and as a wreck it left nothing to be
desired it was considerable wreck

  boys watch this i heard joe ex-
claim

  then it came the huge locomotive
sped down the track it got beyond
control of the honest fireman and the
next time you saw him both man and
engine were headed for destruction


the cpopular magazine

  the engine came crashing head on
through a brick wall and boiled into
the presidents private car where the
beautiful heroine was bound hand and
foot and at this point i dropped my
iron hat on the floor with a clatter and
stood up

  suffering spinoza i remarked to
nobody in particular

  i saw myself

  i saw my old engine no  po-
mona  western heavy type

  i saw the pomona roundhouse and
railroad street in front of it and
bang there i came through the old
roundhouse on the day of the lantern-
smashing contest and into the pas-
senger coach which was on the outside
track i saw myself lifted out of the
cab covered with mortar and profanity
and that was the first time i knew how
i got out of that wreck then the cam-
era slowed down and i could hear the
men talking i stood there trying to
make my brain work but it wouldnt

  that said joe the director saves
the whole picture thats the greatest
wreck scene ever put on the screen
theres a real wreck boys no built-up
stuff

  it certainly is one stirring scene
said another voice it will make them
sit up and take notice

  it ought to joe growled it cost
us three thousand dollars

  you mean for that one scene

  three thousand bones for that one
scene joe continued and its worth
it because it saves the picture thats
a real roundhouse thats the round-
house of the pomona  western rail-
road at pomona the passenger coach
we dragged in where it would get
caught in the ruins when the engine
came through and we never paid a
cent for the passenger coach at that

  how did you get it still another
man asked

  funny story joe went on we
built the whole drama about that one

scene an old guy comes in here one
day with an offer says he can provide
us with a high-grade wreck for three
thousand dollars and will deliver the
wreck before he takes a cent i dont
know the details of his scheme but
part of it had to do with a stewed fire-
man who certainly carried out his part
if it consisted of getting stewed i took
the old man up we hid our camera
men in his livery stable which is across
the street from the rear of the pomona
roundhouse he pulled off his stunt on
schedule time and there you see the re-
suit one of the finest wrecks in the
known world

  at this point i noticed that my mouth
had been wide open in astonishment so
i closed it besides stars i began to
see the real depth of simeon means
and to understand what he meant by
having a lantern contest and by urg-
ing me to convivial extremes

  the funny part is joe said laugh-
ing heartily the joke is on the rail-
road after smashing up their pet
roundhouse the old scoundrel went
right in and got the contract for re-
building it aint that great

  somebody laughed but it wasnt me
you know i heard joe say i
could use that fireman-the stewed boy
who did all this if he ever has any
sober moments i certainly could use
him

  thats what i contend exactly
dave the boss put in emphatically
as it stands the picture is no good
with the exception of the wreck and
why because the fireman we see all
the way through up to the wreck is a
handsome devil and he aint the same
fireman we see lifted out of the busted
cab any audience in the world will
give that the hoot theyll know
youre using two different men dont
you realize that

  i do joe answered with mild sar-
casm and i suppose you expect me to
go back to pomona and hunt through
a cheerful giver



the hospitals till i find the alcoholic
maniac who ran the engine not me
they have a large and chilly jail in po-
mona and im going to stay away if
the railroad people ever find out the
truth-

  at this point some sucker turned on
the regular lights disclosing a sur-
prised outsider standing there in a
grievous state of undress about nine
men in their shirt sleeves stared at me
the fattest one came over to me and
looked at the scarlet pants and the iron
hat

  who are you he asked using some
private adjectives of his own

  well i said my names marty
im the fireman in that wreck scene
and ive been listening-accidentally
of course-to what you said about how
nice it would be if you could get hold
of that fireman if its of any interest
to you im all through firing on the p
 w they saw to that right after
the wreck

  joe looked at me and then laughed
the other men gathered around and
asked questions they also laughed

  are you the stewed fireman joe
asked

  i was the stewed fireman i an-
swered put a lot of accent on that
past tense because ive quit liquor

  joe turned and talked to dave the
boss

  this is what i call a piece of luck
he said

  luck is not the name retorted
dave this is a modern miracle

  i like to hear you gentlemen so en-
thusiastic about it i said picking up
the scarlet pants those are nice
words but if you can use this fireman
whats the salary 

  twenty a week if you drink joe
answered

  i drink nothing but water i told
him

then forty a week if youre telling
me the truth ive made actors out of
worse things than coal shovelers and
theres a bunch around this studio that
ought to be shoveling coal right now
forty dollars a week suits me i
told the director when do i start
whats your name he asked
marty lee

  all right marty joe continued
you probably cant act at all but even
then you havent got anything on a lot
of other heroes in the movies put on
your pants and come along with me
youre an actor now

  and that about winds it up except
that you ought to go see that picture

  the whole thing goes to show that no
bunch of immature firemen can rush up
and squeeze blood out of a turnip-
simeon means being the turnip think
of that sucker dragging down three
thousand dollars and we thought we
were financial sharps

  some day im going back to pomona
and thank the old reptile for what he
did for me

the presidency

uadrennially in november there is waged our great battle of bal-
lots which involves between fourteen and sixteen million voters of these
united states-an expression of popular political sentiment that is with-
out parallel in its influence upon the nation and affects even remote
republics and kingdoms it is an extraordinary occasion at which every citizen
whether he live in a tiny hamlet or a big city on prairie or mountain may lend
his voice to the selection of a head for this government and give into the hands
of an individual greater power than is exercised by most of the rulers of the
world lifted to his high office by virtue of public acclamation this man be-
comes spokesman for a hundred million people his every word and act analyzed
and weighed and recorded indelibly by a vast multitude of minds and set down
in journals of every sort and tongue	f

    selection of the president has with the passing of time come more and more
under the direct control of the people originally as specified by the constitution
the people were not given any direct voice in the election of their chief magistrate
it being held sufficient that the- control by popular vote the election of the
members of the house of representatives to the state legislatures uras given
the power to appoint presidential electors who in turn chose the nations chief
but beginning with the year  the political organizations became too com-
plex and powerful to permit of the foregoing plan and party nominations were
instituted by which congressional caucuses chose presidential electors until 
this scheme served then there arose vigorous protest against it the reformers
laying claim to the peoples right to choose their own electors to cast the final
vote for the president another plan was thereupon adopted of mass conven-
tions and state legislatures deciding the momentous choice but it was found
cumbersome and impracticable however by  the groping for the proper
political machinery resulted in the rise of the national convention the national
committee and the national platform and by  all of the presidential conven-
tions had accepted the present principles of party government but not until
 had the modern political campaign as we know it put in its appearance
with its large financing and skillful publicity

    self-government is exemplified in its highest development in the united
caught in the net



states maintained by means of political machinery unlike that of any other gov-
ernment and requires a force of about half a million men and women to keep it
working smoothly and effectively its master mind is that of the president who
must supervise the expenditure of a billion dollars annually who must give hi
time and attention to the appointment of petty officers as well as to foreign rela-
tions that involve grave issues who must execute the laws of the land and
guard the interests of the people and who must be open to all citizens desiring
to write or see him these duties give us only a glimpse of his herculean task
like most other positions of the present day the presidency has grown exacting
and demands of the incumbent almost incredible performances more is expected
of the president than of any other man in public life on earth there is no other
governmental head under such lenses of burning criticism human he must be
yet something beside for we are an incurably idealistic nation with belief in the
powers of man beyond any experience to justify it perhaps for this reason
alone the presidency is one of the most difficult conceivable jobs to undertake
embodying responsibility of the first magnitude increasingly politics are com-
ing to express the moral purpose of the country and the people are above all else
placing a faith in their chosen leader that he possess and hold that vision without
which a nation perishes

     on the whole we can be justifiably proud of the men that the presidency
has called forth from the ranks of the commonalty and their fitness for such
high destiny has been one of the supreme and inviolable proofs of the value and
permanency of our form of popular government men who had been lawyers sol-
diers tailors farmers and tradesmen have been selected for this great office
and whether intellectual or not they have proven men of illuminating character
and unimpeachable integrity whichever may be the candidate chosen as our
twenty-ninth president this election we are sure he will not fall far short of the
expectations we entertain of the ideals we cherish

monuments to loneliness

consider the sheep-herder with us loneliness is a thing that comes now
and then like the headache or the nerves with him it is a part of his
daily existence a lowly little-known atom of a worlds life he is a piece
of humanity stuck far out upon the sagy stretches of wyoming and
montana or colorado and utah  an atom who cares for the wool supply of the
united states but whose main job is to be lonely

     there is no one to whom the sheep-herder may talk there is no place
for him to go except a deadly repetition of the sand-strewn sagebrushed
stretches which lie all about him now and then one of them becomes mad
from the horror of it all and his bones are found months later where he has
died by a shot rather than endure the society of only himself but those are the
weaklings the men who do not understand that companionship does not neces-
sarily mean the company of humans the sheep-herder-that is the true one-
has solved the problem of loneliness by making the whole world animate or
otherwise his companion

     the sky is his friend for he can lie on his back and watch the clouds by
day or try to count the stars by night every insect that crawls or flies or
squirms is an intimate acquaintance-for many a day has been passed away just


the pocpuljlcr magazine

in watching an ant hill and trying to figure out what all the activitys about
even the dangerous rattlesnake is almost out of the enemy class

    out there when you ride the plains you see towering piles of stones atop
the sandy hills stretching high into the sky great bowlders form their bases
bowlders that required struggling strength and the work of days to move into
place sometimes the stones themselves have been carried for half a mile
across smooth sand and rutty gully finally to be placed upon the stack with the
rest monuments they are great towering monuments that have cost the labor
and time of weeks sometimes months to build and yet when you ask whose
grave they cover what battle they commemorate you learn that they were
built by sheep-herders for no other purpose than to pass the time away to
pass the time away by sweat of the brow and work that would be called hard
labor under any other circumstances-to pass the time away in building great
high-reaching monuments to the god of loneliness i and yet we who live where
there are things to see and persons to talk to we sometimes whine against the
world and say there is nothing to do that we are lonely

investing credit

credit is a mans best capital it may last through the loss of a half
dozen fortunes and enable him to succeed the seventh time it is useless
to advise men to stay out of debt it is also foolish for on our present
- basis a majority of men cannot do business without credit

    however it is imperative that a man knows the sort of debt he is making
to use ones credit in his business may be a wise investment but it is always
dangerous to live on ones credit-to eat it up and wear it away credit merely
consumed leaves a deficit that is a fearful handicap a man should live some
way on what he earns and invest his credit only when careful investigation and
his best judgment convince him that it will be safe and yield a profit

    a tightwad is not a lovely creature but even he is to be preferred to a dead
beat and a man who persists in spending more than he has or makes must in-
evitably become a dead beat it is folly to squander money one will need for real
expenses it is worse than folly to be a spendthrift with other peoples money

    the only intelligent self-respecting plan is to spend no more at most than
one earns and to use ones credit solely as a business asset a capital to be in-
vested only when returns are reasonably sure

single track

when all is said and done it would seem that dogged persistence is the
greatest single factor in success it enters largely into the make-up
of the schoolboy who stands at the head of his class it is a main
characteristic of the business man who wins out over his competitors
it is the lifting force that puts a man on the level where iarge achievements
are possible success is sustained interest failure is the lack of it no one
can be kept out of his inheritance who is able to seize upon his object and hold
it for examination and knowledge there is a large place in the world for
the man who can inclose a thing in a circle and focus his mind upon it with

sustained attention inhibiting everything else that does not relate itself to that
thing

     the habit of localization is one of the greatest helps in securing an honorable
position in life nobody cares to be associated with a scatterbrain no job that
is worth having can be held long by a man whose mind wanders over a score
of things when it should be fixed upon one the power of attention-the single-
track mind-will make for clearness of thought retentiveness of memory sane-
ness of imagination it will help you to your share of all good things

states of opportunity

vi-a western banking state

when the federal board came to locate the twelve national-reserve banks
authorized for the whole united states they put two of the banks in
one state-and the state was not new york nor pennsylvania-but
missouri

    missouri is an old state and very conservative it is now preparing to
celebrate its hundredth anniversary of statehood it has a daily newspaper over
one hundred years old and there still stands many a house built in the days of
daniel boone and james fenimore cooper

    perhaps no other state is so hard to classify whether it is a northern
southern or western state is always open to argument it is a part of all three
with a great deal of the east mixed in it is a large state both in size and
population-and very wealthy in a national convention it casts thirty-six votes
it has two very large growing cities-st louis and kansas city and four other
cities larger than the biggest city in many a state-st joseph springfield joplin
hannibal it has a big university of high standing and almost a dozen good
colleges scattered about the state

    and yet there are many people in america who imagine missouri is a
raw wild-west state of indians and bank robbers following the civil war a
gang of desperate and rather picturesque bandits won for themselves and the
state a great deal of notoriety but it should be remembered that the james boys
had gone out of business in missouri even before tweeds gang evacuated new
york for more than thirty years missouri has been conservatively even tech-
nically and almost painfully law-abiding

     although missouri has been settled a long time and is in a pretty high state
of development it is full of opportunities of every conceivable sort there is
plenty of room an abundance of rawmaterial and exceptional railroad and river
facilities for shipping

    land is not yet as high-priced as the same sort east of the mississippi to
the man of small means the ozark mountains in the south part of the state
offer great chances for fruit growing and stock raising thousands of acres of
land may be had for ten to twenty dollars an acre and although broken and
rocky the soil is good and is excellent for pasturage and fruit growing the
climate is almost ideal and the apples peaches and strawberries of this section
are famous throughout america

    instead of robbing the newcomer missouri offers him the best banking
facilities and a way to make something to put in the bank
indigo pete adjuster

by henry herbert knibbs

author of  the amazing tenderfoot   sunny mateel  etc

a holdup story tfiat is different a brief but exciting bit of action from the
west in which a tenderfoot figures as the victim and a holdup man is the hero
a well-drawn character the adjuster youll want to hear more of his adventures

the snn was close to the rim of
the desert when the tenderfoot
reached the top of the range

      below him a white dot shim-
mered and wavered in the oncoming
shadows the dot was the tentand
the tenderfoot wished with all his heart
that he had heeded his friend yeabos
advice-yeabo was not a tenderfoot-
and allowed the latter to make the jour-
ney to town for supplies turning and
looking the other way the tenderfoot
saw a dot of light then another and
another malachite was beginning to
wake up it was almost as far to the
town as it was to the tent still-the
tenderfoot sighed and tugged at the lead
rope of the burro down the trail they
clattered the tenderfoot whistled
bravely somehow or other the ro-
mance of the desert had vanished dis-
solved in the sunset leaving a creeping
chill of unpleasant anticipation

  halfway down the range the tender-
foot turned the noise behind him was
that of a horse slipping and catching
itself among the loose rocks of the trail
then came a whole-souled curse and
the jingle of bridle reins the tender-
foot naturally wondered who it was
presently the sound of shod hoofs on
rock came nearer and a voice low-
pitched and tinged with an inexpressible
melancholy quavered into song

oh i had a girl in san antone

  she had a beau lived down that way

i met up with him one night alone-

  stand on your feet you glass-eyed
lizard you thats whats your feets
for

  then came the chuck of spurs and
a grunt

i met up with him one night alone

  and thats why im skinnin mules to-
     day

  the tenderfoot grinned despite his
fatigue and fear he enjoyed the
lyric but a tense silence followed
broken only by the soft slither of roll-
ing pebbles just then the tenderfoot
sneezed

  put em up called the unknown

and he was obeyed

  with the heavy breathing of the
horse and the creak of saddle leather
came the dim outline of a tall individ-
ual huge in the gloom and loosely alert
stand right where you be dont
move and a hand jerked his pistol
from its holster now shell and
dont waste time thinkin about it

  the tenderfoot shelled a watch
twenty-five dollars and some odd cents
a pocketknife a collapsible drinking
cup a silver cigarette case a bunch of
keys-

  and that there ring signified the
gaunt intruder

  the tenderfoot demurred the ring
was graven with a college class emblem
and precious to its owner

  whats the idea queried the ten-
derfoot the ring isnt worth much
indigo petet adjuster



  the ideas mine said the horse-
man

  slowly the tenderfoot drew the ring
from his finger and handed it to the
other

  all right now get a-goin

  but the burro-the-supplies-im
camped with a friend down below
surely--

  surely is right im just needin a
burro and a pack of grub myself get
a-goin

  if youll put down that gun and
stand up like a man- began the ten-
derfoot

  the other laughed i sure hate
work he said and it would take some
right smart work to down you i
reckon you size up square

  thats more than i can say of you
sir

  its kind of dark to see aint it
queried the other

  the tenderfoot realized that discre-
tion had its uses and gave over the
lead rope grudgingly if i were in
your business id hold up something
worth while and not go about pilfer-
ing he said scornfully

  you dont reckon yourself worth
much then

  i do but your-er-pilfering
hasnt got yon much

  thats right pardner i ought to
got you afore you bought them canned
goods but im wastin time get

         

a-gom 

  no hurry is there came from the
brush just back of the outlaw

  the tenderfoot felt his heart jump
and stop and then pump hard

  the outlaw stood stiff in his tracks
slowly his hands went up the ten-
derfoot could see the dull gleam of his
pistol in the dusk the unexpected ar-
rival pushed through the brush and
neatly secured the gun

  hes got another-mine said the
tenderfoot

  thanks said the third member of
the coterie ill see to that

  im mighty grateful to you said
the tenderfoot addressing his apparent
rescuer

  to this the other paid no attention
but peered through the gloom oh
its you  he said suddenly well as
you was just sayin to this here hombre
get a-goin 

  the outlaw grumbled and swung to
the saddle

  and go on down-not up said the
third member

  past them he rode slouching in the
saddle clattering down the steep trail
from below came the echo of a range
ditty about san antone its rasp
harper said the rescuer then he got
busy

  just set down he said you need
a rest anyhow now whats the pile
amount to

  its all on that rock there said the
tenderfoot

  well keep a-settin and he
struck a match and surveyed the little
pile of money and trinkets huh
rasp must a been hard up was he
aimin to take the burro and all 

  he was

prospecting

ances like well i been bronchobuster

over the range till the pot quits boilin
so i turned  me pete i turned agin
old rasp and took the goods right out
of his war bag which is agin the rules
of the game he seen you first
course him bein nothin but a low-
down chicken-hfter kind of a holdup
it aint so bad hed ought to be dis-
couraged in his work he ought to be
skinnin mules or somethin what dont
take brains anyhow-

  the tenderfoot made as if to stand
up but petes gun swung round set
still pardner i aint half through

deliberately held up a-er-fellow out-
law and that you intend-

ten im a adjuster now heres the

come in as the fella that had the goods
on me but youd have to swear rasp
took em settin reputation aside id
stand a good chance of gettin off easy
but they aint no court of law cept me
and this here gun law aint what
things ought to be but what things is
sabe 

i understand that ive fallen out of
the frying pan into the fire-thats all

taking it thats all

good gosh but that is like a ten-
derfoot  the burro kin feed all night

with me right now i got to make a
stake

  the tenderfoot who was in reality a
rather husky young chap and only ten-
der in that he was new to the west
nodded ill go he said and rose

  indigo pete sighed and holstered his
gun im feelin better aint talked
so much since i tried to explain to my
second wife that the first one didnt
come a-iookin me up because i asked
her to jest step ahead and well try
our luck

  smoke eddied through the swinging
doors as pete pushed into the room
the tenderfoot followed have some-
thin queried pete

  the other shook his head

  correc well wait

  for an appreciable second a tense
hush fell over the crowded room as
pete pushed back his battered som-
brero and nodded to this one and that
one then began the hum of low-
voiced conversation the ball spun in
the wheel and the monotonous voice of
the dealer beat upon the undercurrent
of talk straight to the faro layout
marched pete the tenderfoot pulled a
handful of gold and silver from his
pocket and placed it at random pete
edged close to the table again came
the hush-then a voice the tender-
foot smiled nervously gathered in his
winnings and turned to pete a by-


the cpocpular magazine

stander sneered and murmured quit-
ter

  pete swung on his heel reached in
his pocket and with tobacco and
papers rolled a cigarette his eyes
narrowed gents he said slowly
this here gent is a friend of mine
any objections

  there were no objections

  out in the glimmer of stars the ten-
derfoot turned to pete i counted
one hundred and seventy-five dollars
heres one hundred and fifty

  nope im a adjuster listen
theres different kinds of ways of
playin square half for me and half
for you goes i aint got time to talk
theys one fella in there that i dont
know and such is takin chances im
gone so long theyll be pokin
around your camp to-morrow lookin
for somethin they wont find if they
ask if you seen me tell em sure thing
if they ask where i be tell em to ask
me thats all

  the tenderfoot turned and started up
the street to face the long journey back
to camp he had passed the corner
when he heard the clatter of a horses
feet a shout and a shot he turned
pete dove under a pony that was
hitched to the rail in front of the sa-
loon whipped the tie rope loose and
swung to the saddle across the street
came a man running figures surged
in the doorway glare of the saloon
pete tore past the tenderfoot bending
low in the saddle s long kid
nother adjuster just lit in town i
reckon-and he turned and shouted
the final words-hell be wantin to
talk to you

  a horse or two flicked past in pur-
suit of indigo pete the tenderfoot
turned at the pressure of a hand on his
shoulder

  the situation was a difficult one to
explain away and so some holdup
shells you-then pete shells both of
you-huh and you got the face to tell

me you come peaceful with pete and
jolt the faro layout for a hundred and
seventy-five-and you a tenderfoot
think up somethin thatll slip down
easier

  the tenderfoot smiled thats all
there is to it sheriff im not used to
lying

 well-mebby- say where you

from anyhow 

  utica new york

 

  oh sure yes but i mean recent
im camped with yeabo jones the
prospector-over the range

  yeabo eh and he lets you run
loose like this

  see here youre an officer and im
bound to respect the law but i want to
tell you right now that you wont gain
anything by that style of talk ill an-
swer any decent question and ill an-
swer it straight im a- tenderfoot-
thats settled and im where you can
have a heap of fun with me-perhaps
pardon me if i suggest that youd look
better on a horse after pete than trying
to josh me

 good now i know youre all
right i knew the minute you begun to
git mad that you were tellin a straight
story just my way of findin out
young fella

  the tenderfoot smiled again thats
all right i didnt appreciate your sys-
tem thats all i suppose i can go
now 

  sure but its a long drill over the
range and its gettin late better turn
in at the hotel ill lend you a hoss in
the morning

  thanks i think thats a good
idea

  with the crisp dawn the tenderfoot
was astir a few dusty and weary
riders loped in and dismounted they
had lost petes trail somewhere up in
the hills moreover their ponies were
not fresh having been used the previ-
ous day in trailing indigo pete to haw-
ley the tenderfoot had breakfast
ndigo petbf djuster



mounted the borrowed horse and am-
bled toward the hills he had come
west in search of local color and he
felt saturated with it for the time being

  up the range he plodded and down
the range he drifted sitting back and
marveling at the ease and sureness with
which the little pony kept its feet on
the ragged trail at the place where
he had experienced his first real thrill
-all thrills of fiction were decidedly
secondary now-he reined up the
burro was gone had he been alive to
the trail he would have seen burro
tracks and pony tracks zigzagging on
down the steep toward the white dot on
the flat far below he wondered what
yeabo would say probably the old
prospector would enjoy the joke for
there was much humor in the recent cir-
cumstance despite its promise of trou-
ble the tenderfoot had been robbed-
twice-and had his belongings restored
with interest to boot the trail became
steeper and he centered his attention
on the pony-a most unnecessary but
natural proceeding

  as he drew near the little tent he
heard voices evidently some one had
made an early-morning call and some
one had

  the tenderfoot swung from the sad-
dle and hailed the camp from the tent
emerged yeabo his white beard flutter-
ing in the breeze then he disappeared
into the tent its all right he heard
yeabo say and indigo pete pushed
back the flap and stood grinning in the
sunlight yep its me welcome to
our city yeaboll rastle some grub
and ill picket that hoss of yourn
come on in you found the right
place

  b-but theyre after you

  sure as a cat with kittens but they
aint got me

  the tenderfoot failed to grasp the
subtlety of petes plan the last place
on earth that a sheriff would search
would be the camp of the man who

had been robbed indigo pete was as
safe in yeabo jones camp-safer in-
deed-than out in the brush and
pete had said he knew yeabo evi-
dently he did for the two old-timers
were deep in a discussion of placer
mining when the tenderfoot finally got
himself together and entered the tent
the tenderfoot felt that he-was for the
nonce about as noticeable to them as
the fly which crawled lazily along the
ridge of the tent when you are in
rome-an alien-be silent so he
thought and instinctively refrained
from talking there were questions he
wanted to ask all in good time they
were answered without his having
asked

  i aint much stuck on work indigo
was sajing but theys times when its
necessary if you think you got some-
thing good yeabo why me and the
boy herell dig in and try her out i
need a rest anyhow course i reckon
to leave right sudden if i see the time
cornin if you want to make a hand-
shake on it heres mine

  yeabo mumbled his cud of tobacco
and spat then he extended his
knotted brown hand she goes he
said and turned to getting breakfast

  me and hims rid together-in the
ole days said pete addressing the ten-
derfoot yeabo thinks hes got a
strike up in the canon yonder some-
thin to keep a fella from thinkin of his
past life-workin a claim eh well
well work her and let the county pay
for hoss feed and ammunition a spell
course you got a say in it what do
you say

  oh nothing im satisfied only
i think youre taking a big risk 

  ever see a fly on a hoss nose yep
well that fly was sure safes long as
he stayed on that hoss nose eh  what
could the bronc do jest rar and
stomp and run-and the fly gits a free
ride sabe  thats me im settin
on the hoss nose-which is this here


the populjr magazine

malachite county and the county
will be rarin and stompin around
tryin to git me-while im restin
your idea of resting strikes me as
peculiar youre the most active
rester ive ever seen

  course did you know it rests a
bronc to lope after hes been walkin
sames it rests a bronc to walk after
hes been lopin and i been lopin some
boy lopin some

  but the horse you-er-borrowed
course turned him loose this
mornin hell jest nacherally stray
back to malachite whered he light
from says the posse and nobody
knows eh 

  but as you said last night youre
afoot isnt that rather against your
principles 

  youre whistlin boy it sure is
but the bunch over to malachite knows
me and they wront be lookin for me
afoot theys more to this here game
than you sabe i reckon shes a hum-
dinger to play right

  come and get it called yeabo and
the hungry ones came

  several days later wrhile panning
color in the canon pete approached
the tenderfoot who was tasting the first
and keen tang of getting gold from the
earth you need a rest said pete
squatting and rolling a cigarette why
dont you ramble over to malachite and
take a look around mebby you could
pick up a hoss-you was sayin you
expected to buy a good saddle hoss right
soon me and yeabo can wash all the
dust we can git out of this nickel-a-
pan deal

  but i thought it was a good find
s-sh dont talk so loud or youll
make ole yeabo feel bad anything
that looks like gold tickles him to death
hes dreamin right now that this here
wildcat deal of his will make him rich
all prospectors does-and the ole-
timers is the worst its goin to play

out afore long i know the looks of
it but it keeps him happy-so dont
say nothin

  oh i see well i wont

  thats right yeabos got feelins
same as you and me

  pies great exclaimed the tender-
foot

  indigo pete smiled slowly yes-
to you he is hes filled you up with
all kinds of yarns about the west sure
he has moseyed around some but his
lifes been like sunday-school teachin
alongside of me why i could tell
you-but say you goin over to mala-
chite 

  well perhaps i dont exactly see
the necessity just now

  course but i does id kind of
like to know who is talkin over there
these days sabe

  all right ill run over in the
morning

  say boy i wouldnt walk youll
finish stronger

  that evening round the tiny fire
they talked of various things deftly
pete led the conversation round to
horses he touched the subject lightly
at first having a plan in mind then
he elaborated and the tenderfoot ab-
sorbed gome actually valuable informa-
tion about the points of a western
cayuse when pete had finished his
talk the tenderfoot thanked him you
have told me more about horses than
i ever knew could be told he said

  pete smiled to himself i sure want
you to get a good one he said and the
tenderfoot wondered why old yeabos
beard twitched and why that rugged
old rascal passed his hand over his face
as though brushing away a--smile per-
chance 

  the evening following the tenderfoot
rode in to camp astride a short-coupled
buckskin that stepped briskly and dis-
played considerable good-natured ac-
tion the tenderfoot was a bit aston-
ished that pete manifested so little
rndigo pete adjster



interest in the horse yeabo jones in-
spected the pony and approved of him
still the tenderfoot was not so over-
whelmed with enthusiasm that he did
not notice yeabos expression of worry
-yeabo who was usually as placid as
the hills could there be something-
wrong with the horse

  how much queried pete pres-
ently

  only a hundred isnt he a beauty
now ill be able to go anywhere i
needed a horse

  uh-uh hes fair whered you
get that saddle

  with the horse-all in one lump-
for a hundred

  uh-uh center fire ole visalia
tree easy to ride

  im glad you like it gee but im
hungry 

  the pony was picketed they had
supper and gathered about the night
fire as usual yeabo seemed unusually
silent the tenderfoot mentioned that
the town folk of malachite had seemed
to have almost forgotten the recent and
brief advent of indigo and the ripple
of excitement following indigo
coughed and rolled another cigarette
the tenderfoot was tired he drowsed
sitting before the fire with head droop-
ing indigo beckoned to yeabo jones
who immediately got up and followed
him to the tent there was a whis-
pered argument-a terse word or two
from pete and yeabo came out and
took his seat by the fire several min-
utes later indigo also appeared nodded
to yeabo and passed back of the tent
and disappeared

  yeabos eternal come and get it
summoned the sleeping tenderfoot to
consciousness and eventually to the
fireside he ate heartily and then pro-
posed to inspect his new pony yeabo
busied himself with the dishes the
tenderfoot rose and stretched grabbed
up his hat and strode toward the flat

where the pony was picketed yeabo
was wiping a tin plate when the tender-
foot came back on the run wheres
my horse wheres indigo pete he
shouted

  i was wonderin you didnt miss him
at grub said yeabo

  thought he might have had break-
fast and gone to the stream said the
tenderfoot

  well hes gone

 gone you mean-

  uh-uh

  but why didnt lie say something
great scott-and he took my pony
reckon he did pete takes most
anything he needs

  but i thought he was going to stay

here  said he was safer here-

  yep but he got to thinkin last
night when you said the folks over
to malachite had quit wonderin where
he was he got a hunch things acts
that way sometimes if theyd been
talkin about him lots hed a stayed
longer hes a wise one-that indigo
i thought he was-er-at least half
decent in his way said the tenderfoot

  i reckon he is-to some now i
got these here dishes put by ill give
you his letter and old yeabo plodded
to the tent and returned with a
scrawled sheet of soiled paper the
tenderfoot seized it and read

  the hoss is a good hoss and i needed
one so i took him you sure was lucky
in gettin a stayer for i am goin to make
the long ride it is time to make the ride
for i got the right hunch hunches is
worth more than money if you listen to
them yeabo was ornery about lendin me
the money to pay forhim but i am honust
at times when i feel like it this one of
them times you are not the worst i met
they is lots worse mebby some day you
and me will meet up again you say the
hoss was one hundred  only had about
eighty from that good play you made in
malakite i stuck up yeabo for the twenty
to make it a hundred him actin bronk
but it was no good he knows me not
trustin him too mutch i leaves the hundred
under that rock by the stream where you


the popular magazine

set when you git tired of pannin gold
you kin find it there yeabo would lied
to you if i give it to him for you now
to fix this thing up you got the price of
your hoss back again and i borrows twenty
from yeabo you kin pay yeabo the
twenty and make it all square i alius was
trew to my friends as my enemys knows
you are my friend if i do say so yeabo is
a ole fool but he canot help it if you
ever need a frend and i am around just
holler	indigo pete

adjuster

  the tenderfoot reread the scrawl and
turned to yeabo did he borrow
twenty dollars from you

 he did-with a gun in my stum-
mick

  the tenderfoot smiled then he got
up and hastened to the rock there he
found a roll of bills and some loose sil-
ver-a hundred dollars in all slowly
he returned to camp stripped two tens
from the roll and presented them to
yeabo the old prospector glanced up

in surprise that squares us-all
around said the tenderfoot

 did pete leave the dough-for
you

  it seems so but we wont discuss
it further i-here is his letter

  yeabo took the scrawl and held it
upside down pretending to read it the
tenderfoot had had no idea that yeabo
could not read carefully the tender-
foot folded the letter when yeabo had
completed his bluff at reading i cant
understand just why pete left us he
said

  thars why said yeabo pointing
toward the range

  silhouetted against the morning sky
line were four riders they stood gaz-
ing into the valley-then reined round
and rode on down toward the little tent
on the flat

  leave it to pete said yeabo
hes got twelve hours start

horse show much to his surprise and the disappointment of his friends the

him for an opinion on the failure

    it was your bad driving was the grooms terse reply

    judge moore made no comment and passed out of the grounds a friend
who accompanied him much surprised by the grooms gruffness turned to the
owner and said

    moore why do you let your groom talk to you like that

    moore smiled

    you wont wonder he answered when i tell you a bit of personal his-
tory a number of years ago in chicago when i was operating in new york

we were at the station a half
hour ahead of train time but
baron moto was already
there and unobserved we
watched him as he walked up arid down
the platform beside the train smoking

with me tommy i expect im going
to find some tough riddles to guess
down there

  i expcct to find a good share of the
answers right here in new york or
at least a straight tip as to where to go
to locate them answered tommy con-

thing up now get under cover for
im going to make your task easier by
rousing the feudal daimio so thor-
oughly in our japanese friend that he
wont be able to get his made-in-
germany strategic machine working
smoothly for another week

  the baron caught sight of us as we
passed through the gate but he mani-
fested no surprise and advanced eagerly
to meet us

  this is an unexpected pleasure are
we to be fellow voyagers  he asked
cordially

  no i have things to do in new
york just now among others a por-
trait of la duvalief which will par-
tially console me for my disappoint-
ment in losing the commission to do the
baroness answered tommy but we
did come here to see you baron we
have had rather a curious experience in
my studio while we were at dinner
in the adjoining room the cabinet con-
taining the sword you are so much in-
terested in was opened

  the baron gave an exclamation of
surprise and his hand went to his
pocket with a suddenness which star-
tled me but he withdrew it grasping
nothing more threatening than the cab-
inet key

  but mr williams this has never
for an instant been out of my posses-
sion  he exclaimed i hope that you
do not suspect that i was concerned in
this-i confess that you might be justi-
fied knowing how ardently i desire to
obtain possession of that weapon of my
ancestors-which by the way i sin-
cerely trust has come to no harm

  no i know that key did not open
the cabinet the one which did was left
in the door as for the weapon that
is still safe and in my keeping as you
can see for yourself he opened the
cloth exposing to view the lacquered
box but for a man who had been so
passionately interested the baron looked
at it with a strange indifference

  ah my dear sir i am inexpressibly
relieved for one day i hope to prevail
upon you to permit me to purchase that
weapon from you he said after sat-
isfying himself that the silken cord was
still fastened with the same curious
knot which only japanese fingers fash-
ioned i am even more relieved that
you will have no reason to suspect me
i am carried away most unexpectedly
and had the attempted theft been suc-
cessful you would have been quite jus-
tified in reading a plausible connection
between it and a departure so sudden
that it would suggest flight

  yes such a thing might have been
possible but as the thief was unsuc-
cessful- with a quick movement

he unfastened the knot and opened the
cover the hand which the baron had
extended in a fruitless effort to restrain
him fell to his side and an involuntary
exclamation came from his lips as he
gazed like a man hypnotized at the
sword still resting upon the padded
silken cushion ignoring the exclama-
tion and the sudden change in his man-
ner tommy finished his sentence as
unconcernedly as if there had been no

interruption  -and as i prevented

his escape by temporarily disabling him
with a bullet there was no reason to
connect you with the attempted theft

  for just a moment i didnt know
whether the baron intended to start a
fight or make an attempt to bolt neither
would have surprised me for he looked
like a cornered rat but with a most
unexpected ease he recovered his self-
possession and met tommy on his own
ground in spite of the absence of a
direct accusation tommys actions
and explanation demonstrated plainly
enough that he had not been hood-
winked and the baron tacitly admitted
at least a most profound interest in the
affair

  temporarily disabled but he still
lives he demanded and tommy
nodded
the third phse



  yes he was still unconscious when
i left the studio to come here but the
wound was only trivial it was the
shock of concussion which knocked him
out he explained i expect that he
will have left when we return as he
was the only one who sustained any
damage i have no wish to make this
thing public

  the baron looked at him curiously
there was nothing of gratitude in his
expression he seemed to appreciate
that tommy was willing to match wits
without taking advantage of the oppor-
tunity to enlist outside assistance

  and this woman la duvalief she
was there when this happened

  rather she was dining with us and
making herself so fascinating that ex-
cept for an accident the trick would
have been turned without our knowing
anything of it answered tommy and
i am sure that even the keen scrutiny
of the baron discovered no trace of sus-
picion in his voice or expression she
is charming baron i am indebted to
you for the introduction and i trust
that the near-tragedy in which she was
unwittingly involved will not deter her
from returning for her portrait i shall
try to guard against a repetition by
depositing this in a safe place

  the baron could not conceal the cov-
ctousness in the eyes which watched
tommys hands replace the cover on
the box

  mr williams i trust that you will
guard and preserve it carefully until i
return he said gravely his face again
curiously like the daimio portrait which
tommy had painted there is much
which you cannot understand but one
day i hope that i can tell you enough
to win your consent to part with it
there was a grim smile on tommys
lips as he finished wrapping it up in the
cloth and to my surprise he extended
his hand to the baron when that task
was accomplished

  ill promise you this much baron

moto he said quietly ill do my
best to prevent it from passing to any
one else-and also to bring things about
which in the old feudal days of japan
would have made you doubly anxious
to get it into your possession

  the baron made no pretense of ig-
noring the challenge and he smiled as
he accepted the proffered hand

  i understand i thank you for your
generosity your first victory but i
will again quote the proverb to-day
to thee to-morrow to me  he said
confidently

  safety first thats my motto ex-
claimed tommy with a grin when i
asked him as we rode back to the
studio what had induced him to take
the trouble to look the baron up that
was one beautiful little scheme which
he had framed up and our lives
wouldnt have been wrorth a canceled
postage stamp if he had gotten away
with it the full beauty of it didnt
dawn on me until i noticed his indiffer-
ence when i exhibited the box to him in
the station just remember this ac-
cording to his lights he was doing noth-
ing dishonorable in trying to cop out
that sword i suppose that as a matter
of fact it was stolen from his family
the mikados adherents were doing
everything possible to destroy the feu-
dal traditions and the power of the
shoguns and most of their possessions
were looted but he must have done
some remarkably quick thinking this
morning in the studio for his plan
was made right there he put the
cover on the box and you may have
noticed the peculiar knot of the silk
cord which fastened it the fashioning
of that knot is just as scrupulously
regulated by custom as every other de-
tail of the old feudal life the secre-
tary sheygio-as thoroughly imbued
with the old traditions as his hereditary
chief-would tie it in exactly the same
way almost automatically that knot


the tpocpullcr magazine

was the one thing which the baron ex-
amined with the slightest interest when
i showed him the box at the station
and it was mainly to make that test
and convince myself that i took the
trouble to go there

  i dont get you it seemed to me
that he didnt betray any particular in-
terest until you opened the box-or
started to

  that last qualification gives me a
little hope for you exclaimed tommy
impatiently if you live long enough
and travel with me you may learn to
observe such trifles in the first place
when i unwrapped the cloth the baron
had every reason to suppose that we
had simply discovered that the cabinet
had been opened at that time i had
told him nothing of the interruption of
the theft he probably supposed that
only a part of the scheme had miscar-
ried that after removing the sword
his agent had neglected to lock the
door that is why he started to pre-
vent me from opening the box he
didnt believe the sword was in it and
he didnt want me to discover that it
was missing here is just what i had
figured out the sword itself the real
thing that he was after was formerly
in full view through the glass because
i purposely left the box uncovered
now a good deal of his talk about
screening it from the view of profaning
eyes was pure bunk a part of his
scheme when he asked my permission
to carry away the key he believed that
it would prevent me from opening the
cabinet until he returned it but he un-
doubtedly gave me credit for an obser-
vation keen enough to make me notice
the peculiarity of that knot through the
glass now had things gone off just
as he planned la duvalief would have
kept us so interested and absorbed at
the table that we should not have no-
ticed anything going on in the studio
his soft-footed clansman would have
slipped in removed the sword from the

case retied that peculiar knot so that
i would never suspect it had been tam-
pered with and made his get-away with
the real goods without arousing our
suspicions that unsuspected burglar
alarm upset everything-and fortu-
nately the strong electric shock so dis-
turbed sheygios aim that he missed
me that is the way i doped it out
and the test i just finished with the
baron convinces me that i was exactly
right he expected sheygio to join
him at the station with the sword in his
possession

  but tommy that sort of figuring
seems to me to be about as profitless
as crying over spilled milk i pro-
tested you had the main facts and
you couldnt have doubted for a minute
that baron moto was behind the whole

scheme whats the use of-

  i wanted to satisfy myself of just
what we are up against of just how
far that medieval jap was capable of
going-and ive satisfied myself that
hell go the limit to get this inter-
rupted tommy grimly the grip of his
hands instinctively tightening on the
package if everything had turned
out just as he had planned he could
have counted safely on at least twenty-
four hours freedom from suspicion it
would probably have been at least that
before my curiosity would have led me
to force the cabinet lock that would
have been ample time for his japanese
household here to disappear now
fond as we are of the diggings we have
so long occupied youll acknowledge
that they are so isolated that almost
anything might happen there without
attracting attention and that ram-
shackle old building is notoriously a fire
trap its my guess that if he had pulled
off the first part there would have been
a second which would have prevented
a discovery of the theft before we be-
came suspicious the whole place would
have been destroyed

  by jove tommy thats going pretty
the third phase



far but i believe you are right i ac-
knowledged la duvalief even con-
fessed that she would be willing to
burn the place to get that confounded
thing 

  exactly it was that casual remark
which first suggested it to me agreed
tommy you must always remember
one thing old chap try as hard as we
may we can never fully realize what
a tremendous appeal this weapon makes
to the clansmen of the moto takimuras
for it appeals to traits and sentiments
which our race has forgotten for a
thousand years to them this weapon
is a sacred thing in trying to recover
it they are actuated by the same spirit
which sent the knights of the round
table over the face of the earth in
search of the holy grail and stimulated
the christian kings of europe to forget
their quarrels and unite in a crusade
to wrest the holy sepulcher from the
possession of infidels they didnt hesi-
tate to sack and burn towns which stood
in their way and i dont believe these
japs would consider it anything but a
legitimate move if they were forced
to commit murder and arson to get this
back thats why i told em to turn
that delegate sheygio loose making
a charge of burglary against him would
have been a little too much like having
sir galahad pinched for breaking the
speed limit when he was chasing the
grail

  we had reached the studio entrance
as he made the whimsical conclusion
to his explanation and i laid a restrain-
ing hand upon his arm

  just the same tommy it wont
make much difference to us whether
we are bowled out by a common bur-
glar or a fanatic and if youll take my
tip youll drive to the day and night
bank and leave that thing until you can
put it in a safe-deposit box then in
the morning you will recall your invi-
tation to la duvalief to sit for her
portrait she isnt swayed by any of

these motives of barbaric chivalry but
shes out for the goods and from what
weve seen of her she isnt too finicky
in her methods she was ready to shoot
me this morning she did her best to
poison you and if arkell hadnt ducked
she would have shot him across the
table-and i dont see that we need that
kind of a visitor in the apartment
tommy shook himself free and stepped
to the sidewalk and his face was very
grave as he turned to me in the door-
way

  my boy if i can inveigle her into
coming there regularly we can get some
sort of a line on what she is up to-and
in these troublous times thats a useful
line to know about he said seriously
you are entirely right she isnt actu-
ated by any of the motives which make
the japs unscrupulous as to methods to
get this weapon but she would be even
more unscrupulous than they if she
could accomplish the same result just
remember that arkell divided this mex-
ican situation into two phases  the first
of them the commercial which is over
with the second the teutonic which
concerned itself simply with mexican
internal affairs but there is a third
phase developing beneath the surface
a phase which for the first time dis-
tinctly threatens us and from what we
know we have every reason to believe
that the hand of baron moto is pull-
ing the strings now just what motive
inspires la duvalief to aid him i dont
know but i am convinced that it is a
powerful one and im going to find
out so long as i have this sword in
my possession that jap isnt going to
lose track of me and its the one best
bet that la duvalief will be the agent
he employs to spy upon me he doesnt
know that we discovered the imposture
of o yucha san and thinks that his
introduction was taken at its face value
as a simple courtesy and then above
all there is another reason

  he hesitated looking at me with a


the cpocpular magazine

strange expression of embarrassment
in his eyes

  confound it i suppose that youll
think that im an erratic fool carried
away by a sentimental chivalry but i
cant help it he went on quickly la
duvalief is no innocent little schoolgirl
but shes white now i cant get it
out of my head--call it a hunch if you
like-that shes in the power of that
yellow schemer that she is in deathly
fear of him and ive got just enough
of the caucasian prejudice against the
tinted races to make that a pill which
i cant swallow if she is mixed up
in any scheme teutonic or japanese
which will lead to attack upon the
united states ill do my best to beat
her but thats a different matter from
standing by and seeing a white woman
obeying a yellow-skinned man through
fear

  he turned abruptly and in silence i
followed him up the interminable stairs
i knew that argument would be use-
less for he had expressed in words only
a tenth part of the aversion which was
one of his pets but i hoped that a
nights reflection would convince him
that his scruples were quixotic he
paused at the studio door and turned
to me with a finger on his lips

  thats strange i thought they
would have clcared out before this
he wthispered

  i listened and muffled by the thick
oak of the door a subdued chanting was
audible from the studio tommy care-
fully inserted his pass-key and opened
the door the studio was brightly il-
luminated and contained the same hu-
man occupants as when we left but
there was a marked and amazing change
in their grouping

  on the divan where we had left him
stretched unconscious sheygio sat upon
his heels as only a jap can perhaps
six feet from him on either side the
secret-service men stood watching him
closely while la duvalief her eyes

alert her face white and her lips set
watched them she was standing close
to the door so close that tommy had
to motion to her to move before he
could open it fully the japanese was
swaying his body gently forward and
back from the hips in time with the
curious rhythm of the weird chant
which came from between lips which
barely moved it was that strange tune
which we had heard and while our
entrance did not interrupt it its char-
acter quickly changed as his curious
inscrutable eyes caught sight of us
before it had seemed a simple narra-
tive but rising to a shrill falsetto it
became an unmistakable defiance or
paean of victory no word of it was
intelligible to me and i knew that
tommy knew no more of japanese than
i but in the situation he read a sig-
nificance which i missed

  grab him quick he shouted to the
two officers and even before they could
make a move he jumped for the man
on the divan himself only to fall
sprawling tripped by the dainty foot
and ankle which la duvalief shot out
in front of him she was evidently too
resourceful to depend twice bn the
same tactics and when i too jumped
forward i was stopped by her full
weight fairly catapulted against me
while my arms were pinioned to my
sides in an embrace which for a mo-
ment i found it impossible to break
and just that moment was enough for
over her shoulder i saw sheygio draw
from beneath his coat a sword which in
size and design was almost the coun-
terpart of the one he had come to
steal and then before the startled
officers could reach him he plunged the
keen blade into his abdomen and gave
the long handle a wrench sideways
which must have made the blade half
sever his spinal column

  with the cry of defiance suddenly
stilled he sat for a moment bolt upright
and then the soul of moto i to fled to
the thicrd phase



the shinto valhalla to proclaim to the
shades of his samurai ancestors that
strong in- the faith of his fathers he
had chanted the death song of the moto
takimuras and paid for his failure in
the mission on which his chief had sent
him according to the ancient and hon-
orable rite of hara-kiri his body
pitched forward and tommy his ex-
pression strangely reverent helped to
replace it on the couch before turning
on the woman who met defiantly his
sternly accusing eyes

chapter x

  mademoiselle that mans death is
as much on your head as if your hands
had driven the sword home said
tommy his voice dangerously steady
his manner ominously restrained you
speak japanese you knew that he
chanted the samurai death song and
your intimate knowledge of the people
must have told you that chant is always
the preliminary to suicide

  la duvalief shrugged her shoulders
and seated herself comfortably before
answering to all outward appear-
ances she was the least moved and
shocked of any of us by that sudden
tragedy

  your attitude savors of the judicial
but i have your own word for it that
decisions in the sort of game we are
playing are rarely rendered in a court
of law she said her voice as steady as
his own that being agreed upon i
will make admissions which might oth-
erwise be damaging yes i knew that
he chanted the death song but it did
not need that to tell me that he would
resort to hara-kiri from the moment
i recognized him after he was wounded
i realized that that would inevitably
follow perhaps i might have delayed
it but it would only have been a matter
of hours he would never have let the
sun rise upon his dishonor mr wil-
liams you are saddling me with the

responsibility for the whole code which
it took the samurais generations to per-
fect when you should be thanking me
for saving your life if i had not
tripped you and prevented you from
reaching him you would have received
that sword through your heart the
electric current which your ingenuity
devised disturbed the aim of his pistol
and saved you but moto ito was the
most expert of his clan in the use of
the ancient samurai weapons perhaps
it was fortunate for you that i do
understand japanese for the death
chant which your entrance interrupted
changed suddenly to the moto taki-
mura war cry of victory-and i let him
sacrifice himself to save you

  there was a suggestion of tremor
about her lips a softening of her voice
as she made that last admission and
tommy evidently finding it difficult to
meet the eyes in which defiance had
given way to an expression which he
found embarrassing turned impatiently
to the secret-service men

  perhaps you fellows have something
to say which will explain this you were
slow enough to act when i hollered at
you he grumbled

  morrison shook his head you cant
pass the buck to us mr williams
he answered that chap came around
within a few minutes after you left but
the concussion seemed to have knocked
everything but japanese out of his head
as soon as he straightened up he made
a break for that cabinet and when we
tackled him to hold him back he gave
us both a jujutsu toss that stood us on
our heads-it was the slickest trick i
ever saw turned we were ready to
tackle him again but this lady said a
few words to him in his own lingo it
seemed to knock all the fight out of
him but it didnt make him feel any
happier he squatted there on the
couch and commenced that spiel we
werent wise as to what it was about
we thought he was just plain nutty


the vovula magazine

and so long as he wasnt doing any dam-
age we didnt want to start anything
before you came back you bet we
were wary about jumping for him that
poor little cuss was all live wire and
spring steel and we were looking for
an opening to get a strangle hold on
him im mighty sorry but if you had
seen the way he put it over us before
youd have looked for an even break
before jumping at him too

  ferros curtly corroborated his side
partners story

  mademoiselle may i ask just what
you said to this poor fellow asked
tommy after locking the sword away
in a drawer of his desk

  certainly for i said only a few
words which prevented him from kill-
ing needlessly answered la duvalief
frankly if you had not taken that
sword with ou he would still have
accomplished what he came for as soon
as he regained consciousness had he
found it there he would have killed
both of these officers before they could
have regained their feet i saved them
when i told him that the sword had
been taken away while he was uncon-
scious and that he had been recognized
by their superior officer inspector ar-
kell unfortunately i could not make
him believe that your promise of im-
munity would be respected in the game
he has learned there is no room for
mercy and he undoubtedly believed
that he would be treated as a common
criminal i am sorry mr williams
for more reasons than one he died
without suspicion that you had pene-
trated my disguise had he lived to see
baron moto his report would have
been so favorable to me that i should
have been far advanced in his chiefs
confidence it was no small sacrifice
which i made when i had to choose on
the spur of the moment between your
life and the success of his mission for
had i not tripped you the man who lies
there would have left this studio in tri-

umph with the object of his quest i
should have accompanied him-and be-
hind us we should have left four dead
men she spoke of that possible solu-
tion with a callousness and indifference
which sent a cold shiver down my spine
and tommys eyelids narrowed as he
watched her

  i fear that your triumph would have
been short-lived mademoiselle you
forget that arkell would have read the
true significance of that evidence-and
your wrists would soon have known
again the touch of his manacles i
guessed that he had purposely reminded
her of that humiliation for his voice
was cuttingly sarcastic if he had in-
tended to anger her he was successful
as the flush which darkened her cheeks
testified

  clever as your friend may be he
could hardly read the significance of
evidence which had ceased to exist
she retorted and wise as you think
yourself you have small conception of
what these people whom you despise are
capable

  tommy could not resist the tempta-
tion to shoot a glance of triumph at
me	

  perhaps i can guess that even bet-
ter than you can mademoiselle he
answered for instance i believe that
they would have been quite capable of
destroying evidence by burning this
building and cremating our mortal re-
mains to cinders-if the white mans
blood which you have inherited had not
made you revolt against the unholy alli-
ance which you have made when you
were put to the crucial test the in-
voluntary start which she could not con-
ceal betrayed how closely he had ar-
rived at the truth and the flush which
deepened on her cheeks was eloquent
of humiliation in so far as it lay
in my power i paid in advance for your
service to me i talked with baron
moto at the station i did my best to
advance vott in his confidence when
the third phase



he returns i have no doubt that you
will be able to resume your interrupted
relationship and-

  stop she exclaimed passionately
as she rose to her feet it is not fair
for you to judge me so harshly for in
your eyes i read even a greater scorn
than your cruel words imply yes you
are absolutely right it was part of the
plan to destroy evidence by burning this
building but evidence of a theft only
cannot you understand that i came here
to prevent the possibility of violence
i knew of the plan to remove that sword
from its lacquer box surreptitiously if
possible but knowing those men and
the mania to possess it which obsessed
them i realized that if by any chance
their plan went wrong they would not
hesitate to amend it by murder that
was one reason that i volunteered to
become an accomplice in the theft
what does the possible loss of that
trinket mean to you nothing i
hoped that they would succeed but i
came here determined to prevent vio-
lence that is why i attempted to drug
you mr williams that concoction
was harmless its effects would have
disappeared within a couple of hours
but you were safer asleep than alert to
guard your property when those fa-
natics came for it

  tommys smile was plainly incredu-
lous as he turned and picked up the
automatic which arkell had knocked
from her hand

  and this pretty little toy-i notice
that the clip contains a dozen soft-nosed
bullets it is a curiously deadly weapon
for apeacemaker to carry he said

  with that pretty little toy i could
obliterate the pips on the ten of dia-
monds across this great studio in twenty
seconds she answered impatiently
that it is loaded with soft-nosed bul-
lets should make it tell its own story
a fanatic takes a lot of killing i car-
ried that as a last precaution sir when
i came here i believed that it was baron

moto himself who would make the at-
tempt you do not know-it is not
probable that you ever will know-the
price i should have to pay for my
weakness  but had the circumstance re-
quired it i should have sent the first
of those bullets through his head the
second through my own heart i cant
tell you why i do not know myself
god knows that in my life i have ex-
perienced little to prove to me that he
quality of mercy exists certainly noth-
ing to teach me to practice it as

	yucha san i came to this studio
this morning prepared to do anything
which would further the one cause for
which i have uncomplainingly suffered
-a cause which i could further only by
serving baron moto but the moment

	stepped inside of that door i was con-
scious that i had entered an atmos-
phere which i had never before known
and it affected me most curiously
never before have i played that part
so perfectly but that was because i
did it automatically-and i was play-
ing the part of an automaton i did not
know that you even suspected the im-
posture  but when by your infernal cun-
ning you roused in him that ancient
spirit which he has so successfully con-
cealed from all the world my very soul
revolted i dared not make open proc-
lamation that i was masquerading but
had my life been forfeited by it i could
not have refrained from dropping the
mask long enough to deny to you that
i was kin to that demon you had
raised

  the two secret-service men listened
open-mouthed she was evidently
oblivious to them to the body stiffen-
ing in rigor mortis on the divan to
everything except her passionate effort
to vindicate herself in tommys esti-
mation and curiously enough i real-
ized that in her appeal there was noth-
ing of sex save its method of presenta-
tion which was purely feminine in its
inconsistency there was no suggestion


the cpotpulair magazine

of sentimentality but i was conscious
that from some motive too subtle for
me to fathom she was desperately anx-
ious to obtain at least a lenient judg-
ment from tommy and to establish her-
self in his good graces w ithout renounc-
ing her alliance with those against
whom he had pitted his wits

  and when she turned to me with
true feminine irrelevancy interrupting
her attack on tommys susceptibilities
and frankly admitted that while she
had literally held my life in the hollow
of her hand when i had moto covered
with my pistol she could never have
brought herself to the point of killing
me my predisposition in her favor was
strengthened never until then had i
discovered anything beautiful in her
face but there was an irresistible ap-
peal in her eyes a fascinating attrac-
tion in her smile

  of course i could never have let you
shoot him-you would understand that
if you knew how important it is to me
that he should live she continued with
a bewitching artlessness i am an
expert with that weapon and even
through the kimono sleeve i could have
shot that pistol from your hand per-
haps i might have grazed a finger but
you have ten of them the baron has
but one life which is most precious to
me and you looked so fierce and stern
that i knew your bullet would find its
billet if you pulled the trigger

  a very mephistophelean grin came
to tommys lips as i mumbled an ac-
knowledgment of my belief in the inno-
cence of her intentions but he curtly
cut her short when after flashing me
a smile of gratitude she again turned
to him

  well take it for granted that in spite
of appearances you came here with only
the milk of human kindness toward us
flowing in your veins and that at a
pinch you were prepared to be our
guardian angel he said dryly that
however does not imply that you are

innocent of complicity in a plot to rob
us a plot which has culminated in the
very embarrassing situation that we
have a dead japanese to get rid of or
account for you chaps will have to
take care of that part of it he con-
tinued turning to morrison and ferros
you know enough of what is going
on to appreciate that we dont want any
publicity can you manage it

  i think that our department has
enough drag for that unless his friends
carry the thing to the newspapers an-
swered morrison confidently is there
any chance that the embassy will start
anything 

  not the ghost of a chance they
would probably deny that he was even
a japanese said tommy grimly that
neednt worry you and his immediate
boss is on the way to the mexican bor-
der under the watchful eyes of yours

  mr williams you have little con-
ception of the demon you have aroused
or created with your black magic if
you believe that interrupted la duva-
lief hurriedly no matter how ur-
gently the business of the mikado might
call to the baron moto the daimio
moto takimura would never go far
from where the hara-kiri svord of his
ancestors rested in the keeping of
strangers give it to me mr williams
so long as you keep it you will find it
only a menace with it i could gain my
hearts desire and accomplish my mis-
sion in life and i promise you that the
baron moto will never again cross your
path

  tommy looked at her intently for a
moment and shook his head

  no not yet at any rate he an-
swered if keeping it will make him
stay away from the border that will
be enough for the present arkell is
clever in his line but he hasnt just the
quality of brains to fight that japs
schemes and-
the third phase



  a tapping at the door interrupted
him and he bowed low to her after
reading the telegram which i took from
the panting messenger boy

  i think i must give you right made-
moiselle he said quietly arkell was
able to secure the drawing-room after
all for baron moto for whom it was
reserved changed his mind at the last
moment and remained in new york
her expression suddenly changed
her face became masklike inscrutable
as the door which i had inadvertently
left ajar swung open and tommy alert
for every sign of danger wheeled about
to face the baron moto

  i believe i heard my name i hope
you were saying something good of
me he said quietly as he stepped into
the studio

chapter xi

  it was of course her voice which
had given la duvalief high place in
the world of art but had she played
behind the footlights the various roles
which she assumed in our old studio
apartment the most exacting critics
would have ranked her dramatic ability
with that of duse and the divine sarah
surely never wras an actress on the
mimic stage confronted with such a
difficult part as circumstance assigned
to her when baron moto made his
startling and unexpected appearance in
the studio doorway but he had not ad-
vanced three paces into the room before
she had assumed it on the spur of the
moment as convincingly as if she were
letter-perfect from long rehearsal

  the body of moto ito stiffening on
the divan was a grim reminder that she
was playing in a game of life and death
the calm stern face of baron moto
from which inscrutable eyes watched
her without the slightest betrayal of the
thoughts behind them testified that the
slightest slip would bring the fabric of
hope which she had erected in serving
him tumbling about her in ruins it
hap

was a part within a part for to retain
his confidence it wras necessary to hood-
wink him to convince him absolutely
of her fidelity to his interests and that
we had no suspicion that she had pre-
viously visited the studio as o yucha
san or that she had the slightest con-
nection with or knowledge of the plot
which had culminated in the hara-kiri
of moto ito

  never for an instant did she over
or underplay that part although she
must have been conscious that a single
word from any one of the american
spectators would spoil her effort she
was the experienced woman of the
world unwittingly and innocently in-
volved in a sudden and unexpected
tragedy and she behaved exactly as the
average man would expect an experi-
enced woman of the world to behave
in such an emergency it was perhaps
fortunate that tommys remark at the
station had predisposed the baron to
the opinion that we suspected nothing
it was certainly an advantage to have
tommy distract and monopolize his at-
tention which he eventually did but
not until la duvalief had been forced
to use her dramatic powers to the
utmost

  baron your coming here is as much
of a surprise to me as i dare say my
visit to the station was to you but i
can assure you that you are welcome
he said quietly interrupting the con-
vincingly excited and incoherent rela-
tion which poured from her lips as
you can see the result of the attempted
theft has been a tragedy i assume that
appearances will speak for themselves
that you will need little explanation

  the baron walked to the divan gently
closed the lids over the glazed eyeballs
and reverently covered the dead face
with a handkerchief of the finest habu-
tai the conventionalized lotus flower
the badge of his clan embroidered in
its center there was not the slightest
sign of sorrow on his face nor was


the popular magazine

there any betrayal of emotion in his
voice or expression when he turned to
answer

  no to a japanese familiar with the
old traditions of his race this hardly
needs an explanation he said simply
you suspect that he came here bent
upon robbery he is past telling whether
or not that was the motive for his
visit but his act testifies that whatever
it may have been his mission failed
may i ask you for the particulars of
just what happened 

  certainly he was unconscious
when i left here baron and i requested
mademoiselle duvalief to aid in caring
for him until he was so far recovered
that these gentlemen who are govern-
ment officials could put him in a cab
and take him back to the hotel an-
swered tommy and then he proceeded
to tell what had happened after our ar
rival omitting only the significant de-
tail that la duvalief had tripped him
of course baron we are still anxious
to avoid any publicity in this matter it
would serve no good purpose and it
might cause embarrassment we were
discussing methods to avoid that just
before you entered he concluded

  the baron cast an inquiring glance at
the secret-service men

  that is a piece of generosity which
i might have expected from your hon-
orable courtesy he said gravely if
these gentlemen will be good enough to
lend me slight assistance i can relieve
you of that embarrassment you know
mr williams that this unfortunate
man was associated with me you rec-
ognized him as my secretary 

  tommy bowed assent and the baron
checking verbal reply with a gesture
drew himself up proudly and taking
place beside the divan faced us defi-
antly in bearing and expression no
longer the prussianized product of
western civilization but the daimio of
the days of the shoguns

  yes you recognized him as sheygio

the secretary of the baron moto he
said a curious intonation in his voice
recalling the death chant which we had
heard through the studio door but he
was more than that he was moto ito
a noble of the honorable clan of the
moto takimura of which i whom you
have known as the baron moto by
right of birth and succession am the
unworthy daimio he was bone of
my bone flesh of my flesh and blood
of my blood my faithful kinsman and
retainer my quarrel was his quarrel
my honor was his honor the death
which he died i glory in the task in
which he failed shall be mine to com-
plete should i too fail that duty will
pass from man to man from father to
son so long as the humblest descendant
of the great and honorable hideoyshi
from whom the moto takimuras
sprang shall live to glorify and rever-
ence the traditions of their fathers

  quite unconsciously and as if obliv-
ious to our presence he broke into his
native language his voice rising to that
falsetto which seems the common tone
of all orientals in expressing strong
emotion la duvalief the only one
of us to whom his words conveyed a
meaning carefully avoided meeting our
eyes but clever as she was in dissimu-
lation she could not entirely disguise
her intense and eager interest in them
in fact had he not been so strongly
under the influence of his emotions that
in chanting those words of the past
he had forgotten for the moment the
present she might have betrayed her-
self  for la duvalief the russian
singer was not supposed to number the
japanese language among her accom-
plishments but she quickly recovered
herself and her face was as eloquent
of bewilderment as was my own when
the baron broke off abruptly and pass-
ing his slender brown hand over his
forehead looked confusedly about the
studio

  i must crave your pardon he said
the third phase



to tommy i fear that i have for-
gotten myself mr williams there
must be somethin about this wonder-
ful room which rouses strange passions
and memories

  tommy shrugged his shoulders

  baron there are getting to be too
many tragic associations with it to
please me he said grimly as he noted
that the eyes of the japanese wandered
to the cabinet where the sword had
rested but as i am rather attached to
it and dont wish to move im going to
do my best to prevent the accumulation
of any more for that reason perhaps
it would be wise to tell you that the ob-
ject which your eyes are seeking will
not be kept here any longer for the
present i shall put it in a place of
safety and now if you will kindly tell
these gentlemen how they can assist

  there was a flash of disappointment
in the barons eyes

  you do not mean-you cannot mean
that you would part with that sword to
another he interrupted you the
one alien whom i have ever known who
had a sympathetic understanding of
what such an object would mean to
me

  tommy shook his head not for
gold and precious stones would i dis-
pose of it to you or to any one else
he answered at one time or another
in my life ive taken big chances but
theres a limit beyond which even the
rashest fool will not go and i should
call having something which all the de-
scendants of hideoyshi want to get hold
of lying casually around just about a
million miles beyond that limit it isnt
going to leave new york baron it
wont go more than a mile away from
this studio but it will be surrounded by
greater safeguards than the simple lit-
tle electrical device which preserved it
the first time i hope that one day it
will become your property but for the

moment i cant see my way clear to part
with it but i cant have it about here
and i am fearful that its possession has
already brought me disaster for i can
hardly believe that after the painful
things which have happened because of
it i can induce mademoiselle duvalief
to keep her promise to return here for
a portrait

  it was fortunate for baron moto
that turning to face the russian hid
his face from tommys observation
for in the eyes which he fixed on her
there was a menace and a threat which
even she found it difficult to meet his
voice however was suave and cour-
teous as he answered for her before
she had an opportunity to speak for
herself

  i am quite sure that mademoiselle
whose friendship it has been for a long
time my privilege to enjoy will not let
this unfortunate occurrence influence
her unduly he said only i must
warn mademoiselle that if she has se-
crets to conceal she must guard them
most jealously for there is some mys-
terious influence here which destroys
pretense

  whether it was skillful acting or
grim and pitiful reality i could not de-
termine  but la duvalief seemed sud-
denly possessed of a paralyzing fear as
she shrank back under his threatening
eyes

  tommy started visibly as he noted
that expression and the hysterical qual-
ity in the laugh of protest which came
from lips suddenly blanched and trem-
ulous

  baron moto i can assure you that
mademoiselle need have no fear that
her confidence will be forced he ex-
claimed coming to her rescue i take
it for granted that you intended no
offense in that warning for it is incon-
ceivable that an american gentleman
would take unfair advantage of a wom-
ans fears mademoiselle may come
here in perfect peace and security you


the popular magazine

are not the first man who has insinu-
ated that this studio is a temple of truth
and its walls have listened to many
strange revelations and confessions but

no man-

  the baron wheeled suddenly to face
him and la duvalief freed from the
observation of those eyes which had
dominated her quickly regained her
self-possession

  mr williams i certainly meant no
offense protested the baron nor
do i react any in your reply but re-
member that the customs and ethics of
the wtest have but recently been adopted
in our land circumstances have re-
quired that we accept and practice many
things which would not have been tol-
erated under the old regime to survive
and progress in the world competition
which was forced upon us when our
protecting isolation was destroyed we
have been obliged to accept them un-
questioningly and to practice them most
vigorously two of them are so much
a part of your recognized code of mor-
als that they are taught to your chil-
dren in the schools as copybook max-
ims-necessity knows no law and
alls fair in love and war 

  tommys smile was suddenly meph-
istophelean and he looked at the jap-
anese through eyelids narrowed to slits

  baron you can prove pretty much
anything by copybook maxims and
theres one of em that ive seen veri-
fied time and again in this very studio
he said dryly its the one we try to
steer by without even a mental reserva-
tion and that is honesty is the best
policy there is still another and i
believe that the spirit of it was a part
of the code of your ancestors it is
noblesse oblige 

  a flush came to the barons face and
for the first time he found difficulty in
meeting tommys gaze for an instant
la duvalief disregarded him and in
that instant i knew that she was play-
ing no part for in the eyes which she

turned gratefully on tommy i read the

confidence and fearlessness of a trust-
ful child

chapter xii

  morrison and ferros demonstrated
the ability which arkell had claimed for
them in preventing publicity concerning
the manner of moto itos death a sen-
sation which would have made a front-
page story for every new york paper
the body was removed to the hotel
blitz the necessary formalities were
complied with and the whole matter
arranged without anything more than
a simple announcement that captain
sheygio a near relative of baron moto
had died suddenly appearing in print
that announcement following close
upon the heels of the statement that the
baroness was confined to her apartment
by a severe illness was sufficient to
account for the abandonment of the
social program which had been ar-
ranged and greatly to the disappoint-
ment of the secret-service agents led
to the cancellation of mrs padelfords
engagement as social secretary

  in fact it was only from la duva-
lief and the reports of the secret-service
men who maintained a constant watch
upon their movements that we knew of
the continued presence of that curious
japanese delegation in new york for
the barons visits to the studio ceased
and we learned that he and all of his
party kept themselves secluded in their
apartments la duvalief however
came to the studio every day and con-
sidering the manner of her introduction
and the strenuous and tragic incidents
in which she had taken part there her
relationship was curiously common-
place

  mr williams i have come here on
order but i obey that order because i
wish to she said simply when she
appeared the day following the tragedy
i am taking you at your word that
you would take no advantage of a
the third phase



womans fear to force her confidence
you gave me the clew to the reason
this studio atmosphere is so grateful
to me it is because i felt instinctively
that you two gentlemen practiced al-
ways all that is implied by tlat very in-
definite noblesse oblige and it is
just because of that that i shall if you
permit me make the task which you
set for yourself easy i should value
the privilege of coming here and of
being within these walls that i never
dare to be in the great world outside-
the real nelka duvalief

  from tommys expression i knew
that he received her statement as the
absolute verity she too was con-
scious of that her eyes expressed her
gratitude and taking his assent for
granted she went on quickly before he
could speak

  and so there must be no false pre-
tense she exclaimed i am still nom-
inally the agent-the spy if you wish
to be harsh-of baron moto but as
i have received nothing of his confi-
dence there is nothing which i can be -
tray the mythical o yucha san is
still in his apartment i as la duvalief
do not enter there and have no knowl-
edge of what is going on inside the
doors i believe that for the moment
he has abandoned the plan in which he
thought my services would be of value
in the instructions i received this morn-
ing there was no suggestion of it only
the order to come here regularly and
to find oat if possible the disposition
you have made of that sword

  i will make that simple for you i
give you my word that it is in the
strongest safe-deposit vault in this
city answered tommy as for the
rest i think i understand-and now
for the portrait

  and with that simple understanding
in spite of all that had gone before
commenced that succession of days in
which this strange and mysterious
woman posed faithfully and steadily

every morning often remaining with us
for luncheon and occasionally dining
with us at a restaurant

  in many ways that portrait was the
best thing which tommy ever pro-
duced  but probably no one of the
thousands of people who had seen her
across the footlights would have rec-
ognized it as the likeness of the great
singer and certainly none of the hun-
dreds who had been more or less inti-
mately associated with her in the other
phases of her many-sided career would
have discovered in it the traits with
which they were familiar it was
above all the face of a good woman
but not of a woman ignorant of the
knowledge of evil one felt instinc-
tively that the wonderful eyes had
gazed far into the depths of human
depravity but in them there was no
hint of viciousness it was the face
of a young girl but by some subtle
trick of brush and color he had made
it the face of youth prematurely aged
by suffering and misery there was
nobility in it a claim for that pride and
purity of purpose which produces the
rare woman capable of knowing all evil
while practicing none of it

  and i knew that in painting that
curiously contradictory portrait tommy
was absolutely honest and sincere in
putting on the canvas only what he be-
lieved he read in the study of her face
it was not to impress her for in spite
of her teasing and pleading from the
time when he first outlined her face in
charcoal on the white canvas he never
permitted her to get a glimpse of his
work nor would he discuss it with
me even when we were alone together
and during the many hours which we
spent lingering about the luncheon table
i was almost convinced that his con-
ception of her was the true one for she
revealed on closer acquaintance a most
unexpected human sympathy a broad-
minded judgment of men and affairs
and a habit of thought curiously free
the tpovulflcr magazine

from cynicism and bitterness in a
woman who had observed at close range
so much of the seamy side of life

  even exceeding the strict letter of
their tacit agreement we carefully
avoided discussion of her most recent
associations and associates but from
the mutual acquaintances we discovered
it was evident that rumor had not
wronged her in whispering that she was
an old hand in the game of underground
diplomacy for most of them were in-
timately connected with that vast web
of espionage in which we had more
than once been involved during our
long european residence

  but if la duvalief did her best to
make us forget that and ignored the
spread of that web of conspiracy to this
continent arkell certainly did his best
to keep it constantly before our minds
not a day passed without a long com-
munication from him usually sent in
code to the new york office and for-
warded in plain language from there by
the hands of morrison or ferros from
all that he was able to discover after his
arrival at the border it appeared that
tommys first conjecture was right
there was nothing to show that the
massacre of the seventeen americans
was anything but a piece of wanton sav-
agery committed by the followers of
villa  but on the other hand that whole-
sale murder was quickly followed by
disquieting and suspicious develop-
ments

  now owing to the most elaborate
system devised by the secret service
during the long period of watchful
waiting there was hardly a rifle a box
of cartridges a case of munitions or a
pound of explosives which entered
mexico without their knowledge and
in almost every instance they knew the
source of origin and the eventual des-
tination there is nothing partisan
about the secret service for many
years it has been exactly what its name
implies and it has always proved en-

tirely adequate to the duties required
of it duties so varied that their scope
is not even suspected by the general
public which it so efficiently protects
and serves the preservation of neu-
trality during the european war and
the gathering of accurate information
along the mexican border and in mex-
ico itself were among those newer du-
ties and under arkells direction they
were conscientiously and skillfully per-
formed  but he was quick to realize and
sufficiently generous to acknowledge
that even in that service tommys very
peculiar abilities were of the greatest
value to him and so day by day he
sent those full reports which told of
the mysterious and puzzling events be-
low the rio grande of the growing
animosity against americans of the in-
creasing arrogance of the ragged revo-
lutionists of the common bond which
seemed to be making them forget their
jealousies of each other

  arkell was unable to obtain absolute
and definite proof of his suspicions but
day after day he unearthed evidence
which strengthened them one day it
would be the discovery of japanese of -
ficers turning bands of tatterdemalion
bandits into disciplined regiments of
effective soldiers the next it might be
the sudden reconciliation of two rival
leaders following visits from the slant-
eyed orientals who for months had
been investigating the possibilities of
the silkworm culture at guaymas and
the other ports on the gulf of cali-
fornia the japanese fishing schooners
arrived in ever-increasing numbers
carrying hundreds of passengers who
disappeared mysteriously into the yaqui
indian country and at manzanillo a
succession of tramp steamers flying the
japanese flag discharged curious car-
goes which were entered at the custom-
house as agricultural and mining ma-
chinery in southern california the
japanese colonies were very much de-
pleted by twos and threes the men-
the th<RZ> phase

 

most of them veterans of the russian
war-slipped away most of them leav-
ing san diego to cross the border-to
be lost to sight the minute they passed
the little frontier village of tijuana

  but there was one thing which ar-
kells reports particularly emphasized
the arms shipments which had char-
acterized what he called the second
phase of the situation had steadily di-
minished from a stream to a trickle
and even that entirely ceased from the
moment villas bandits crossed the bor-
der to raid columbus save for small
driblets smuggled across by pack mule
and rowboat not a rifle or cartridge
was entering mexico from the united
states or through the atlantic ports
but still the scattered revolutionists
whose numbers were steadily increased
were readily supplied with equipment
and the soldiers of the de-facto gov-
ernment suffered from no lack of am-
munition or arms

  the entrance of pershings force into
mexico tremendously increased the dif-
ficulty of obtaining information but
still arkell managed to get a lot and
to me it was most disquieting for it
told of ever-increasing efficiency of the
mexicans of the quiet concentration
of large bodies of troops at points
where they could cut the slender line
of communication with the base in a
dozen places tommy shook his head
when i voiced my fears

  if our information is correct there
is no immediate danger he said grimly
morrison assures me positively that
the baron and his entire party are still
at the blitz no one has seen them
they keep themselves absolutely s
eluded but he has a cordon of shad-
owers about the place which they cant
elude even nelka has not seen the
baron  but every day she makes her re-
port that the sword is still in the safe-
deposit vault and every day she re-
ceives renewed instructions in his own
handwriting to watch most carefully for

it hes there safe enough and so
long as he is and neglecting his mani-
fest duty to the mikado which calls him
to mexico nothing is going to happen
he is fairly deluged with telegrams
the secret service has managed to de-
code a few of them each of those has
urged that he come immediately what-
ever the action he had planned there it
evidently cant start without his per-
sonal supervision-and its the one best
bet that colonel moto will not go down
there until the daimio moto takimura
gets what hes after in new york

  he laughed at my protest that the
baron might elude the cleverest shad-
owers and that la duvalief in spite
of the good qualities to which his un-
finished portrait testified was still pos-
sessed of a past which did not recom-
mend her as absolutely trustworthy

  i never trust any one too far and
its about time to stimulate the samurai
spirit again anyway he said if
youll look in the cabinet youll see that
the sword is there i brought it from
the vault this morning-and i might
mention that a jap who had trailed me
from the studio to the bank started on
the keen jump in the direction of the
hotel blitz when he saw me come out
with the box under my arm i asked
nelka to come an hour later than usual
this morning shes just about due and
when-

  of course it was la duvalief whom
i admitted in response to a nervously
insistent knocking tommys eyes al-
ways seemed to be able to see through
that heavy oaken door without stop-
ping to greet us she ran to the cabinet
and an indescribable cry came from her
lips as she saw- the sword in its cus-
tomary resting place

  what is this-the meaning of it-
are you as mad as this thing has made
baron moto and his people  she de-
manded fright and bewilderment min-
gled in her expression dont you
know that you are inviting danger by


the cpocpuljlcr magazine

having this thing here it needed the
evidence of my own eyes to make me
believe that he was not mistaken when
he told me that you had removed it
from the vault and brought it back
dont get excited about a little thing
like that nelka said tommy quietly
is there any reason why you should
not tell us just what has happened to
arouse you so

  before answering she tiptoed to the
door opened it suddenly and after
peering out on the landing closed it and
secured it by lock and chain

  you knew that you were spied upon
that you were seen to take it from the
bank she asked in a voice little above
a whisper

  certainly im only an amateur at
this sort of thing but ive learned
enough to keep my eyes open an-
swered tommy you neednt be afraid
to speak out theres nobody about but
duck sing you have seen baron moto
with your own eyes

  she gave a little start and looked at
him curiously her eyes troubled her
face unusually pale

 tommy what have you done
there is no longer a baron moto she
said for the first time calling him by
his first name but what your black
magic has made of him and his fol-
lowers i have seen and-she hesitated
passing her hand with its delicately
manicured nails across her eyes-it
is incredible unbelievable i cannot
credit it

  suppose that you tell us about it
we are not easily surprised and it is
impossible to shock us suggested
tommy soothingly you were per-
mitted to enter the apartment to-day
yes for the first time since the
death of moto ito she answered her
voice so low that we were forced to
listen most attentively to catch her
words for days she had been so sim-
ple and natural in her bearing that i

had almost forgotten the great dra-
matic powers of which she had proved
herself to be possessed but i was sud-
denly conscious of them for there was
much that was suggestive of the the-
ater in the furtive wandering of her
gaze to the corners of the studio the
tightly clenched hands pressed firmly to
her breast the tenseness of her whole
attitude and expression it was so sug-
gestive that my half-allayed suspicions
returned redoubled and i was more
than doubtful of her sincerity

  yes for the first time since moto
itos death i entered that anteroom
where as sheygio he had performed
his labors as the baron motos private
and confidential secretary she con-
tinued it was as i had seen it last
save that the desk at which he worked
was piled high with unopened letters
and telegrams and the air was heavy
with the perfume of burning incense
adjoining it was the large salon where
it was originally planned that i in the
character of o yucha san was to en-
tertain the people of whom the baron
expected to make use those enter-
tainments were to have been japanese
in character he had already made ar-
rangements to have his countrymen
here make the decorations and furnish-
ings typically in keeping and my two
musmes both of them perfectly trained
geishas were to serve tea and when
occasion demanded press the insidious
tongue-loosing sake upon youngsters by
whose indiscreet revelations he might
profit she interrupted her recital
and with finger on lips tiptoed to the
door listening for a moment for the
slightest sound which might betray lis-
teners upon the outer side

  i was prepared therefore to find it
changed when little o kin san opened
the door and beckoned me to enter but
nothing had prepared me for such a
transformation as i actually found
she continued still in that same subdued
voice i had expected the dainty trap-
the thrd phase



pings of a high-caste japanese ladys
boudoir i stepped from sheygios
workroom equipped with every twen-
tieth-century modern convenience for
secretarial work into the council cham-
ber of the moto takimuras of medieval
nippon the walls were hung with
priceless antique embroideries and tap-
estries each depicting some incident of
the life of the great hideoyshi from
which the clan claims direct descent
and the heroic deeds of the forty-seven
ronins on a shrine of exquisite
lacquer heavily decorated with the
golden lotus flower in high relief rested
the great two-handed fighting sword of
hideoyshi the companion weapon to
that hara-kiri dagger in your cabinet

  tommy could not restrain an excla-
mation of astonishment as she paused
and pointed to it

  great scott can that be possible
he exclaimed is this the weapon of
hideoyshi the japanese sir launcelot
and bertrand du guesclin rolled into
one popular hero 

  no less a treasure would have
tempted the baron moto the most
trusted officer of the japanese general
staff to forget all that he has learned
of western civilization and the fealty
he has sworn to the mikado in his mad
desire to regain possession of it she
answered

  she had forgotten her fears as she
spoke her beautifully modulated voice
came in natural volume from the lips
to which the color had returned

  and the reason for admitting you
to the chamber said tommy as she
paused never for a moment had his
eyes left her face but there was noth-
ing of suspicion in them he watched
her as a scientific investigator might
watch the development of a delicate
experiment in a chemical laboratory
alert for the first indication that a fresh
reagent must be added to get the desired
result and as i in turn watched his

face i realized that never had an al-
chemist waited more eagerly to see base
metal transmuted to gold in his cru-
cible than tommy williams watched to
find in this curious feminine bundle of
contradictions a confirmation of and a
justification for the qualities which his
brush had so subtly indicated on the
canvas which was shrouded by the cov-
ering cloth on his easel

  she hesitated long before answering
to his suggestion unable in spite of her
natural talent and long training entirely
to conceal the inward conflict which her
face betrayed gradually she slipped
back into that la duvalief we had first
known and tommys eyes hardened as
he watched her expression change

  mr williams you must employ that
cleverness which you claimed to guess
the real reason for that she answered
the formal address emphasizing the hint
of defiance which had unconsciously
crept into her voice you must re-
member that baron moto has not the
slightest suspicion that you discovered
the imposture when i came here as o
yucha san that he believes that you
are not suspicious that as la duvalief
i am coming here as his spy he thinks
that i am absolutely faithful to his in-
terests  not because he trusts me for
he trusts no one who is not of his race
but because he knows how prohibitive
to me would be the cost of betrayal i
do not yet know his plan perhaps if
he had confided it to me i should not
have warned you of the danger of hav-
ing that weapon here because he has
not trusted me fully i can tell you this
much he sent for me to give me my
orders i was to come here as usual
and verify by my own eyes the fact
that you had brought the sword here
if possible i was to find out if you in-
tended to keep it here i am to report
to him and then again assume the char-
acter of o yucha san she is to make
such a quick and unexpected recovery
that baron moto will ask the privilege


the popular magazine

of escorting her here this evening os-
tensibly to make his apologies for what
has happened and to make amends by
arranging for you to paint her portrait
just as you wished that is all the
determined set of her lips as she fin-
ished confirmed that curt finale she
would volunteer nothing further but
tommys expression warned me that
he would not let it stop there

  hell be granted that privilege all
right but in spite of his samurai high-
binders hes not going to get that knife
until im ready to hand it to him he
said a grim smile on his lips as he
turned to me see here old chap i
want you to do me a favor go down
to headquarters and ask morrison to
detail a strong-arm squad of his men
to watch this place men who are not
afraid to take a chance with jujutsu
and who will keep their mouths shut
they are to let baron moto and his
wife enter unchallenged but after that
they are to hold up- everything which
looks like a jap which comes within a
block of the entrance-slam em into
taxis and keep em driving around the
park until daylight thatll be about
all i reckon we can attend to things
here in the studio

  again i saw the betrayal of an in-
ward struggle in la duvaliefs eyes as
she listened and when i reluctantly
started to carry out tommys instruc-
tions she motioned me to wait

  are you sure of that mr wil-
liams she asked remember that i
have told you that it means the accom-
plishment of the mission to which i
have devoted my life if baron motos
plans succeed as o yucha san i shall
come here to further them-as his ac-
complice to be brutally frank-and you
know that i am capable of doing des-
perate things

  mademoiselle since youve started
being brutally frank ill take my cue
from you answered tommy turning

suddenly to face her and consummate
actress as la duvalief had demon-
strated herself to be i realized that my
versatile friend was beating her at her
own game the formal mademoiselle
in place of the familiar nelka which
he had used for days the curl of his
lip the biting sarcasm of his voice com-
bined to express a contempt before
which she shrank back as if threatened
by a whip and brought to her eyes a
moisture which perhaps prevented her
from reading in his that in adopting
brutality he was playing a part i read
it there for in spite of his harshness
he was still the investigator the al-
chemist

  you prated about the refreshing at-
mosphere of noblesse oblige which you
found so grateful in this studio but
according to your own confession
youre not the kind of a woman who
would recognize that atmosphere if it
was strong enough to asphyxiate you
he went on contemptuously  just the
same that does exist here and i shall
be true to the promise i have made-
even to the woman you have shown
yourself to be i shall take no advan-
tage of your fears to force your con-
fidence  the confidences of such an in-
veterate liar would be of no value to
any one come here to-night prepared
and primed to do any desperate thing
your yellow master may command i
do not fear him i do not fear you im
still confident that as a white man im
more than a match for any oriental
even one who holds the lash over a
white woman who has so far forgotten
the traditions of her blood that she low-
ers herself to serve him if that sacred
mission to which you whine that you
have consecrated yourself depends upon
his success youre doomed to as great
a disappointment as he is for im going
to smash his plans so flat that hell
think a steam roller ran over em

  at first she fairly cringed before him
but as the tirade continued it roused a
the third phase



fury within her and at its conclusion
she faced him erect and defiant her
hands clenched her dark eyes blazing
in a face livid with passion

  you you for whom i have sac-
rificed so much for whom i have risked
losing all that i have lived for when it
is almost within my grasp you dare
to say these things to me she ex-
claimed furiously that much of it
is true takes away none of the bitterness
of it coming from your lips i scorn
to justify myself to one who knows no
gratitude but what has my life been
but a lie and who has forced me to
live it i do not prate of noblesse
oblige it is you who do not know the
meaning of it nor do i whine about
my mission i glory in it i shall be
true to it even if to accomplish it i
must work beneath the lash of a yellow
man and trample out the lives of his
white antagonists to win i

  tommys gaze had never faltered
but as her defiance terminated with a
suspicious tremor in her voice the mask
of contempt dropped from his face he
watched her steadily as he walked over
to the easel and placed his hand on the
cloth covering the portrait which she
had never seen

  you will pardon me if i repeat that
you are an inveterate liar he said
quietly but the smile on his lips and
the kindliness in his eyes drew the sting
from the accusation the most dan-
gerous kind of a liar for you are so
skillful at it that you deceive yourself
i suppose that you believe implicitly
right now that you will be able to carry
out the rash threats you have just made
but i know-perhaps through that same
black magic which you accuse me of
having practiced on moto takimura-
that you never can i know it at any
rate from what i have discovered of
the real nelka duvalief beneath that ly-
ing exterior the nelka duvalief whom
serge ivanof loved and for whom he
suffered the nelka duvalief-my

nelka duvalief-whom my brush has
imprisoned on this canvas

  her face was a study in bewilder-
ment as she listened no color returned
to it but the fury died in her eyes under
his kindliness and when as he con-
cluded he whisked the covering cloth
from the portrait she had ocular proof
that he was sincere a cry of relief and
gratitude came from her lips for a
moment she gazed at it spellbound and
when she turned away from it to look at
him her own face had grown curiously
like that one which tommy had ideal-
ized on the canvas

  you mean that tommy after the
life i have led all these years the deceit
i have practiced until it is second na-
ture the hot plowshares on which i
have walked you can still find that
nelka duvalief in me she asked pite-
ously as if fearing that she was the
victim of a grim joke

  i mean that absolutely nelka i
never force my brush to lie he an-
swered quickly all that you see there
i have found in your face even your
art could not hide from me the real
nelka duvalief that is why i do not
fear you for i know that when the test
comes that real nelka will be too strong
for the la duvalief that no fear would
be strong enough to overcome the tra-
ditions of the white mans civilization
at the behest of an oriental barbarian
with a little cry she turned and came
toward me with outstretched hands

  go  go  go  she exclaimed hys-
terically pushing me toward the door
i shall betray myself but there must
be no witness-go a quick nod from
tommy enforced obedience and releas-
ing me she threw herself on the divan
burying her face in her hands her body
shaken with her convulsive sobbing
and as i looked back from the door-
way i saw on tommys face as he
watched her the expression of triumph
of the alchemist who has seen worthless
dross transmuted to purest gold

chapter xiii

  when i hurried hack to the studio
after completing the arrangements for
the secrct-service operators la duva-
lief had gone there was an air of
elation in tommys manner which testi-
fied that he believed that he had been
successful in his experiment but i re-
ceived small satisfaction when i ques-
tioned him

  i cant tell you just what happened 
it would be too much like betraying the
secrets of the confessional he pro-
tested perhaps you guessed pretty
nearly the truth  at any rate youll not
be very long in suspense for things
seem to be moving toward a quick cli-
max you have attended to what i
asked you to do

  yes and i was tempted to go far-
ther and ask morrison to send a couple
of men inside i grumbled perhaps
that russian wept out something after
 left that convinced you that you can
trust her but shes played too many
parts here to let her come it over me
im still not so certain of her that id
trust her much farther than i could
see her

  then that will make your part all
the easier to play this evening for you
may have to put a bullet through her
before the entertainment to whichmoto
has invited himself is over answered
tommy grinning as he glanced at a
note lying on the table so far its
come off according to program  the note
which she predicted arrived and i sent
back word that i should be delighted to
see them-which is gospel truth

  ill be hanged if i shall be i pro-
tested i tell you i dont trust that
woman i thought it all over while i
was out and-

  you wont have to think at all this
evening interrupted tommy impa-
tiently neither will you have to dis-
semble your suspicions for i want you
to get the drop  o yucha san the

  moment she enters the door dont
make any bones about it either let her
see that youve got it and dont hesi-
tate much longer than it takes a rattle-
snake to strike about shooting at the
first bad move if you do or if you
dont shoot to kill youll be the central
figure at the resulting coroners inquest
i dont believe it will come to that if
you show from the start that youre not
bluffing for within five minutes after
they get here ill have that reincarnated
samurai so tame that hell eat out of
my hand and stand without hitching
that will be all the lime i need and
im trusting to you to keep that bear cat
bluffed but dont be afraid to make
your bluff good if she attempts to call it
-you know i shouldnt ask you to do
anything i would balk at myself

  it was not an alluring prospect but

	knew that i should have to obey trust
him implicitly or get out he smiled
his gratitude when i mumbled a re-
luctant promise

  its essential that i get the baron
here he continued ive been going
over arkells reports those you have
seen and one which came while you
were out and im sure that things are
getting about ready to crack if that
tau should come out of his trance and

 a

get back on the job he was busy with
before he caught sight of that sword
he might start something in ten minutes
which it would take all the might and
majesty of the united states a good
many years to finish now before he
leaves here to-night i intend to see that
lie does start something but its going
to finish along about where i dictate-
which is approximately the point where
his original plan called for the com-
mencement hold on im not trying
to mystify you youll get what i mean
when i tell you that well be leaving for
southern california to-morrow

  no i dont get you at all i pro-
tested and he grinned as he pointed to
the file of arkells reports
the thrd phase



  if you analyze those youll find one
reason he said pretty much all they
contain has since we received them
been published in the newspapers and
the attention of the public the govern-
ment and the war department is pretty
well concentrated on the border from el
paso to columbus-owing to the per-
nicious activity of pancho villa now
i havent the honor of his acquaintance
but we have a pretty good line on him
from the descriptions of trained and
accurate observers they are unani-
mous in describing him as illiterate bru-
tal and bloodthirsty without moral
sense devoid of conscience and the in-
carnation of bestial lust he is altogether
unfitted to be a salvation army officer
but he has demonstrated his ability to
recruit discipline and lead an army of
mexican bandits he has been accused
of pretty much every crime in the cal-
endar but no one has ever impugned his
personal bravery nor accused him of
being a fool now so long as mex-
icos troubles were confined to her own
borders or if the various factions com-
bined to fight the united states he
would be general francisco villa the
leader of a recognized army but as a
result of that massacre and that mad
raid across the border he is pancho
villa the outlaw and bandit with pretty
much the whole american army chas-
ing him and his own people afraid to
give him open support

  i still fail to get you there seems
to be justification for the belief that
hes dead-arkell had positive proof

that he was badly wounded and-

  it doesnt make any difference
whether hes dead or alive-now in-
terrupted tommy the important
thing is the true significance of that
massacre and the subsequent raid now
admitting that villa is not a fool why
should he have gratuitously slapped the
face of the united states its my
guess that he is to-day a skulking bandit
instead of a mexican general because

he failed to receive the support of which
he felt assured and that support failed
him because moto takimura happened
to discover the hara-kiri sword of his
ancestors in this studio youll notice
that up to a certain point everything
went like clockwork villas affront was
so outrageous that we had to act and
that action meant stripping every army
post in the united states to get enough
men to chase him and guard the texas
border there has been no suspicious
mexican activity in lower california
our attention has been riveted to the
other portion of the border and even
the coast artillery with insufficient
men to serve the guns when they are all
where they belong has been called upon
to help out you remember of course
the opening of the japanese-russian
war the japs virtually won it before
it was officially declared by a surprise
attack which crippled the russian fleet
and gave them a free sea over which
they transported their troops thats
their conception of strategy--and they
had also taken the precaution to plant
a good many thousand colonists who
were transformed overnight into organ-
ized battalions in the ports they in-
tended to use as bases now arkells
reports show that the mexicans are
doing enough marching and counter-
marching to keep our forces- concen-
trated on the texas border but the
japs who are quietly pouring in
through the gulf of california vanish
into the yaqui country a district that
even porfirio diaz was wise enough
to leave severely alone incidentally
that territory happens to be within easy
striking distance of southern califor-
nia so thats why we are leaving for
there to-morrow

  to stem single-handed the threat-
ening yellow peril i jeered and
tommy shook his head

  no hardly that ive wired arkell
to be there and to have a dozen of his
men with him he answered seriously


the popular magazine

i expect a very pleasant little reunion
out there and unless i am mistaken
in my guess among those present will
be the baron moto well have plenty
of time to talk it all out on the train
so now i would suggest that you make
the necessary preparations for the pro-
logue here this evening

  i had half suspected that tommy was
joking in his directions but the care
which he took in his own part of the
preparations convinced me that he was
in deadly earnest he rearranged the
electric lights so that they were con-
centrated with dazzling brilliancy upon
the entrance and moved several pieces
of furniture so that they virtually
formed a barrier which would prevent
a quick rush from the door to the spot
in the shadows where he directed me
to stand to receive our expected visitors

  im strong for preparedness he
said grimly as he surveyed the results
of his labors ill leave the door ajar
and the only light will be that one illu-
minating the cabinet the minute they
come in ill switch on the others and
as i shall have my hands full with the
baron its up to you to take care of

o	yucha san

 through long association with
tommy i had learned that it was use-
less to question him when he was pre-
paring one of those dramatic surprises
which he delighted in but i had also
learned that he never overestimated the
risks i was therefore keyed up to
the top notch of expectancy when the
door opened that evening and when
the lights were switched on i was con-
vinced that in this particular instance
he had if anything rather underesti-
mated them

  there were only two people in the
doorway one of them was the baron
but the other in spite of the feminine
costume was certainly not la duvalief
masquerading as o yucha san at the
very moment of the illumination the
kimono fell from a pair of broad mas-

culine shoulders the towering wig was
impatiently shaken off and over the
barrel of my leveled pistol i looked into
a pair of fierce murderous eyes in the
grim face of a samurai there was
no mistaking their intention for each
of them carried a short stabbing sword
that weapon s which the japanese used
with such deadly effect at close quar-
ters at port arthur and i knew that
the first of tommys predictions was
verified they had come prepared to
profit by the strategy of surprise they
were literally stripped for action espe-
cially the barons companion who had
passed the secret-service cordon in the
feminine disguise for when the ki-
mono fell to the floor it revealed his
wiry muscular torso stripped to the
waist his brown skin glistening with
the oil which would have made him as
slippery as an eel

  the baron who found himself fac-
ing the muzzle of tommys automatic
had worn beneath the overcoat which
he had discarded in the hallway only a
single japanese garment of the flimsiest
silk which would have torn like tissue
paper in an adversarys grasp and on
his feet were rubber-soled shoes which
would have given him secure footing
on the polished floor they were so
thoroughly keyed up for attack that i
believe in spite of our most unexpected
preparedness his companion would have
taken a chance but the baron was quick
to see that the odds against them made
such an attempt absolutely hopeless and
he checked him with a sharp command

  thats wise baron you can ap-
preciate that it is still my day said
tommy quietly now see here it is
quite within our rights to shoot you
both down where you stand and i give
you my word that we shall not hesitate
to do it if you dont behave as a first
step kindly drop those weapons

  they obeyed the baron without the
slightest hesitation his companion only
after a repetition of the order from
the third phase



him now baron im not treating
you chaps as common criminals i re-
alize that your motive in coming here
prepared to commit murder if neces-
sary justifies you in your own eyes
continued tommy im going to make
it easy for you but first i want you to
impress upon your friend there that
he is to remain as passive as a bronze
buddha-or get a bullet in his head
then when you have done that you are
at perfect liberty to advance alone and
remove from that cabinet anything
which happens to suit your fancy

  the baron stared at him for a mo-
ment in speechless amazement appar-
ently more surprised by that unexpected
generosity than by the trap into which
he had walked but familiar from long
association with every subtle intonation
of tommys voice i knew that he had
not yet reached the climax he had
planned for and even after a few stern
words in japanese had stiffened my op-
ponent to the rigidity of a graven image
i still kept him covered with my pistol
with his eyes fixed on the cabinet
which was illuminated strongly the
baron stepped quickly into the studio
threading his way through the disar-
ranged furniture as a somnambulist in-
stinctively avoids obstacles without
lowering his pistol tommy quietly
shifted his own position so that a broad
table would be between them

  a sibilant hiss came from the barons
lips as he stood before the cabinet and
started a reverent kotow before stretch-
ing out his hands to grasp that weapon
of his ancestors which had made him
forget his western tutoring and his
duty as a modern soldier but it changed
to a falsetto cry of disappointment and
rage as he gazed through the glass and
then with the quickness of a cat
wheeled about it was fortunate that
tommy had changed his position for
the japanese was crouched for a spring
which would have meant death to one
or both of them but in just that second

which it required for him to locate
tommy in the shadows he regained a
portion of his self-control he was
still laboring under strong emotion
however and the first words of a tirade
uttered in that shrill falsetto were so
incoherent that they were unintelligible
it spoke well for the discipline in which
he held his retainers that the man i
held covered never for an instant for-
got his original command and retained
a passivity which i knew from the eyes
which looked defiantly into mine was
not dictated by fear of my pistol

  yes baron i have tricked you the
day is still to me exclaimed tommy
triumphantly from the shadows cutting
short that ear-piercing protest of the
oriental youll have to amend that
proverb which you learned from your
mexican friends for i intend to claim
several more of them that isnt the
hara-kiri sword of hideoyshi but an
imitation of it in papier-mache and tin
which i had made by one of our the-
atrical property makers i may tell you
that the original has been sent by safe
hands to the pacific coast and if any-
thing happens to my friend or myself
at japanese hands no moto takimura
will ever see it again that being the
case you will appreciate that you have
everything to lose and nothing to gain
by violence so i would suggest that we
put away our weapons and try to be
nice and clubby as we talk things over

  for a minute or two possibly be-
cause the barons emotion made it dif-
ficult for him to comprehend english
it was touch and go but as tommy
watched him in silence he evidently
concluded that he had won for with-
out waiting for verbal assent he low-
ered his hand and slipped his pistol into
his pocket i followed his example
but not until a -few words in japanese
caused the half-naked man in the door-
way to bow his defiant head and hiss
a sibilant assent as he turned to gather
up the garments which they had dis-


the popular magazine

carded in the hallway tommy had re-
stored the studio to its normal condi-
tion by the time he had finished and
closed the door after entering

  it was not until then that i had a fair
opportunity to study the barons face
and i realized that la duvalief had told
the truth in describing the change in
him which it reflected he was no
longer the suave impassive inscrutable
soldier whom tommy had painted in
a modern uniform but the fierce im-
perious warrior daimio whose word
was law to the clan of moto takimura
the change wasaccentuated by his re-
turn to the prohibited samurai fashion
of hairdressing the scalp at the sides
closely shaven the long hair at the back
woven into a thin tight braid which
was brought forward along the center
and fastened to a lock in the front giv-
ing it a grotesque resemblance to a
cocks comb the wisp of mustache
had been sacrificed and the face set in
grim hard lines was devoid of hair
save for the thin lines of eyebrows
which had been distorted until they ac-
centuated the obliquity of the slanting
eyes it was just such a face as the an-
cient japanese artists depicted looking
through the visors of the medieval lac-
quered helmets the likeness which
tommy had approximated in his fanci-
ful portrait his long days of seclu-
sion in that transplanted atmosphere of
the past had carried him so far along
the road to yesterday that to all out-
ward appearance he might have been his
famous ancestor hideoyshi who made
so large a part of the history of medi-
eval japan tommy was quick to ap-
preciate that and as it apparently
suited his book to prevent a return to
modern methods of thought he curtly
interrupted the mumbled attempt at an
apology coming from reluctant lips

  baron moto there is no need for
an apology and we neither of us have
cause for complaint against the other
he said it is just a difference in

standards im sufficiently broad-
minded to appreciate yours and under
the circumstances you will have to ac-
cept mine now i have figured out to
my own satisfaction the reason why you
originally came here it was on the tip
from the russian secret service that it
would be wise for you to keep track of
me while your plans in the south were
developing it would have been a good
tip too except for the peculiar coin-
cidence that you discovered that sword
in my possession now right here let
me say that there is only one way in
which you can regain that sword and
that is by making absolute and uncon-
ditional surrender and doing exactly
what i tell you to do

  the baron started and a fierce scowl
came to his face but tommy metit in
kind and checked his protest with an
imperative gesture for silence

  im not arguing im telling you ex-
actly where you get off he said sternly
first ill make it easier for you to
listen by giving you my word that the
sword of hideoyshi will be returned to
you in all honor if you do exactly what
i tell you and make your followers do
the same i also warn you that unless
you do it will be devoted to uses which
will so defile it that the meanest beggar
ever spurned by the foot of a moto
takimura samurai would draw back
from it in loathing-and in both these
promises i mean exactly what i say
now get that please for i always keep
my word he paused for a moment
and i knew that the baron did get it
and that he was convinced of tommys
sincerity  for he turned to his clansman
who was squatting on his heels near
the entrance and signed to him to be
quiet

  thats right now well get along
better said tommy approvingly i
might just mention that in any event
you cant count on outside assistance
for i took the precaution to have the
secret-service men ready to bag any of
the thld phse



your countrymen who might follow you
here no dont get excited they will
only be detained until you leave for
im so sure that i hold the whip hand
that im not worrying now baron
from reports i have received from be-
low the border im convinced that your
devotion to the recovery of that sword
has caused your carefully made plans
down there to get wabbly at the joints
the watching of that part of it is in
competent hands but i have made a
promise of sorts that there will not be
any complications from this end so you
and your staff will continue to keep
hands off remain deaf to the appeals -
for assistance from both the cientificos
and the bush bandits and just for
your own information i will tell you
that as i suspect the success of those
plans might cause the united states
considerable embarrassment the secret
service will make it its business to see
that you carry out my instructions in
this part of it i am not asking you to
deliver your code books or do anything
active but the attempt on your part or
that of your followers to send a single
telegram or letter will be sufficient in-
dication that you are not playing on
the level and will lead to trouble so
much for that now we shall come to
the more personal part

  tommy opened a drawer of the table
and took out a paper which he handed
to the baron

  you will kindly have that translated
into your very best japanese and send
it to tokyo by cable he said but
the baron interrupted him with an ex-
clamation of anger after glancing at the
contents

  i was right to distrust that russian
she-devil he exclaimed

  no but you were wrong to employ
the methods you did worse than that
you were foolish answered tommy a
new and harsher note in his voice for
what you were planning to do in mex-
ico i hold no grudge i know that you

  a p

were simply carrying put the policies
of your superior officers for the meth-
ods you have employed in trying to re-
cover this sword  so far as they have
threatened us i freely forgive you i
realize that you were swayed by tra-
ditions too strong for you to resist
but when you listened to the teaching
of the russian third section and fol-
lowing their suggestion did things
which neither the samurai code nor the
best of your adopted civilization would
sanction you have made my heart
harder than pharaohs now listen
well moto takimura and know that
i mean exactly what i say two weeks
from to-day you will meet me in san
diego i know that you can command
the services of a cruiser which will
carry out the instructions and with suf-
ficient speed to anchor off tijuana by
that date on my word of honor if
you have faithfully carried out my in-
structions the sword which you covet
will be delivered into your hands and
you and your staff will be permitted to
depart in safety but if you fail to
keep that appointment or if you by
word or deed violate the spirit or letter

chapter xiv

  it lacked but a day of the stipulated
fortnight when with nelka duvalief as
our traveling companion we arrived in
san diego after a leisurely journey
tommy had been in constant tele-
graphic communication with arkell and
the skirmish at carrizal followed by
that diplomatic note which would have
been an insult demanding an immediate
declaration of war if it had not been so


the popular magazine

                                                

childish indicated that the pot of mex-
ican troubles was still bubbling we
rarely discussed anything connected
with it for in spits of the repression
and self-control which the girl had
learned to exercise in a hard school it
was evident that she was under an in-
tense nervous strain and we confined
our conversation to commonplaces

  arkell met us in that beautiful south-
ern californian city his expression as
triumphant as tommys was confident
as they greeted each other

  tommy im a million miles from
knowing all there is to know but weve
discovered enough to draw the sting of
the japanese hornet he exclaimed i
dont know just what youve been up
to but the greasers are all in the air
the good old cientificos are sore because
the graft seems to have been cut off
and the revolutionary leaders are sulk-
ing in their side-door pullmans because
the pay for their men and the promised
arms and ammunition are not coming
across and best of all that carrizal
thing and the sassy note has wakened
up washington you know that the
entire militia has been ordered to mo-
bilize and ive been given a free hand
the only string to it is the order to keep
everything as quiet as possible i am
empowered to call on the army or navy
for assistance but i think i can handle
it all through our own department ive
located three big caches of stuff enough
to transform the colonies of peace-
ful yellow agriculturists into a well-
equipped army corps and they are sur-
rounded by enough of my men to seize
them also ive got enough on your
friend baron moto to warrant me in
clapping the cuffs on him and his whole
bunch  ive only held off on your say-
so but ive got the little jap tea house
down the coast where they are putting
up surrounded

  arkell youre going to have a dis-
appointment there and as usual the se-
cret service is going to justify its name

and reputation and do a great big
duty well without publicity answered
tommy gravely do you know if
moto has received a wireless within the
last day or two

  tm holding up one which came for
him this morning a message from the
captain of the jap cruiser nikko say-
ing that he would anchor off tijuana
to-morrow at daybreak im not stuck
on his knowing that one of the biggest
caches of ammunition is on the coro-
nados islands just off that port the
particular island is supposed to be un-
inhabited but ive got a dozen men over
there with orders to set fire to the stuff
if an attempt is made to land but that
wouldnt save them

  my dear arkell they are not in the
slightest danger and you can let that
message through together with one
which i wish to send to the baron ask-
ing him to meet us at tijuana to-mor-
row at nine answered tommy and
for the first time in days that aggravat-
ing mephistophelean smile appeared on
his face then well sit down and
work up the stage directions for a little
stunt i wish to pull off and old chap
i wish that you would take nelka out
for a sight-seeing trip while we are
working dont strain your eyes look-
ing out across the pacific young woman
-its too big to see across but i prom-
ise you that its bearing your ship
safely to port

  promptly at nine oclock the follow-
ing morning our automobile rolled into
the tiny plaza of the squalid mexican
town just across the border save that
the precious sword in its lacquer box
lay across tommys knees there was
nothing to suggest that we were armed

  i had no definite knowledge of just
what tommy expected to do but the
expression on his face convinced me
that he was preparing a denouement
which would give him the center of the
stage and the sight of baron moto
grim of face sitting in another car told
the thmd phase



me that he was cast for the part of the
goat far out on the blue water a
cruiser flying the ensign of japan lay
at anchor and as we all got out of our
cars greeting the japanese with the for-
mality of duelists in the middle of the
plaza a surfboat shot away from her
side and headed toward the harbor
tommy looked at it for a moment
through powerful glasses and then
turned and placed the sword in nelkas
hands we were out of earshot of the
plaza loungers when he faced the baron

   baron moto so far as i can see you
have been wise enough to play the latter
part of this game according to my direc-
tions he said quietly as your com-
munications have been cut for some
time by the secret service it is only fair
to tell you that the plans which you laid
have been knocked out the arms ship-
ments thanks to the decoding of the
cipher messages sent to you by your
agents have been intercepted the ac-
cumulations of stores artillery and
equipment which you have been gather-
ing for months in preparation for the
invasion of california and the arming
of your countrymen here have been dis-
covered and to prevent the publicity
which might arise from their seizure
secret-service agents have been ordered
to destroy them by fires which at this
moment are being kindled

  the baron nodded indifferently his
face wras still that of the fanatic his
eyes were riveted upon the box in la
duvaliefs slender hands and only left
it tosfioot a glance of venomous hatred
at her face tommy noted that and
there was nothing of courtesy in his
voice when he continued

 that part then we may regard as
a closed incident-and there is the
proof he said pointing dramatically
out over the bay to a low island from
which a column of black smoke was
rising but there is something else
which is not and that is the vindication
of nelka duvalief baron for every

other thing you have done i can find
justification for your cruelty to her i
loathe you gentlemen-he turned to
us markedly excluding the baron from
that address-you have all heard sto-
ries discreditable to this girl for in
spite of her years she is nothing more
perhaps i have repeated them for until
i knew her i gave credit to common
gossip concerning her which said that
she was a traitor to the land of her birth
-and she will tell you that the gossip
was justified and confirmed by appear-
ances they told of her having be-
trayed russia to germany because her
lover was murdered in a russian dun-
geon that is a lie nelka duvalief
has done secret-service work of the vil-
est kind but it was always for her own
country and it was done under the lash
of the most infamous organization in
the world the russian third section
that lash was not held over her shoul-
ders but above the scarred back of her
lover serge ivanof he did not die
he has been held a prisoner in russian
penal settlements and it is for love of
him that nelka duvalief lias saved him
from the unmentionable tortures which
those fiends know how to inflict by
obeying their commands it has made
of her a consummate actress for she
has been obliged to hoodwink the ger-
man general staff the shrewdest spy
catchers in the world into the belief
that she was betraying russia to them
but heartless as were her own people
to her the baron moto proved even a
worse taskmaster when chance placed
her in his power you remember that
after the russian war the island of
saghallen the worst of the russian
penal settlements fell to the japanese
in the most loathsome of its dungeons
they found serge ivanof forgotten
when the other political prisoners and
convicts were removed in all confi-
dence he babbled out to colonel moto
the story of what he had suffered and
of what nelka had been forced to suf-


the pocpulacr magazine

fer for him believing that from the yel-
low man he would receive that mercy
which had been denied to him by the
white

  for the first time moto started to
speak but tommy was not yielding his
place in the spotlight and he motioned
to him to be silent

  but colonel moto was not throw-
ing away the chance which had so for-
tuitously been thrown into his hands
the chance to command the services of
a skillful and beautiful woman in his
own espionage system to dictate through
fear such obedience as no yellow man
can ever exact in any other way from
a white woman serge ivanof was re-
tained in captivity and to save him
nelka entered a service more loathsome
to her than the one she quitted

  we had been so intent upon his re-
cital that we had not noticed the arrival
of the surf boat at the neighboring jetty
but turning quickly tommy indicated
it with a dramatic swteep of his arm
the japanese sailors tossed their oars
smartly and the little lieutenant and the
coxswain helped to the landing a pas-
senger in civilian clothes who had been
crouched in the stern sheets

  he was a tall rawboned man but
the broad shoulders were pitifully
stooped and in spite of his long legs
he walked with the short jerky steps
of a man whose ankles had long known
the restriction of fetters his hair
which judging from the light-blue
lackluster eyes and the white skin must
have originally been blond was as white
as snow and his face was furrowed
with those deep lines which come only
from intense physical pain and mental
anguish he shambled ungracefully to-
ward us docilely following the direc-
tions of the naval officer who had been
his escort but there was not the slight-
est sign of interest on his vacant stu-
pid face but when nelka with such

a cry of joy as few men are ever priv-
ileged to hear from a womans lips
sprang forward to meet him there was
something in her face which was that
of a young girl which banished the years
of pain and misery

  he straightened back the stooped
shoulders the drooping head was sud-
denly raised and the seamed face was
radiant in the pale eyes was that light
which never was on land or sea as he
crushed her to his breast with arms
which mercifully for her were weak
from the years of confinement in the
manacles which had left deep scars on
the wrists those scars were the last
things i saw distinctly for a moment
for i confess that my vision was blurred
with moisture tommy who was beam-
ing on the happy results of his handi-
work was recalled to earth by a sharp
exclamation from arkell for the baron
unobserved for a moment was scut-
tling toward the boat the sword of his
ancestors clasped convulsively to his
breast tommy knocked the pistol
which arkell had drawn from his hand

  let him go we can use his car
to get back to san diego and after
all these years of separation those rus-
sian turtledoves are entitled to drive
back alone  he exclaimed and he
chuckled as in his haste the baron made
such a mpd leap for the boat that he
fell in a heap in the cockpit you
couldnt pinch him without causing just
the publicity you wish to avoid you
havent any kick coming arkell all
youve lost is the chance to clap hand-
cuffs on him but hes carrying off a
valuable piece of my property im sat-
isfied if you are he concluded with a
significant glance at the reunited lovers
still clasped in each others arms
thats cheap at the price and between
us i reckon weve managed at least to
put a crimp into the third phase of this
mexican business

    the adventures of captain blood a skipper who had lost several ships
and several small fortunes but had never lost a friend who had run guns
and run gin and had his name coupled with the word barratry in 
earlier times privateering and grand smuggling would have claimed jiim ij
and held him by their charms in these flat times he was just a free lance ji

v	i

 i-the captain gets a ship

captain blood was an irish-
man of the black-haired blue-
eyed type a presentable man 
and a great favorite with the
ladies with scarcely a trace of the irish
accent but a voice that would soothe
the devil to sleep and a temper that
when roused carried all before it this
gentleman had lost several ships he
had lost several small fortunes gotten
more or less illegitimately he had lost
caste in several ports of the world but
somehow or another he had never lost
a friend he had run guns and he
had run gin his name had been whis-
pered coupled with the word barratry
in earlier and freer times privateering
and grand smuggling would without
any manner of doubt have claimed
him and held him by their charms in
these flat times he was just a free lance

  after the penguin job he and billy
harman that simple sailorman had
come back to frisco the very port of
all others one might fancy they would
have avoided but billy had been a
power in frisco and reckoning on his
power he had taken the captain back
with him

  theres no call to be afraid said
billy there was more in that job than
the likes of us why theyd pay us
money to tuck us away whatser use
freezin round n york or boston
theres nothin to be done on the east-
ern side friscos warm

  damn warm  put in the captain

  maybe but theres ropes there 
can pull an make bells ring clancy
and rafferty and all that crowd are
with me and weve done nothin
why were plaster saints to the chaps
that are walkin round in frisco with
cable watch chains across their wes-
kits

  they came back and billy harman
proved to be right no one molested
them san francisco was heaving in
the throes of an election and people
had no time to bot-her about such small
fry as the captain and his companion
while owing to the good offices of the
clancys and raffertys billy managed
to pick up a little money here and there
and to assist his friend in doing like-
wise

  then things began to get slack and
to-day as bright a morning as ever


the popuur magazine

broke on the pacific coast the captain
down on his luck and without even the
price of a drink was hanging about a
wharf near the china docks waiting
for his companion

  he took his seat on a mooring bitt
and lighting a pipe began to review
the situation gulls were flitting across
the blue water whipped by the westerly
wind blowing in from the golden gate
a chinese shrimp boat with huge lug-
sail -bellying to the breeze was blunder-
ing along for the upper bay crossing
the bows of a stockton river boat and
threatening it with destruction pleasure
yachts burly tugs and a great four-
master just coming in with the salt of
cape horn on her sun-blistered sides-
all these made a picture bright and
moving as the morning

  it depressed the captain

  business and pleasure have little ap-
peal to a man who has no business and
no money for pleasure we all have
our haunting terrors and the captain
who feared nothing in an ordinary way
had his when in extremely low water
he was always haunted by the dread
of dying without a penny in his pocket
to be found dead with empty pockets
was the last indignity his irish pride
revolted at the thought and he was
turning it over in his mind now as he
sat watching the shipping

  then he caught a glimpse of a figure
advancing toward him along the quay
side

  it was mr harman

  billy harman was an innocent-look-
ing sailorman with an open weather-
beaten face and blue eyes that gazed
at you direct a copy-book moralist
would have made nothing of billy for
he was full of guile and yet possessed
of a strange sort of innocence his
morals would have shocked a sunday
school yet he would have been the life
and soul of a sunday-school treat had
he ever been invited to one this gen-
tleman who could scarcely read and

who managed with difficulty to write
the words billy harman had yet
been endowed by nature with a mind
active as a squirrel ward politicians
knew mr harman as a useful man
and used him occasionally crimps
knew him and tavern keepers had
he been more of a scamp and less of a
dreamer he might have risen high in
life his dream was of a big fortune
to be got sudden and easy and this
dream stimulated at times by alcohol
managed somehow to keep him popr

  so there you are said he as he
drew up to the captain i been lookin
for you all along the wharf

  any news asked the captain

  mr harman took a pipe from his
pocket and explored the empty bowl
with his little finger then leaning
against the mooring bitt he cut some
tobacco up filled the pipe and lit it

  only when the pipe was alight did
he seem to hear the captains question

  that depends said he i dont
know how youre feelin but my feelin
is to get out of here and get out quick

  theres not much news in that said
blood ive had it in my head for
days whats the use of talking
theres only one way out of frisco for
you or me and thats by way of a
focsle and thats a way im not going
to take

  maybe said harman youll let
me say my say before putting your hoof
in my mouth news-i should think
i had news now by any chance did
you ever sight the channel islands down
the coast there lying off santa barbara 
first you come to the san lucas
islands then you come to santa cata-
lina a big brute of an island she is
same longitude as los angeles then
away out from santa catalina you have
san nicolas

  no ive never struck them replied
blood whats the matter with
them 

  the chinese go there huntin for
sb plunder



abalone shells went on harman dis-
regarding the question im aimin at
a teeny yellow bit of an island away
to the north of the san lucas a place
you could cover with your hat a place
no one ever goes to

  well 

  well theres twenty thousand dol-
lars in gold coin lyin there ready to be
took away only this morning news
came in that one of the see-yup-see
liners-you know them rotten old tubs
china owned out of canton in the
chow an coffin trade-well one of them
things is gone ashore on san juan thats
the name of the island swept clean
she was and hove on the rocks and
every man drowned but two chinee
who got away on a raf i had the
news from clancy the wrecks to be
sold and clancy says the opinion is
shes not worth two dollars seein the
chances are the seas broke her up by
this well now look here i know
san juan intimate and i know a
vessel once ashore there wont break
up to the sea in a hurry by the nature
of the coast theres some coasts will
spew a wreck off in ten minutes and
somell stick to their goods till theres
nuthin left but the starnpost and the
ribs its shelvin water there and rocks
that hold like sharks teeth the yan-
shan-thats her name-will hold till
the last trumpet if shes hove up proper
which by all accounts she is and
theres twenty thousand dollars aboard
her

  well  said blood

  well if we could crawl down there
-you an me-wed put our claws on
that twenty thousand

  how in the nation are you going
to rig out a wrecking expedition on
two cents and suppose you could buy
the wreck for two dollars-wheres
your two dollars 

  im not goin to buy no wrecks
replied harman nor fit out no wreckin
expeditions what l want is something

small and easy handled-no steam get
her out and blow down on the north-
west trades raise san juan and the
yan-shan lift the dollars and blow
off with them why its as easy as
walkin about in your slippers

  the captain sighed

  as easy as getting into the peniten-
tiary said he first of all youd
have to steal a boat and frisco is no
port to steal boats in second theres
such things as telegraphs and cables
you ought to know that after the pen-
guin job then if we were caught as
we would be youd have the old pen-
guin rising like a hurricane on us shes
forgotten now i know but once a chap
gets in trouble everything thats for-
gotten wakes up and shouts

  maybe said harman and maybe
id be such a fool as to go stealin
boats im not goin to steal no boats
but im goin to do this thing somehow
and once i set my mind on a job i does
it you mark me im fair drove crazy
to get out of here and be after some-
thin with money on the end of it and
once im like that and sets my think
tank boilin theres fish to fry you
leave it to me i aint no fool to be
gettin into penitentiaries well lets
get a move on theres nothin like
movin about to keep ones ideas
jumpin

  they walked along the wharf step-
ping over mooring hawsers and pausing
now and then to inspect the shipping
there is no port in the world to equal
san francisco in variety and charm
here above all other places the truth
is borne in on one that trade that much
abused and seemingly prosaic wrord is
in reality another name for romance
here at frisco all the winds of the
world blow in ships whose voyages are
stories freighters with china mud still
clinging to their anchor flukes junks
calling up the lights and gongs of the
canton river schooners from the
islands whalers from the sulphur-bot-


the popular magazine

tom grounds grain ships from half the
world away the spirit of trade hauls
them all in through the golden gate
and over and beyond these the bay
itself has its romance in the ships that
never leave it-junks and shrimp boats
the boats of greek fishermen yachts
and all sorts of steam craft engaged on
a hundred businesses from suisun bay
to the guadeloupe river

  wandering along blood and his
companion came to raffertys wharf
raffertys wharf is a bit of the past a
mooring place for old ships condemned
and waiting the breaking yards it has
escaped harbor boards and fires and
earthquakes healthy trade never comes
there and very strange deals have been
completed in its dubious precincts over
ships passed as seaworthy yet held to-
gether as harman was explaining now
to blood by the pitch in their seams
mostly

  as they came along a man who was
crossing the gangway from the tank
saw harman and hailed him

  its jack bone said harman to
blood walk along and ill meet you
in a minute

  blood did as he was directed and
harman halted at the gangway

  youre the man i want said bone
whos your friend

  oh just a chap replied harman
whats up now

  bone took him by the arm and led
him along in an opposite direction to
that in which blood was going bone
was the landlord of the fore and aft
tavern half tavern half sailors board-
ing house situated right on raffertys
wharf and with a stairway down to
the water from the back premises his
face to use harmans description of
it was one grog blossom and what
he did not know of wicked wharfside
ways could scarcely be called knowl-
edge

  ginnell is layin about lookin for
two hands said bone hes due out

this evenin and its five dollars apiece
for you if you can lay your claws on
what he wants whites they must be
whites you know ginnell

  harman did

  ginnell owned a fifty-foot schooner
engaged sometimes in the shark-fishing
trade sometimes in other businesses of
a more shady description he had a
chinese crew and though the custom-
house laws of san francisco demanded
only one white officer on a chinese-
manned boat ginnell always made a
point of carrying two men of his own
color with him

  being known as a hard man all along
the wharfside he sometimes found a
difficulty in supplying himself with
hands

  yes i know ginnell replied har-
man him and his old shark boat by
repitation ive stood near the chap
in bars now and again but i dont call
to mind speakin to him his repitation
is pretty noisy

  well i cant help that said bone
i didnt make the chap nor his repita-
tion if he had a better one i guess
ten dollars wouldnt be lyin your way
nor twenty dollars yours laughed
harman

  thats my business said bone
the question is do you take on the
job id do it all myself only theres
such a want of sailormen on the front
its those durned bands of hope and
sailors rests that sucks em in fills
em writh bilge in the way of tracks
and ginger beer and turns em out onfit
for any job onless its got a silver-
plated handle to it mouth oigans an
the new jerusalem is all they cares
for onct them wharf missionaries gets
a holt on them i tell you billy har-
man if they dont get up some by-law
to stop these chaps propagatin their
gospels and spoilin trade the likes of
me and you will be ruined-thats a fac
well what do you say

  all the time mr bone was holding
sb a plunder



forth harman who had struck an idea
was deep in meditation the question
roused him

  if ginnell wants two chaps said
he i believe i can fit him with them
anyhow wheres he to be found
hell be at my place at three
oclock said bone and ive promised
to find the goods for him by that
well ill tell you said harman
ill find the chaps and have them at
your place haff past three or so you
can leave it safe in my hands

  you speak as if you was certain
and certain i am ive got the chaps
you want

  now look here said bone dont
you take on the job unless youre more
than sure ginnell isnt no boob to
play up and down with hed set in
mostlike to wreck the bar if he
thought i was playin cross with him
dont fret said harman ill be
there and now fork out a dollar ad-
vance for ill have some treatin to
do

 bone produced the money it
changed hands and he departed while
harman pursued his way along the
wharf toward his friend

  blood was sitting on an empty crate
well said he as the other drew
up what business

  harman told every word of his con-
versation with bone and without any
addition to it waited for the other to
speak

  well youve got the dollar said
blood at last and theres some satis-
faction in that im not the chap to
take five cents off a chap by false pre-
tenses sames youve done with bone
but bones not a man by all accounts
hes a crimp in mans clothes and if
all the old whalemen hes filled with
balloon juice and sent to perdition
could rise up and shout i reckon his
named be known in two hemispheres
i beg your pardon said harman
what was that you were saying about

false pretenses  i havent used no
false pretenses they aint things im
in the habit of usin between man and
man

  well what have you been using
you told me a moment ago youd
agreed to furnish two hands to this
chaps order for five dollars apiece and
a dollar advance

  so i have

  and wheres your hands

  ive got them

  in your pocket

  oh close up said harman i
never did see such a chap as you for
wearin blinkers cant you see the end
of your nose in front of you well
if you cant i can however ill tell
you the whole of the business later
when ive turned it round some more
in my head what im after now is
grubr heres a dollar and im off to
billy sheehans you come along with
me-a dollars enough for two-and
you can raise your objections after
youve got a beefsteak inside of you
maybe youll see clearer then

  the captain said  no more but fol-
lowed harman far better educated
than the latter he had come to recog-
nize that harman despite his real and
childlike simplicity in various ways
had a mind quicker than most mens
he would often have gone without a
meal during that wandering partner-
ship which had lasted for nearly a year
but for harmans ingenuity and power
of resource

  at sheehans they had good beef-
steak and real coffee

  now said harman when they had
finished if youre ready to listen to
reason ill tell you the lay im on
ginnell wants two hands im goin
to offer myself for one and you are
goin to be the other

  i beg your pardon said blood
you mean to say im to sign on in that
chaps shark boat is that your mean-
ing


the popular magazine

  i said nutliin about signin on in
shark boats i said we two has got to
get out of here in ginuells tub once
outside the gate were all right

  i see said blood were to scup-
per ginnell and take the boat-and
how about the penitentiary

  im blest if you havent got peniten-
tiaries on the brain said harman if
you leave this thing to me ill fix it so
that therell be no penitentiaries in the
business of course if we were to go
into such a fools job as youre thinkin
about wed lay ourselves under the
law right smart no the game im
after is deeper than that and its gin-
nell im goin to lay under the law
now ive got to run about and do
things an see people ill leave you
here and heres a quarter and dont
you spend it till the time comes now
you listen to me wait about till haff
past three and at haff past three punc-
tual you turn into the fore and aft
and walk up to the bar and lay your
quarter down and call for a drink
youll see me there and if i nod to you
you just nod to me then ill have a
word in private with you

  is that all said the captain
  thats all for the present said

  	v x	

harman rising up youll be there
yes ill be there said blood
though im blest if i can see your
meaning

  you will soon replied the other
and paying the score off he went

  he turned from the wharves up an
alley and then into a fairly respectable
street of small houses pausing before
one of these he knocked at the door
which was opened almost immediately
by a big blue-eyed sunburned good-
natured-looking man some thirty years
of age and attired as to the upper part
of him in a blue woolen jersey

  this was captain mike of the fish
patrol

  billy harman said captain mike
come in

  no time said harman ive just
called to say a word i wants you to
do me a favor	

  and whats the favor asked the
captain

pretend to fall asleep i just -wants
you as a witness

  whats the game asked captain
mike

  harman told

  had you been watching the two men
from a distance you might have fan-
cied that there was a great joke be-
tween them from the laughter of cap-
tain mike and the way in which har-
man was slapping his thigh then the
door closed and harman went off
steering north through a maze of
gtreets till he reached his lodgings

  here he packed a few things in a
bundle and had an interview with his
landlady a motherly woman whose in-
come was derived from a washtub and
two furnished bedrooms

  among the other belongings which
he took with him was a box of quinine
tabloids these he placed in the
pocket of his coat and with the bundle
under his arm departed

  it was five minutes past three when
he entered the dirty doggery misnamed
the fore and aft and there before the
bar behind which bone was serving
drink stood ginnell

  pat ginnell to give him his full
sb plundbcr



name was an irishman of the sure-
fwhat type who might have been a
bricklayer but for his decent clothes
and sea air and the big blue anchor
tattooed on the back of his left hand
there was no one else in the bar

  heres the gentleman said bone
when he sighted harman up to time
and with the goods to deliver i dare
say harman this is the captain
wheres the hands 

  well said harman leaning his el-
bow on the bar i believe ive got
them one of thems meself

  dyou mean to say youre up to sign
on with me  asked ginnell

  thats my meanin said harman
ginnell looked at bone then he
spoke

  it wont do said he i know you
be name mr harman youre in with
clancy and that crowd and my boats
too rough for the likes of you

  you neednt fear about that said
harman ive done with clancy
what ive got to do is get out of frisco
and get out quick the cops are after
me there you have it ive got to get
out of here before night-do you take
me-and im so pressed to get out sud-
den ill take your word for ten dollars
a month without any signin

  ginnells brow cleared

  what are you havin  said he
ill take a drink of whisky replied
harman

  the bargain was concluded

  and now said ginnell what
about the other chap

  harman wriped his mouth with the
back of his hand

  ive made an arrangement with a
chap to meet me here said he hell
be in in a minute

  whats he like asked ginnell
like why ill tell you what hes
like he wouldnt sign on in your tub
for a hundred dollars a month

  faith and youre a nice sort of

chap said ginnell is it playin the
fool with me you are

  by way of reply harman took tnc
box of quinine tabloids from his pocket
opened it showed the contents and
wanked

  bone and ginnell understood at once
one of those in his drink will lay
him out for an hour said harman
without hurtin him put one in your
weskit pocket bone--and how about
your boat

  shes down below at the stairs
replied the landlord putting the tab-
loid in his waistcoat pocket ill go
and call jim to get her ready-a mo-
ment gentlemen he vanished into a
back room and they heard him shout-
ing orders to jim then he returned
and as he passed behind the bar who
should enter but captain mike

  the captain walked to the bar called
for a drink and without as much as a
glance at the others took it to a seat
in a far corner where he lit a pipe
several wharf habitues loafed in and
soon the place became hazy with to-
bacco smoke and horrible with the smell
of rank cigars

  well said ginnell wheres your
man  im thinkin hes given you the
slip and be the powers mr harman
if he has itll be the worst for you
the brute in ginnell spoke in his
growl and harman was turning over
in his mind the fate of any unfortunate
who had ginnell for boss when the
swing door opened and blood appeared

  thats him said harman you
leave him to me

  blood was not the sort of man to
frequent a hole like the fore and aft
and he frankly spat when he came in
he was in a temper or rather the be-
ginning of a temper and harman
seemed to have some difficulty in sooth-
ing him they had a confabulation to-
gether near the corner where captain
mike his glass and pipe on the table
before him wras sitting evidently


the tpovulacr magazine

asleep and then blood seeming to
agree with some matter under discus-
sion allowed himself to be led to the
bar

  this is me friend captain ginnell
said harman captain this is me
friend michael blood looking for a
ship he is

  i cant offer him a ship said gin-
nell but i can offer him a drink
what are you takin sir 

  blood called for a whisky

  the quinine tabloid popped into the
bottom of the glass by bone dissolved
almost immediately nor did blood
show that he detected the presence in
his drink he loathed quinine and this
forced dose added to the flood of his
steadily rising temper without how-
ever interfering with his powers of
self-control

  he wras a good actor and the way
he clutched at the bar ledge shortly
after he had finished his drink left
nothing to be desired

  let him lay down said harman

  i cant leave the bar said bone
but if the gentleman cares to lay down
in my back room hes welcome

  blood allowing himself to be con-
ducted to this resting place ginnell
followed without drawing the attention
of the others in the bar

  arrived in the back room blood col-
lapsed on an old couch by the window
and lying there with his eyes shut he
heard the rest

  he heard the whispered consultation
between harman and the other the
trapdoor being opened jim the boat-
man being called and then he felt
a hand on his shoulder and ginnells
voice adjuring him to rouse up a bit
and come along for a sail

  helped on either side by the conspira-
tors he allowed himself to be led to
the trapdoor

  well never get him down them
steps said harman alluding to the
stairs leading down to where the boat

was swaying on the green water that
was swishing and swashing against the
rotten piles of the wharf

  this is the way its done said gin-
nell and twitching bloods feet from
under him he sent him down the stair-
way like a bag of meal to where jim
was waiting to receive him

  at half past six oclock that day the
heart of ireland-that was the name of
ginnells boat-passed the tumble of
the bar and took the swell of the pa-
cific like a duck

  ginnel giving the wheel over to one
of the chinese crew glanced to wind-
ward glanced back at the coast where
tamalpais stood cloud-wrapped and
gilded by the evening sun and then
turned to the companionway leading
down to the hole of a cabin where they
had deposited their shanghaied man

  im goin to rouse that swab up he
said he ought to be recovered by
this

  go easy with him said harman

  ill be as gentle with him as a
mother replied the skipper of the
heart of ireland with a ferocious grin

  harman watched the unfortunate
man descending he had got shoulder
deep dowrn the ladder when he sud-
denly vanished as if snatched below
and his shout of astonishment and the
crash of his fall came up simultane-
ously to the listener at the hatch

  then came the sounds of the fight
harman had seen blood fighting once
and he had no fear at all for him if
he feared for any one it was ginnell
who wras crying now for mercy and
apparently receiving none then of a
sudden came silence and harman
slipped down the ladder

  biood during his incarceration had
ransacked the cabin and secured the
captains revolver he was seated now
revolver in hand on ginnells chest
and ginnell was lying on the cabin
sea plundecr



floor without a kick or an ounce of
fight in him

  you havent killed him asked
harman

  i dont know replied blood
speak up you swab and answer are
you dead or not

  faith i dont know groaned the
unfortunate im near done what
are you up to what game is this
youre playin on me is it murder or
what 

  let me talk to him said harman
bob ginnell youve doped and shang-
haied a man-meanin my friend cap-
tain blood-and ive got all the evi-
dence and witnesses captain mike of
the fish patrol is one he came to the
fore and aft be request and saw the
whole game that means the peniten-
tiary for you if we split youll say
i provided the dope whos to prove
it  when i told you the cops were
after me i told a lie whos to prove
it  i wanted you and your old tub
and ive got em say a word against
me and see what clancy will do to you
you shanghaied me friend and now
youre shanghaied yourself in your own
ship and youll never dare to have the
law on us because dyou see weve got
the law on you the captain there has
got your revolver the coolies on deck
dont care they never even turned a
hair when they heard you shoutin
now my question is do you intend to
take it quiet or would you sooner be
hove overboard 

  faith and theres no use in kick-
ing replied the owner of the heart
of ireland i gives in

  then up on your feet said blood
rising and putting the revolver in his
pocket and up on deck with you
youre one of the hands now and if
you ever want to see frisco again
youll take my orders and take them
smart youll berth aft with us but

your rating is cabin boy and your pay
up with you

  ginnell went up the ladder and the
others followed

  ginnell showed to the light of day
two black eyes and the marks on his
chin of the frightful uppercut that had
closed the fight

  he looked like a beaten dog as blood
called the crew in order to pick
watches with harman

  i take the chap thats steering said
blood

  and i takes bob ginnell said
harman

  they finished the business and dis-
missed the hands who seemed to see
nothing strange in the recent occurrence
among the whites - and who were
thronging now to the focsle for their
supper their faces all wearing the same
chinese expression the expression of
men who know everything of men who
know nothing

  then having set a course for the
san lucas islands and while ginnell
was washing himself below blood with
his companion leaned on the rail and
looked at the far-away coast dying out
in the dusk

  seems strange it was only this
mornin i projected gettin out like
thi s said harman and here we are
out with twenty thousand dollars
ahead of us if the yan-shan hasnt
broke up which she hasnt pears to
me it was worth a dose of quinine to
do the job so neat with no bones broke
and no fear of the law at the end of
it

  maybe said the captain

  he whistled softly to the accompani-
ment of the slashing of the bow wash
looking over toward the almost van-
ished coast above which in the pansy
blue of the evening sky stars were now
showing like points of silver

another story of the captain in the november th popular
get your man

by b m bower and buck connor

authors of five hundred head for a ranger  etc

like the man without a country is the man in this story who was dismissed from the
texas rangers after a love affair that blinded him to duty to get back into the
service becomes an obsession with him there is a terrific fight between two men in
the tale-one fighting for his life and the other for what makes life worth while

in the gray of a windy afternoon
when the leaden clouds were more
sand than vapor captain oakes
of the texas ranger force jerked
open the door of his office and looked
out just as bill gillis was passing

  tell marshall to report to me at
once the captain hailed bill and
turned back as though the thing was
done

  marshall aint here biil grabbed
for his hat which the wind had all but
swooped from his head and blinked
into the wind and sand while he faced
his captain

  aint here where is he the
captain pulled the door shut because
the wind was stirring up the papers
on his desk and turned a sharp glance
toward the corral and stable

  went to town a little while ago
bill said reluctantly torn between
ranger discipline and his personal
sense of loyalty to marshall

  you go after him the captain
went in and the wind slammed the
door shut bill hanging to his big-
four stetson with both hands went
staggering down to the stable cursing
his vile luck for bringing him past
the door at the moment when the cap-
tain opened it why couldnt it have
been vaughan or kent or charlie
horn 

  going after king marshall did not
sound very difficult since there was

only a mile or so to ride but bill
would gladly have exchanged that er-
rand for a fifty-mile trip in some other
direction nevertheless still when the
captain says go there is nothing to
be gained by loitering so within five
minutes bill was mounted on the horse
that day assigned to his vise and wras
leaning into the wind and riding with
his eyes two-thirds dosed so that his
lashes might strain the dust that half
blinded him

  its shore a ticklish job dragging a
fellow away from his girl-and that
right after youve told him plain and
forcible that hed better cut out run-
ning with her bill mused uncom-
fortably kings liable to forget who
hes speaking- to and tell me to mind
iny own business and then bill fin-
ished with a quirk of his lips the
dustll shore be stirred up along the
trouble trail cause i wont take any-
thing like that offn king marshall or
no other man

  on the chance that king had met
an acquaintance and had loitered in the
post office for a few minutes bill
swung off his horse at the platform
and went in spitting grit as he went
perhaps lie was secretly postponing his
disagreeable errand-but that could not
be for long because the captain wanted
king and the captain was not one to
avait patiently when he had called a
man to report for duty at any rate
get yoljtr man



king was not in the post office and
bill glancing through the glass front
of lock box no  saw that he had
not been there bill opened the box
and took out the mail and returned to
his horse

  on the extreme edge of the town
lived the girl half mexican in blood
and the traditions of women born to
be petted full american in speech and
in a certain careless freedom of the
restraining conventions of the better
class across the border lisa gonzales
had lovers in plenty-yet not so many
but she resented fiercely any influence
that would take one from her bill
gill is she recognized-trust a woman
for sensing antagonism a mile off-as
such an influence

  bill was in no mood for subterfuge
or diplomacy since he must get king
to the captain he meant to do it as soon
as possible so he rode straight to the
flat-roofed adobe house where lisa
lived with her father and a half-grown
sister and struck his knuckles impera-
tively against the blue-painted door
panels

  lisa herself opened the door six
inches and looked out at him with
unreadable unfriendly black eyes

  bill tilted his hat in a perfunctory
ealute-since he recognized and re-
turned in full the antagonism-and
wasted no words in preamble id
like to speak to king marshall he
said straightforwardly

  you would lisa smiled guile-
fully well fll tell him so-when
he comes and she added by way
of apology perhaps oh it is so windy
to-day  and pressed the door shut in
the face of bill gillis and the swirling
clouds of dust

  bill hesitated glaring at the blank
light-blue panels so affected by mexi-
cans he believed that king was in
there beyond that door-but he wanted
to be absolutely sure of it before he
forced an entrance what ailed the

man anyway  he thought angrily as
he swung up into the saddle he
turned his horse and stared for an-
other minute at the house

  he did not go back into the town
instead he went straight to the little
adobe shed where lisas father shel-
tered a cow and a meager little pony
when the winds were too piercing out-
side without leaving the saddle bill
rode close to the sagging door reached
out and pulled it open so that he could
look within there resting on three
legs half asleep under the saddle stood
the horse king had ridden to town

  the lyin little hussy bill snorted
unchivalrously and i knew she lied
too

  he rode back to the house swung
off his horse on the sheltered side
where the wall was unbroken by win-
dows and went around to the back
door he did not know for sure but
he suspected that lisa had been sharp-
witted enough to lock the front door
when she shut it in his face at any
rate he did not intend to expose him-
self to the humiliation of trying to
open a door that was locked against
him

  he opened the back door delib-
erately as though he had a perfect
right to walk in where he pleased to
go he went into the kitchen-and
faced king marshall seated at a table
spread with a red-and-blue-checked
cloth and filled with savory mexican
dishes the arms of lisa were just
drawing away from kings shoulders
when bill went in her black eyes spat
hate at him over kings brown head
bill paid her no attention whatever he
looked full at king and he tried to
keep his face free of all emotion

  captain wants you right away
king he announced casually he
sent me in to tell you

 what does he want snapped
king lowering a forkful of frijoles to
his plate im not on duty--


the popular magazine

  a rangers always on duty king
bill corrected mildly he did not so
much blame king-a womans spell
can work an unbelievable change in a
man

  well-you can tell him ill be along
after a little the soft fingers of lisa
were tapping tapping on kings shoul-
ders his left hand went up defiantly
and prisoned them in his palm and
bill youre kin da butting in on another
mans private affairs dont yuh think

  captain sent me after you king
youd better come bill stood just
inside the door with his hat pushed -
back on his head-ignoring in the face
of bigger things the little courtesy of
removing it in lisas presence-and his
voice stopped just short of being apolo-
getic he hated this situation into
which he had been forced-hated it
worse than did those two across the
table-but it never occurred to him to
shirk his duty

  king marshall flushed it was lisa
however who answered bill with a
spiteful little smile and a barbed mean-
ing that made the blood beat in the
temples of the two men

  you just want to take him from
me she cried her arms slipping
around kings neck youre mad be-
cause- know why-if i wanted to
tell you followed him here and you
want to get him away bah  know
how much the captain wants him
you cant fool nobody-but yourself
was what she said

  now every one knows that a man
violently in love is in an abnormal
state where truth looks trivial and the
things that are false look true and fine
and big king marshall was suffering
from the infatuation which sometimes
seizes a strong man who does not know
women very well and the moment lisa
put the lie into speech punctuated by
little caressing movements king who
was in a highly abnormal condition be-
lieved she spoke the truth

  you keep your hands off my affairs
bill he said harshly forgetting how
they two had been friends when lisa
was an untidy schoolgirl in short
dresses and long braids ive had
enough of this spying and interfering
in my business ill go when i get
good and readj 

  youll go now king the captain
told me to bring you bills voice was
still soft but his eyes were not he
wanted to tear those clinging arms
from kings neck perhaps without
their insidious influence king would
have sense enough to see that he must
come when the captain called

  youve delivered your message-
and that lets you out king parried
reaching with ostentatious ease for the
flat little tortillas lisa had daked for
him he did not look at bill-per-
haps in spite of the perverse spirit
that rode him hard he was ashamed
of himself ill settle with the cap-
tain he added lifting his forkful of
frijoles again to his mouth lisa
wheres that good coffee i smell 

  right now i bring it lisa cried
eagerly and sent bill gillis a tri-
umphant glance duty pitted against
loves desire-and love had won just
as it always does win if it is greater
than a mans soul she hurried back
to stand close behind king marshall
after she had filled his cup her fin-
gers returned to their little caressing
taps on his shoulders the beans
are they are plenty full of chili

  king youve got to come now
bill feeling dimly that this was not the
real king marshall who sat there
openly mutinous was patient even
when he wanted to tear those two apart
by force

  aw clear out bill you give me
a pain ill settle with the captain i
told you once king sent him an ugly
look youre about as welcome here
right now as --------

  get up from there and come with
get youcr man



me bills patience snapped all at
once king was no longer a fellow
ranger who was out of his mind with
love of a girl but a man whom the
captain had told bill to bring to head-
quarters putting it on that basis bill
knew exactly what to do and how to
do it he had brought reluctant men
to headquarters before now

  king looked up into the muzzle of
bills six-shooter and caught his
breath in sheer amazement why

  ill take you to the captain by
gosh if i have to take you in irons
snapped bill you lunatic-to let a
little snip of a fool girl ruin you with
the force like that for half an hour
longer to spoon with her youd refuse
to obey an order would you well
im not built that way myself captain
told me to bring you-and youll go
bill gillis was little as height went
-but at that minute he towered above
king at the table also the gun in his
hand was an argument not to be over-
looked even by a love-crazed man king
got up because he knew he must if he
wanted to live any longer never for
one second did he doubt that bill would
shoot him if he refused he could not
doubt-because he knew

  lisa you go in that next room and
shut the door behind you

  whimpering her chin drawn down
and her shoulders drawn up like a child
waiting for a blow lisa went

  turn your back

  king did it sullenly

  bill took kings six-shooter from its
holster at his hip and slipped it into his
own knowing kings habits he
reached into kings coat pocket and got
the small automatic which king always
carried there against emergencies

  go on out bill ordered  and when
they were outside he made king turn
his back while bill mounted and then
bill followed king to the  shed and
watched him grimly while he led out
iap

his own horse and mounted lead
out he said when king settled into
the saddle and do some going cap-
tains waited too long as it is

  king the color wiped from his face
with the rage that held him because he
was so helpless looked at bill furi-
ously and swore by all the gods men
use to cover the puny ineffectiveness
of their oaths how he would get even
with bill gillis for this

  bill did not make any reply what-
ever as they galloped before the wind
that howled and sent clouds of dust
after them bills anger against king
cooled to a half-amused sympathy

  when they neared the corral bill
rode alongside and held out kings
two guns to him here he said
whimsically im sorry the play came
up like it did but i had to do it king
captain said to bring you-and you
know what a fool i am about obeying
orders but i want to tell yuh right
now king that i consider ive done
you a big kindness-and i dont care
a cuss how you look at it far as im
concerned this thing ends right here
im your friend he rode on and
dismounted at the corral gate

  king looked at him writh his lips
turned down at the corners gave his
horse a kick and went on to the office
sour and sore and feeling that his world
was against him which was of course
merely one phase of his abnormal con-
dition he went in and stood with the
stiff back that expressed a dogged de-
fiance of censure just inside the door
it did not help his mood any that cap-
tain oakes looked up at him over his
reading glasses for a minute-long in-
spection before he spoke

  marshall youre taking altogether
too many liberties around here lately
the captain said at last with the cold
terseness that his men always dreaded
hereafter you will ask permission be-
fore you ride off to town-since you
have formed the habit of forgetting to


the popular magazine

tell me that you are going and why
you should have been started an hour
ago on the job i have assigned you
in the ranger service an hour may
measure the difference between success
and failure

  go up to tobin and look into this
horse stealing that seems to be an epi-
demic in that country here are all the
details that have been sent in get
started as soon as you can-and try
and make up the time that has been
wasted in getting hold of you take
the horse you rode to town youll
be close to the branch line all the way
and you probably wont need a pack
horse thats all

 many a time king marshall had
gone off whistling on harder longer
trips than this one promised to be-but
to-day he passed vaughan with a scowl
and did not answer the cheerful hail of
charlie horne under the friendliness
he imagined an ironical gloating over
him

  he took his carbine and hung it un-
der his right-leg fender and mounted
his horse and rode away glowering at
the familiar wind-buffeted little adobe
buildings that formed the ranger
headquarters - the captains repri-
mand repeated itself over and over in
his mind and bit deeper with every
repetition as an acid eats into a sore
from being a mere reprimand because
of a small breach of discipline it be-
came an unjust accusation wholly un-
deserved  then an insult which no map
should bear in silence so that he
neared ysleta in the mood for further
revolt

  his eyes went toward the adobe
where lisa lived it would be no more
than an act of common kindness to stop
and tell her where he was going and
when she might expect him back-and
to comfort her with a kiss before he
rode on it was very easy for king
to persuade himself that his loyalty to
lisa was a bigger finer thing than

obeying to the letter his captains com-
mand that he make all possible haste
to tobin he swung toward the adobe
and careless whether he were seen
stopping there dropped reins before the
door and went in

  he really meant to stay but a min-
ute he had no intention of loitering
there but with lisas arms around
his neck and with her cheek pressed
against his shoulder while her big
black eyes looked up into his gray ones
minutes were not easily reckoned lisa
was telling him what a brute bill gillis
had proven himself what a thankless
task it was to be a ranger-a dog of
the law to be harried here and there
and never a word of approval for the
risks he took the hardships he en-
dured

  he stopped her tirade with kisses
under the delirium of his infatuation
there still held firm the ingrained loy-
alty of the man for his chosen calling
too long had he been proud to wear
the ranger star too often had he
fought to maintain its integrity to hear
it spoken of slightingly now when
lisas fingers twitched petulantly at
the star he laid his hand over hers and
pulled her fingers gently away vaguely
hurt because she hated his profession
and said so

  its a good old star little girl and
it takes a good man to wear it he told
her lightly kiss me now so i can
go ill be back just as soon as ever i

  she struck the star with her fist i
hate it she cried with the fierceness
of her fathers blood it takes you
away from me always just when i have
almost made up my mind to promise

- she looked up at him tempting

him with her lips and her eyes give
me the star-and ill promise-what
you want me to promise she whis-
pered in his ear standing on her toes
and leaning against him i think that
old tin thing means more to you than
get youcr man	

i do you let it take you away from
me-and there are plenty of others to
go if you didnt give me the star
king-king of my heart she began
fumbling it again tentatively pressing
the pin out of its fastening

  kings hand closed over her fingers
again arrestingly dont do that
sweetheart he muttered reprovingly
impelled by a glimmer of sanity kiss
me now-i must go

  it was just at that moment that cap-
tain oakes opened the door and walked
in his face gray with anger the rea-
son for his being there was simple
enough though kings jaw dropped
with astonishment he had started for
town soon after king had left head-
quarters and his sharp eyes had seen
and recognized kings horse standing
tail to the wind before this place the
rest was inevitable since captain oakes
knew who livedtthere and what errand
it was that took king there

  marshall you neednt trouble to
make that trip to tobin he said
sternly standing just within the room
ranger business is too important to
trust to a lovesick calf like you you
may take your choice here and now
you may resign from the service or i
shall dismiss you he looked at king
with narrowed eyes and added grimly
it will look better for both of us on
the records if you resign

  i reckon i can thank bill gillis for
this king blurted hotly its easy
to guess he told you id be here and
ill sure settle with him he finished
savagely

  marshall you act and talk like a
crazy man i strongly suspect gillis
of straining a point more than once to
shield you if he knows of your fre-
quenting this place he has never hinted
it to me your horse out there is
plain-eriough evidence to any one but
a blind man

   frequenting this place  lisa re-

peated the phrase shrewishly you
talk like this was a-saloon

  id rather find marshall in a saloon
than here id have more hope of
him snapped the captain as though
that placed the limit on his staying
longer in the house he pulled open the
door i shall expect to receive your
written resignation before dark he
said to king so i can enter it on rec-
ord and report a vacancy

  he went out with his neck stiff and
his back very straight-but he rode
back to headquarters without attending
to the errand which had brought him
out in the wind and he rode with his
shoulders drooped and his eyes bent
moodily upon the ground discipline
sometimes is as hard for the master
as it is for the men he commands

  a shock sometimes does more for a
man than months of reasoning king
went to the post office stood before the
ink-spattered desk chose a sputtering
stub pen curled his lip contemptuously
and began to write his resignation from
the texas ranger force two lines
down from the top he stopped and
cursed the pen for dropping a btot
on the words unavoidable circum-
stances that is how he was going to
put it and he hoped that the captain
would get the inner meaning of the
phrase and feel ashamed of his pica-
yunish interpretation of discipline the
captain had known well enough that
king would go to tobin-and bring
back his man or men if it were humanly
possible to do so five minutes to say
good-by to lisa-fiddlesticks  that
wasnt it the captain had it in for him
and took this as an excuse to get rid of
him king understoodthat very well
and without bawling out the captain or
any one elce he meant to word that
resignation so that the captain would
read his real meaning between the
lines

  kicked out of the service-that was
what it practically amounted to a
woman-even the sweetest little girl in
the world he made haste to pay mental
tribute-surely does play hob with a
mans life if she would marry him
hed take her away what did it
amount to after all if she were half
greaser there wasnt a girl in
texas to compare with her in looks

- he was going to say disposition

also but his natural honesty stopped
him her disposition he had to con-
fess was no milder than the chili which
she ground for the frijoles

  king borrowed another sheet of
paper took the other pen off the desk
and started again this time he did
not write unavoidable circumstances
at all and he did not curl his lip in-
stead his eyebrows were pinched to-
gether and his nostrils were white and
when he signed his name at the bottom
the letters were quavery as though an
old man had written them it was a
hard document to write

  at headquarters whither he rode in
haste to present his resignation and
have it over writh before the captain
could accuse him of reluctance he
packed his few belongings presented
his resignation to the captain without
a salute and with no speech on the sub-
ject and left while the captain was still
leaning forward to pick up the letter
from the corner of the desk where king
had dropped it the boys scenting
trouble in his return and guessing
shrewdly what it was tactfully avoided
meeting him king set that down to
ostracism and resented it-just as he
would have resented their friendliness
had they been stupid enough to show
any

  for the first time since she had
smiled invitingly with a droopy-lashed
sidelong glance that tingled his blood
king went without eagerness to see
lisa that evening he was going away
somewhere-anywhere to stay in

ysleta and meet the boys and the curi-
ous looks of the townspeople wras not to
be considered at all not even to be
near lisa would he stay-and that
morning he had believed that no
power on earth was strong enough to
drive him from her

  her viperish denunciation of bill
gillis and captain oakes and the whole
ranger force grated upon him her
arms around his neck were more cling-
ing than sweet and when she wrept
with her face against his breast he
noticed that weeping made her eyelids
red she had wept before now and he
had comforted her without ever seeing
the disfigurement of red lids

  im all outa sorts little girl he
said finally puzzled because her pres-
ence could not soothe his hurt puz-
zled also because his tongue would not
say what he had intended to say to her
would not ask her to marry him on
the morrow and go away with him
somewhere i guess this upheaval has
upset me somehow i hate to inflict
such a mood on you-so ill go and
cuss it off and then well talk things
over good night sweetheart--ill see
you to-morrow early

  she did not want him to go and she
pouted and cried a few more tears but
king went just the same which should
have been more enlightening to him
than it was he did not realize that
lisa was already beginning to lose her
spell over him

  the next day the perverse mood still
held him to a degree he had not slept
at all though he went early to his room
in the little hotel where he had left
his war bag all through the night
memory had ridden him hard trails
he had taken with his fellow rangers-
nights when he had crouched on guard
straining his eyes into the blackness
not daring to move lest some little noise
betray his presence there and bring
a questing bullet that way summer
scenes wherein laughter had mingled
get yoljtr man

 

with the smoke of many cigarettes and
life had seemed clean and good and
worth the living

  king did not know what ailed him
that he must remember all these things
just when he least wanted to recall
them he would rather think of lisa
-but his mind kept drifting away from
her he would picture her in some
desireful pose-and the first he knew
her image would fade like a dissolve
scene in motion pictures and the face
of bill gillis or kent or little charlie
horne would look out at him so he
had lain until daybreak

  he drew his savings from the bank
he even made a purposeless trip to el
paso before he went to see lisa that
is it proved purposeless he went to
buy lisa a ring but he got no farther
with the buying than a half-hearted in-
spection of a jewelers window none
of the rings on display seemed to hit
his fancy so he turned away without
looking farther

  because he had no ring in the last
minutes of good-by when his infatua-
tion flamed up again while he held her
in his arms and muttered promises and
love wrords in her ear king took from
his watch chain the charm he had worn
ever since he joined the service and
pressed it into her little warm palm
for a keepsake it was not of much
value but she had often taken it in her
fingers and admired the queer streak-
ings of red in the dull-green stone in-
closed in a horseshoe band of gold

  when i come back said king
dully ill bring you something else
will you go with me when i come back
after you sweetheart

  when will that be lisa was turn-
ing the trinket in her hand and staring
as she had stared so many times at
the tiny initials k a m which king
had filed in the edge of the horseshoe
band she did not look up at him

  when ive got a place fixed for you
i dont know when that will be but it

will be just as quick as i can make it
im going to leave town to-day i hate
the place

  you hate it-and i will be here all
the while  lisa showed a dimple
you men say the craziest things-

  the gawky half-grown sister inter-
rupted them then and in a few min-
utes king left lisa had not said in
so many words that she would go with
him but at the door as he was leav-
ing she lifted the watch charm to her
lips and looked at him with deep tragic
eyes that last glimpse of her stayed
vividly with king and did a great deal
toward fusing the hot passing emo-
tion he called love into the deep last-
ing attachment which is loves real self

  after that king wandered here and
there for a while he worked for the
tijana china outfit on their beef
round-up thrashed a man who had been
so unwise as to refer banteringly to
king as the famous ex-ranger and
took his saddle and rifle and bedding
roll elsewhere king was extremely
touchy on the subject of texas rang-
ers

  he bought a horse and a burro and
went down into the wilderness of
brewster county wandering alone in
the hills on the pretense that he was
prospecting-not for gold but for a
piece of fertile land where he could
get water on the soil and build a ranch
for lisa and himself he clung with
a persistence that was almost dogged
to the idea of making a home for lisa

  he could have gone back to see
her but the desire for her presence
was not too great to be borne with
fortitude not half as great for in-
stance as the nagging hunger that filled
him for the boys-bill and vaughan
and kent and charlie horne

  he used to sit by his camp fire in
the hills and smoke and stare into the
shadows and relive his days and
nights with them sometimes he
dreamed of lisa but not as often as


the popular magazine

you might think primarily king mar-
shall was a mans man the image of
lisa grew hazy and the thought of her
more a sense of responsibility for her
future than a poignant longing for
her immediate presence whereas the
thought of the boys became a grow-
ing hunger to have speech with them

  when the nights grew frosty he
drifted into chico which is a little
brush town a days ride from the
railroad he had no particular rea-
son for stopping there but he was so
dismally adrift and without any definite
purpose that he stayed

  why dont you buy me out king
so i can quit this dang place  the dis-
satisfied owner of the one little livery
stable suggested to him one day when
king was sunning himself apathetically
on the bench by the stable door with-
out consciously deciding to change his
name he had given it as king when
he arrived and let the marshall slide
into oblivion

  what you got against me mur-
phy king retorted grinning

  not a thing you could have worse
things wished on yuh than this here
livery business aint nothing the mat-
ter with it-not a thing but i dont
want it no longer i want to go to
californy and live murphy nursed
his knees and stared down the street
as far as the first crook td sell it
cheap he added wistfully

  how cheap-just as she stands
it occurred to king that lisa being
half mexican would probably not ob-
ject to chico but he had no great en-
thusiasm for the idea-or for anything
else for that matter

  just as she stands king ill put
on my coat and walk out uh here fer
four himdred and fifty dollars and i
own -the stable and the house and
ground as far back as the crick you
know the horses ive got-nothin
fancy but they make me a livin-the

burros and the rigs ill make yuh a
present of four hundred and fifty
cash-thats how bati i want to leave

  a gift almost king said he would
take it he would have fifty dollars
or so left-enough to send for lisa
and the stable was earning a little
money every day in the year the
stage that came three times a week
from the railroad kept a team here
always which was a steady income
even though it was small king paid
murphy the money that day and that
is how he came to settle down in
chico

  it was on the very next mail day
when the little store post office was
crowded that king received his sec-
ond shock he had a letter from lisa
-forwarded from marfa where she
had written her last a tender mis-
spelled affair with six crosses after her
name to signify that she sent him six
kisses kings heart warmed toward
her when he read the letter and he
made up his mind that he would send
a letter back on the stage next day
with fifty dollars for her fare and ask
her to come at once and take charge of
the tidy little place which murphys
wife was leaving so eagerly

  beside him a big fat-cheeked mexi-
can was reading a letter avidly with
little exclamations of delight now and
then king glanced at him carelessly
and caught the ysleta postmark on the
envelope which the mexican-one
pancho mazon-held face out in one
hand while he read his letter king
glanced again to make sure for the
envelope looked very much like the one
he had stuffed in his own pocket just
then pancho looked up showing his
teeth in a broad smile

  look fellows-what i gets for
my birthday he cried jubilantly my
little sweetheart she sends he held
up the gift for all to see-he seemed
a jovial fellow who must share his joys
and his griefs with all his world
get your man



  king looked and chilled with the
curious sensation that comes when one
has felt the treachery of a friend

  a watch charm with a quaintly
marked cornelian set in a horseshoe
band of plain gold-he knew it as he
knew the look of his two hands he
knew-and yet he reached out and took
the dangling trinket from the amazed
pancho turned it over and saw the
tiny initials he had painstakingly filed
there during one bored afternoon when
he had been left in charge of the
ranger office

  he laughed-because there seemed
nothing in the world to say-gave the
charm back to pancho and walked out
tearing lisas letter into little bits and
scattering the pieces for the wind to
play with by sheer coincidence he
unconsciously quoted bill gillis in the
only sentence he spoke the lyin
little hussy  he said and that was all

  he went back to his livery stable
he took a basin and a sponge and
began bathing the saddle galls on one
of his horses and whenever he thought
of lisa gonzales and her six cross
kisses at the bottom of the letter she
had written him he called her the name
he had called her before-the name
bill gillis had called her he tried not
to think of her however and after a
while he succeeded

  but there he was settled in chico-
which he did not like as a town-with
a livery stable he did not want on his
hands  had he been free of it he
would have drifted god knows where
but he was not free no one else
seemed to hanker for the livery busi-
ness especially now that winter was
with them

  one day in late spring the stage
came in from the railroad loaded with
passengers and camp outfit and
stopped at kings stable to dump three
sacked saddles off there king was

used to that sort of thing and he did
not leave his work in the dim-lighted
stall at the far end when he heard the
arrival in front juan his stableboy
was out there and would see to things
and if any one wanted the boss why
juan had but to lift his voice a little
king had fallen into a passive kind
of devotion to his horses and in the
same ratio he had come to feel no in-
terest whatever in men if a man came
to hire a horse king would look at
him make a swift appraisement and
choose the horse according to his
opinion of the man beyond that and
collecting payment his interest did not
g

  juan did not call him so king went
on trimming the mane of a horse he
had just bought even when he heard
footsteps coming down the stable he
did not leave the stall to see who was
coming-because no inkling of the
immediate future did fate permit him

  hes back somewhere-i dunno 
you will find all righ he heard
juans voice announcing cheerfully near
the door

  king frowned a little and moved
down to the horses rump-saw who
was coming and retreated precipitately
into the shadow he was not quite
quick enough for bill gillis coming
toward him glimpsed his face and his
hat above it and knew him at the first
glance bill dove into the stall and
grabbed king by the shoulders and
shook him a little and laughed

  dog-gone you king im so tickled
i cant say howdy  bill said and
laughed again i kinda wondered if
the king that owns this stable was you
-dont know what gave me the notion
but i just naturally had to hunt you up
to make sure how are yuh anyway
darn it are yuh dumb

  just about king confessed in a
queer shaky voice and bit his under
lip sharply he laid one arm over
bills shoulder and looked out over his


the populjr mjgjzinb

head and winked very fast for a ruin-
ate

  you popped in on me kinda sud-
den bill he remarked when he was
sure of his voice give a feller time
to get used to the notion his hand
tightened on bills shoulder and he
pushed him back a little and looked
down at him avidly you blamed
little sawed-off runt i sure am glad
to see yuh he added in the tone that
bill knew of old down here alone

  captain and vaughan are here
bill said still grinning for the simple
reason that his face refused to do any-
thing else just then we came down
to ride the big pastures-and i guess
i might as well start pickin out the
horses well want from you king

  fly at it king agreed absently try-
ing to adjust himself to this unexpected
turn trying also to decide whether he
really was glad or sorry to have bill
there for sometimes it is better not to
have a happier past recalled ive got
some good ones bill-and youre dead
welcome to the best i got

  bill covertly eyed king while he
chose what horses they would need
and told as much of the ysleta news
as was tactful he did not for in-
stance say anything about lisa gon-
zales marrying a mexican-one pancho
mazon who had started a new cantina
that had already acquired a reputation
of its own he thought of it and won-
dered how king would take the news
if he were to tell him

  king stood in the wide doorway
with his hands in his pockets and
watched bill go off up the street in
search of the captain and vaughan
lie watched bill and his eyes were
wistful and his mouth had a twist of
bitterness he saw the captain broad-
shouldered straight and purposeful in
his movements come out of the post
office with vaughan at his heels he
saw bill hurrying to meet them-and
king turned back into the stable and

took down his saddle from its rusty
spike

  clean up mouse and faro and come
again he called to juan and clean
em good or ill just about break yuh
in two theyre for them three that
come in on the stage he slapped the
saddle on his big black noches cinched
it hurriedly and dropped the stirrups
into place if anybody asks for me
he told juan as he led the horse to the
doorway just say ill be back muy
pronto

  it would have been unjust to accuse
king of running away from the
rangers as a matter of fact he was
attempting something a great deal more
foolish than that for he was trying to
run away from himself he rode out
into the hills until they were piled high
all around him and then he let the
reins lie loose on noches neck and
wandered aimlessly not caring where
the horse took him so he headed into
further wildness

  he returned after dark and his black
horse showed dust-colored streaks
where the sweat had dried on his hips
and legs and his neck shone wet to
show that his homeward pace had not
been slow supper time was past but
king waved juans solicitious anxiety
to help and himself rubbed down
noches and loosened the hay in his
manger and kicked the bedding into a
softer pile

  the little man who had come on the
stage juan informed king deprecat-
ingly had come with two others and
asked for king they had waited a
little and gone off to their camping
place by the high bank next the arroyo
where was the little spring at sun-
down the little man had come again
and had waited on the bench he had
gone not ten minutes ago he left
word that the three horses be brought
to their camp at sunrise

  all right you go to bed ill lock
up king told him shortly and stood
get your man



in the doorway rolling a cigarette
while he watched juan disappear up
the crooked street that lay quiet and
dark under the starlight he sat down
on the bench and stared t the bluffs
beyond the town after a while he
got up and went to the corner of the
stable nearest the arroyo and stood
there leaning one shoulder against the
adobe wall while he stared hard at the
glow on the opposite bank from a camp
fire in his eyes there was again a
great hunger and his lips had a twist
of bitterness

  he walked slowly down toward the
glow when he was close enough to
see the little licking flames and could
hear the cheerful snapping he stopped
and stood hesitating over whether he
should go on forms in the firelight
he did not see-since this was a
ranger camp and since rangers are
rather particular about revealing them-
selves unnecessarily in the light of their
camp fires he waited for a minute
and went back and sat hunched together
on the bench beside the stable door

  he was very quiet and very very
bitter toward life

  when juan came swiftly down the
street just before daylight to feed the
horses that were ordered for sunrise
he found them munching contentedly
heads buried to the eyes in fresh piles
of secate also they were sleek from
long brushing and king was settling
the saddle of captain oakes upon the
back of come again the best horse in
the stable barring kings own private
horse noches whereupon juan im-
mediately became abjectly apologetic
for being so late-though he really had
come early

  when king himself led the horses
out and swung into vaughans saddle
with the lead ropes of the other two
in his hand juan felt that he trembled
-literally-upon the brink of dis-
missal senor king must be very mad
indeed when he would not let juan

take the horses to camp he looked
after king and got no encouragement
from the gloomy face of his master
something was very wrong-and yet in
his heart juan knew that he had come
early enough

  king rode slowly down the arroyo
to where the rangers had made camp
every step that the horses took king
cursed himself for coming yet his
eyes went searching eagerly for the
camp and for sight of the men who had
for three years and more been his close
comrades when he saw them how-
ever he sat a little stiffer in the saddle
and when he reached their breakfast
fire and dismounted just outside its
zone of heat his manner was carefully
neutral as though he were delivering
the horses to strangers bill was down
at the little stream

  why hello king vaughan hur-
ried forward and took his hand and
pumped it up and down you old
sun of a gun youre lookin fine
howdy kiug the captain greeted
him easily-with a warmth in his man-
ner that king had never expected to see
again good horses youve brought
us he added while he shook hands
his keen little eyes taking in line by
line the trimness of the mount king
had chosen for his use you havent
forgotten my fancy for a long-legged
animal under me i see i rode a burro
once for two hundred miles-since then
i want to know that mv feet arent
going to drag on the ground every time
i straighten my legs

  hes a good horse king said
simply turning to pat the hard-muscled
neck and to hide a sudden mistiness
in his eyes hell carry you all day
and all night and then some ive
named him come again after youve
rode him youll know why

  whats the pedigree uh that there
critter under my saddle vaughan
looked up from the skillet of sputtering
eggs to demand whats his name


the popular magazine

  him  faro-and you dont go up
against any brace game when you crawl
in his middle either king had him-
self in hand now and he faced
vaughan with a smile that reached his
e-yes hes a right true little caballo
-and hes a cat for climbing if you
want to know hell take yuh any-
where you point him vaughan bill
picked em out of a dozen or so ive got
down there

  the captain rubbing the nose of
come again gave king a keen glance
so youve branched out into the livery
business he remarked doing pretty
well casual as the question was on
its surface king felt an underlying
anxiety for his welfare knew too that
vaughan had looked up and was wait-
ing for the answer

   oh-all right i guess he said in-
differently making money far as
that goes

  then bill came and slapped king on
the back just as he used to do in the
old days king stayed and ate break-
fast with them and was afterward sur-
prised to remember how matter of
course it had seemed

  having lived for several months in
that part of the country and being en-
gaged in a business that brought him
into contact with the riders thereof
king knew a good deal about the fence
troubles and the gossip of altered
brands and the like what he knew he
told them freely just as though it was
his business to help them he advised
them as to short cuts through the hills
and he offered to keep an eye on the
camp while the three were out riding

   juan was astonished to hear his mas-
ter come whistling back to the stable
that morning

  the cheerfulness however fluctu-
ated a good deal in the next three days
mixed with kings pleasure in renew-
ing old friendships was the bitterness
of knowing that he was after all an
outsider that when the captain assigned

certain tasks to his men he must sit
apart and never be ordered anywhere
because he had forfeited his right to
wear the ranger star he did not feel
like whistling when that fact was
forced coldly in upon his conscious-
ness

  then one evening come again came
hobbling painfully to the stable with
captain oakes riding slack in the sad-
dle hurt so badly that king had to
steady hint to the bench besicle the
stable door juan produced a bottle of
whisky from somewhere and with the
temporary strength lent by a swallow
or two the captain got to his camp bed
and let king bathe his bruised leg and
the strained tendons of his knee and
afterward make him a comforting cup
of coffee

  accident had befallen come again
the best rope horse in that part of
the country thfe captain had wanted
to inspect more closely a doubtful
brand on a particularly wild steer and
had roped it but the ground was
broken into treacherous small ridges
and water-deepened ruts and when the
steer bolted around come again the
horse was jerked backward into a
ditch and thrown and the captain had
not been able to jump free because of
the rope the wonder was he ad-
mitted to king that neither had broken
a bone or two

  the next day king spent with the
captain leaving juan to tend the stable
and doctor come again that is why
king was in camp when a mexican
brought captain oakes a message
which had been sent from el paso and
was permitted by fate to have another
chance at the thing he wanted most in
his life

s in effect the telegram said that one
bull dawson who had been an outlaw
so long that he had almost become an
institution in southwestern texas had
murdered and robbed two men under
peculiarly brutal circumstances-even
get your man



for bull dawson he was somewhere
in brewster county according to last
reports and while a sheriff and posse
were scouring the northern part the
rangers were asked to head him off if
he got as far down as the hills around
chico

  i dont see how we can do anything
about it captain oakes grumbled
handing the telegram to king-so
nearly had the gap between them been
bridged i cant call gillis and
vaughan off their work and i cant go
out after him myself crippled like this
bulls the kind of man it takes a gatlin
gun to make any impression on hes
been shot so often he dont think any-
thing of a bullet or two under his skin

  king flicked the ashes thoughtfully
off his cigarette what kinda lookin
fellow is he  he wanted to know he
had heard of bull dawson often
enough but always in a general way-
the name standing for the ultimate
depths of depravity and the ultimate
heights of strength and ferocity and
animal cunning

  big-over six foot wreighs about
two hundred hes a fighter of course
-but hed just as soon shoot a man in
the back had a black beard last time
his description came in to the office
and hair streaked with gray eyes are
black too-the snaky kind

  king got up and stood looking across
the arroyo his fingers kept flicking
absently at the end of his cigarette
which was cold by now i-if youd
let me do it id like to go after him
he said while the red rose steadily from
his collar to the hair line on his fore-
head uh course if yuh dont feel
like-

  the captain gave a grunt and heaved
himself stiffly up on his good leg
steadying himself against a rock he
looked at king a minute

  marshall i was pretty hard on you
last fall he said you made a fool
of yourself-but i wfas pretty hard on

you if you really want to take this
special job-

  want to kings voice shook a
little you know well enough-you
know id give anything ive got in the
world to wipe out last fall and be back
in the service

  the captain cleared his throat if
you feel that way about it marshall
heres your chance there happens to
be a vacancy right now barrett re-
signed ill swear you in for special
duty to go after bull dawson heres
my star-ill lend it to you for the trip
and marshall if you get your man
you can keep that star ill reenlist
you to fill barrets place hold up your
right hand

  trembling a little king raised his
hand and took the oath he drew a
long breath when his hand dropped
slowly from pinning the star on the lin-
ing of his coat

  ill send juan up to look after you
he said hes a good boy and you
can trust him as far as you would any
outsider im going to get out on the
trail and captain-im going to get
him

iv

  once last fall when king was riding
through the country half-heartedly
looking for a likable location for a
ranch he had come upon a place that
looked very much like a permanent
camp a deep hidden depression in a
sandstone ledge where the sun shone
in during the morning had been fitted
up with a crude stove made of rocks
and a flattened coal-oil can for a top
in a dark corner a small roll of blan-
kets was suspended from the roof with
a piece of wire and beside it hung a
bag with brown beans and a square of
salt pork and a little corn meal

  there wtere no signs however of re-
cent occupation it may have been a
month or two perhaps longer since the
cave had been used but there was dry


the popular magazine

wood piled in a corner where beating
storms never reached and king judged
that whoever had camped there meant
at some time to return and had pro-
vided food and fire and a bed for him-
self when he did come

  now as it happened while he had
been riding at random through the
hills trying to fight off the black mood
of vain regrets which the sight of bill
gillis had brought him he had met
just before dusk a horseman riding on
a narrow trail which led farther into
the hills  a man bigger than the average
judging by the length of his stirrups
and the breadth of his shoulders a
man with a black stubble of a beard
that had lately been cut short and after-
ward neglected and with little black
eyes of the kind called snaky king
had turned out to let the man pass
and had nodded to him in the cursory
greeting which men of the open give
each passing stranger the man had
nodded in reply and had ridden on-
but king having the trick of seeing
things behind him without turning his
head caught the stranger watching him
with his head turned over his shoulder

  now however his ranger training
carried his mind to those two isolated
incidents-impelled perhaps by the
captains description of bull dawson
the man he had met that night might
not be dawson and he might not have
been on his way to that snug little
camp hidden away under the sandstone
ledge but there was no reason why it
could not have been he the descrip-
tion tallied well enough and the man
had certainly been traveling into the
hills in the direction of that camp al-
though it is true that he was a days
ride away from it he had been
traveling light with just a blanket roll
and a slicker tied behind the saddle
which proved that he must have grub
within riding distance

  king considered his guess as good as
any he could make and he took a blan-

ket and his rifle and a little flour and
bacon and coffee and ground feed for
his horse and started out with noches
he knew the country and he rode
straight toward the camp under the
ledge ten miles out he camped until
morning he meant to ride by day-
light so that he could pick up the trail
of the man he believed was bull daw-
son

  he was so confident of finding the
cave camp occupied that he left noches
hidden in a thicket at dusk and trav-
eled the last two miles on foot bull
dawson was noted for his animal-
like cunning and like an animal king
hunted him he did not approach the
place by the most direct route up the
canon that held it instead he climbed
the ridge at the canons mouth and
followed the top until he knew he must
be above the place where the camp lay
he had noticed last fall that just be-
yond the camp the ledge ended in a
bank of earth scattered over with
scrubby little bushes such as make shift
somehow to live in barren soil and by
the light of the stars he watched for
the upper rim of that bank

  he found it without much trouble
and pushing his six-shooter forward
so that his hand could drop to it easily
he began to climb down slowly bush
by bush feeling with his feet for soft
soil that would take his weight with-
out sound bull dawson if he were
in camp would watch the canon the
bluff above him must give forth some
sound of footsteps some sign of move-
ment before it would draw his atten-
tion from the easier approach below
so king reasoned and took his time

  it took him a long time but he
reached the base where the bank joined
the wide shelf at the bottom of the
ledge and he had not made a sound
that could have been heard above the
faint rustling of the little night breeze
that brushed the canon sides nor had
he heard a sound under the ledge he
get your min



sniffed the air for the smell of smoke
but the wind was in the wrong direc-
tion and he could not tell he felt
in his coat pocket for the handcuffs
the captain had given him so that
there should be no slip-up if his man
was there bull dawson meant so much
to him that king stood there and
thought of every little contingency as
an anxious unaccustomed traveler feels
for ticket and baggage checks purse
and parcels

  like a cougar stalking a deer he
crept inch by inch along the ledge to
where the cavelike opening showed
black at the rim his hand was grip-
ping his six-shooter now he did not
mean to take any chances at all he
reached the opening and stopped there
peering into the blackness it was like
looking into a great blot of ink-he
might as well have shut his eyes for all
he could see but that instinct we can-
not name told him that something was
in there something alive be it man
or beast he strained his ears-and it
may have been breathing that he heard
or it may have been a throbbing of the
blood in his own veins

  he drew back his head fearing that
he might be seen against the clear star-
light and at that instant a gun roared
deafeningly king remembered after-
ward that he had felt the bullet fan
his face as it hurtled past at that mo-
ment however he was grappling and
fighting a huge body that launched it-
self full at him from the black cave
mouth and trying to keep big hard-
knuckled fingers from gripping his
throat

  like two great dogs they fought and
rolled before the cave they did not
speak--they needed their breath for
something more vital than words
there was no question of motive or
object each man fought for something
precious-for one man fought for his
life and the other fought for what made
life worth while

  gripping and twisting bodies and in-
terlocked legs they toppled over the
edge of the shelf and began to roll and
slide down the steep slope to the bot-
tom of the canon as they went king
heard something clink in his pocket
and set his mind and all his energy
toward accomplishing one certain thing
just one thing-let him do that one
thing

  they landed with a jolt and by the
mercy of fate it was king who lay
for one stunned minute on top one
arm his left one was pinned under the
man but his right arm was free he
slipped his hand into his pocket as in-
stinctively as one raises an elbow to
ward off a blow and got the handcuffs
the man beneath him heaved himself
up but king caught his right arm and
snapped on one iron jerked his own
left arm from under the man and
ironed that one also

  the man sat up dazedly and stared
down at their two arms locked together
with steel bands that shone bright in
the starlight king was feeling the
others body with quick practiced
movements for weapons a knife he
found and sent spinning away among
the bushes a six-shooter hidden in-
side the fellows shirt he sent after the
knife the other one that had been
fired at king from the cave mouth was
back there somewhere on the shelf

  get up bull dawson king com-
manded with an exultant note in his
voice im a ranger-and you know
the rest

  youre a - several things

which were the worst he could think of
the prisoner spat out venomously

  its a long way to camp bull king
remarked cheerfully we better be
starting-cause well have to walk

  i got a horse bull whined as he
stumbled along that damn fall hurt
my leg whynt you iron both my
hands an let me ride i aint able
to walk-what yuh fraid of


the populzr magazine

  what king was afraid of he kept
to himself he was hurt-he thought
he must have broken a rib or two
there was a salty taste in his mouth
that he knew for blood and when he
turned his head there was a grinding
pain at the top of his shoulder but
he had his man-had him fast to him
so that where one went the other must
go the tug at his wrist whenever bull
dawson stumbled sent a thrill over
king keen as a pain and delicious as the
kiss of a loved woman

  afraid why bull i just want to
walk with yuh thats all we can stroll

along comfortable enough-

  bull dawson whirled suddenly his
left hand doubled to a fist and shoot-
ing out to get king under the ear king
ducked his head forward and saw stars
with the blow that glanced off his skull
he poked the barrel of his six-shooter
into bulls side suggestively and bull
wilted into meek plodding again

  i thought youd try that bull-but
it wont work now let this sink into
your mind every low-down trick you
think of ive thought of it first and
theres another ttiing i dont believe has
come into your mind yet so im going
to plant it there if you try any of the
tricks you think of im going to shoot
your left wrist so ill break both bones
figure for yourself how dangerous
youll be then

  in the dark bull dawson gulped and
turned a sallow shade you wouldnt
do a thing like that  he protested
nervously why-why that would be
plain brutal why i wouldnt do a

thing like-

  king laughed all the difference
between us is youd do it first if you
could before i had a chance to try any-
thing or maybe youd do worse ill
give you a chance to come along like
a white man 

  bull walked along for a time and
said nothing he did not attempt any
further treachery-indeed he seemed

inclined to steady king over rough
places and to lend the help of his
greater strength he seemed to take
kings statement as truth beyond argu-
ment king walked steadily but the pain
in his side grew worse he no longer
had the salty taste in his mouth how-
ever and he took courage from that
but his neck was getting stiff and sore
-terribly stiff and sore he could not
take a long breath at all and resorted
to a quick shallow breathing to supply
his lungs with air

  they came to where noches was tied
and king compelled bull dawson to
slip the bridle off the horse and hang
it on the saddle horn he was tempted
to cuff dawsons two hands together
and make him walk ahead while king
rode behind that would be safe enough
ordinarily but king was afraid of
that pain in his side that grew con-
stantly a little worse what if he could
not bear the jolt of riding what if
he should faint

  noches free to go where he would
chose to follow docilely at his masters
heels until king drove him ahead and
urged him wtith his voice to a shuffling
trot and the two men walking side
by side when the trail was wide enough
king an awkward step behind when
they could not go abreast plodded on
through the night

  when daylight came king left the
trail and struck off on a short cut that
was not quite passable for a horse be-
cause of one ledge along a canon wall
a man going carefully afoot could
negotiate it safely enough and thereby
save several miles of travel king fig-
ured that if he took that short cuft they
might with steady walking reach
chico by sundown

  were coming to a kinda ticklish
spot bull he announced when they
entered the canon youre remember-
ing what i said when we started out
i hope and youll watch where you
set your feet i hope guns dont make
get your man



you nervous buil-youre going to
travel quite a piece now with mine cud-
dlin your ribs

  aw cant ye see i aint goin
to try -nothin bull expostulated
grievedly i was mad when i started

out- i hit out without thinkin

but i aint a fool youve got me and
i know it and he finished virtu-
ously whatever else they tell on me
they cant say t bull dawson caint
take his medicine

  fine king approved colorlessly
and pushed bull out along the ledge
im sure glad i can-trust you bull
midway across where they had a
jagged-edged shelf of a rock a foot
wide to walk on king stumbled a
dizziness had caught him unawares
when he glanced down at the thread
of water in the arroyo below bull
looking over his shoulder stopped and
eyed king intently

  sick aint yuh he asked in what
he meant to be a sympathetic tone
this heres a little too much for ye

mebby jest-

  remember what i said about your
left wrist bull king pulled himself
together and looked back steadily into
bulls wolfishly greedy eyes

  bull grunted and went on stepping
carefully king with his lips pressed
tightly together edged carefully after

  when they reached safer footing-a
loose sandy slope that led down to a
wider gulch where they could walk
side by side king stopped suddenly
and looked back at the ledge and down
away down to the thread of water they
could not reach by any means at hand
he grinned a little and with a flip of
an outward heave he sent his gun spin-
ning down the cliff the effort made
him catch his breath sharply

  i-dont need the darn thing he
said with another little gasp i can
trust you

  bull dawson smiled a great gashlike
smile that parted his black stubble of

beard unpleasantly why shore you
kin trust me he cried eagerly
thats what i bin tellin ye all along
shore ye kin

  over she goes king said cheer-
fully-too cheerfully arid flung his
arm outward again melodramatically
didnt need the darned thing-just so
much weight to pack i know i can
bank on you

  shore ye kin say what they will
they caint say bull dawson aint t be
trusted his tone was fawningly
friendly

  come on said king well pike
along and get this over with

  shore git it over with is what

i	says bull smiled again and then
fell silent

  down that steep bluff they went bull
dawson limping a little king with his
lips shut tight and taking little quick
breaths through his nose instead of
turning his head now he rolled his
eyes when he wranted to look sidewise
and the pain in his side was a consum-
ing fire that burned and licked along
the nerves to his shoulder and down
to his thigh

  they went down that gulch turned
into another and followed that also
they came to a tiny stream of tepid
water and the two knelt together and
drank scooping up the water in their
free hands-king with his right hand
bull with his left they -laved their
bruised faces they sopped water on
their hair because the sun was hot and
high above them but they did not talk
much

  when king gave the signal to rise
bull lurched heavily against him and
bore him to the ground his little
snaky eyes sought here and there while
his body pinned king down helpless
he leaned and picked up a rock that
was all his left hand could lift and
poised it grinning venomously over
kings head

  im goin to smash your brains out


the popular magazine

he stated gleefully i guess you wisht
now youd broke my wrist fore i
thought uh this here little trick hey
king looked up at him grinning sar-
donically i thought youd try it he
said speaking jerkily because of the
pain in his side thats why i throwed
the handcuff key after my six-gun go
ahead-youll sure have one sweet time
of it-shackled to a dead man

  bulls jaw dropped also he low-
ered the rock to the ground though he
kept his hand upon it

  you lie he screamed you
never throwed away the key  you lie 
you never throwed it away

  i did too i knew youd try some-
thing like this and i blocked your play
five miles back you better be sure of
that key bull before you go caving
my head in 

  bull looked swearing horribly while
he turned kings pockets wrongside
out hunting in every crease and every
wrinkle of kings clothing he sat
back on his haunches finally and stared
at king like a beaten animal in a cage
-snarling lustful to kill but shaking
with fear

  ironed to a dead man keep that
in your mind bull when you want to
try something else and theres no
grub in camp remember and no gun
and no knife-nothing you swine but
our two legs to get us out of here and
if you dont help me get out youre
here to stay-with a dead man hobbled
to you help me up bull my sides
a fright and weve got to get to chico
to-night

   bull called down curses to wither the
earth with their blasphemy had they
carried farther than his bellowing voice
tears of rage rolled down his lined
grimy cheeks into the stubble of his
beard he raised the rock again
quailed before that mirthless grin on
the lips of king marshall and threw
the rock as far away as his strength

would send it with his free hand he
worried kings boots off his feet think
ing the key might have been hidden
there he searched kings pockets
again he tugged and pulled and
twisted at kings wrist trying to free
it of the steel band that held those two
together

  king fainted with the pain of that
last performance he looked so like
a dead man lying there that bull daw-
son was scared into acceptance of his
defeat without food or weapons
there in the wilderness shackled to a
dead man-bull dawson was baffled
beaten to a stark terror lest his anger
had brought upon him that horrid fate
which king had named

  he scooped up water and bathed
kings face watching anxiously for
some sign of returning life he eased
the strained wrist as much as he could
and when king finally opened his eyes
bull dawson shielded him with his own
big body from the glare of the sun until
king was able to stagger to his feet
and go on

  at dusk that night just when the
firelight was beginning to cast a danc-
ing glow upon the bank beyond the
spring these two staggered into the
ranger camp kings face was like a
dead man except that all his intrepid
soul looked dauntlessly out from his
hollow eyes he moved slowly helped
along by bull dawson who limped and
gazed furtively this way and that as
he came

  what the devil-marshall is that
you captain oakes for once in his
life was startled out of his self-con-
tained dignity

  kings knees bent under him and he
sagged down to the ground just as his
hand went weakly up to salute his
lips stretched in a grin that was star-
tling in that drawn face of his

  captain-i-got my man  he said
and fainted
i ots of nonsense is circulated in this
world as real information because
no one takes the trouble to think seri-
ously about it or deny it one of the
fool remarks especially irritating to us
is the one to the effect that if you want
to really get people interested you must
tell them a simple love story we could
easily fill these pages with proofs to the
opposite we have read hundreds of
love stories and the only ones that have
ever stuck in our memories have been
those that had a whole lot to them be-
sides plain and simple love so far as
the great masterpieces have been con-
cerned from shakespeare to stevenson
the stories have been interesting for
something beside the love story we
suppose the best love story in the world
is that of romeo and juliet but what
would the play be without the gallant
and whimsical mercutio who is not in
love at all and who is twice the man
that romeo is the next most power-
ful love story is perhaps that mystical
and sinister celtic tragedy that wagner
chose for the framework of his tristan
and isolde-and if you were to take the
music away from his drama we doubt if
many would go to see it

a a

 s a matter of fact falling in love is
only a part of a mans life byron
informs us that  tis womans whole
existence but if he had met some of
the women in the united states he might
have modified his opinion if a mans
love affair is not complicated with a lot
of other things it is likely to be too
sweet for average consumption it is
because of this that we have never
leaned very heavily toward love stories

some writers however have the ability
to give the love affair its proper propor-
tion to make it interesting in a mascu-
line rather than a mawkish sense and to
make us see the womans side of it as
well

a 

the particular writer we are think-
ing of now is bertrand w sin-
clair you remember north of fifty-
three and the rest of the story
and that other great novel of his we
published last spring the way of the
north they all had real live men in
them and what is more they had real
live women they are all considerably
wider in scope than mere stories of ad-
venture as solomon remarked the
way of a man with a maid is a curious
thing so is the way of a maid with a
man sinclairs latest novel is called
landlubbers luck it will appear
complete in the issue of the popular
out two weeks from to-day it isnt a
love story at all but there is a love story
in it it is a big stirring tale of the
halibut fisheries it is a story of big
business as well as of physical adven-
ture furthermore it is the story of a
girl who on account of her family mar-
ried the wrong man and afterward lost
herself from the world that knew her
there is real outdoor excitement in it
and the bracing tale of a man who works
his way up from nothing to a fortune
running parallel with his story is that
of the girl who has own her own trou-
bles her own adventures her own
achievement as a breadwinner if you
were to classify this story you would
undoubtedly say that it was a mans
story at the same time if you happen
  a chat with you-continued

to know any woman who wonders why
you are so attached to the popular
and says that she cannot get interested
in stories of adventure get her to read
landlubbers luck shell understand
after that

a a

opeakixg of women we also want
to call your attention to the girl in
rimrock jones by dane coolidge
you have read the first installment by
this time but as yet you can have
formed no idea of what a broad and
human story it is rimrock himself is
worth a whole book as an example of a
stubborn masterful thoroughly mascu-
line human but the girl is just as much
a character in her own way too many
writers of tales of action and adventure
have failed in their delineation of women
beautiful dolls with no savor of human-
ity mince through the pages of many a
book otherwise good the girl rimrock
is interested in is just as real and vital
and unexpected in her way as rimrock
himself she has a will of her own and
the conflict of the two wiils is so fas-
cinating and powerful a drama that the
story will be remembered for a long
time and ultimately win a place as one
of the biggest novels of the year youll
hear plenty of people talking about it
later on when it comes out in book
form you are just so much ahead in
getting it now

a a

there are two other western sto-
ries in the next issue of the popu-
lar one is called vanity of men
and is by j frank davis who wrote
garland ranger service and of
wrhom you will hear a great deal in the
future the other is a short complete
novel called the killer and is the
work of b m bower and buck connor
b m bower needs no introduction
buck connor is however a less familiar

name to the readers of this magazine
although it is well enough known in
texas he is a texas ranger now act-
ing under the direct personal advice of
general scott himself from his old
captain hughes of the rangers he has
already secured material that no other
writer could possibly have access to in
the guise of popular fiction you have
already learned a lot of true things
about the northwest mounted police
the texas rangers are a body of men
of the same stamp the history of the
organization is every bit as thrilling and
interesting but until we started giving it
space in the popular very few knew
anything about it this magazine is the
first that ever published real baseball
stories taken from the life of the big
league it was first in the field with
stories of the northwest it is now do-
ing the same thing with the southwest
you can read stories elsewhere purport-
ing to give the real life and atmosphere
of the rangers but we doubt if any
magazine save this can give you the real
thing the killer is really a wonder-
ful story taken from life itself grim
holding and tense in its atmosphere
we call special attention to it as an evi-
dence that the magazine is still grow-
ing and striking into new and untrodden
fields for its fiction

a a

preside these things there is a sea
story by stacpoole a detective
story by ritchie a funny fight story by
witwer and a tale of the northwest by
hendryx in the next issue of the maga-
zine there is also a football story by
williams and a moving-picture story by
ullman there is a story of the u s
army by captain evans who knows
what he is writing about-and this is by
no means all if there is any choice be-
tween this number and the next-the
next is a little better

jvening dress may be termed the
civilians uniform since its cut is
military in inspiration and some of its
details as the stripe on trousers are
borrowed from the kit of the soldier

  in its cyclic swing from the knee
breeches and buckled slippers of the
bygone beau evening dress has never
been so bereft of the ghost of a thrill
as this year theres hardly even a
new sugar coating to the old pills

  a very smart fashion here though
it is two years old abroad is an evening
topcoat of bright navy blue with a
black velvet collar it is slightly drawn
in at the waistline and has free-drap-
ing skirts that ripple around the edges

  this coat worn by a distinguished
foreigner has been widely copied but
its characteristic cut seems to be mas-
tered by only a handful of tailors

  the knitted-silk evening waistcoat
will come as a surprise to many but
this too is an oft-told tale abroad
the mesh is just like that of a muffler
a fine soft figure-flexing fabric which
is far lighter than woven materials

  the evening inverness or cape over-
coat is the last cry and all that sort
of thing but it takes the irreproachably
turned-out man to carry it off height

this department about any problem of dress
provided that a stamped self-addressed

figure air and that sixth-sense gift of
smartness which cant be put into
print are the things that count

  one meets many types of the in-
verness coat this season a totally new
one is the alf-and-alf coat with the
cape extending from the back seam to
the front you have the conventional
cape front together with a straight
loose box back

  alike at the metropolitan new
york and covent garden london the
inverness is now accepted by fashion-
ables as the preferred evening coat
for occasion it is both the young-
sters and an oldsters coat befitting
each if he have the spare tallish well-
set-up figure to go writh it

  another smart coat for evening wear
this season is the paletot or frock
overcoat having skirts split from the
waist down however the black or
dark-gray chesterfield coat with a vel-
vet collar is just as proper and not so
extreme

  in dress as in all the fine arts its
the little mind that scorns the little
things you can toss a biscuit across
the narrow gap that divides the thor-
oughbred from the underbred

 neolin comforts
 neolin lasts

   child aliie of mans imagination
 and of his synthetic genius - neolin
 today is acclaimed hy the modem man
 for the modern achievement which it is
 born but a year ago its coming marked
 the decline of the leather sole

 for neolin-the natural tread-is as
 superior to leather as is electricity to
 gas neolin is better in every way that
 sole-leather is good and good when
 sole-leather is not neolin costs far
 less than leather because it wears far
 longer and saves not shoe-bills alone
 but doctors bills as well

   indeed hundreds of thousands are
 grateful to neolin for its absolute water-
 tight tread and for the foot-muscles it de-
 velops through neolin flexibility and
 neolin looks as good as it feels it
 comes in one certain dependable grade
 - goodyear grade - indicated by the
 mark neolin mark that mark -
 stamp it on your memory dealers or
 shoe-repairters have neolin - or can
 get it at no added cost to you
