chapter i-the incurables of ceres

atimer stumbled
 heavily and fell from
 the ramp to the
 frozen rocks his
 hand went automati-
 cally to his belt but
 the spacesuit he was
 wearing had no belt

neither had it the holster and the pis-
tol that for so long had seemed part
of himself weaponless latimer lay
where he had fallen snarled wordless-
ly at the guard whose farewell shove
had caused him to lose his balance at
the vast bulk of charon like some
dark tower blotting out the stars
solar frontier

by a bertram chandler

only one group of defenders stood between earth
and the black marauder from the depths of space
-and that was alan latimers tiny planet of exiled
criminals unarmed despised and burning
for their own private vengeance

  for long minutes he lay there he
was aware that the airlock door in
charons side had shut that the tele-
scopic ramp had retracted to its re-
cess in the shell plating and knew
that it would not be long before the
main drive of the prison ship seared
the rocks that were his comfortless
couch with all-consuming fire but

he did not care to a man such as he
the merciful penal laws of his tim
held little of mercy better he told
himself a quick clean death than a
long lifetime lived out among the in-
curables of ceres he looked at the
stars and waited for what at worst
would be only a microsecond of
agony




out of this world adventures

  somebodys clumsy gloved hands
were tugging at the sleeve of his suit
somebody was trying to pull him to
his feet he did not shift his gaze
from the glittering stars but he
spoke his voice strange and tinny in
his own helmet phones

  get away from here he said
then more urgently get away
from here you fool dont you know
that the ship will be blasting off at
any moment

  the other made no reply but the
insistent tugging continued ac-
tuated by rage rather than by any
urge towards self preservation lati-
mer started to scramble to his feet
even to himself his motives were
not clear-but his hands in their
thick gloves tingled with anticipa-
tion of the stinging blows that would
send this meddler scurrying back to
the safety of the airlock under the
brow of the low cliff

  then the stranger spoke it was a
low voice softly husky well modu-
lated-and even the inevitable dis-
tortions of the helmet phones could
not disguise its magical qualities
neither could they conceal the un-
dertones compounded of despair and
misery and resignation

  perhaps you are right latimer
heard perhaps you are wise per-
haps your action-our action-will
encourage others to follow suit when
charon comes again and then this
little world will be the poorer by so
many little personal hells and that
will be good

  it was a low voice and a softly
husky voice and it held within itself
a honeyed sweetness that had long
been lacking from the world of alan
latimer not that his world had been
in any way drab or dreary it had
been a good world-harsh perhaps
but not lacking the bright color of
new faces fresh scenes the explosive
flares of excitement and danger

  la his world as it had been it is
possible that such a voice uncon-

sciously intimate full of unspoken
promises would have failed to stir
him but within the narrow compass
of this new world this world that he
had made for himself or that the
peculiar inimitable combination of
genes that came from his parents
and from their parents had made for
him the voice promised a light a
color that must be sadly lacking
from the days to come or it could
have been that it brought back mem-
ories of a still older world a plane
of existence in which there were
other realities than the harsh turbu-
lent life of the frontiers the flare of
rocket drive against the stars and the
stars themselves sharp crystalline
with no kindly atmospheric veil be-
tween their hard brilliance and his
eyes

  no he heard himself shouting
were alive-and we stay that way
come on

  he was on his feet now he rough-
ly disengaged himself from the
clumsy paw that was still clutching
the right sleeve of his armor put out
his own gloved hands to grasp the
shoulders of the girl he did not stop
to examine the face that he could
dimly see within the transparent
bubble of the helmet he swung her
so that she was facing away from
him and then clumsy in his haste
rushed her towards the safety of the
low cliff and the airlock he hoped
desperately that the officers of
charon would be looking down from
control that they would see that the
field was not yet clear for blasting
off

they were still a score of yards
from the shelter when charons
pilot depressed his firing key had
ceres possessed an external atmos-
phere the roar of the blast might
well have deafened them for life as
it was their senses registered a
blinding intolerable light that
seemed to strike clear through their
raiders of the solar frontier



skulls to the retina the ground be-
neath them shook and the wave of
incandescent gases that was volatil-
ized rock lifted them and cast them
from it in spite of the insulation of
their suits they felt the scorching
fury of the blast had it not been for
the insulation they would have been
burned to a crisp and the force with
which they were flung to the ground
stunned them

  alan latimer was first to recover
he staggered to his feet putting one
hand out to the cliff face for support
blood tasted salt in his mouth and
there was a warm trickle from his
nostrils he disregarded it-attired
as he was there was nothing else that
he could do-and blinked to clear his
befogged eyes he looked up saw
charon a fast waning star among
the stars another spot of light among
the countless millions

  for a while he watched her his
heart going out with her revisiting
in memory all the ports and cities
that he would never again see it was
not until the girl stirred striking
feebly with her arm against his
booted foot that he bethought him-
self of her and her safety he
stooped then awkward in the stiff
articulations of his armor and picked
her up he strode the few short paces
to the airlock dull silver against the
rugged black of the cliff with little
of evident tenderness he lowered her
to the rocks fumbled for the controls
to the right of the entrance when
the outer door opened he dragged
the girl into the little compartment
already he was beginning to resent
the fact that wittingly or unwitting-
ly she had balked his plans for a
swift clean suicide

  pressures equalized the inner door
opened and he passed through into
the ante-chamber beyond dimly he
heard the rattle of armor as he let
the girl fall from a semi-sitting pos-
ture to one that was lifelessly supine
he snapped open the visor of his

helmet took his first breath of the
air of the notorious prison world of
ceres

oo you made it after all re-

  o	marked the little man behind the
big desk disinterestedly you
wouldnt v been the first theres
many a poor sap gone out that way
--an thought that he was bein hell-
ish clever

 so you knew demanded lati-
mer

 big menacing he regarded the
grey clerkish keeper of the gate he
was ready to resent the fact that
these people had known of his at-
tempted suicide had made no effort
to prevent it then he remembered
that it had been an inhabitant of
ceres who had pulled him back into
the world of the living-and that she
had received scant thanks for so do-
ing the dangerous flare died in his
pale eyes the hard lines of his deep-
ly tanned face softened with clumsy
haste he dropped to his knees flung
open the visor of his rescuers hel-
met

  and she knew too chuckled the
little clerk if i hadnt let her see
the advance copy of charons passen-
ger list shed never a gone outside
but as soon as all the passengers
were tallied in but one-an that one
lieutenant alan latimer-nothin
nor nobody could stop her   

  all this latimer half heard as he
stripped the clumsy armor from the
body of the girl the clerk rattled
on then almost fell over backwards
in panic as latimer rose to his feet
reached out with one big hand but
it was only the gaudy silk handker-
chief protruding from the little mans
pocket that he was wanting and
when he had it he returned at once
to the unconscious girl began wip-
ing away the trickle of blood that
was still oozing from the corner of
her mouth that had gushed in a
stream from her nostrils then-


out of this world adventures

 fetch some cold water i he
barked

 the other hastened to obey his
grumbling monotone as he did so was
faintly audible irritating

 dont know why she bothered
dont know why hes bothering
were free on ceres if folks want
to die we let em   

 you whats your name

  marcus then reluctantly sir

 and what are you here for

  the little clerks voice was sullen

 forgery embezzlement

 and you know what im here for
so keep quiet unless youre spoken
to

 and in the silence that followed
latimer completed his superficial ex-
amination of the girl he worked
deftly mechanically assured himself
that no bones were broken and all
the time the conscious part of his
mind was bitterly regretting that
he had not held her there with him
to die in the blast of charons jets
the voice had stirred faint chords
in his memory but he had assured
himself that it was imagination now
that he could see the woman herself
shocked disbelief had rapidly given
place to shocked credulity the
figure true was fuller with more
than a hint of blowsiness but the
crudest change had been that in the
face nobody could deny that laur-
anne towers was still beautiful but
the mouth that had always been a
little too large too full-lipped was
now frankly sensual the fresh
charm that he had known so long
ago in port gregory was now the
dangerous allure of the unashamed
wanton

 latimer dipped the handkerchief
afresh into the cold water that mar-
cus had brought again he bathed the
pallid face of the woman she moaned
and stirred slowly the heavy-lidded
eyes opened stared darkly at the
anxious face of the ex-lieutenant

  alan i couldnt believe it when i

saw your name on the passenger list
i couldnt believe it until i saw you
sprawled on the rocks waiting for
charon to blast off   

  im afraid its true laurie   

  my dear i dont know whether
to be glad or sorry it would have
been nice to have died with you out
there  it can still mean some-
thing to us if we live together   

  we can go outside and open the
visors of our helmets whispered
latimer bitterly it would be best
that way otherwise for you a mur-
derer for me   

  alan dont

 we can go outside where we
have been you and i since those days
in port gregory the devil alone
knows but we can share the jour-
neys end   

  im not stopping you cackled
marcus youre free lieutenant
youre on ceres the only laws are
the laws you make yourself

  and heres one that im making
now and that is get out of our sight
at once

  you cant   

  ive killed two men one with my
bare hands better men than you
so 

when marcus had gone laur-
anne rose unsteadily to her
feet she sat in the chair behind the
desk that the little forger had va-
cated from a pocket in her dress
she produced a mirror and a compact
and with a hand that hardly trembled
began to repair the ravages wrought
upon her complexion by the events
of the past half hour when she had
finished she opened the top drawer
of the desk brought out a bottle two
glasses a box of cigarettes

 latimer was grateful for the
smoke for the stiff slug of good
whiskey but sitting on the desk he
did not like what he saw as he looked
down at lauranne he did not like
the way in which she tossed down her
raiders of the solar frontier



drink refilled her glass immediately
he looked down and the look on his
harsh face could not be mistaken for
anything else but disapproval

 cheer up alan darling were
here both of us for life so-better
make the best of it

  yes and well start like this

 he reached down snatched the
glass from the girls hand hurled it
and its contents against the further
wall it did not break but fell down
the metal surface with almost ludi-
crous slowness the trickle of whis-
key reached the floor only a second
after what had been its container
and the sombre chastened mood that
had been driven away from the girl
by the warmth of the spirits re-
turned she got up slowly from the
chair the utmost dejection in every


out of this wortd adventures

drooping line of her figure with
slow dragging steps she walked to-
ward the airlock door

  where are you going 

  what does it matter outside
latimer waited until her hand went
out to the controls of the inner door
then jumped down from his seat two
long strides-almost leaps in the
feeble gravitational field of ceres-
carried him to lauranne as before
his hands went out to grasp her
shoulders but this time it was - to
turn her to him and the pale blond
head of the man went down to that
of the woman was enveloped in the
blacl mist of her hair for long sec-
onds they stood thus and then gen-
tly latimer led lauranne back to the
desk seated her in the chair behind
the massive piece of furniture he
himself remained standing

  you were right the first time he
admitted at last we must live i
dont know why but in each other
we have something 

  something whispered the girl
raising her tear-stained face some-
thing a pale shadow of our former
lives dont lie to me alan-for you
i can never replace the surge of an
accelerating ship the flare of rocket
drive against the stars the ordered
routine of your little world of grey
paint and burnished metal for you
more than for me this is the end of
the trip this is that last haven of
which swinburne sang

 there go the loves that wither

  the old loves with wearier wings

   and alt dead years draw thither

   and all disastrous things

  dead dreams of days forsaken

   blind buds that snows have shaken

   wild leaves that winds have taken

   red strays of ruined springs 

  latimer pulled thoughtfully at his
cigarette thoughtfully he watched
the smoke watched it as though its
spirals and convolutions held the
ecret of the universe the girl

looked up at him her face yearning
hurt that she should be ignored

 at last latimer looked down his
lips beginning to move if he had
been given the time to speak his
words must inevitably have been
drowned by the trampling of heavy-
booted feet along the corridor out-
side his hand was a rapid blur as it
flashed towards the holster that no
longer hung at his side then moving
fast he bundled lauranne off the
chair behind the desk picked it up
so that it could if need be be used
as a weapon

  the door crashed open

chapter ii
boss of the exile world

you make your own laws

 o	said kimball he leaned well
back in the chair that was almost a
throne picked his teeth thought-
fully with a wooden toothpick from
the little vase on the table by his
right hand latimer watching him
intently was repelled by the mans
grossness his untidy slovenly attire
but was impressed by the aura of
very real power that surrounded the
boss of ceres

 kimball spat the little chewed
fragments of wood falling in a fine
spray around the cuspidor at his feet

  so our little friend marcus told
you that we were all anarchists he
sneered

  i never said so latimers voice
was firm uncompromising

 i know you didnt but i know
marcus they allow me to have a few
little machines to play with latimer
ive got a lie detector but i never
trouble to use it on people like you
i know your type you wont talk
until you feel like it and then youll
tell the truth maybe not the whole
truth but nevertheless nothing but
the truth and i can use men like
you i can trust men like you
jtalders of the solar frontier



  thank you and the alternative

  nothing too bad you become an
ordinary citizen of ceres which
means that you have a sufficiency of
fresh air and food and artificial sun-
light which means that you will be
allowed to potter around with any of
the footling arts and crafts that are
encouraged here which means that
youre liable to be beaten up at any
time that my police see fit

  the room with its luxurious ap-
pointments blurred before latimers
eyes fists clenched he started for-
ward on either side of him a guard
clutched his arm another struck him
across the mouth with a hard hand
faint and far away he heard the
voice of lauranne dont she was
saying dont be a fool alan

  and the words served only to stir
him to fury his right arm lifted
lifting with it the man who was cling-
ing to it it swung across his body in
a swift arc and the guard at his left
hand was felled by the club that the
others body had become the guard
who had struck him went down the
lower half of his face bloody and
curiously blurred it was not until
later that latimer felt the pain in his
broken knuckles

  but there were too many of the
guards they fell upon him from all
corners of the room they bore him
down with the weight of their bodies
and there was the sharp clicking of
steel on steel and the kiss of cold
metallic bands on latimers feet and
ankles and when they pulled him to
his feet he tottered there unable to
move

  there followed seconds of useless
straining at the handcuffs the leg-
irons then the bloody haze before
latimers eyes slowly faded and
through the thinning mists he saw
the flabby paradoxically strong face
of the boss kimball had one fat
hand upraised in a demand for si-
lence

 hear me out he was saying

almost plaintively you of all per-
sons must know the heed for dis-
cipline if what i hear of you is true
your crimes were no more than strict
enforcement of discipline and yet
you seek to hamper my poor efforts
to bring law and order to this law-
less little world

  think well latimer what would
ceres be were it not for some or-
ganized body to enforce certain
standards of law and decency per-
haps my rule is not democratic-but
i ask you have we the raw materials
of democracy here i will be frank
with you back on earth i wanted
too much power and i wasnt overly
particular in the methods i used to
get it i was apprehended once psy-
choed and warned but they couldnt
change me i was apprehended a sec-
ond time-one of my underlings was
both jealous and ambitious and this
time i was classified as an incurable

  and here on ceres i still want
power and still im not particular
about the methods i use to get it

  so i see

  now you are being foolish what
would have happened to you if you
had been brought before one of your
admirals and attempted to assault
him and they rule only squadrons
of ships i rule a world

  latimer forebore to make unkind
comparisons between the size and the
striking power of those same squad-
rons and that of kimballs domain
he only said shortly

  all right ill play ball whats
in it for me if i come in with you

  membership in my police force-
with prospects of promotion this
carries the right to first choice of
the comforts and luxuries brought by
charon the right to marry whom
you please

  marry

 when latimer heard laurannes
little gasp--more of hurt than indig-
nation-he was sorry that he had not
been able to keep the amused in-


out of this world adventures

credulity out of his voice but kim-
ball his tone unchanged continued
yes marry we are a very moral
people latimer there are those of
course who are not moral but unless
they offend against public decency
no action is taken against them but
as one of the governing class you
will be expected to respect the laws
that you yourself will enforce
law and order said latimer
musingly here on ceres take off
these damned irons kimball and ill
sign your articles or whatever you
call them

  kimball motioned to the guards
one of whom produced a key

  and in future call me boss  he
warned and you constable mer-
rick rustle up a copy of the contract
so that constable latimer can sign
while youre about it bring along a
marriage license well tie this fel-
low up in more ways than one

there was something wrong
with the park it was not the
grass neither was it the gorgeous
flowers their equal would have been
hard to find anywhere on any of the
inhabited worlds it was not the cav-
ern roof that arched far overhead-
that was lost in a dim blue haze from
which streamed the health-giving
rays of the big sun lamps it could
almost have been the sky of earth
in misty mood

 constable alan latimer stared
about him barely conscious of the
light pressure on his arm that was
lauranne latimers hand but she
ever conscious of him read his
thoughts

  no children she said that is
what is wrong

  and the man looked about him at
the wide expanse of green lawn at
the sedately strolling couples young
middle-aged old and saw that she
was right it was all too orderly
unnaturally quiet he realized with
a sudden pang that in all proba-

bility the only happy man was the
bent grey gardener who was work-
ing with slow and loving patience in
a bright flower bed near by

  gently he disengaged his arm from
his wifes light grasp raised it so
that it fitted about her waist they
strolled on enjoying the feel of the
smooth velvety grass under their
bare feet listening to the songs of
the birds that were such a poor sub-
stitute for the joyous clamor of chil-
dren at play

  that has always seemed to me to
be crudest of all he mused the
sterilization law

 but its kind my dear you
couldnt bring up children in a penal
colony whether or not their hered-
ity was unsound they themselves
would grow up to be criminal types
and if they were taken from us at
an early age and sent to earth for
their upbringing that would be
crueler still for us

  perhaps you are right but i know
ceres better now and it wouldnt be
a bad world in which to rear chil-
dren no worse than many another
as it is now but we are fortunate
in our boss broderick before him
called himself king and he was mad
and bad then there was a long pe-
riod of anarchy which was worse
than ever the rule of king broderick
had been kimball wants power and
is quite ruthless but he uses his
power well the man who follows
him-who can tell he may be strong
and bad he may be weak and good-
which will be worse

  the two walked on in silence
you know admitted latimer
this is not bad this world i mean
i have you i was a fool my dear
ever to lose touch with you after i
sailed from port gregory but i was
young then-and the service was
wife and parents and children but i
am glad that i have found you again
if only it could have been some other
way  
raiders of the solar frontier



  what did happen ive respected
the privacy of youf past alan just
as youve respected mine but  a
woman is always curious i guess

  it will do no harm to tell you
the first time was when i was second
in command of pathfinder we were
on a survey job measuring charting
along with a spot of geology in the
belt it was the other side of the sun
from ceres well the charts we had
werent too accurate-and one day
we found ourselves in one of those
jams that it would be almost impos-
sible for the finest mathematician in
the system to duplicate on paper
we were on a collision orbit with no
less than half a dozen hunks of as-
sorted cosmic debris and there was
no way out the automatic controls
just blew all their fuses and died

  some didnt get into their suits in
time we never had a chance to get a
message away and in the finish there
were five survivors in our number
two boat with myself in charge

 the way things were the best
policy was to put ourselves on the
earth-jupiter lane and wait until
thunderqueen came along it was a
long wait and long before she was
due long before we could raise her
on our lifeboat transmitter tempers
were wearing very thin and we were
hungry all the time-have you ever
tried to make a meal of food concen-
trates the nourishment is there the
protein and the calories and the vita-
mins but theres no bulk youre
always hungry and the boat was
cramped and we were all in each
others way and we hated each
other

  and then during my sleep period
one of the technical ratings a fellow
named burton tried to raid the food
locker i woke up and we fought i
fought a little harder than was nec-
essary but once i got my fingers
round his throat i couldnt let go

  but that was only the first

  yes that was only the first i was

warned  and psychoed and dis-
charged as fit for duty and so i was
until a barroom brawl in port la-
salle you know how i always used to
boast about my skill with side-arms
about being quick on the draw there
was this fellow in the bar town mar-
shal i think he was i dont know
what he was like sober but he was
most unpleasant drunk perhaps i
was too anyhow he pulled a gun on
me and before it cleared his holster
id drilled him between the eyes

  and that was the finish for me

lauranne said nothing lati-
mer did not look at her face but
he felt the warm waves of sympathy
that radiated from her only one
who like himself had come to this
sink-hole of the solar system could
possibly sympathize

  they came to the grass verge au-
tomatically they stooped put on the
sandals that they had been carrying
they walked on over the smooth-
surfaced floor of the tunnel it did
not matter to them that the artificial
sunlight of the park had been re-
placed by lamps that made no pre-
tense of being other than utilitarian
lighting fixtures there was a warmth
between them and a dim but steady
radiance that needed no assistance
frqm outside power supplies

  yet as he walked latimer took
almost unconscious note of his sur-
roundings he was in a part of ceres
strange to him the tunnel walls
were devoid of the usual doorways
and windows of residential apart-
ments the floor was coated with a
fine dust there were the tracks of
one of the little scooters to show that
somebody had come this way and
recently but that was the only sign
of traffic there was

  still they walked on half in a
dream welded to each other by the
seal of confession the voice of the
sentry harsh commanding came as
a sudden shock


out of this world adventures

  halt who goes there

  friend replied latimer auto-
matically

  he looked up to see one of kim-
balls police smart in his uniform of
blue and silver the metal-shod stave
was held threateningly at the ready

  advance friend began the con-
stable and   

  his eyes dropped to the little sil-
ver badge on the left breast of lati-
mers civilian shirt lifted to study
his face and there was a light of
recognition of the memory of past
intimacies in his eyes as he shifted
his regard to the girl

  all right he said youre the
new man arent you  latham or lati-
mer or something i suppose that
lauranne is showing you the sights
the cold hard flame leapt into
vicious life behind latimers pale
eyes he was often to wonder later
what he would have done what would
have been the consequences of his ac-
tions had not his wife taken charge
he felt her grip on his arm pain-
fully tight and he heard her say
alan this is philip lane an old
friend of mine philip this is alan
latimer my husband

  his hand went out but only to grip
that of the other lane was talking
quickly nervously fully conscious
that the air was charged with hos-
tility

  havent they shown you round
here yet youll be getting your spell
of guard duty soon enough  

he led them down the tunnel
around a bend and the tunnel
was sealed with a bulkhead of gleam-
ing steel in this was set a door like
that of some huge safe or treasure
vault the levers and wheels and
dials on its shining face would not
have looked out of place on the con-
trol panel of a jovian mail liner

  and whats behind all that de-
manded latimer his anger giving
place to curiosity

  thats what wed all like to know
but we never see behind that door
nobody does not even the boss but
every year charon brings a flock of
technicians from earth and theyre
escorted here by a regiment of armed
guards from the ship and they pot-
ter around with the machinery and
we know that were all right for an-
other year

  theres light in there latimer
and heat and the power that drives
the pumps theres power in there
and every boss that weve ever had
in ceres would have sold his soul to
lay his grubby paws on it we have
men here cracksmen who could have
this door and the other doors open
in less time than itd take you or me
to open a can of sardines   
then why dont hey

  because theres always at least
one of us here to stop em because
if they did wed all find out if its
true what the technicians tell us
because if they did folks back on
earth and mars would see a first-
class nova right in their gardens
you mean   

i mean that if anybody tries to get
through those doors or tries to get
through to the vault in any other
way up goes the atomic power sta-
tion thats tucked away in there
oh replied latimer inadequate-
ly thanks lane he looked at his
watch time we were getting back
now i have to be on duty at 
a policemans lot is not a happy
one riposted the other but it
could be unhappier eh lauranne
i wouldnt know she replied
frigidly come alan

  she felt that the muscles of his
arm beneath the thin shirt were
tensed but now she felt that she was
barely able to control the monster
that had been called from the dark
abyss of her husbands ancestry in
pathfinders lifeboat that once
called into being had destroyed his
career
aiders of the solar frontier



come alan she said again

 and when they were around the
bend of the tunnel he turned to her
and asked what is he to you
he is nothing and he was noth-
ing will you be content with that
yes he replied at last slowly
grudgingly i suppose so

chapter iii

the ship from outside

inspector alan latimer cursed
as the telephone shrill insistent
interrupted his leisurely breakfast

  it was lauranne who answered it
she was gone a long time when she
returned latimer looked at her with
more than a faint distaste reflecting
that women such as she should never
slop around in dressing gowns

  its for you she said

  oh who is it

  the boss

  you were a long time talking to
him

  was i anyhow its important
latimer gulped a mouthful of egg
washed it down with coffee rose
slowly to his feet

  in future he growled when
calls come for me-or calls that you
say are for me-dont hang around
in the booth all morning answering
them

  arent you going it was impor-
tant i said

  to you and who else
nevertheless latimer went
through to the telephone booth sat
down on the little seat before the in-
strument from the screen kimballs
flabby pasty face glowered at him

  so youre here at last latimer i
thought you were never coming
the message took long enough to
reach me

  i dont care for your tone of voice
latimer but let that pass come
round to my office at once

 why

  j donthave to answer questions
button up your jacket and wipe the
egg off your face and hurry thats
all

  the instrument went dead lati-
mer considered calling the boss back
thought better of it but the taste of
the morning was bitter in his mouth
as he went back into the breakfast
room to finish his coffee he drained
the cup put it back into the saucer
with an unnecessary clatter he went
into the little hall of the apartment
he took his cap from its peg clapped
it anyhow on to his head without
troubling to look into the mirror he
did not kiss lauranne good-bye

  in kimballs office he found the
boss nervously pacing up and down
seated were two men strangers
they were in uniform latimer
stared charon was not due for two
months yet he looked more closely
the visitors wore the insignia of the
jovian mail service a five-pointed
star transfixed by a jagged conven-
tional lightning bolt

  latimer said kimball abruptly
pausing in his restless pacing the in-
evitable toothpick working with a
speed that betrayed the depth of his
agitation these gentlemen are cap-
tain pemberthy and commander
wood of thunder queen

  thunderqueen boss but   

 thunderqueen i said and thun-
derqueen i mean captain this is in-
spector latimer of my police force
ex-lieutenant latimer of the regu-
lar navy   

  latimer put out his hand it was
ignored by pemberthy the inspector
flushed deeply and darkly under his
tan and the cold light flared briefly
in his pale eyes he looked fixedly at
the short stout captain whose hat-
less head gleamed in the lamplight
at the tall angular commander and
then anger was replaced by puzzle-
ment long and steadily he looked
at commander wood and did not find
that for which he was seeking


out of this world adventures

  we had to make a forced landing
on your world began pemberthy
without preamble our tube linings
are burnt out and we dont carry
spares our hull is strained and leak-
ing badly we shall have to stay here
until help comes  

  so what

 were being followed chased
rather by a big black ship that
seemed to come from the direction
of polaris-although that means
nothing and she was no earthly
ship we approached her close when
our radar picked her up thought at
first that she was some hitherto un-
discovered planetoid with an orbit at
right angles to the plane of the eclip-
tic we were almost on top of her
before we saw what she was and as
we were turning away she let fly with
some ray that burned away most of
our starboard fin and the venturis of
the starboard auxiliaries we ran of
course she didnt take any more
hostile action that we could see al-
though for all we know she may
have used her ray again and missed
one thing she did do-blanketed our
radio so that we could neither trans-
mit nor receive  

  kimball broke in latimer i
suggest that you let these officers use
our station

 a blinding glimpse of the ob-
vious snarled the boss that was
the first thing they asked of me car-
ter went along with them and this
blanketing effect of theirs obviously
covers us

 so now captain how do you
know that youre being followed

  i dont know pemberthys voice
was peculiarly flat almost lifeless i
dont know but it seems reasonable
to suppose that any race sufficiently
advanced for interstellar travel will
be at least as far advanced as you in
the field of electronics theyll have
had their scanners on us ever since
the first contact the mere fact that
the rajdio is dead indicates that

  and im still to be convinced that
this marvelous big black ship is
from outside stormed the boss it
could be pirates and if it is and if
they come here im making a deal
ceres owes no loyalty to the federa-
tion

  how did you know it was an alien
ship anyhow

the little fat captain hesitated be-
fore making his reply it was im-
possible to read his expression there
was no expression to read his face
was that of a carven buddha and his
tall thin executive officer sat wood-
enly in his chair like a cigar store
indian latimer was thinking

  it was her shape said pemberthy
at last and her hull wasnt smooth
but covered with all kinds of projec-
tions jweapons they might have been
or part of her interstellar drive and
she had her name in big white char-
acters on her bow and they belonged
to no earthly alphabet   

  could have been arabic or chi-
nese anyhow a ship capable of com-
ing here from alpha centauri or
sirius or wherever shes supposed to
have come from could have made
rings round your decrepit old
wagon

  no she would not be using her
interstellar drive in the vicinity of a
planetary system and it is reason-
able to suppose that even using her
reaction motors she would approach
such a system with caution   

  and so you brought her here  

  it was the nearest port of refuge
replied pemberthy simply

  and do i organize the defense of
ceres demanded latimer sharply

  yes of course the boss seemed
mildly surprised that the question
had been asked

 what with

  kimball glared at him he began
to say something then thought bet-
ter of it his tone when at last he
did speak was placatory
kaioers of the solar frontier



  youre the professional fighting
man in this outfit he said i leave
that entirely in your hands and i
am sure that these gentlemen will do
all that they can to help you
first stated latimer i shall
want access to your engine room
captain pemberthy i think that with
your tools your workshops and with

  the captain was silent but the tall
commander stirred and spoke regu-
lations he said simply and that was
all but it was the cue that pemberthy
needed

  yes regulations you know what
happened when your people got con-
trol of thunderbird that must not
happen again

it was a living
pulsing brain he
held in his hand
- a brain im-
prisoned in glass

your converter to manufacture ex-
plosives i shall be able to turn out
some hamilton torpedoes dont
know how much use theyll be against
a race that plays around with death
rays but unless they know enough
to degauss their ships they should be
fairly effective and i shall want any
arms that you your passengers or
crew have in your possession

  any arms we have we keep said
pemberthy flatly and i regret to
have to say that you will not be
allowed to set foot aboard my ship
great galaxy exploded the in-
spector this is no time to be petty
dont you realize that the fate of this
world of the system of man himself
may depend upon your co-opera-
tion

 it was kimball who found a way
out of the impasse

  why he asked shouldnt you
give these gentlemen details of what-
ever it is you want made then all
that will concern you will be the fin-
ished article

  and that was how it was finally
arranged and the hamilton torpe-
does were to remain aboard thun-
derqueen until such time as the black
ship of the aliens chose to appear
and with that latimer had to be con-
tent

  he found it especially humiliating
that with their own little world well-
guarded inviolate the passengers
and crew of the jovian liner were
made free of all ceres


out of this world adventures

  but even that had its compensa-
tions

for long years ever since the first
primitive story-teller soared on
the wings of his imagination to the
stars the invasion from outside had
been an ever recurrent theme of man-
kinds fiction at first the tide of con-
quest was to come sweeping in from
the moon or the sister planets but
the instruments of the astronomers
had shown the improbabilities inher-
ent in such a plot even before the
spaceship slipped with disconcerting
ease from the realm of fancy into
that of fact thereafter the invaders
were to come from the stars from
which particular star nobody was
ever quite sure-but surely among all
the glittering hosts of heaven there
was one with planets to spawn a race
to rival or surpass the technological
progress of man

  but the very idea had been a pure-
ly fictional concept for so long that
the ceresians even if they did ac-
cept it intellectually could never do
so with their emotions perhaps the
only man in the little world to whom
this raid from interstellar space was
probable possible was alan latimer
but he had taken part in the navys
war games those fleet maneuvers in
which half earths forces fought in
theory to the last man and the last
gun in which the other half played
the part of centaurians or rigellians
or whatever the fancy of the com-
mander-in-chief might dictate

  as for the rest the boss had said
that thunderqueen had been attacked
by pirates of humble terran origin
and the boss as always was right
it was true that the captain and offi-
cers of the liner stuck to their story
of an alien ship but it was obvious
that they were lying as a matter of
policy as long as they could con-
vince the ceresians that they were
about to fight a common enemy an
alliance was possible but that enemy

had to be alien captain pemberthy
knew full well that his hosts would
far prefer to throw in their lot with
the raiders if they were human than
with himself it was all so obvious

  meanwhile if inspector alan lati-
mer chose to believe the cock-and-
bull story of his fellow spacemen
there was more good than harm done
the plans made for the defense of
the little world the organizing the
drilling were admitted to be neces-
sary when the pirates came in their
black ship any kind of organized re-
sistance would be a most useful bar-
gaining counter so would the
weapons that were being made
aboard thunderqueen to latimers
specifications

 and the strangers who roamed
without let or hindrance through the
caves and tunnels made a very wel-
come break in the monotony of life
in the prison asteroid they were not
molested there would be time
enough for that when the pirates
came besides in spite of pember-
thys refusal to surrender his arms to
latimer it was quite obvious that he
had enough and to spare of weapons
for his own people they did not
wear them ostentatiously but neither
did they go to any great pains to con-
ceal them and one of the parks had
been set aside for their use as a shoot-
ing range both men and women
showed a proficiency that was an
effective deterrent to any of the in-
curables who might get ideas

 an ex-officer himself latimer
could not blame the captain if he
had been master of a passenger liner
he would not have allowed his
charges to wander unprotected about
a penal colony but he would not
have allowed shore leave but per-
haps the hull was leaking badly if
so why not make some attempt to
patch it and quite probably the
first that would be known of the ap-
proach of the alien would be the sud-
den destruction of thunderqueen
raiders of the solar frontier



the police force had all been
warned to be on the alert for the
first signs of internal trouble but
ceres could well have been some
fashionable pleasure resort well-
dressed men and women strolled the
parkways mingled without snobbery
or embarrassment with the colonists
the theatres played always to full
houses even allowing for the excel-
lence of the talent this was mildly
surprising until one remembered
that with the mysterious blanket still
thick over all radio transmission and
reception no terran entertainment
was available

  and as the purely arbitrary days
rolled on without the merest hint of
thunderqueens black ship there
were those who wished heartily that
the raiders or pirates would come or
even better that the jovian liner and
all her people would go the officers
and passengers of the big ship were
becoming altogether too ubiquitous
there is little enough privacy at the
best of times in a world such as
ceres and the four hundred odd
people who were thunderqueens
personnel seemed to a certain grow-
ing minority to have the nuisance
value of ten times their number

  alan latimer was not of this mi-
nority to him the days were packed
with interest and with the sense of
urgency of working against time
and lauranne saw little of him in
the brief periods he allowed himself
for relaxation she heard stories
stories that at first met with incre-
dulity that at last forced a grudging
belief upon her always these stories
featured the name of ailsa rae
lauranne remembered having seen
the girl slight she was and red-
headed with high cheekbones and
eyes that were green and she moved
with a lithe grace that lauranne her-
self could never hope to recapture
and while she knew in her heart that
alan was hers yet she knew with a
dreadful certainty that the coming

battle with the aliens meant for her
husband the slim chance of pardon
of a new life that she was not in-
tended to share

  these thoughts had crossed lati-
mers mind in his more optimistic
moments he had allowed himself to
dream dreams and he had hated him-
self that his wife was not part of
these same dreams but the dreams
remained unchanged but in these
latter days the thought whose urg-
ency crowded all else from his mind
was that he was not ready an antic
fate had made him earths champion
in the first battle between men and
aliens and both armor and armament
were sadly lacking he decided that
he would force a showdown between
himself and pemberthy would de-
mand to be allowed to inspect the
progress made in the manufacture of
the torpedoes the arming of thun-
derqueen

  he said as much to ailsa rae with
whom he was walking in one of the
parks

  but it is all right alan she in-
sisted ive been down to the engine-
room and the workshops i know
nothing about these things but i saw
row upon row of plastic cylinders
each with its fins and jets at the tail
and theyre setting up launching
cradles in all the airlocks it will be
all right i tell you

  perhaps my dear but i want to
see for myself and i want to have
at least one round for each of my
own projectors if this black ship of
pemberthys drops on us without
warning and blasts thunderqueen i
have no weapons to fight back

  but    oh i can see its no use
arguing with you youll see the old
man and youll have a first-class row
same as you did before and youll
get nowhere and   

 shut up ordered latimer he
enforced his order by pressing his
mouth on hers and as she went limp
in his arms he felt his resolve to


out of this world adventures

have it out with captain pemberthy
weaken he was doing enough he
was doing more than his share let
the boss dicker with thunderqueens
master-he was the politician

chapter iv

cold-blooded murder

how long this mood would have
lasted had it not been for the in-
tervention of chance it is impossible
to say but it was the hard pressure
of ailsas shoulder holster against
his chest that aroused resentment
pulled him up from the pit into which
he was fast falling this girl this
woman that was his for the taking
was armed and he was not it was an
affront to his pride as a fighting man
it was unthinkable that a foolish
merchant skipper should have the
effrontery to provide his female pas-
sengers with weapons and deny
those same weapons to those to whom
was entrusted the defense of a world
and more than a world

  he let his arms fall to his sides
the girl taken unawares staggered
and in her green eyes when she
looked up at him was puzzlement and
hurt and a strange light that was
neither

  where do i find the captain de-
manded latimer harshly

  you should know she replied sul-
lenly he and commander wood are
usually with your boss at this time

  then im going there now and
kimball had better back me up
or

or what the voice was mocking

 never you mind he laughed
matching her mood of light raillery
he clasped her to him and kissed her
heartily and thought that if this had
been lauranne the little scene would
have been followed by an atmosphere
of dull resentment that would have
lasted for hours

somehow as he strode across the

velvety grass his spirits were light
he looked with appreciation at a tall
blonde girl one of the liners pas-
sengers and he was not too sur-
prised when he saw a few minutes
later the same girl again it couldnt
possibly be the same girl he told him-
self she must be twins    and
thought nothing more of it

  he returned the salute of the sentry
at the entrance to kimballs apart-
ments with a snap that surprised even
himself as he strode along the cor-
ridor he found that he was rehears-
ing what he would say to pemberthy
he repeated the most telling phrases
turning them over and over in his
mind with relish

  it was not until he had almost
reached the office that the sound of
angry voices aroused him from his
pleasant daydream angry voices he
listened intently there was only one
angry voice and that was kimballs
pemberthy was speaking in his usual
expressionless tones and wood ap-
peared not to be speaking at all

  latimer started to hurry as he
reached the door he heard kimball
shout i know i know what   
and there was a peculiarly soft ex-
plosion and a scream and when
latimer flung open the door the sick-
ening stench of burned flesh

  on the floor in front of his desk
lay kimball where his protuberant
belly had been was a charred gaping
hole the coils of the intestines laid
bare seemed to have a life of their
own seemed to be writhing slowly
andslimily latimer gulped he turned
away quickly but not before he had
seen the smoking gun in woods hand
the ugly weapon that pemberthy was
pointing straight at him

 when he looked back both wood
and pemberthy were covering him
with their weapons they were he
saw standard  service automatics
fitted with silencers firing an explo-
sive slug and the hands that held
them wavered not one fraction
raiders of the solar frontier



  latimer was not unarmed he had
his stout metal-tipped stave and the
short dirk at his belt against two
nervous inexperienced gunmen he
would have stood a fighting chance
but these gunmen were not nervous
such sangfroid might have been ex-
pected from two officers of his own
late service but hardly from those
whose whole training emphasized the
safe delivery of passengers and cargo
the safety of their ships he latimer
had killed his men in hot blood the
only hot blood in evidence in this
killing had been kimballs the two
merchant officers were no more than
cold-blooded murderers

pemberthy was speaking i am
sorry that this had to happen he
said

  you will be when youre sent out
here to become a permanent guest
cracked latimer

  let me finish your boss kimball
was planning to seize our ship to hand
her over to the invaders that he will
-would-insist on regarding as ter-
ran pirates we quarreled he drew a
knife commander wood was obliged
to fire in self-defense

  what did kimball know de-
manded the inspector

  there was a little silence then
wood permitted himself the luxury
of a mirthless smile

  he thought that he knew that the
ship that attacked us was manned by
terran pirates   

  another thing youve said that
you could not spare us arms but
even your women are packing guns
we should perhaps have been
more frank put yourself in our place
latimer as far as we are concerned
this place may be more dangerous than
the jungles of venus are we to de-
prive ourselves and our charges of all
protection

  no admitted latimer slowly
but the alliance between us-if you
can call it such-has been far too one-

sided you and your people have been
given the freedom of our world and
what have we got in return nothing
but vague promises

  worse you are supposed to be the
law abiding citizens we the criminals
yet    he pointed mutely to kim-
balls body

  pemberthy was silent it was not
strangely enough an embarrassed or a
guilty silence this the inspector
fou id strange indeed he was willing
to believe that the master of a pas-
senger liner might well find a lack
of frankness a certain disingenuous-
ness very essential in the execution
of his professional duties might even
in time become an accomplished pre-
varicator but it is not so much the
act of lying of equivocation that
brings moral discomfort in its wake
it is being found out but this was as
nothing to the fact that kimballs
killers men of peace could view the
body of the man they had butchered
without the slightest trace of emo-
tion

  let him see the ship suggested
wood his voice expressionless as al-
ways let him see the ship and con-
vince himself that we are making his
weapons but first sir it will be as
well to dispose of the body

  commander wood is right agreed
the captain nobody need know that
kimball is dead at a time of crisis
such as this it will be as well if no-
body ever does know that kimball is
dead you of course will carry on
as you have been doing ever since
our arrival you have been the real
boss kimball has been only a figure-
head

 latimer wanted to argue he
wanted to press the stud under the
desk that would bring the guards
pouring into the room and above all
he wanted to do violence to the two
who stood there and to whom the body
on the floor was just so much refuse
to be unceremoniously dumped

  but    they held the guns


out of this world adventures

  had it not been for the fact that
there was nobody else on ceres to
whom the military command could be
entrusted that he alan latimer was
even though earth did not know
might never know entrusted with the
defense of the solar system he would
never have let himself be overawed by
the threat of the heavy pistols would
have allowed the tides of fury to
sweep aside all prudence all con-
sidered action

  but ceres had wrought its changes
so too had the heavy responsibility
with which he had been saddled and
he held himself on a tight rein and
the red haze never quite obscured his
vision and the drumming of the blood
in his ears was never loud enough to
drown what the others were saying

  well demanded pemberthy

  i still think that youre murderers
i still have to be convinced of the
truth of your story but  

  yes

  you give me no choice

wood had found the cunningly
concealed button in the paneling
he pressed it and a circular section
of the floor slid to one side latimer
wondered how the strangers knew of
the existence of the chute that ran
down to the big fertilizer tanks
probably kimball had told them in a
moment of drunken confidence he
had always been proud of this uncon-
ventional office fitting but during his
eign it had never until now been
used for bodies bitterly latimer re-
flected on hpw much better the boss
had been than his bad and mad
predecessors experienced a sense of
very real loss of hatred for his
murderers

 wood dragged the gross body to
the edge of the round hole gave it a
last shove with his foot it teetered
for a second or so then vanished
from very far away came the sound
of a splash kimball had always been
proud of ceres parks and gardens

and in death he would serve them
no less faithfully than he had done
during his life

  pemberthy waited until his execu-
tive officer had removed with a piece
of rag all traces of blood from the
polished floor sent the hideously
stained cloth to follow the body
then with his gun he gestured to-
wards the door

  and tell the guards he said
that the boss is working hard must
not be disturbed you can arrange to
have food sent in at intervals

  you fools thought latimer who-
ever brings the food will see st once
that there is something amiss    but
wefre playing the game your way all
i have to do is to keep my jets clear

  the two officers returned their
guns to their side pockets the in-
spector could sense rather than see
that he was still covered that the
slightest hostile move on his part
would be the last move that he would
make they closed in on either side
of him as they walked along the cor-
ridor to the outside passages so close
were they that he found it difficult to
return the salutes of the guards

  at the last door there was another
constable talking to the one on duty
when he saw latimer he stiffened to
attention brought his hand to the
brim of his helmet the most meticu-
lously prussian military officer would
have found it hard to lay his finger on
anything wrong with the salute but
in it there was something of what in
all services and all ages has been
called dumb insolence

  the man was lane

  mrs latimers compliments sir
he said stiffly and will you come
round to your apartment at once
alan latimer did not want to go
the memory of the girl ailsa was too
fresh in his mind dreams of a future
in which she played a prominent part
were not lacking

  that can wait said pemberthy
  oh i dont know   h
raiders of the solar frontier



  of course it can wait

  and who the hell are you to give
me orders affecting my private life
come to think of it-you and your
long lanky sidekick are ruddy anx-
ious to get me aboard your damned
ship theres a catch in it somewhere
but i dont want to be bumped off the
same as kimball all the same id
better play ball my way up to a
point cant afford to split brass-rags
when the alien ship may be on top of
us at any moment   

  but he said i think id better go
captain he nanaged a mirthless
grin you know what women are
i think youd better come with
us wood stated flatly no trace of
emotion was evident in his voice in
his eyes but latimer knew that the
index finger of the commanders right
hand had tightened about the trigger
of his gun

  latimer glanced about him there
were too many witnesses for a mur-
der in addition to lane and the con-
stable on duty there were three more
policemen just coming out of the
administration offices and there were
a half dozen of thunderqueens pas-
sengers men and women coming
along the wide corridor

  it should have been reassuring yet
he had the feeling that wood would
as soon shoot him down in front of
all ceres as in private

  no he said my wife wants me
and id better go but that matter we
talked over in kimballs office you
have my word that im in favor  

  the dull expressionless eyes stared
into his then we have your
word

  havent i just told you

  good and as for your visit to the
ship some other time perhaps
thats what you think thought
latimer he gave the two merchant
officers a perfunctory salute strode
down the corridor with steps that he
tried to make not too hurried and the
uneasy feeling in the small of his

back persisted until he had put a
bend of the passage between himself
and pemberthy and wood

he had every intention of going
straight to his apartment he
was curious as to the reason for laur-
annes summons and he was grate-
ful to her for having extricated him
from what he felt to have been an
awkward situation awkward it was
more than that he became aware that
his underclothing was clammy with
perspiration knew that he had ex-
perienced a fear altogether beyond
even the most unpleasant and terrify-
ing events of his past life he told
himself that this was because this
was the first time that he had forced
himself to stand up to a real emer-
gency in cold blood during his serv-
ice career a recklessness an unthink-
ing bravery had stood him in good
stead-until the black day that this
same recklessness spelled the ruin
of his career and all his hopes thats
what it was he told himself but the
explanation wasnt convincing

 he was deep in thought as he
turned the corner into the corridor
on which his apartment was situated
unseeing blind and deaf to all else
but the problem in his brain he let
his feet carry him around the fa-
miliar curve and when he cannoned
into something firm yet soft some-
thing that said well really he
was taken by surprise and off bal-
ance staggered and almost fell if
ailsa rae had not caught his arm he
would have fallen

 wrapped in thought and clothed
in haste she said mockingly and
hurrying home like a good hus-
band 

 why yes but not too good im
afraid  

the girl fell in step beside him
latimer was walking more slowly
now matching his pace to hers he
was telling her his troubles his wor-

           when jud lee carried that helpless heiress into a
           martian ruin he thought he was saving her life
           from the red planets vengeance he never suspected
           that he was only carrying her across the thresh-
           hold to a lost world a hundred times more deadly

  the last great empire of mars a series
of fertile islands in the heart cf a shallow
toarshlike sea near the equator came
abruptly to an end sometime in the darb
ages of earth less than a thousand mar-
tian years have passed since the med sands
swallowed the sea of raba and its several
score doomed cities and towns   

  it was in the last years of the empire
that science reached its peak during the
reign of raba dagan the wise scientists
shook off the shackles of gravitation and
voyaged in huge metal ships to the moons
and to venus and earth the trading ships
of raba exploited the savage tribes exist-
ing at either pole and her miners reopened
long-abandoned mines rimming the dead
tea bottoms

  then with the death of raba dagan
came the rst of a series of plundering



voldurians better known as toads gray-
fleshed lumpy four-foot entities from
outer space and almost overnight the sea
of raba vanished the hungry red sands
unchecked now swallowed the ravaged
islands and buried the domes

  to the north and to the south fled the
survivors there to battle and mingle their
blood with the dwindling savage descend-
ants of earlier civilizations yet the memory
of their vanished fertile homeland persisted
in their legends and was woven into the
intricate structure of their theism

  the dune-buried islands and dead cities
became a lost paradise that was to be
eventually restored to its pristine culture

ud lee ran stubby
brown fingers through
ihis snowy hair before
he let the pressure
helmet drop back in
place despite the
laboring pressure
pumps the air in the leaky cabin of
the prospecting helicopter was un-
comfortably thin for the last three
days he had lived eaten and slept al-
most exclusively in his pressure suit

  lopez he called as he snapped
on the ship-to-ship audiophone

  the receivers in his helmet rattled
in response have to check for loose
connections or use the spare helmet
he decided he bumped the trans-
parent face-plate with a hooded wrist
and the voice cleared

      speaking

  almost in the heart of raba de-

pression he said his eyes continu-
ing their endless sweep of the deso-
late dunes and ridged hollows no
sign of water or desert growth two
ruined cities off to the north one
just ahead

  no luck here either vincent
lopezs voice was unsteady we
have but a week remaining my
friend

  if we could only blast the toads
out of the northern canals wed have
water in plenty ten cruisers from
earth would do the trick but we do
nothing let them force us off mars
or use all our profits buying water
si agreed lopez bitterly but
the rhett peace pact says no for
no longer raiding venus and earth
we give the northland of mars to the
invaders

finger in the pie their polar water-
ways are free of grafting voldurians
lopez grunted assent reminds
me-seen anything of that sml pas-
senger liner reported missing yes-
terday 

  nope uh wait a minute some-
thing down here outcrop of rock
maybe or a building   

  dropping down to a hundred feet
   uh oh its the ship all right
half buried in a dune and shattered
must have exploded

  whats your position jud lee
snapped back the readings easing the
heli down toward the base of the
marching dune

  stepping out to look her over
lopez stand by

  heading for you visibility almost
zero sandstorm kicking up lopez
snapped out something in disgusted
spanish

  not bad here better climb above
it so long

  lee took his featherweight sand
spade and left the helis cabin on the
side opposite the stiff southern
breeze he swung to the left around
the swirling turtle-paced toe of the
marching hillock of ruddy sand here
it was more sheltered and in a dozen
paces he had reached the twisted
debris of the half-covered wreck

  he cleared away the sand swiftly
in two minutes he had wriggled
through the burst-open cabins wall
he gulped at what he saw

 a minute later he was calling
lopez five passengers and three
crew members all dead
emergency call made it six pas-
sengers one female

  all men lee frowned at the slow-
ly advancing wall of sand particles
the breeze was growing in power
she may have been thrown free
cabin split open like a nut

 well radio from the base
lopezs voice was strained getting
really knotty here jud better take
off before it gets you

  the transmitter of the little mexi-
can partner of jud lee clicked off
the water prospectors and mineralo-
gists of northern mars incorporated
always worked in pairs and jtiever at
greater distances than forty miles
from one another so the desert storm
would soon be upon lee

  he took off the sudden blast of thin
air as he topped the dunes almost
smashing him downward again he
climbed as fast as the sky props
blades permitted and his hands froze
on the controls

  a pinpoint of light blossomed in
the growing dusk of swirling dust
clouds and endured for brief seconds
-an emergency flare less than a
quarter mile to the north it was he
headed toward it and finally spotted
a pressure-suited shape kneeling in
the shelter of a minor dune

 somehow he landed less than a
dozen feet beyond the woman she
came crawling through the blast of
the sky prop and he yanked her into
the cabin he sent the ship lurching
skyward and once clear of the sand
locked its controls for  feet

  the helmet slid from the womans
dusty head he saw a tear-stained face
and long reddish-brown hair her
eyes were big blue and staring with
the terror she had known lee took
in the flabby cheeks and the pouting
lips and did not like what he saw

  im thirsty she said give me
some water

  lee held a water flask for her and
pushed her hands away after the first
swallows uh uh he said

give me that water grandpa she
snarled weakly at him my fatherll
put you back at mining if you dont
your father will lee laughed
and whos he

 commander banton you fool
now give me that drink

  lee stuffed the flask into his pres-
sure suits zippered belly pouch he
snapped on the transmitter calling
lopez again between call for his
under martian sands



comrade he studied his unwelcome
passenger

 so youre louse banton he
mused worst spoiled brat on mars
and from south mars tool

  my name is lois the girl fairly
screamed and i am not a brat

  shut up ordered lee abruptly
yeah thiss lee you okay lopez
great   

  got the girl jet-happy little dame
left the wreck and started off on foot
honest    bantons daughter  

  lois slapped at lees tough pres-
sure mask and he held her off with
one hand grinning sourly at her
gasping rage

  meet you at base he concluded
in an hour or so

half an hour later he was not
so sure hed make the base he
was making no headway against the
raging torrent of sand-laden atmos-
phere  in fact he guessed he was los-
ing the battle and the battered helis
cabin was slowly wrenching apart at
its welded seams

  once hed climbed to four thou-
sand feet to find the wind yet more
turbulent there cross currents of air
had tossed the little mapping ship
about and forced him groundward
and the power of the hurricane had
kept growing

  both he and the banton girl were
strapped into their seats as the heli
slammed about crazily abruptly the
controls went lifeless in his hands
something had given way helpless-
ly they were carried before the storm
the instruments were crazy here in
the raba depression they were far
below the arbitrary sea level as it was
and now they could not be read cor-
rectly

 may crash any minute lopez
lee shouted through his throat mike

  uselessly lopezs faint voice was
requesting his position but before
lee could answer the crash came a
freakish swirl of the sand-laden air

slowed the ship momentarily and it
dropped like a rock there was a
brutal snapping impact and then a
blackness the storm could not equal

 after a time lee was conscious
of the cutting blast of air that probed
through a great split in the top of
the cabin only now the roof was in
front of him there was the taste of
salty blood in his mouth and he was
no longer strapped in the control
chair

  clumsily he groped to the locker
where the protective sand masks were
stored and took out two of them one
he slipped over his pressure helmet
and the other he took to the girls
sprawled body

 keep your filthy paws off me she
snarled savagely his audiophones rat-
tled her breath gurgled unevenly

  she clawed at his hands but he
persisted in his task of strapping on
the mask and an extra belt of water
flasks and oxygen cylinders she was
only semi-conscious and he was
forced to carry her toward the gap-
ing rent only then did complete
understanding return to her

 what-where are we going she
demanded pettishly

  have to start off on foot look for
a deserted city or other shelter

  lois banton laughed nastily hah
you laughed at my ignorance in leav-
ing the wrecked flyer and now you
do the same

  lee shrugged sure you crashed
in comparatively decent weather the
wreckage remained exposed but in
five minutes ten feet of sand may
bury the heli the dunes build swiftly
in such a hurricane

  the girl gazed fearfully at the ris-
ing level of sifting sand over what
had been the control panels she fairly
flung herself at the opening lee
caught her sand boots just in time
and pulled her back calmly he
snapped a ringed ten-foot line of
tough nylon into her belt and into his
own then he checked his sand spade


out of this world adventures

pouched solar torch and pressure-
proof zippered holster where his com-
pact machine-gun lay

  we could anchor ourselves to the
ship by a hundred-foot line he told
her calmly as he set the transmitter
for thirty-second intervals of auto-
matic signals but wed soon be
buried too only chance is drifting
before the wind

  loiss eyes were streaming tears
but theres no water out there
she quavered and our oxygen will
run out

  then well use the hand pumps on
our suits lee was angry suddenly
as for water there is little loss per-
haps a pint escapes in a day from
these suits

  he pushed her out the opening and
followed swiftly the blast of the
storm hurrying them along he caught
a glimpse of the heli and a building
ridge of red dust behind it

they stumbled through a ruddy
darkness that rustled and chewed
at their tough pressure envelopes
they leaned back against the wind
their sand boots slogging mechani-
cally along the surge of the storm
currents threatened to send them
hurtling skyward chiplike even the
shifting ridges of the dunes offered
little protection and a moments halt
buried them to the knees

  the curved solidity of a wall jarred
lee back into realization of his sur-
roundings time had lost all mean-
ing and weariness had dulled his
senses he was astonished to discover
lois yet on her feet her body flat-
tened against the obstruction

 domed city he croaked his
throat thick

 the girls teeth showed whitely
through the begrimed faceplates of
her sand mask and helmet she was
trying to speak but he heard nothing
the communication cables linking
them had broken or his audiophone
receiver had finally quit

  he inched along the slow curve
of the vast dome toward the left and
perhaps a hundred feet further along
found a ragged crevice in the semi-
opaque shell roofing the dead citys
dust-choked ruins he squeezed
through to a catwalk of spidery look-
ing but enduring metal and drew
lois in beside him

  only five feet below them the high-
est of the ancient towers and flat-
roofed dwellings sprouted from the
sand lee knew that their bases might
be a hundred feet further down per-
haps more eventually the outer level
cf sand and the inner level would co-
incide that this dome must have been
less badly shattered by the raiding in-
vaders of a thousand years before
he could well believe most of the
dead towns were completely buried

  they moved to the right until the
spurting spray of sand through the
wide slit in the dome could no longer
reach them lee discovered the phone
cable was unlinked and reclipped the
contacts

  im going outside again he told
the girl taking out his solar torch
to mark our entrance then well
hunt for shelter in the ruins

  he lengthened the nylon cord with
another ten foot length before bat-
tling outward again and then above
his head he burned a sooty broad
arrow into the domes crystalline
surface to the left of this he burned
lee in two-foot letters and on the
opposite side of the crevice he put
another longer arrow

  this done he re-entered the huge
dome and lay exhausted upon the
hard metallic ribs of the catwalk lois
was sprawled there too mouth slack
sleeping the effort to stand again
was too great he closed his eyes

t ee was smothering his lungs
gasping for air he struggled to
an elbow and opened his eyes to a
dust-swirling twilight the storm had
not eased while he slept
under martian sands



  the oxygen cylinder was exhaust-
ed stale air sickened him and his
temples were throbbing as he
switched over to the spare tank when
that was gone theyd have to rely on
the emergency hand pumps to fill
them again with compressed air

  he breathed deeply and switched
on the girls extra tank she stirred
and sat up too he grinned wryly at
her contorted features

  hard bed he said even sand is
better

  lois squirmed uncomfortably
stretching her cramped legs and arms
she stood up looking out over the
mile-wide extent of the domes foggy
disc now what she yawned any
chance of rescue soon

  lee shook his head not until the
storms over may be a day may be a
week our exits blown shut too i see
the crevice by which they had en-
tered was sealed again and a rounded
ramp of sand led down to the domes
uneven floor lee led the way to this
and slid and stumbled down it the
girl trailing

  might as well hole up in the
ruins he advised maybe we can
seal out some of the dust so our hand
pumps will not clog so fast

  lois did not reply she had with-
drawn an arm from her suits inflated
right sleeve and was munching at an
oval bar that looked like candy lee
jerked at her other arm making her
drop the remaining fragment

  thats emergency ration he said
sternly food for a week youre
going to be sorry

  yah spat out the girl grimacing
angrily at him

  suddenly she doubled over her face
paling and yellowing to a hideous
green hue for several minutes she
was violently sick the cramped con-
fines of her helmet and pressure suit
but multiplying the discomforts of a
cramping disgorging stomach

  after a time she was better and le
smothered a smile as she glared at

him he headed again toward the oval
doorway of a rounded tower of seam-
less yellowed plastic the same mate-
rial of which the enormously thick
skin of the dome was constructed

  inside a vast high-ceilinged cham-
ber opened and here the light seemed
to have brightened perhaps because
the dust cloud was thinned lee un-
capped his solar torch cutting its
radiance to less than normal noontime
illumination

  vast murals their colors bright and
fresh and the glistening protective
coating of diamond-hard transparency
unmarred by the centuries covered
the inner walls lee blinked his eyes
startled as he saw familiar animals
and vegetation not of mars but of
earth and then he recalled the leg-
ends of the savage natives of the
polar waterways stories of great ships
crossing to earth and venus

  one wall depicted scenes of earth
jungles seas and cultivated country-
sides with hilltop castles and thatched
huts of stone one figure was that
of a mailclad warrior astride a masked
and hooded horse here was that
proof that martians had visited earth
during the middle ages this and the
relief maps just below the murals

  the other wall represented scenes
on venus recognizable to lee al-
though he had never been there frog-
like natives butrads he saw and the
ever-present aquatic growth of thidin
vines the paintings were as lifelike
and colorful as three-dimensional
photographs

 this must have been old raba
dagans headquarters lois he said
turning to the pale-faced girl

  they were now near the further end
of the lofty hall where twin oval
ports stood invitingly open the right
hand door opened into a smaller room
its walls also decorated with pictures
lois stepped inside and lee followed

  sudden emptiness opened in the pit
of lees stomach it was like a long-
continued drop into a mine-shaft the


out of this world adventures

oyal opening into the outer chamber
gave way to a blurring succession of
rock strata and black galleries

  lois so far forgot her dislike for
lee that she clung to his arm in ter-
ror were falling she screamed
stop us stop us

  dont worry he told her this
is probably an automatic elevator of
some sort

  as though to confirm his words the
room slowed and stopped opposite
another oval doorway they stepped
out into a dreary cavern of a room
that was lightless save for lees solar
torch for another ten seconds or so
the platform remained opposite and
then it sank away smoothly into the
depths

  only a faintly luminous mistiness
smokily brown and falling steadily
was to be seen in the square shaft

  now what vac brain demanded
the girl were stuck here maybe a
mile below the surface

  the other shaft should have a cur-
rent of this same inert gas rising up-
ward lee suggested lets see

  they took the four steps neces-
sary to reach the other opening look-
ing down into a vacancy like that they
had just quitted lois laughed jeer-
ingly apparently her stomach was
returning to normal and she was
again her usual disagreeable sel

 disappointed grandpa she
asked

 lois was possibly nineteen or
twenty and lee was twenty-five it
was his prematurely snow-white hair
that earned this nickname a freakish
result of a glancing bullet in one of
the unending affrays between miners
of sml and his own company he
grinned after all hed called her
louse first

  nup be another platform along
soon

  a minute passed lois sniffed tri-
umphantly and then a bulky some-
thing came sliding softly up from be-
low and came to rest in the shaft its

oblong entrance almost exactly
matched that of the mysterious bar-
ren chamber

  going up miss banton asked
lee no charge

  lois shook her head violently no
lets keep going down and see whats
there we might find a treasure or
mines

  there was new respect in lees
voice as he agreed it took a certain
amount of courage or bravado to
go downward into the unknown when
a way to the surface was waiting
despite her words her voice had qua-
vered a trifle at the end

  a moment later they were aboard
a platform in the other shaft and
dropping steadily downward

the platform cage glided to a
stop again its seventh and a
well-lighted corridor lay beyoid the
oval port lois wept swiftly out of
the unmoving compartment with lee
at her side and for the first time he
noticed how their pressure suits
wrinkled and flapped about their
bodies

  he tested tho outer pressure by
cracking the helmet valve there was
no escape of oxygen gingerly he
sniffed sniffed again more deeply-
and tugged at his helmet until it
loosened and hung back on his shoul-
der hinges

  clean air he cried air with the
smell of flowers and green growing
things in it moist air

  lois followed suit for several long
sobbing breaths they were content to
stand there and suck in the heady
fragrance of the thick air it made
them dizzy after a time forced them
to breathe more shallowly as they
peeled off their cumbersome pressure
gear

  how deep would we be demand-
ed lois before air pressure equaled
earth normal

  plenty deep lois and the air is
moist
under martian sands



 so what our domes in south
mars are the same

 lee muttered something uncom-
plimentary about toad lovers and
started down the corridor for sev-
eral hundred feet it extended straight
as an arrow a softly glowing tube
of perhaps twenty feet in diameter
the girl hurried after lee

 their now useless pressure suits
and helmets as well as the useless
sand gear they left behind finally
lee spoke

  moisture means water possibly an
underground lake or sea north mars
incorporated wouldnt have to close
its mines weve been in the red for
the past two years buying all our
water from the toads

  im glad theyre not in our hemi-
sphere agreed lois

 yeah cynicism dripped from
the word his lips uncurled sorry
forget youre just a brat shouldnt
be taking out my dislike for sml
on you

  im nineteen the girl cried and
no brat but most of us do feel sorry
for your people in the north-the
women and children that is
thought youd qualify it
suddenly lee halted and his right
hand went down to the gas-powered
pocket gun holstered at his hip it
contained a clip of a thousand biaton-
tipped needles-each needle an ex-
plosive miniature grenade because
the needles were expelled rather than
fired the common term of expoder
was given them

 a forty-foot section of corridor
had lost its glowing coating it lay
jumbled and dull on the floor and
the slimy darkness of water puddled
there as well on the left a branch-
ing corridor also in darkness opened
and there lee thought he had de-
tected movement

 his hand fell away he laughed
at himself how could there be life
here in this long-deserted necropolis
of course the weird elevator shafts

yet functioned and there was the mys-
terious light but in other abandoned
cities earthmen had discovered vast
atom-powered machines purring un-
tended after thousands of years at
port bemis his homedome all the
power they needed for lights and
heat came from a single martian
power plant

  carefully he picked his way over
the debris by the dim light from be-
yond he passed the intersecting
emptiness a smaller unlighted way
and then a scrabbling sound came to
him probably lois he started to
turn

  jud behind you the girls voice
screamed

  his leisurely movements changed
he flung himself forward and spun
about dropping to his knees with the
expoder jutting from his fist he saw
three dwarfish squatty shapes heavy
clubs upraised almost upon him
they must have come from the un-
lighted passage

  and then the hand gun sewed its
needles across their torsos those
missing the targets exploding against
the corridors wall a miniature series
of thunderclaps boomed along the
way but even as the echoes died away
the last of his attackers fell

  lee came forward warily his solar
torch at plus sunlight searching into
the other tunnel for other foes it
was empty to a depth of perhaps a
hundred feet but it curved to the
right and therefore he could see no
further

  he turned again to the fallen men
discovering them to be dwarfed hu-
manoid creatures thick-shouldered
and hairy their teeth yellowed fangs
and with foreheads little higher than
their bulging frontal sinuses two of
the naked beast-men were dark-
haired and the other covered with
matted straw-colored hair yet among
the native martians of the polar
regions black hair was almost un-
known  reddish-blond hair coarse


out of this world adventures

and thick as fur being their natural
covering

  and the size of their chests when
compared with the vast lung cavities
of the polar natives was pitifully in-
adequate they were warped bow-
legged and gnarled with the filthy
skin under their coarse-haired cover-
ing whiter than that of lois

  he returned to the girl

  better go back hadnt we he
asked

  she bit her sagging lip and her
damp eyes grew hot her body
straightened defiantly stooping over
a dead savage she found his club a
knotted cudgel longer than a mans
forearm and lifted it she moved past
lee come on grandpa she chal-
lenged leading the way

  lee moved up beside her his hand
gun in his fingers and his eyes alert
together they strode down the seem-
ingly unending length of the huge
tube foolhardy it was perhaps but
the water-hunger that only a native-
born martian knows burned hot in
both their hearts

  something of the mans excitement
and flaming hope had touched the
girl in her eyes was the same over-
powering lust for water and more
water that rivaled mankinds earlier
madness for gold

less than half a mile the gal-
lery extended into the misty
glow of its inner walls then they
came out on a wide ledge of stone
its outer wall of living granite waist-
high and realized that they perched
near the roof of a vast subterranean
abyss on either side the ledge ex-
tended unbroken an observation plat-
form for the long-vanished citizens
of the raba depression

  this must have been a zoological
garden a living museum of earth
whispered lois softly

  the cavern floor a thousand feet
below was almost five miles in length
and half as wide and three-fourths

of its area was island-rimmed water

 directly beneath them a grassy
miniature tableland sprouted oddly
familiar structures of stone-castles
and crazily constructed little huddles
of thatched huts the castles four
in all were in ruins but about the
last of them to the right two-legged
figures were moving there too were
a few patches of tilled ground with
rowed dottings of cultivated green

  and rimming the lake basking in
the all-pervading glow of light simi-
lar to that of the corridor lifted a
mighty tangled forest of familiar and
unfamiliar trees

  those wild men were earthmen
lee moved slightly away from the
girls too-obvious nearness i thought
their structure was decidedly unmar-
tian too-slight lung capacity

  must be old king raba dagan had
quite a zoo lois lolled on the rocky
parapets flat top and studied the
scene below suppose theres another
cave like this for venusian fauna
and stuff

  lee massaged a knuckle thought-
fully he nodded ufa huh those
murals those paintings were adver-
tising the wonders of the strange life
imprisoned here

  this is a paradise though all this
water means nmi wont have to close
down after all

  loiss laugh was nasty if we can
get topside yes dont forget the sand
has covered the opening and your sig-
nal is buried we may be trapped here
forever

  i hope not probably by now lopez
is starting to hunt for us or soon
will be and the crack in the dome
may be uncovered again

  isnt it thrilling though gramp
giggled lois were like castaways
-adam and eve in a garden-har-
veth and elise on luna

  martian hill-dog and a desert cat
in a bag more likely said lee dryly
and were not alone either look
coming
under martian sands



  she turned to look in the direction
his hand gun indicated to the left
they saw a tall broad-shouldered
man his thick black beard like a mane
down across his hairy chest and an
ancient explosive-type rifle in his
hand his only garment was a rough
but effective swathing of animal hide
about his hips he was less than
twenty feet from them and the small
black eye of the rifle was upon them

  behind the savage-apjearing crea-
ture clustered a dozen of the twisted
dwarfs more beasts than men that
they had already encountered

for a long moment they front-
ed one another unmoving before
the strangers weapon dropped away
and his beard split to reveal uneven
white teeth his voice was deep and
unsteady the words blurred by alien
pronunciation

  good day sirs he said apparent-
ly mistaking loiss golden slacks and
brown jacket for a masculine outfit

 greetings thug chirped lois
she grinned at lees warning frown
in an undertone she demanded isnt
that a perfectly good caveman title

  lee grunted something about fools
and their heads ending in two sepa-
rate sectors of space

  hello he said quietly earth-
man

 indeed i am said the bearded
giant advancing we are all earth-
men his arm indicated the motley
knot of little monsters at his heels

  but you are more recently arrived
eh

 the big man grimaced his under-
standing thirty years ago my father
found this horrible place he came
from the desert after his ship was
crushed in landing

  lees eyes were shining the first
spacers landed about then what is
your fathers name

 grant ashley he is dead now
he pulled an ancient pocket-watch of
worn soft gold from a pouch beneath

his great beard one hundred twenty
days and-almost an hour from now

-ago

  lois bowed her head over it i
see she laughed how you knew
thirty years have passed you couldnt
miss seeing this

  but you dont look to be that old
the big mans eyes were fixed on
the girl he took a step toward her
hands clawed in a horrible hungry
sort of way and then another a
ghastly bubbling cry of misery and
unbelieving joy wrung from his lips

 a woman-an earth woman
he mumbled always they told me i
must mate with the ugly little shes
but now gash has a woman

  lois backed away uncertainly- get-
ting behind lee lee grimaced with
distate but held his ground

  my woman he said sorry
then i must fight you for her
the big savage dropped his rifle and
bared his teeth then in imitation of
lee sorry

  lee shook his head the little hes
may fight so over their women not
so real earthmen they let the woman
choose

 the bearded man scratched his
shaggy head his beard again covered
his teeth he grunted grudging as-
sent but he continued to regard lois
hungrily lee knew the truce would
not last

  my father married a little she
he told lee and the girl he pointed
down into the cavern valley toward
the castle with the cultivated fields
mine he added proudly you come
there please

 how many of the dwarf-men are
there lee wanted to know as they
studied the valley

  gash fiddled with his huge splayed
fingers his lips moving as he counted
laboriously and silently

 maybe sixty-one sixty-two or
three perhaps some have rebelled
and hide in the forests or in the val-
ley of the frog people


ouf of this world adventures

 lee nodded the venusians
where does it open off this valley

  gash indicated the dark opening
at the left-hand end of the valley
there he said savagely some day
i will lead my people into it again
are there other valleys more
lakes

 the bearded man grunted at
other end of the cavern but all is
water there and the light is bad al-
most gone also huge swimming
things fill the water

  lee looked at lois and then mean-
ingly down into the cavern she
shook her head slightly he turned
to gash

  we must return to our friends
he said extending his hand but we
will return again soon

  the big man scowled but he took
lees hand suddenly he jerked the
flyer toward him and his other fist
crunched into lees jaw a second
blow landed on his temple and he
felt his legs crumpling under him
feebly he struggled to strike back
to reach his expoder

  he heard lois screaming and he
saw the pipestem crooked legs of the
degenerate warriors about him with
the last fading senses then cool stone
was crushing his lips and nose and
he knew no more

he was penned in a time-
weathered dungeon light seep-
ing through yard-thick walls of
masonry and silvering the cobwebs
festooning the falls and ceilings his
bed was a heap of mildewed weeds
and reeds on a low stone platform
and in the cells center a tiny spring
bubbled up from this a tiny rill
crossed the rocky floor and vanished
into a gaping cavity wider than a
mans skull

  lee went to the narrow slit of the
single window standing on a heap of
debris to do so he looked out over
the weedy patches of cultivated
ground and saw the willow-grown

border of the lake in the garden plots
misshapen little women worked their
naked flesh a hideous fish-belly white
and grotesque little dogs played with
unsmiling tiny children upon the un-
cut grass between the gardens

  the inbred simple-minded inhabit-
ants of this hidden eden beneath
the ruddy desert never laughed and
lee only once heard their unin-
telligible speech raised in a broken
sort of song the proud knights and
their humble serfs brought here from
earth had fallen far from their early
estate

  lee tested the walls searching for
loose masonry that could be removed
he tried the warped metal door and
found it to be strengthened by a sec-
ond sturdy gate of interlocked logs
and branches last of all he examined
the ceiling a dozen feet overhead
and found it had suffered least of all
in the passing years

  his only hope of escape seemed to
be through the opening cut into the
walls by the springs overflow and
toward this he started to move but
a sound of shuffling feet in the corri-
dor beyond arrested his steps and he
faced the doorway the overlooked
clip of needles was worthless as a
weapon

  gash stood in the doorway a fire-
blackened lump of flesh its white-
jointed bone protruding in his left
hand in his other fist was lees
needle-expelling hand gun he tossed
the hunk of meat at lee

 your woman fled from me he
complained his forehead wrinkled
she hides in the forest beside the
lake with the rebellious people
good for her said lee i told
you we earthlings allow the women
to choose

 you must summon her ordered
gash then when she is close i can
capture her

  go in a vacuum lee told him he
gnawed at a huge mouthful of the
underdone meat
under martian sands



  you refuse gash took a threat-
ening step forward

  lee gave the bone and most of the
meat back to the bearded giant-in
the teeth he followed the hurled
missile with his fists and the weight
of his tough sand boots but the big
man weathered the storm easily one
big hand seized lee and hurled him
stunned against the further wall of
the dungeon

  he paused only to pick up the mis-
used joint of meat

 when you grow hungry he
roared you will be glad to call your
woman for me

  lee felt the numbness leaving his
battered flesh he made no sign he
knew gash was about instead he
began masticating the mouthful of
meat he had retained

 the bearded savage growled and
lunged off along the corridor beyond
and as his footsteps grew inaudible
lee came to his hands and knees and
crawled over to the spring to drink
then despite the pain that every
movement brought he lowered him-
self into the water-slimed cavity
where the little rill disappeared

  his feet found a footing on a nar-
row ledge then his elbows locked him
in the narrowness of the crooked
channel as he slowly descended once
he stuck fast and for perhaps twenty
minutes hung there with the falling
water saturating and chilling his
coveralls and the garments beneath

  then cloth ripped along his back
and he was precipitated suddenly
downward about eight feet into a
thigh-deep pool with a slimy mud
bottom he groped about in the icy
depths his solar torch gone along
with his hand gun and came up a
gradual slope of possibly twenty feet
in all to a waterless expanse of rock

  the echoes hollow and booming
of his boots on the rocky floor in-
formed him that he was inside a lower
cavity of considerable area he groped
along the edge of the pool found

where it overflowed and followed the
escaping thread of water

  he squeezed through narrow slits
in the rocky walls and traversed vast
chambers where a faint rippling play
of electricity revealed inky pools and
lakes he heard splashings that only
living things could make and he
armed himself as best he could with
a keen-edged splinter of rock twice
as large as his palm in the depths
darting trails of pale light marked
the passage of the watery denizens

  three times he lept his cramped
limbs and aching muscles awakening
him before he was rested he was
hungry his stomach crying out for
the food that successfully evaded his
attempts to scoop it from the growing
bitterness of the cavern pools

 then came the moment when he
wriggled upward through a narrow-
ing slot of dank rock above the gur-
gling rush of piled-up water and
saw light ahead

  once beyond the narrowing of the
walls he hobbled along a widening
ledge for a hundred yards-and
emerged through a trailing curtain of
venusian thidin vines and lacy crim-
son-hued swamp air into a watery
valley yet larger than that of the
earthmen

  floating islands of thidin dotted
the foggy surface of the steaming
lake and along the narrow shoreline
the fruit-heavy bushes of the nik-nik
clustered their orangehued husks
were specked scarlet

  lee ate the ripe fruit the faded
globes of brown with the enlarged
splotches of red as slowly as his
hunger permitted nor did he have
his fill of the crisp salmon-hued pulp
and its thumb-sized black seeds when
he reluctantly pushed off into the pale
jungle

he slept once before he discov-
ered the linking passageway
with the earth cavern it was near
the mile-high arch of the caverns


out of this world adventures

roof and led upward a well-worn
trail had grooved the stubborn sur-
face of rock to a depth of an inch

  in the venusian cavern he had only
once seen a noseless gray-hued frog
and that lop-eared aborigine had been
paddling a living raft of thidin out
in the lake of the earthmen reputed
to have taken refuge in the lower val-
ley he saw not a sign

  he emerged hours later into a tree-
roofed tunnel piercing the forest he
had taken but a dozen steps along
this narrow way when a tangle of
vines and braided ropes of hide and
grass fell about him

 he struggled despairingly his
keen-edged stone slashing madly yet
for every strand he severed two or
three more nooses fell about him at
last he lay helpless

  three of the crooked beast-men of
the lost cavern gathered about him
prancing proudly and thumbing the
points of their rusty dagger-like
knives suggestively and then a
pleased gurgle of laughter made him
turn his head in the other direction

  lois banton bent over him and be-
gan loosing the cocoon of ropes she
had changed greatly in the short time
they had been apart and lee won-
dered if perhaps more than four or
five days by martian reckoning had
passed for under her flapping ragged
garments the muscles moved lithely
and the superfluous flesh had melted
from her face

  have you loose in a minute she
said olar you and ktton help
me bron can keep watch

  glad youre still free grunted
lee and was amazed to discover that
he really meant it

  weve been trying to locate you
said lois but this eternal dayshine
is bad only at the sleeping hour did
we dare venture from the forests

  the last of the ropes fell away and
lee stood up he saw now that lois
had an ancient-looking cross-hilted
sword in a clumsy scabbard of dried

black leather and that two of the
squatty club-armed hunters wore
floppy sleeveless jerkins of battered
chain mail

  found the armory of one castle
explained lois noting his curious
gaze never did get to rescue you
though our friend with the beard
kept a guard posted she cocked an
eyebrow howd you do it

 lee explained his escape she
nodded

  ive been in the other cavern once
frogs arent friendly any more since
olar-she indicated the largest of
the three renegade dwarfs-refused
to let them eat his woman

 they understand english then
and speak it

  lois grinned in a superior fashion
naturally ashley tried to teach
them modern english among other
things he was horribly crippled
often lay helpless for weeks result
of spacers crash so his brief attempts
at schooling them accomplished
little

  lee dug into his inner pockets
his hand emerging at last with the
useless clip of biaton needles for his
captured hand gun he showed them
to the girl

  if youll let me have that dagger
he said pointing to the blade she
carried thrust through her sword-belt
ill try manufacturing a bomb
lois handed it over reluctantly
needles are dangerous to tinker
with arent they she demanded

  uh huh but we cant cut our way
through to the dome-lifts with just
clubs and a sword not against an ex-
poder and a high-powered rifle

  lee seated himself beside the trail
and motioning the others away set
to work on the delicate task of ex-
posing the metal-encased pinpoint of
explosive biaton at the tip of three
needles in his hand gun the razor-
edged trimmer key armed the needles
only as they were expelled to ex-
plode upon contact with anything
under martian sands



more substantial than air but this
way he was holding in his hands a
death more susceptible than nitro
glycerin to sudden jolts

 with sticky gum from a bruised
tree he gingerly sealed all the needles
into their clip leaving the three
armed needles projecting further
then he looped a slender strip of hide
about the deadly thing and ran the
thong up and over a low limb secur-
ing the other end with a loosely
driven peg

  directly beneath the clip of explo-
sive needles lay a barely exposed reef
of greenish-gray rock where only
lichens and moss could root last
of all he knotted another thin strand
of hide about the peg and -ran it
knee-high across the trail where he
quickly and properly secured it to
another limb

  his death trap clumsy though it
was was complete now he must lure
the childish bearded giant into it

  even as he plotted the mans de-
struction he could not but feel pity
for the poor brute had the man been
unarmed or alone he would have
risked capturing him with snares or
even attempted to escape from the
cavern without further conflict

  but he could take no chances on
the bearded giant recapturing or kill-
ing them news of this plentiful sup-
ply of the fluid life-blood of mars
must be carried outside whatever the
cost

  gash must die

  lee started down the trail toward
the castles and then retraced his
steps he tore the cord from the limb
and knotted other lengths to it the
blank-faced beast-men and the girl
regarded him curiously

  at a distance of a hundred yards
well inside the tunnel toward the
venusian cavern he posted lois with
the looped end of the cord in her
grip

  we must be sure it is their leader
he said a wandering animal or

dwarf might set off the bomb can you
do it

  the girls lips tightened but her
grave eyes were steady on lees

  certainly she said simply

twice jud lee showed himself
briefly he could not be too ob-
vious before gash and ten of his
brute-men came charging out of the
ruined castle after him

  at first he ran easily allowing
gash to gain on him and then he
was sprinting desperately to keep
safely in advance the prodigious
bounds of gash put him far in ad-
vance of his hairy followers

 he passed the ledge of exposed
stone but a dozen paces in advance of
the bearded savage a lead that was
swiftly being whittled down and
then flung himself to the left behind
a sheltering inky black boulder

  there was a terrible explosion

  he stood up at last ears ringing
and looked back toward the shallow
pit in the trail he saw gash weapon-
less and broken his eyes and fore-
head a bloody mass of ripped flesh
crawling sightlessly toward him

  lois had given the rope too late
a tus probably waiting for him to
reach shelter and gash was beyond
its full fury

  he ran around the blinded man to
where the satiny metal of his hand
gun shone and sent a burst of explo-
sive needles over the cowering heads
of the hairy men they broke before
this new menace raced back along the
way they had come

 then he turned back toward the
crawling bloody mass of flesh that
was gash reluctant to destroy him
yet knowing that the man was better
dead in all the earth cavern only
gash might lead an attack against
them

  but the bearded savage had disap-
peared nor did a half hour of search-
ing uncover his trail

  im glad he escaped said lois


out of this word adventures

as they climbed the winding ramps
to the upper gallery and the lifts
we have the guns now in a few
minutes well be in the dome

  i feel the same admitted lee he
couldnt stop us now

  they hurried along the shining cor-
ridor the three rebellious beast men
accompanying them and lee had time
to consider the future the storm
would be long over now he could
tunnel out through the sand and burn
outsized symbols on the dome then
they could return to the depths until
help arrived

  they passed the unlighted strip of
tunnel where the clean-stripped
bones of the two beast men lay and
came to the lift

  lee halted his throat constricting
and the girl squeezed his arm sym-
pathetically

  the huddle of equipment pressure
suits helmets sand spade and spare
belts was gone the dusty floor of
the passage was empty where it had
lain the imprint of splayed naked
feet was yet visible gash and his
warriors had carried them off and
they might never be found again

 in fact the curiosity of gash
might impel him to tear the suits and
pumps apart to ruin them hopelessly

  he looked at lois and her eyes
were steady and calm like him she
must have been digesting the knowl-
edge that they were trapped here now
for a long time for he doubted his
ability to contrive a workable pres-
sure suit and pumps out of the crude
materials at hand

  the thought of enduring her con-
stant companionship was not unpleas-
ant now that privation and danger
had revealed the real character that
years of self-indulgence had failed
to destroy theyd quarrel and she
would insult him and bully him un-
mercifully at times he knew

  she must have sensed what he was
thinking wordlessly she came closer
and lifted her face toward his

 break it up a muffled voice
sounded behind them they turned

 lopez cried lee howd you
find us

  lopez finished removing his hel-
met revealing a trim moustache and
handsome features his smile was
dazzling and all for the girl

  this fortune-hunter making trou-
ble he inquired maliciously

  lee shook his partners shoulders
how he demanded

  lopez waved an airy hand that
nothing plotted direction of storms
path and your last position discov-
ered dome explored same and here
i am

 he turned again to the amused
girl

  now he said warmly you are
safe at last miss banton i vincent
lopez will see that no harm befalls
you there is nothing to fear   

  except you supplied lee grin-
ning come along lois lets show
our friend what paradise looks like

            had she betrayed humanitys last stronghold to
            the conquerors from the giant planet-or had
            she sold only herself for a tyrants harem

  by j harvey haggard

era you space
gypsy youve be-
trayed us here in the
dantes ridges of ur-
anus-the last out-
post of man-

  ill not forget her
soon standing there in the green rays
of the twin moons while above us
the blue ships of the jovians like
giant malignant crystals edged over
the jagged escarpments and began
descending

  theyre looking for me she had
said simply i was to meet them
here

  she didnt lock like a traitress for
that matter she didnt seem to be-
long in the hidden chem-laboratories
though that was where her cunning
little mind had wrought seeming mir-
acles her face was oval sweet and
enchanting like that of a sprite with

large blue eyes that melted my heart
away every time she so much as
looked at me even in the rugged garb
of a fighting scout her slender figure
possessed an allure that was astonish-
ing for those same garments on
others looked worn and ugly a short
kilt a high breast vestment with red
celluline space boots

  i said mera youre crazy your
brains got the whirling orbits youre
coming away with me whether you
like it or not i seized her bodily
then but she struggled and her blue
eyes looked into mine and her tiny
ruby lips brushed my own my dar-
ling i breathed but she protested
my muscles went to water-but i
kissed her yes there with the jov-
ians wheeling down like ravenous
buzzards searching for carrion i
thrilled to the embrace of those soft
small arms




out of this world adventures

 not now jan the jovians are
coming later perhaps when that blue
demon they call their napoleon of
space has ceased to plague the uni-
verse with his existence

  i looked away following her gaze
she was staring at the towering
heights far away capped with eternal
snows of frozen air there were the
last remnants of our people survivors
of earth last warriors of the human
race who had been driven here by the
blue hordes of jove their armada
of fighting-crystals had swept down
across the solar system in a seemingly
endless array jnu latha their giant
blue leader had become a terrible leg-
end among earthmen it was said that
having the strength born of a might-
ier planet he had once met ten earth-
men barehanded and had slain them
jnu latha it was said was immortal
and it was the fearful hating earth-
men who had dubbed him the napo-
leon of space

  hes driven us from planet to plan-
et jan said mera were lost if we
keep on fighting the way we have
done and besides im not betraying
you just disobeying orders remem-
ber-

  and there with the crystal-raiders
of jove hurtling down like tangible
thunderbolts i did remember three
days before she had come from the
makeshift cave laboratories with an
impossible scheme

  even a napoleon cannot win for-
ever shed explained we might
take a lesson from terrestrial his-
tory

  were outnumbered yes i had
retorted through gritting teeth but
jnu latha can be killed i know he
can

  it was indicated continued mera
at the autopsy of napoleon bona-
parte or so the ancient histories go
that his later battles were lost because
of a failing pituitary gland as its
functioning lessened lethargy and
fat-headedness resulted

  then lets hope jnu lathas blue
neck begins to shrivel i had explod-
ed contemptuously then three more
wishes cross your fingers in a magical
symbol and spit over your left-

 but you can do the same thing
with rays she had protested ive
done it in the lab and i can do it
again with a tiny portable lamp that
can be hidden in my clothing its
invisible waves will spray out and
destroy the vital glands slowly-

  and you propose to enter the camp
of the enemy train your rays on his
glands and wait until he becomes too
lethargic to command his troops ab-
surd before you do that i will have
sliced his head from his shoulders
with my sword dont even talk of
such a thing

  she hadnt but her little lips had
set tightly and now on the next scout-
ing expedition she told me how she
had communicated with the jovians
on an ionic-beam promising to meet
them and betray the earthmens
whereabouts

  i	whipped a dagger from a sheath
a wavering sliver of gleaming metal

  you win i exclaimed dubiously
but take care of yourself mera
keep this for your own protection
you can keep it hidden when you
pin this blade in your garment the
jeweled haft looks like an ornament

  she shrugged helplessly as i slid
the blade into her harness vestment
leaving only the hilt visible a scin-
tillating crescent of precious stones
as a lethal weapon for protection it
was now perfectly hidden none would
guess that it was anything but
jewelry

  then i turned and ran up a tortuous
channel between high buttes i might
have remained might have died fight-
ing in vain as the ogreish figures
leaped in i might have taken many
blue savages of a distant planet to
the hell-limbo they call kzku but i
would most certainly have been slain
in the end i am not afraid of death
jupiter napoleon



but somehow i couldnt think of it
as long as mera thraddock was alive
a virtual prisoner among the myrmi-
dons of jove

two kecaldes the retrograde
ariel had circled the planet three
times in its satellite orbit that was
the jovian means of measurement for
the passing time long tormenting
weeks as measured by terrestrial
clocks the jovians were encamped in
the fertile floor of a huge extinct
crater while we of earth were en-
trenched in mountainous grottoes liv-
ing on glue-bugs and those creeping
monstrosities we managed to trap in
the caves skirmishes were frequent
during that time but indecisive the
earth commandant gave the order to
attack under the third saffron moons
wan rays during the late hours of
night

  it was a slim chance but we were
becoming desperate that night ten
thousand rugged terrestrial ghosts
rose over the edge of the craters maw
and leaped silently downward fate
smiled the jovian tribes had been
overconfident only the dominance of
jnu latha had served to hold con-
flicting creeds together there were
but few sentinels and these were so
unwary that we overcame them with
little noise then we were down
among the fibre shelter-spreads
raygats snarling forth paeans of
death

 we were like demons risen from
the grave of the past madness surged
within our breasts we fought like
supermen history marks that day no
use to repeat an accounting of that
the blue jovians leaderless and un-
organized were slain like the cattle

they are as they fled in cowardly
panic but they did not escape our
avenging beams i led a detachment
up an escarpment that teemed with
blue warriors and with those earth-
ly hellions at my back we left a
shambles along the terrace below the
rich jovian tent-furnishings of the
warlord

  in the inner chamber i found mera
she stood before a curtained hanging
and looking past i could see jnu
latha the napoleon of space who
seemed to be sleeping

 mera thraddock i exclaimed
jubilantly you glorious little space-
minx blazing universes that wild
plot paid off at a thousand to one
youre all right mera she nodded

  even as napoleon she said draw-
ing the gossamer curtain aside

  history repeats itself i ac-
claimed it was indicated that a
great terrestrial general lost his lead-
ership qualities because a gland
failed-and now-and now- it was
hard to think of jnu latha who had
been so dynamic and ruthless as a
sluggard a mold of human flesh or
sub-human as it were held captive by
internal secretions but mera was
shaking her head

  i	frowned strode into the farther
chamber

  the jovian was nof sleeping his
repose was more fixed than that upon
his naked blue breast glistened a curi-
ous little ornament a crescent of glit-
tering jewels nestled like a sting-
ing bee

  a drop of green blood formed dim-
ming the sparkling hilt as it fell down
upon the bare knees of the napoleon
of space whose darkening blue flesh
was becoming cold as clay
the city of

burkeson and the men from america figured the interplanetary
expedition in search of an invincible weapon was going to be
a cinch there was nothing to stop them-just a lot of silly
martian music boxes floating in the air    until burkeson
blundered on the key that unlocked the symphony from hell

by bryce walton

          he crew was gone
  nwjr captain ballance and
  lt dobson and clev-
  easer ferrell and
  hopkins all of them
   jkm	gone burkeson sat in

the rocket  shadow and thought
about them and hearing the rapid
change in the citys symphonic voice
burkeson knew that soon he would go
and then the rocket would go and

after that-

  his laughter was shrill in the thin
martian night echoing against the
rockets skin and drifting off across
the red desert in his laugh was a
crazy climbing note of lonely fear

  that mounting thunderous destruc-
tion in the music of the city-what
an awful difference he thought wild-
ly and stared info the shadows of dis-
tant city spires its all through the
music now the corruption and hate
and its growing and growing and
we taught them-

 the symphonys theme was
changed forever to the horror that
never existed here before the rocket
came harmonies and sustained notes
in the minor were creeping in the
sombreness of the key of g the brutal
sinister and gloom dramatic violence
of c and the sad agitation of e

  he wondered how long before it
changed enough to be able to destroy
him too with its hate

  it was funny he thought but that



first night when we landed none of
us except clevenger knew why we
were here but they sensed the pur-
pose and at first no one knew what
to do and no one was aware of the
music   

first the necessary routine stuff
the testing of atmosphere and
the observation of surrounding ter-
rain from the safety of the rockets
interior there was the familiar canal
the distant city the barren moun-
tains dead sea-bottoms and that was
all no eight-legged beasts or giant
birds under the double moons

  then they got out and stretched
and breathed the clean crisp air and
looked at each other as though not
quite sure they actually had arrived
and were on the martian desert or
whether they were merely ghosts of
an idea

  they were spared the excitement
of surprise at finding the canals and
the city for that had been observed
and charted through the palomar eye
burkeson felt the music at once but
remained silent as he tried to analyze
it the others didnt seem to hear it
his hyper-sensitive and musically
trained inner ear registered the
sounds that were apparently inaudi-
ble to the others a delicious alien
sensation seemed to swim through
him with his throbbing blood

  captain ballance a blond neatly
singing cubes

uniformed giant stood and looked at
the distant spires of the gleaming
city

  the big question is he said
-life and the others were obvious-
ly thinking of that too burkesona
head was cocked to one side puzzled
wonderment in his eyes no one no-
ticed his odd reaction burkeson was
an oddity anyway a dreamer an un-
realistic sort except in his specialized
field of audio engineering and elec-
tronics

  ferrell the atomics man was sift-
ing sand through his fingers and no-
ticing that it felt much like any other
sand would feel anywhere on man-
hattan or long beach lt dobson
was breaking out a case of rations for
a little celebration though no one

seemed festive ferrell walked over
beside burkeson and ballance he
also looked at the distant city its
softly shifting pastel harmonies flick-
ered in the moonlight

  beautiful burkeson whispered
ferrell said the question is how
alien is life here likely to be his
small fat body shivered and he
folded his arms maybe we cant get
along with em maybe theyll be su-
per-intelligent or savages in either
case maybe theyll be so different
well never be able to get anyplace
with em

  capt ballances cold hard face
turned to the big neutron cannon
mounted between the rockets two
skin casings his voice was grimly
final were not worried ferrell




out of this world adventures

  burkeson said softly but where
would we want to get with them
thats the thing i want to know
there hasnt been any enthusiasm
here like youd expect on a first flight
to mars its all too grim i want to
know what were doing here

 why do humans do anything
ballance said might as well ask that
why did western culture expand and
murder primitives by the millions just
to expand who the devil knows
economics instinct geography a
complexity of causes there may not
be any general reason were on mars
now except that its just a way-sta-
tion to keep on expanding

  clevenger came up with a bottle of
beer in his white hand and a thin
smile on his sardonic face clevenger
the north american defense federa-
tion representative whose presence
lowered ballances title of captain to
only a name as a representative of
the nadf clevenger was part owner
of half the world and his words di-
rectly affected the private and gen-
eral lives of billions

  clevenger said you spoke with
broad generality captain now that
were here and not just because our
aesthetic comrade burkeson has spe-
cifically asked for it i think we
should all know why were here get
any romantic nonsense out of your
heads men this is business he
looked at the city hungrily burke-
son thought

  were here to see if theres any-
thing we can use clevenger said
softly especially in the way of-
weapons

burkeson was sick for a sec-
ond he forgot the strange music
from the city all this planning and
expense and the dreams man had al-
ways had of going to the stars-the
great black mystery of space broken
-and for what a better weapon

  oh lord he thought what could
be more horrible than that more of

an indictment he noticed that none
of the others seemed to care about
clevengers disclosure a lifetime of
militarized regimentation had dulled
their imaginative faculties this thing
was routine to them it was incred-
ible to burkeson sickening

  he said it seems very quiet and
peaceful but it isnt can any of you
hear anything theres music very
muted and slow and much of it lost
to our hearing because of frequency
but it fills the air

 he leaned toward the city the
others stopped whatever they were
doing and listened perhaps they still
didnt notice as strongly as did
burkeson but as they listened they
began to hear shades of what burke-
son had been hearing

  for a while no one said anything
then clevenger smiled thinly and
arrogantly and said

  probably got a big band out to
welcome us probably terrified at our
landing might even think were gods
or something id suggest that we
break out weapons from the arms
locker captain and trek over to the
city and see whats what the city
actually might support some kind of
life that knows weve landed and are
preparing a little surprise welcome
for us

  burkeson closed his eyes oh lord
a band his compatriots didnt un-
derstand at all they havent any
idea what it is this music nor what
kind of highly evolved aesthetics are
necessary to create such glorious
sound

  ballance nodded the necessary or-
ders two men remained to guard
the rocket the rest moved on to the
city armc with neutron rifles and
revolvers and one man carrying a
compression gun firing atomic war-
head shells

  as they approached the city the
music seemed to swell until burkeson
felt that he was breathing it ecstasy
trembled through him so that he
the city of singing cubes



could hardly force himself to walk
on toward the heart of the sound

  he knew now that he never really
had heard music before but only the
most awkward ignorant primitive at-
tempts to create it he had a vague
and magnificent hint now of what
music was

  but-it was too perfect too big and
too beautiful for human senses he
grabbed ballances arm so that the
captain stopped and consequently the
group stopped

  i dont think we should go any
further sir

  what that burkeson

 i dont think its safe that
sounds the result of highly special-
ized development sir its a kind of
perfection that maybe the rest of you
havent sensed as easily as i have im
trained for sound ive a faint idea
what mastery of audio engineering is
necessary to produce a symphony like
this it means theyre way ahead of
us in sonic science which could mean
theyre away ahead of us period they
might be hostile and unwilling to
waste time in getting acquainted id
suggest that we wait and try to figure
out exactly what were really up
against

  clevenger laughed hatred for him
and his egotistical laughter hit burke-
son hard

  what kind of so-called logical
reasoning is that burkeson if youre
afraid admit it but we cant afford
to if theres any intelligent life here
weve got to impress them with our
lack of fear our superiority and
weve got to maintain that impression
even if we have to put on a demon-
stration of force

  several voices shouted agreement
all the voices joined in with a roar
of agreement except burkeson some-
one sneered at him

  they walked on toward the city
though more slowly now the volume
of delicate yet voluminous sound
swelled and inside burkeson the

  ecstasy grew with it and also a hint
of fear

telicate ribbons of blue
pastel highway curved into the
city there were no gates no walls
around it there werent any cannon
on the parapets nor any sign of
armed men on guard there is just a
city burkeson thought and the mu-
sic

  no trouble here clevenger said
triumphantly if there are people
here ive an idea theyll be malleable
its obvious theyre not set up for
any kind of defense probably in some
stage of decadence civilized and
progressive peoples are always set up
to defend themselves against any at-
tack

 the words grated in burkesons
mind

  then they stood in the center of a
curving avenue in the moonlight and
looked and listened and wondered
spontaneous unease filtered among
them ballance stared into the soft
architectural beauty of the city and
had his rifle pointing into the purple
shadows clevenger was analyzing
what he could through his eyes alone
ignoring the music which was mean-
ingless to him and the others

  he said i dont see any signs of
life just that longhair noise maybe
there isnt anything alive and some-
things been playing this highbrow
racket mechanically for centuries

  ballance said whoever built this
city was advanced all right like
burkeson said i hope there isnt any
life here make it easier for us i
guess to get what we need and get
out

  clevenger said they must have
developed some pretty good weapons
too any highly civilized race has
terrific weapons well find such
weapons whether theres any life
around or not

 something moved past them it
moved noiselessly gliding over the


out of this world adventures

  gently curving walkway and into the
purple shadows ballance crouched
every man stood with weapon ready
tensed and waiting very coolly clev-
enger said

 it was a cube about half my
height wasnt it it looked like metal
or some kind of shiny plastic same
as the buildings wait we wont fol-
low it up yet take it easy if they
show us any signs of trouble blast
psychologically weve got to show
them their place from the start

  burkeson gagged he stared past
clevenger after the disappearing
cube as it moved past the cube had
glowed and pulsed with ever chang-
ing monochromatic light harmonies
which burkeson thought would cor-
respond to the sound it was giving off
in the form of music

 burkeson knew that part of the
great orchestration rising from the
city came from this cube it was an
instrument he felt that it was alive
that it was martian life he felt
strange because he seemed to know
he didnt see how he could know

  he thought of a cube blasted with
neutron rifles that instrumental per-
fection exploding and the coloration
fading to corpse gray and freezing
there while the vast orchestration
over the city lost part of its com-
pleteness

  weapons always looking for bet-
ter and bigger weapons clevenger
represented north american defense
federation the other half of the
world the asian defense union
hadnt been quite fast enough and
nadf was on mars first advanced
weapons that would break the bal-
ance-of-power deadlock between the
defense zones was sought

  bitter hate hit burkeson again and
again as he listened to the swelling
music around him the peaceful sta-
bility of the city he felt like a beast
stalking into a patio dripping bloody
saliva over a garden

 burkeson had never thoroughly

  conformed to regimentation and he
had always expressed in any small
individual way he knew his intense
hatred for the prison militarism had
made of the world all-out defensive
militarization had made people fit into
the machine regardless of their nat-
ural abilities burkeson was an audio
engineer an electronics man and he
had been a composer until the big
draft since then very little devotion
to music he knew he hadnt been ad-
justing any too well to his frustra-
tions

 everyone lived always with but
one thought wait and prepare be-
cause someday theyll attack we
must be ready and the other half of
the world lived always with but one
thought wait and prepare because
someday they  attack we must be
ready

  it didnt make any sense of course
burkeson knew because someday no
one had any idea when the delicate
balance of fear would topple one way
or the other and-poof but no one
ever thought about that much any
more

  it was always invent a weapon a
little more horrible and gigantic than
theyve got so theyll be afraid to
attack us and so the weapons got
bigger and more horrible on both
sides the only thing was there be-
gan to be a limit on what innovations
could be dragged up by physicists
and biochemists and biologists and
the fear-making psychologists the
point was reached where there was
the search for one final weapon cap-
able of completely wiping out the
others without also destroying the
entire earth and everything on it

  so come clear to mars to find it
burkeson thought and he smiled his
mouth stretching taut like fine dark
wire and if we dont find the super
super weapon here go on and on
and explore the stars clear to cen-
taur us find something more super
than anyone on earth can create
the city of singing cubes



  so they looked for the super super
weapon

  and the only thing they could find
was-music

tthe cubes seemed to ignore
-l them or else didnt sense their
presence at all communication with
the cubes was attempted and aban-
doned everyone but burkeson de-
cided they werent alive but no one
paid any attention to burkeson for
a while his aesthetic philosophy was
too unrealistic and introverted they
thought but he did know his field
very well sonics and they finally
realized that if anything was to be
found out about the city burkeson
was the only one qualified to do it

  they moved into a large beauti-
fully constructed hall in the heart of
the city with plenty of equipment
setting up headquarters for explora-
tion for testing or attempting to test
the unknown elements of which the
city was built and always trying to
figure whether the cubistic things
that moved silently over the floors and
along the shaded streets were intelli-
gent whether they were alive or or-
ganic inorganic or semi-organic col-
loidal or what

 they glowed with ever-changing
co-lor and music came out of them
always for miles around and beyond
the city the giant orchestrations
could be heard and in the city itself
the sound became something taken
for granted and almost unnoticed
except for burkeson he sat hour
upon hour eyes closed listening his
mind reeling in clouds of magnificent
sound

  ballance called him in the next
afternoon and clevenger was there
to ask questions and demand answers
clevenger sat with his feet propped
up on a glowing cube that was con-
veniently not moving at the moment
as burkeson came in and saluted
clevenger deliberately ground his
cigarette out on the side of the cube

  a piercing pain hit burkeson as
though he had felt the burning coals
the cubes coloration flickered with
momentary ugliness

  burkeson gasped he leaned over
and almost grabbed clevengers arm
clevenger grinned

  its alive burkeson whispered
ive told all of you that these cubes
make the music we hear this is their
city

  ballance said that isnt the ques-
tion burkeson

  clevenger said we need your ad-
vice looks as though this city is
geared strictly for sound thats your
department you mentioned that these
people-you call them that-are mas-
ters of sound could you elaborate

  ballance said you mentioned to
ferrell about communicating with
them

 i dont know burkeson said
stiffly given time i think we could
i believe theyre of a much higher in-
telligence than well ever be

  clevenger started flushed slightly
and his fingers started drumming on
the cube matter of opinion of
course im a little too proud of being
human to admit that all i want to
know is how do they function alive
or not im sure no human will ever
find any emphatic response to them
whatever they are

  maybe not burkeson said but
it seems to me it should be obvious
that theyre intelligent that this is
their city i think we could recognize
them as being entitled to our respect
they didnt invite us here this is
their planet their city theyve found
a kind of ultimate peace and beauty
well never be able to find

  ballance coughed were not in-
terested in sociological problems
now burkeson weve taken plenty
of photographic reels and sound
tracks but weve found no machin-
ery no power plants no evidence of
atomic or electrical power we be-
lieve the cubes contain the secret but


out of this world adventures

so far weve hesitated about tearing
one down to see what makes it tick
you suggested ultrasonics-

  clevenger leaned toward burkeson
i know a little about audio engineer-
ing i know our scientists have been
working in that field for years look-
ing for weapons ultrasonics in sol-
ids i believe these cubes are ani-
mated machines my idea is that
theyre machines that can keep them-
selves going by hidden sonic power
that theyre robotics of some kind
left by a dead civilization what do
you think of that possibility burke-
son

  tear one of them down music like
this-out of a machine-tear   

 somehow burkeson remained
calm and underneath he wanted to
kill his hand shook and he felt per-
spiration crawling down his face

  ive told you my opinion sir i
think theyre alive and highly intelli-
gent and so far above us that they
may not even realize yet were here
theyre masters of ultra- and super-
sonics city and individual life here
is supported by it i think they com-
municate with each other by music
a small part of which is audible to us

he got up then and stood so
that the cube was between him
and clevenger the individual in-
strumental music from the cube
seemed to envelope him in a separate
cloud of sound

  he said theyve developed along
much different lines than we have
my idea is that now that weve started
exploring space we cant keep on
looking down on everything thats
different than we are maybe these
cubes are partly mechanical in struc-
ture this whole city is structured
for a vast communal interrelated ul-
trasonic life i can explain something
about what controlled and focused
vibration can do to solids what ultra-
sonic potentials are

  but im afraid you would find it

rather technical for example the
acoustic material of this city has been
chosen and built so as to make the
reverberation time the same for all
frequencies resulting in the loudness
of all frequencies decaying at the
same rate the acoustic material
shows a variation of absorption coef-
ficients in other words theyve done
what our scientists could scarcely im-
agine this city and the cubes are in
tune you might say

  i think each cube is living and
intelligent and is also a part of a
vast ultrasonic social culture all
working in complete vibratory har-
mony to create and sustain their own
existence to create music thats lit-
erally an endless joyous sensual life
for them its beauty that our senses
cant imagine

  ive gotten an idea of whats been
perfected here these cubes can do
almost anything through their con-
trol of vibration thats the way ive
got it figured you know yourselves
how we can use it for measuring de-
tecting flaws in processing foods
drugs and chemicals and as a catalyst
to speed up chemical reactions you
know about the crystal type of ultra-
sonic unit that uses electrical energy
instead of air as a source of power
and quartz crystals transform electri-
cal energy into mechanical vibrations
maybe these cubes operate on some-
what the same principle infinitely
complicated i dont know

  i know about all that humans have
found out so far about ultrasonics
which is to say practically nothing
these cubes know everything about
it

  all i say is that i think these
cubes are alive and that theyve mas-
tered ultrasonics as well as the secret
of living in harmonious beauty
through extreme specialization i
think theyve completely mastered
their environment

  clevenger said very interesting
speculation except that now were
the city of singing cubes



part of their environment say where
does all this humility come from
burkeson dont you like being hu-
man

  burkeson didnt answer that he
could have he could have said that
during the last few hours that ques-
tion had been bothering him he was
uncertain

 ballance said anything else
burkeson about the cubes

  burkeson shrugged my interest in
them is their complete mastery of
music my interest as you may re-
member was composing before the
draft i can tell you this to illustrate
their mastery of music though this
is only a small part

  for example to fairly represent
even the crudest kind of music the
range of frequencies should be from
 to  to  or  cycles
and the acoustic power range above
the threshold of hearing should be
from  to  decibels without distor-
tion yet these people have gone 
far beyond these ranges that my in-
struments are not worth anything
and yet i can understand something
of these people and their culture
but its completely alien isnt it
clevenger smiled and there should
be no more hesitation about- tearing
these cubes down than in tearing
down a highly specialized ant-hill to
study it

  burkeson felt his hands clench to
wet fists id rather try to work out
some means of communicating with
them learn their secrets that way
maybe by subjective harmonics and
non-linear response if you want that
explained further-

 no forget explanations now
clevenger was on his feet his face
was drum tight with anger this is
your specialty we have only a few
more days here and regardless of
your attitudes were going to tear
down these cubes burkeson and
youre ordered to oversee the job
he breathed deeply then said if

theyve developed this fantastic mas-
tery of ultrasonics that you say they
have then certainly these cubes con-
tain the secret of some kind of ultra-
sonic weapon and that would be ex-
actly what we need to finish the
asians thered be no defense against
ultrasonics specific vibration could
destroy any defense our scientists
have been working on ultrasonics
looking for a way to utilize sound
waves as a weapon for a long time
they havent gotten anyplace why is
that burkeson

burkeson felt nauseous weak-
ness he leaned against the desk
he put out a hand and touched the
cube and suddenly a strange thrilling
strength seemed to flow through him

  he said the difficulty is in nar-
rowing the destructive vibration
waves down to concentrative focus
waves have a tendency to spread if
a way could be found to funnel the
sound waves into concentrative focus
anything could be shaken to pieces
completely destroyed by finding spe-
cific vibratory rates

  clevenger said and these cubes
should have that secret shouldnt
they

  i dont-know whispered burke-
son

  then clevenger said  think
youd better start looking into the
cubes and finding out the secret of
one of these cubes might very well
give us the drop on the asians enable
us to destroy them all and all their
works im afraid the nadf will hear
of your uncooperative attitudes
burkeson unless you show a great
deal of change

  clevenger said to ballance id
suggest that you put burkeson in
charge with ferrell and hopkins to
assist at once well take several of
the cubes back to the ship and tear
them down if the job seems too diffi-
cult and looks like it might take too
long well take a cube or two with


out of this world adventures

us back to earth whatever there is
to learn is in the cubes anyway

  burkeson was dismissed ferrell
was sent to the ship after a small
power car to mantle and bring back
to the city for hauling cubes burke-
son went outside into the cool shaded
street and he sat down beside a cube
to wait he sat in the shade cast by
the cube and buried his face in his
arms

  reality seemed slowly to fade it
became as though he were swimming
in an endless sea of glorious sound
and that he was orpheus or the angel
israfel

  he had felt without knowing how
now he knew their music was lan-
guage and he understood its broadest
semantic meanings he had always
thought that if man would find a uni-
versal language it would be in the
realm of basic vibratory harmonies
that even in their crudest form had
such profound and deep effects on
the senses

  chance didnt move beethoven to
select the key of e flat for the heroic
symphony burkeson thought and
that of f for the pastoral it was in
obedience to that mysterious law
which assigns to each key a peculiar
aspect a special color

  there would be slight variations
according to temperament and condi-
tioned responses but basically it was
a physical law of general reactions
a certain vibration must inevitably
have specific effects on physical struc-
ture

  wrapped in that surrounding sym-
phony of sound burkeson began to
feel that he was in general contact
emotionally with the cubes mental
world not with any individual cube
but with the whole interrelated sound
structure of each cube and the city
itself and it seemed that as a result
entire emotional messages impihged
on his nervous system flooded his
brain with understanding it was a
kind of ultimate method of compre-

hension of evaluation that one could
term semantic

  and they were in touch with him
and their music was a language that
he felt in great floods of understand-
ing and they understood his own
anguished outpourings of feeling

  he felt the resulting horror as they
absorbed his emotions there was re-
treat then more absorption then
shock then slow horrified comprehen-
sion burkeson clutched his head
suddenly as if invisible hands were
poised to strike his body began to
shake

  he staggered to his feet screaming
with pain and horror as their emo-
tional reaction poured back upon him
he stood swaying pressing his tem-
ples with shaking hands his head
rocking

  the pain slowly faded he stood
with his eyes closed and then he felt
the change begin in the music of the
city major chords began to mingle
and seek to establish themselves

 the doleful anxiety of ab the
funereal and mysterious pathos of bb
crept in retreated moved in slowly
to remain g sombre c brutal sin-
ister e sadness and agitation c
gloomy dramatic violent f-hate
hate hate c and f hate destruc-
tion hate destruction

  efa profound sadness of realization

  then c and f hate hate hate
destruction

 kill kill

 burkeson yelled hoarsely he
turned and lurched back through the
arched doorway he screamed at
clevenger he screamed at ballance

they straightened up quickly and
clevenger licked his lips slowly
as he saw burkesons twisted face
burkeson started babbling he
screamed at them insults and threats
but he wasnt making much sense
clevenger thought ballance looked
meaningfully toward the two guards

war of the marsh-men

           by w malcolm white

ew chicago had been destroyed over-
night during the deep venusian
darkness-which lasted for twenty hours
out of the strange planets day of forty-
great flares of crimson rocket trails had
been seen coming from the south then
with terrible roaring and crashing huge
rockets loaded with high explosives had
blown the small colonial city to pieces the
few survivors were able to give the direc-
tion the rockets had come from-but that
was all they knew

  we of the interplanetary patrol stationed
on earths polar colonies on that cloudy hot
planet heard of it as soon as we had re
turned from our latest mission we had
been far up beyond the stratosphere cruis-
ing slowly over the huge and eternal cloud-
bank that covers the second planet we
were looking for a missing pleasure-plane
said to have been piloted by verna jenson
daughter of governor-general jenson of
earths colonies

  verna had left the day before to fly
across the equatorial clouds to the south
pc le station but she had never arrived no
word had been heard from her-hut that
was not surprising for radio waves do not
easily penetrate the electric static of the
venusian atmosphere

  we eased our little cruiser into port at
north pole base when we got off hoping
to have a rest it was our captain birch
who came running back to us with the
news of the new chicago disaster

  but who was it where did the
bombs come from why the members
of our small crew asked but he did not
knov nobody knew we were ordered to
take off at once all the sky-cruisers of the
command stationed there were out looking
for the unknown enemy

  we hastily piled into our rocket ship
and again headed upwards over the clouds
we would go south towards the unknown
equatorial region looking for the bomb-
senders

  venus is a planet of mystery covered
eternally with thick clouds there are huge
sections of it that are utterly unknown
explorers can safely travel only on its ex-
treme northern and southern polar parts
because venus is millions of miles closer

to the sun than the earth its middle re-
gions are far too hot and super-tropical no
one can survive there for long even the
parts we live on the polar regions where
new chicago was situated were like deep-
est africa on earth yet they were con-
sidered cool

  what strange beings may inhabit the
equator of venus no one knew on our
parts there were no natives though there
were unusual animals in plenty so we had
no idea of what we were looking for it
was the opinion of us all that venusians
did exist and evidently they were starting
now to destroy all earths people on their
world

  our cruiser raced south over the- huge
sea of mist our super-radar operating stead-
ily to show us what lay beneath the clouds
radar could show us some things-it
ihowed where land and rivers were and
where the boiling oceans but as you got
nearer the equator land and water seemed
to merge and a vast belt of hot swamp-
land was believed to exist there in that
mystery terrain the radar could not dis-
tinguish details

  captain birch was watching the radar
in the control room and shaking his head
it had been the same in our search for
verna jensons ship yesterday-the farther
south you got the less you could see now
we were over the vast marshes and our
instruments showed only an uninterrupted
flatness beneath the clouds

  then suddenly our alarm bells went
off captain birch jumped to the window
a huge robot-rocket was heading up out
of the clouds towards us birch shouted
an order the man at the controls jammed
over the rocket levers and the ship jumped
wildly to one side we held our breath-
and the mystery rocket grazed past us
missing us by a matter of inches

  lieutenant williams at the rear gun
managed to get his weapon working a
steady stream of atomic bullets flew from
the muzzle of his wicked looking weapon
i saw them hit the strange black painted
rocket and explode i was thrown from my
feet by the terrible shock that followed

  we had hit the enemy rocket and it had
exploded but it had been too close to us
when it went off we were falling out of
control falling into the clouds into the
marshes below

  captain birch struggled to straighten the
ship he fought with the controls as the
ship whirled and tossed in the air currents
still we fell down down through the
grey clouds and then at last we steadied
rode down to the surface below came to
a halt in the swampy marshes of unknown
venus

 the ship was somewhat damaged it
could be repaired fast though    and
birch ordered the men at it meanwhile we
would have to wait there for a little while
birch williams and i opened the side
port and looked out

 the ship was floating in a mass of
muddy marshy stuff pools of dirty oily
water covered with green and yellow
growing things great bubbles of blackish
muck kept boiling up about us here and
there hummocks of mossy land stood out
great ugly looking trees stuck up in odd
places it was truly a dismal sight

  look cried williams excitedly and
pointed into the distance our eyes fol-
lowed and we saw a huge six-legged mon-
ster leaping through the swamp towards
us theres someone riding it shouted
birch

  sure enough perched on the ugly crea-
tures back was a slim lightly clad figure
we strained our eyes as the animal dashed
on in our direction its verna shouted
williams

  we recognized the figure of the gover-
nor-generals daughter evidently she was
trying to reach our ship and now we
could see why-she was being pursued

  running after her coming with great
jumps and leaps through the marsh some-
times in the water sometimes leaping from
hummock to hummock were men-huge
greenish monster-men ten twelve feet tall
horrible marshmen the mystery inhabi-
tants of the planet

  vernas weird animal seemed winning
when one of the marshmen stopped aimed
an odd pistol-shaped weapon at it and
fired a burst of black smoke and the
animal jumped gave a hideous scream and
fell almost at our ships door verna
scrambled off its back and we reached for
her hauled her up into the ships en-
tranceway

  the marshmen were right on her tracks
one leaped went deep into the water and

managed to get a hold on her leg birch
shot him others were coming from all
directions the ship rocket and i shot a
glance overhead one marshman horrible
and slimy green had come up on us from
behind and was climbing over the ship

  we rushed inside slammed the steel door
just in time verna collapsed into a ham-
mock birch ran to the controls fortu-
nately the repairs had been mostly made
an emergency system had been rigged up
and we were able to take off before the
marshmen now swarming about could do
any damage

  up we shot into the steamy air above
the swamp we dropped a bomb and had
the satisfaction of finishing off those fiends
who had been surrounding the spot we
had left

  verna recovered her strength enough to
rake her place beside birch there go
that way she pointed a direction to us
and our ship followed her finger there
was the city of the monsters

  it rose from the swamps just a little be-
yond the spot we had been forced down
it was a low sprawling city of ugly mush-
room-shaped houses hidden in the marshes
we could see several ugly rocket-launching
racks just outside it and many huge black
cylinders waiting to be fired at the rest of
our cities

  verna told us she had come down in the
marshes for a slight repair when her little
pleasure ship had trouble the day before
she had come down by accident on the hid-
den city of the marshmen and they had
made her prisoner they had long been
planning to attack us and now they de-
cided to attack at once that very night
the dreadful rockets had gone out that had
destroyed new chicago

  verna had taken advantage of their con-
fusion when our shots blew up the rocket
bomb they had last launched she had
seized one of their domesticated animals-
the monster we had seen her riding-and
had ridden away towards where she had
heard our rocketship descending

  the marshmen could have destroyed
us all colony by colony and we would
never have been able to hit back verna
said to us but that was no longer to be
for i heard birch now on the radio-beam
sending back to the north pole base the
directions that would enable our huge bat-
tleships of space to blast the marshmen out
of existence forever-

what was he-degenerate
or supermant

           although other explorers had found venus cold
           forbidding and lifeless this adventurer found it a
           world of marvelous delight what strange alchemy
           had transformed it on that one earthlings behalf

      by john  dorothy de courcy

is only an alien who can
really enjoy the exotic but
the alien who has no con-
nection with the scene
who has not even the
vaguest idea what will
come next he truly experi-
ences an unusual and wonderful thing
for he smells strange smells touches
strange textures hears strange sounds
and the very air he breathes is some-
how different and so it was with me
lying on the ground unfamiliar
ground with an odd soft feel pow-
dery to the touch yet not clinging as
earth dust would suddenly remem-
bering where i was i sat up and
looked about me

  when i had left the earth i hadnt

known where to go first as there were
so many places to visit so many ex-
citing and unusual sights to see and
an infinite variety to choose from but
i had finally selected venus partly
because it would be a short hop but
mostly because exploration had re-
vealed so little about it those who
had gone there had found only a
waterless dust bowl with unending
dust storms which made any exten-
sive investigation next to impossible

  yesterday very tired and in need
of sleep i had landed and had climbed
out of my ship to find not a dust
storm but a curious crowd watching
me i stood there dumbly wondering
what to do until one who seemed to
have authority took me with him into




out of this world adventures

their city he seemed to know i was
tired for he left me in a compartment
barren of furniture yet seemingly
possessed with all the comforts as-
suredly i had slept well for this soft
springy ground had been my bed

  as i gazed about me i wondered if
it had been wise to leave my ship but
so strange and foreign were my sur-
roundings i soon forgot about it i
walked through an archway which
led outside and discovered that most
of the dwellings about me were much
the same there were neither doors
nor windows and there seemed to be
no streets the houses could have
been made of earth for the walls were
the same color as the ground and
they were round hexagonal and oc-
tagonal generally

  beyond the houses in what ap-
peared to be approximately the citys
center rose towers high into the air
they seemed somewhat triangular to
me and tended to come to a point al-
though the distance made seeing diffi-
cult then i heard the bell as its
sound rolled out across the city in a
great ringing crash i jumped and
looked in the direction of the towers
again that strange rumbling clang
struck me like a physical blow as
yet i saw not a soul in the spaces
between the domiciles and i thought
it incredible that anyone could sleep
through such a racket

  for the final time the voice in that
mighty bell rolled out leaving a preg-
nant silence in its wake a silence that
must soon give birth to new sounds
or it would surely burst asunder from
its own electric tension i stood there
waiting for what i did not know
avidly drinking in each detail of a
new world at that moment my host
appeared

perhaps it was the light of
morning or perhaps it was be-
cause i had drunk of the refreshing
cup of sleep but he seemed less form-
less and more concrete than when i

had last seen him actually he could
have been a man a rather large man
and not the least bit freakish hie
features were classic and his nose
was long enough to be distinguished
yet not so much as to be ridiculous
his hair was pale and golden tinted
and his eyes were a bright blue the
mark that would set him apart from
earth men was his skin for it too
was blue

  was he barbarian i wondered
or was his a philosophy too deep for
my mind to grasp his feet were
bare yet what ned for shoes on such
resilient soil he wore a short skirt
which for its color could have been
woven silver yet by its weight and
flexibility must be cloth or perhaps
some plastic which we did not have
there was no belt nor did he wear
adornments indeed his smooth skin
with long powerful muscles flexing
beneath it had no need of ornamenta-
tion

 he smiled then just as anyone
would smile he had teeth seemingly
like mine but more even and white
perhaps because of the contrast of his
skin he asked me a question in his
deep voice making motions with his
flexible hands

  i did not understand

  he pointed to his mouth and made
chewing motions

 this was clear and i nodded my
head i eat i said then went
through the motions of lifting a fork
full of food to my mouth and masti-
cating it

  he repeated the word eat

 i moved my jaws and nodded my
head

  i he repeated flatly

  i pointed a finger at myself and
said i

  he pointed his forefinger at me and
said i

  this time i shook my head violently
and grasping his firm hand turned it
around so that he too pointed to him-
self 
alchemy



  he smiled again pointed to him-
self and said bo-i

  i pointed to myself then and said
questioningly bo

  gravely he nodded

  we surmounted the you problem
in a moment you appeared to be
ti

  my host believing that he had
enough fundamentals said i eat you
eat and then nodded his head

  it was a rather rudimentary thing
but it gave me food for thought while
my tall host led me toward food for
the body we went into the house
again through a different archway and
there i found what appeared to be a
board or piece of plastic about three
feet square on which rested little
pyramids of assorted food stuffs my
friend seated himself or more ac-
curately contorted himself for he
folded his legs into the manner of a
statue of buddha this i tried and
found i could still do since at one
time i had practiced yoga for my
health

  the food was certainly unique but
tasty not one familiar flavor was
represented although there was salt
in a small pyramid in the center of
the table there was a pile of small
green things which resembled rad-
ishes but which tasted vaguely like
cooked potatoes with a dash of pars-
nip added there were many other
curious things but i cannot describe
them for there is nothing to compare
them with all of them seemed to be
vegetables except the beverage this
was served in small opalescent cups
slightly smaller than our own cups
and about the shape of a flower pot
i should say was already there since
no one appeared to add food or take
any away

  the liquid was sweet but had body
in the manner of coffee it was quite
clear and had a distinct blue color
my friend named each item of food
as he picked it up and i endeavored
to remember them

  again i asked myself the question
are they barbarians or have they
passed beyond civilization when
all things needful are present it
could indicate either the idyllic ex-
istence of a tropical island or the cul-
mination of millennia of progress

when the meal was finished we
arose and i stretched my rather
cramped legs my host made a circu-
lar motion toward the outside smil-
ing broadly i nodded and followed
my legs still aching a bit when we
were outside i thought of my ship
and how maybe i should go back but
then i reasoned that i came here to
see the planet and not the ship cer-
tainly there had been no sign of hos-
tility so far and i felt somehow that
my rather battered craft would be
left alone

  the light on venus is peculiar
there seems to be something in the
air which screens off most of the
sunlight yet the day seemed as bright
as on earth when it is slightly over-
cast i saw no shadows for light
seemed to be everywhere and then i
remembered that i had not seen any
artificial lighting of any kind in the
house i looked back through the
archway we had just come through
and saw that it was just as light in-
side as it was outside that same pe-
culiar bluish light which seemed to
be everywhere yet came from no-
where

 the air was warm the tempera-
ture appeared to be unvarying as i
remembered that the same warmth
had persisted throughout the night
i wondered about these things and
wished desperately there were some
way i could ask questions

  my friend waited patiently for me
whenever i stopped to look about
we walked between innumerable
houses all doorless a number of
people were outside and i discovered
they were actually a beautiful people
they were all blue although the


out of this world adventures

shade varied from a rather pale tint
to a pronounced purple hue the
women were generally paler and were
clad the same as the men the colors
of the short skirts varied through
the spectrum including colors that
we cannot as yet impress upon fab-
rics some noticed us some called
greetings to my friend and some gave
us only a passing glance

  we walked for a long time several
hours always in the general direction
of the towers as we approached
them i could see that there were
four of them spaced about a hundred
feet apart in a diamond shape they
rose approximately six hundred feet
although i could be far wrong

 my host allowed me to wander
around the base of the first tower and
scrutinize it i thought at first it was
made of copper or a rose gold yet
when i touched it it was not cold
like metal but rather neutral like a
plastic there was an open archway
on the side facing the inward part
of the diamond and i could make out
another on the farthest tower

  again i had that intense desire to
ask questions to make myself under-
stood but how could i even if this
man could guess my questions how
could he answer me so that i would
understand wondering i looked at
my friend and he smiled i studied
him for a moment trying to decide
what lay behind that smile was it one
of understanding or just an automatic
response to what he thought ridicu-
lous i couldnt tell

  the smile faded gradually from his
face as he stared back at me then
he smiled again and said i eat

  i hadnt noticed but i too was hun-
gry it had been a long walk i nodded
and he began walking toward the
nearest of the houses i walked along
beside him trying to keep in step
but it was almost impossible to
match those long effortless strides
we went through an archway and
found a woman within before her

was a triangular board a little larger
than the one we had dined from in
the morning she smiled at me re-
assuringly and behaved in every way
as though she had fully expected both
of us

  i wondered how this could be for
my friend had spoken to no one m
this vicinity and again the thought
occurred primitive or beyond under
standing

  the food was totally different from
what i had eaten earlier except for
the beverage my friend chatted with
our hostess smiling occasionally and
using gestures which could have
meant most anything when the meal
was over i smiled at the woman try-
ing to convey the impression that i
had enjoyed the meal perhaps it was
wishful thinking on my part but she
seemed to understand

my friend rose gracefully and
walked to the archway i at-
tempted to do the same but my legs
were so stiff and sore from the long
walk and the cramped sitting posi-
tion that when i tried to straighten
up i fell so surprised was i at the
incredible softness and rubberlike
quality of the ground that i just lay
there for a moment then realizing
that i wasnt the least bit hurt i
pulled myself into a sitting position
and when i thought of my clumsiness
i laughed once started i couldnt
stop and the tears rolled down my
face

 my friend helped me to my feet
and it was then i noticed that he too
was laughing only it was more like
a heavy rumble which came from his
throat he bid our hostess goodbye
and we went outside

  i looked at my friend questioning-
y he smiled and pointed to the
towers i nodded and followed but
this time we walked straight through
hie archway almost immediately i
saw why we were here for leading
upward around the central well was
alchemy



a spiral ramp it was of a material as
soft and resilient as the ground

  on an impulse i sat down and re-
moved my shoes heavy cumbersome
things i tucked my woolen socks in-
side the shoes and stood up and for
the first time i realized that the
ground was warm my tall friend
smiled a seeming knowing smile yes
it was obvious and had been that i
needed no shoes here we started up
the ramp and i found walking much
easier indeed

  on the wall beside the ramp lay the
purpose of our visit for painted or
impressed with a startling clarity
were figures acting out a wordless
drama i saw the way these people
were in the early beginning learning
fire learning to work stone though i
had not seen a stone since my arrival

  up the familiar climib toward civil-
ization we walked the higher we
ascended the higher the civilization
i stopped at each picture studying
it carefully until there appeared
technology a strange technology
which certainly no longer existed
why had they slipped back i won-
dered why the decline and then
i saw an all too familiar thing war

  for some reason i was saddened
they seemed such a peaceful people
it was a shame that they had had to
taste of war death and destruction
perhaps they were better off as they
were

  we walked further and further up-
ward and i began to feel strange
things vague stirrings in my mind
at first i thought it was the effect
of the alien pictures pictures that
were too clear but as we ascended
i found it growing stronger on and
on we went passing by the panorama
of life and death of man rising to
new peaks and falling to new depths
but this time it was man whose skin
was blue

 and then we came upon another
series depicting war and i started as
i stood before a mushroom-shaped

cloud so they had even had atomic
energy it seemed incredible some-
thing surged inside of me a strange
something and i thought perhaps it
was the horror i somehow knew
would be depicted soon the ghastly
spectacle of suicidal atomic war yet
when it came the feeling inside of
me grew the surging became intense
that something which eluded me
seemed almost within my grasp
here pictured with unworldly vivid-
ness was the end of a world

  yet i found it was not the end for
many had survived and they began
rebuilding gradually the shape of
the thing they were building became
plain it was the towers or a group
like them rising up into the heavens
here again was advancement so the
end had not come in the hell of
atomic war but where then where
had all of this knowledge gone

  onward and upward we walked and
now i saw space craft they had
traversed the depths of space even
to our earth they had built cities
everywhere had become a great and
mighty people i marveled that so
much had been gained and was so
obviously lost but was it lost it
seemed to be i had seen nothing that
would indicate otherwise

 then came a series of pictures
which puzzled me for they showed
the blue-skinned people leaving their
great cities reentering their space
ships and returning to their home
planet there seemed to be no reason
for this exodus and i pondered each
picture for some time the more i
thought the more sure i became that
somewhere locked in my mind was
the answer to the puzzle it was as
though i were trying to remember
something something logic told me
i could not possibly know and yet it
was there just on the rim of con-
sciousness

  and then we came to the last pic-
ture i felt as though i had been
shocked electrically i know the


out of this world adventures

blood drained from my face as i
stared unbelieving how could it be
yet there it was the final picture
showing my friend standing just as
he was standing and myself just as i
was even barefoot how could they
have known it was a perfect mirror
image in miniature i moved a little
but the picture of me did not it was
not a reflection i continued to stare
fascinated and slowly i realized that
the picture was a familiar one to me
i had seen it before but where i
groped sought frantically within my
mind for the explanation but it con-
tinually escaped me remaining just
beyond my reach

dazed i turned to my friend but
he only smiled it was a smile
with the quality of all knowing wise-
ness and suddenly he too seemed
familiar to me someone i had known
for a long time he motioned me to
go onward through an archway but
i couldnt move i felt as though i
were half in and half out of my body

  gently but firmly my friend took
my arm and guided me to the arch-
way i paused on the threshold fear
beginning to clutch at me but my
friend urged me on we entered to
face an aging man whose skin was
quite light though still blue he mo-
tioned me to sit as he was cross-
legged and i did hardly knowing
what i was doing and only vaguely
conscious that my friend had done
likewise then the old man reached
out touched my forehead just above
my nose and i fainted

  when i opened my eyes i felt that
time had passed but there was no way
of knowing my friend held me up-
right my head resting against his
massive shoulders within myself i
felt peace a quietness i had never
known and then all at once i realized
i knew i lifted my head and looked
at the aged one who sat unmoving
yes i knew i understood these
people

  are you feeling better now the
aged man asked

  it was an alien language yet some-
how i understood i knew many other
things i felt many other things but
all i could express was yes-yes-
im much better now

  now i knew that here was perfec-
tion that theirs was not a civilization
of the body but one of the soul and
that somehow i was a part of them
and they were a part of me

  yes the old man said aloud you
are one of us you always have been
if you were not- he broke off but
i understood i was a descendant of
those early pioneers who had come
to earth this i knew if it were not
so i would have found nothing when
i landed for where i was now was in
and yet not in the world a place apart
and not visible to ordinary eyes

  i looked into the eyes of the man
beside me and knew i would never
leave would never want to leave this
was my home my real home and these
were my people my people because
of a bond more powerful and ever-
lasting than one of flesh and blood
for i was one with myself a truly
integrated being and therefore one
with all men who were as i

  unbidden i stepped through an-
other archway and found what i knew
would be there a short skirt such as
all the people wore i removed my
clothes quickly and drew on the little
garment then turning i looked into
the polished oval of metal finer than
the finest mirror already my skin
was bluish and smiling i ran my
fingers through my hair fluffing it

  i prepared to leave then hesitated
a moment i knew that waiting for
me was the man with whom i would
be forever forever his as he would
be forever mine and yet i had one
tiny regret a regret which quickly
changed into humor when i finally
emerged from the little room i was
laughing i hadnt brought my lip-
stick

en should have ex-
pected it he should
not have been sur-
prised when chal-
lon the executive
chief took over
command of the ex-
ploration party after all there was a
great deal of glory connected with
this first planet-landing in over 
century

  the executive chief stood at the
gunwales of the gravity boat just be-
hind ren and the controls his voice
was metallic each overtone in it re-
minded ren of the ping of metal
cracking with cold even challons
pale blond hair and unblemished skin
seemed metallic although his move-
ments were lithe enough he was in
superb physical shape-all aboard the



         for centuries the atomic
         wandered the universe in
         home but when they fin
         of their choice it was to le
         less amid an ocean of sp

spaceship alpha were for that matter
ren worked the controls automati-
cally he was steeped in a curious
thing today-an emotion-a prescient
feeling without any logic or two-and-
two in it and he had been feeling this
in his marrow ever since descending
to the surface of this new and un-
known planet

  and now for some reason-part of
this queer emotion probably-he
turned to glance at jana who sat
along the gunwales with tht other
landfall

at that moment a dcen
ismarians descended on jana
and the trapped scientist-

supermen from earth had
search of a new planetary
ally landed on the world
ave them inextricably help-
ear-carrying non-descripts

scientists and with the men of the
protec guard she saw him and
smiled at him he smiled back and
felt a little better

  challons metallic voice cut in all
right mister lets pay attention to
the controls

  ren obeyed but he felt a surge of
something-it seemed to start just be-
low his lungs and come up through the
sihell of his body another new emo-
tion he kept his stare on the control
panel and threw his squarish brows

into a deep scowl this was anger he
felt anger was a primitive trait and
forbidden-but it seemed to come so
easily on this world

  the gravity car passed over a den-
sity fault and bumped ren corrected
he kept the long boatlike vehicle
skimming following the contour of
ismarus

  ismarus theyd named it after
ulysses first port of call-and theyd
been lucky all right to find it the
scanners had picked it out of space
after analyzing only a few thousand
others it met all the requirements
it was of the same mass as earth it
had an atmosphere earths tempera-
ture one satellite and a similar ro-
tation and orbit period it was a jack-
pot find no question of it now the
alpha had landed upon this planet


out of this world adventures

and they had taken the gravity boat
to explore in a wide radius from the
big spaceship there would be long
days and nights of waiting while the
alpha was re-massed-they would get
to know ismarus better maybe too
well before it was all over

  ren glanced occasionally at the
iandscape all about them he had
difficulty in seeing it as a pure sight
-his mind kept wandering into rea-
son and analysis the people of the
alpha after all were conditioned to
analyze and reason from birth in this
they were probably superior even to
the revered ancestors who had
launched the alpha ren concentrated
so that he wouldnt have to think so
hard

  a queer place ismarus in some
ways similar to the minifilm reader
pictures of earth that every alphan
child studied-but in other ways sub-
tly different very little vegetation
for one thing mostly rolling stretches
of hard-packed red and ochre sand
lacerated here and there with rock
sharp rock grey rock the rocks be-
came more frequent as they neared
the mountain chain tortured cac-
tuslike plants began to appear

  spectro please captain pinged
challons voice he was still behind
rens shoulder

  ren ticked the scanner the screen
glowed with white light then flashed
and jiggled before it came to life
bands of color appeared and floated
until ren stilled them by dialing

  challon leaned forward and studied
the image

  ren looked at challoos profile
strong handsome confident face-as
befitted an executive chief immense
 q superb physique and very low
emotional index naturally no other
kind of man could hold the com-
munity together as the alpha took
its warping path through the universe
science was the supreme being and
challon was its prophet these days
you could hardly whisper e equals

me square without a slight feeling of
having committed blasphemy

  challon was reading the spectro off
the cuff soil relatively fertile on
the slopes ahead some vegetation
might be inhabitants there

jana rose and came forward ren
smiled to himself he knew she
couldnt sit still when she heard the
word inhabitants vitology the study
of life on other planets was her spe-
cialty and in fact that was why she
had been brought along on this first
exploration trip she came to chal-
lons side looked at the screen too
and said what about water are
there deposits or is it underground
that makes a difference in the form
life takes sometimes

  deposits i dare say said challon
he looked at jana flatly after all
the atmosphere contains moisture
ren glanced at challon quickly
there had been irritation in his an-
swer-but challon of all people was
supposed to be the supreme intellect
who never became irritated who had
practically no inconvenient emotions
was there something in the air of
this planet which was giving even
challon primitive tendencies

 and jana-ren saw sudden color
in her cheeks he saw a faint tighten-
ing of her upper lip and a quick
movement of her grey eyes as she
returned challons flat stare well
one thing she was even more beauti-
ful with her irritation showing like
this gave life to her face at times
her ordinarily calm cool mask had
made him uncomfortable-reminded
him that after all she was a privileged
scientist and he was only a captain
of the protecs

  he looked at the instrument panel
again-at first in a routine unsuspect-
ing way then abruptly his instinct
told him that the instruments werent
behaving correctly

  he raised his brows he swept his
gaze horizontally studying every-
celestial landfall



thing the speedometer was wavering
although the car certainly moved
along at a steady pace the mass in-
dicator had dropped and the spectro
showed bright flashes

  ren stared at the landscape again
he wasnt sure but there did seem
to be a faint concavity to the land
here-as though there had once been
a crater perhaps a mile in diameter
he raised himself in the seat to stare
some more-and the gravity boat
stopped with a sudden and quite un-
usual jolt

  here whats this said challon
whirling toward ren the cars pas-
sengers stirred and began to mutter
to each other

  dont know said ren he exam-
ined the control panel again cant
figure it out he took the fiat mini-
film reader from his tunic pocket and
opened it quickly he pressed the but-
ton and watched the moving images
flash by on the lens the film in the
reader was a tech manual for the op-
eration of the vehicle but as he had
supposed it told him nothing the
standard atom symbol flashed at the
end of the film and he was still no-
where

  lokar the big tawny-haired protec
sergeant hauled his bulk forward and
touched rens arm sir maybe wed
better get the hell out of here i dont
like this spot i dont like the feeling
in my bones

  well decide that in a minute ser-
geant ren said in a formal tone the
formality was for the benefit of chal-
lons ears meanwhile ren flicked a
significant glance at challon and
lokar understood the sergeant went
back to his seat

  suddenly janas voice cried out
sharply i saw somethingv

 what whats that challon
turned toward her

  she was standing pointing she
was pointing at the face of a large
jagged rock ahead-an outcropping
the size of a cottage something

over there-an animal-or a person
pm sure of it

  ren stared in that direction he
didnt see anything just the grey rock
and the yellow-red sand rising toward
it it struck him then that in this
circular area there was no vegetation
not even the twisted bushes or the
cactuslike plants

  it couldnt by any chance chal-
lon said frigidly to jana have been
a slight hallucination

  she shook her head quickly it was
an animal or a person

ren frowned to himself an animal
or a person he felt a queer puls-
ing thrill in his lifetime he had
never known a living thing outside of
the people aboard the spaceship al-
pha nor had the others of his gen-
eration the need for a re-massing
stop came about once a century and
it had been over a hundred centuries
since the alpha left the legendary
place they all knew as earth

  the alphas saga was of course
one of the first things children learned
when they became old enough to sit
in the hypno bays or operate their
own minifilm readers and always the
importance of their destiny as ai-
phans was hammered into them their
entire culture was built around the
idea that eventually there would be
a day of arrival-the alpha would
return to earth

  later when they began to study
relativity they could understand how
it was that the day of arrival would
come not centuries after the depar-
ture-but within a few score years
earth years at any rate aboard the
alpha generations would experience
the passage of centuries or seem to
but since the alpha was traversing
the entire curve of space it would
reach its starting point both in space
and time the only period of time
difference would be a few score years
required for acceleration and deceler-
ation thus-it was the hope of those


 out of this world adventures

who launched the alpha that it would
return in their own lifetimes and en-
able them to meet their own many-
times-great-grandchildren

  but the calculations were very in-
volved the best thinkers among the
ancestors differed in their predic-
tions of the arrival date some by
many years some by several or even
a dozen centuries

  at any rate rens world had always
been the corridors cubicles and rec-
reation spaces of the mile-long space-
ship the only other living things he
had ever known were those aboard it
he knew that it was emotional-prim-
itive-for him to be excited like this
but he didnt care strange ever since
setting foot on ismarus he hadnt
been particularly ashamed of any of
his emotions

  force screen captain caime chal-
lons pinging voice snapping him out
of it

  ren punched the button that would
throw protective force around the
gravity boat he expected the red in-
dicator to glow but it didnt and
challon was losing some of his cold
metal calm dont tell me that doesnt
work either he said definite anger
in his voice

  ren looked up and said have you
noticed were in some sort of an old
crater here do you suppose that has
anything to do with it

  suppose said challon we ex-
amine the facts first and then draw
our conclusions he said it quite
icily

  ren shrugged he had an enjoyable
momentary dream he pictured him-
self punching challons handsome
face and savored the idea then he
looked up again toward the rock
and the small rise that skirted away
from it he saw at least thirty human
figures come over the crest of the rise
and stand silhouetted against the yel-
low sky

  prepare to repel attack captain
snapped challon

  the others stirred buzzed pointed
drew sharp breaths

  battle stations ren called over
his shoulder

 he heard the protec guardsmen
shuffle about and take their places
jana moved to the bow of the gravity
boat and pointed to the photoscope
lets have a close look at them

  ren nodded switched the gadget
on he was pleasantly surprised to
find that it worked-it was one of the
few purely electronic devices in the
boat he began to adjust focus eleva-
tion and azimuth an image of one of
the human figures appeared became
sharp

  definitely humanoid said jana
softly she was squinting at the im-
age  she was in deepest concentration
ren saw her again-despite her good
looks and youthful features-as the
scientist the gal with the head full
of serious thoughts and no nonsense
about it

 the ismarian in the photoscope
screen was naked except for the grey-
furred skin of some animal wrapped
clumsily about his waist his skin
was white in the caucasian sense
but deeply tanned by sun and weather
he had matted brown hair across
his chest and shoulders and a thick
unkempt beard his mouth was part-
ly open as he stared at the gravity
boat and ren saw that his teeth were
yellow broken and mottled although
not especially large he carried a
metal-tipped spear in one hand and
a club of stone lashed to a wooden
haft hung from a thong at ihis waist

  its-its incredible jana said
staring at the image

  whats incredible asked chal-
lon he was moving about a bit nerv-
ously as though undecided about the
next thing to do

  jana nodded at the screen theyre
not only humanoid but their culture
is that of primitive earthmen the
law of averages would certainly in-
dicate some differences-
celestial landfall



  challon spoke a little wearily
jana our science has achieved its
present state by one very basic atti-
tude-taking nothing for granted
how do we know the law of averages
is valid in this particular place and
further to the scientific viewpoint
nothing is incredible you know that
jana tossed a quick sharp look at
the executive chief but didnt an-
swer ren knew how sihe felt-there
was just no point to answering a man
like that the fatuous dummy for all
his i q the fatuous dummy

the rank of ismarians came to
a ragged halt they were perhap
seventy-five yards away now they
began to gesture and parley among
themselves ren could hear -die sound
of their voices but could make out no
words

  wed better blast one just to let
them know what we can do said
challcn

 ren started to nod and then
brought his head up he gaped at
challon the man had given his order
so casually that its meaning hadnt
struck ren immediately ren said
look they havent tried to harm us
yet whats the use of blasting them
challons eyes were very hard as he
turned them upon ren captain i
didnt say to blast them i said to
blast one perhaps its unfortunate
we have to do that but its the wisest
move at present one sub-human life
isnt going to make much difference
in the outcome of this thing

  but even so if-

  im in command here captain
ren shut his mouth hard he didnt
bay anything

  challon kept the hard stare upon
him youll order one of your men
to blast the nearest ismarian now
captain

ren said ill be damned if i will
challons finely drawn eyebrows
rose oh he put his thumbs into
the golden belt that marked his rank

his tone didnt become angry his
face stayed calm metallic all right
captain well see about this later
he turned his head sergeant p
lokar bumbled forward yes sir
drop that man-the nearest one by
the rock there- with your reactor
lokar glanced at ren frowned
heavily then finally said yes sir
he raised his reactor which was pis-
tol-shaped except for the slender
crtjtchlike shoulder support he
aimed and he touched the trigger but-
ton

  nothing happened

  you should take better care of
your weapons said challon

  sergeant lokar had already re-
moved the rear plunger and was star-
ing into the anode-barrel but-but
theres nothing wrong with it he
said it just dont work thats all 
nonsense said challon he took
the weapon

  maybe its not nonsense ren said
softly the reactors nuclear too
nothing else nuclear works on the
boat-only the purely electronic
stuff

  the sergeant glanced toward the
ismarians they were closing their
ranks now and some were advancing
cautiously one with a bow and arrow
was dropping to his knee and fitting
a shaft to the string captain he
said to ren maybe we better get the
blazes out of here

  ren looked at challon how about
it

 we do seem to be temporarily
defenseless said challon scowling
he started to look about-with just
a touch of helplessness in his manner

  ren pointed sternward we can go
a hundred yards or so and be out o
this area-whatever it is the reactors
will probably work then if they at-
tack they might want to be friendly
you know

  as ren spoke a volley of arrows
came

  instinctively everyone ducked be


out of this worid adventures

hind the metal gunwales of the grav-
ity boat some of the arrows rustled
nastily overhead others struck the
sides of the vehicle with a soft clat-
ter

  all right well run for it said
challon you take over for the with-
drawal captain

ren turned a faint smile upon
challon and let him see the con-
tempt in it and then he called out his
orders scientists first he said
coolly guardsmen then deploy in
skirmish order in two ranks by squads
ten yards between ranks advance in
relays thirty yards at a time zig-zag
if they pursue fire as soon as your
weapons operate-rear rank always
firing everybody got that 

  the guardsmen nodded or indi-
cated understanding by silence and
moved to their places sergeant lokar
hustled the group of civilians to the
stern thwart and muttered instruc-
tions to them telling them to run
crouched and keep a zig-zag course

  the scientists-five men in civilian
permo-cloth and jana in her silver
halter and skirt-scrambled to the
ground they ran the first rank of
guardsmen leaped after them and
fanned out into a broken line the
second rank followed and ren and
challon went with it

  shouting came from the attackers
arrows snapped and fluttered all
around them ren turned his head for
a quick look the skin-clad muscular
hairy ismarians were charging after
them running with a kind of power-
ful waddle some were brandishing
their clubs and spears others were
dropping every few seconds to their
knees to discharge arrows again

  the first rank halted faced the rear
and crouched-the second rank kept
its broken course and ran through it
another thirty yards ahead of the
two ranks jana and the other scien-
tists continued to run when the sec-
ond rank came to its halt ren turned

with the rest and saw that the ismar-
ians were gaining upon them this
was to be expected since their retreat
consisted of both running and halting
-ren could only hope theyd make
the edge of the shallow crater in time
and after that he could only hope the
reactors would begin to work again

  the fugitives took one more relay
ren was in the foremost rank again
looking back he saw that the ismar-
ians had already reached the stalled
gravity boat-and that they were giv-
ing it a wide berth they passed it
warily that slowed them some well
a break there ren swiveled his head
to look forward again and saw the
beginnings of tough wiry grass and
cactus ahead the edge of the crater
or whatever it was jana and the five
scientists had already reached that
area and now they had paused to
wait for the guard the second rank
came running by one guardsman had
an arrow in his upper arm and was
being helped by a comrade another
lay toward the gravity boat lay very
still and an arrow grew from the
middle of his back

  ren rose to run again he turned
he looked toward the edge of the
crater and at that moment a dozen
ismarians suddenly appeared from be-
hind a fencelike outcropping ahead of
them and ran toward jana and the
five scientists

  get them dont let them shouted
ren his hand raised he ran forward

  he forgot to zig-zag maybe that
was it he felt an abrupt and terrible
blow in his shoulder and it spun him
he fell to one hand and knee he
stared stupidly at his shoulder and
saw the arrow in it-the arrow that
had gone all the way through he put
his hand on the protruding forepart
of the shaft he saw that there was
lots of blood

 most of all he wondered why it
didnt hurt it just felt numb it had
been painful when it struck but now
it felt only numb he shook his head
celestial landfall



and felt a little light-headed and
crazy about the whole thing

  he started forward again he saw
the dozen ismarians who had made the
flanking movement descending on
jana and the others like a flash flood
a guardsman reached one of them
ducked a blow from his club and
swiped him viciously across the cheek
with the stock of his reactor

  ren heard footsteps and grunting
behind him and several shouts he
spun his head to face it-feeling ter-
ribly dizzy as he did so

 he saw the blurred shadow of a
club and in the instant before he
found blackness he realized that it
was about to strike his skull after
that the blackness the deepest black-
est nothingness he had ever known

it was night when ren awoke he
didnt realize this at first of course
because he awoke very slowly his
hearing returning first and the sound
of the wind over the parched plain
coming to his ears next he opened
his eyes and when they focused he
saw the stars in front of them for a
moment he thought he was back in
space at the port or in the control
bubble of the alpha perhaps

  but he wasnt he was lying on his
back in what seemed to be the same
spot where he had fallen

  except for the purr of that breeze
it was very quiet

  he rose to one elbow that made
him dizzy he shook his head and
felt like retching and he decided he
would as soon as he got in a position
to he looked at his shoulder there
was no more arrow in it and the blood
around his wound had caked he
wasnt bleeding any more

 weak he fell back again and
thought some more

  he turned his head and saw a brok-
en stained arrow beside him it was
broken just behind the head in the
packed sand by it which glistened
very coldly in the light of ismaruss

moon he saw a footprint and a larger
depression as though someone had
knelt beside him now he could sup-
pose what had happened an ismarian
-the one who had struck him per-
haps-had removed the arrow and
then left suddenly probably called
when the others of the alpha were
subdued and captured and after that
theyd evidently forgotten about ren
supposed him dead

  his head began to ache now and he
groaned

  well no use wondering how hed
been left here-thing to do now was
to move recover find out about the
others he lay there for many long
minutes breathing slowly and deeply
and then finally somehow he man-
aged to move again he managed to
stagger squirm and crawl back to the
gravity boat it took him most of the
night it was nearly dawn when he
opened the seat lockers to find the
medicines and concentrated food

  tthe moon went down he sat there
in the darkness and munched on
energy biscuit and stared out at the
landscape the darkness wasnt ab-
solute-he could still see enough
shapes every once in a while to be
startled more than anything else he
kept thinking that jana was some-
where out there and as soon as he
could move a little better he was going
after her he was in love with jana
in the illogical primitive way the ro-
mances in the minifilm reader depict-
ed now he knew this too

  he ate slowly and thoughtfully he
stared at the barely discernible shape
of the large rock from behind which
the ismarians had first come

  for some reason this feeling of in-
tuition in him was stronger than ever
the quietness or his own weakness
perhaps at any rate he began to think
about ismarus and about everything
that had happened he recalled the
queer surge of emotion hed known
when the alpha first landed and he
oversaw the breaking out of tihe grsv-


out of this world adventures

ity boat he recalled the strong
primitive things hed felt-and the
way even challon had slipped into
anger and sarcasm he recalled that
first look at an ismarian in the photo-
scope he recalled the moon rising
and setting over the planet

  and the crater here nuclear de-
vices wouldnt work in it others
would his minifilm reader for in-
stance  that was purely electronic he
took it from his pocket again glanced
into it and saw once more the stand-
ard atom symbol which marked the
end of the tech manual just to make
doubly sure he tried projecting the
image on the instrument panel-and
that worked too

  his frown became a weighted thing
he held it for a long time he scarcely
dared believe what a kind of instinct
was telling him about ismarus

  he heard movement and the sound
of low voices by the big rock he
lifted ihis head quickly it was too
dark to see who made these noises
he dropped to one knee and then
moved carefully forward to the in-
strument panel the photoscope was
still focused upon the vicinity of the
rock he switched it on he worked
the lens angle to take in a wider
amount of area

  when the image came into being he
saw ismarians-a score of them per-
haps they were talking in low tones
to each other and every once in a
while pointing or staring in the direc-
tion of the gravity boat and behind
them he saw their captives bound
neck to neck by a series of crude
heavy ropes

there was in ren for a moment
an urge to get out of this place
to slip over the side of the gravity
boat and run in the opposite direction
then he could circle or wait-or do
something anyway to rescue his
friends later but he recognized this
urge for what it was plain panic

  and then his idea came to him

abrupt and full-blown out of the
darkness of the night

  this would work only if his guesses
were right and of course if it didnt
work then hed be quickly and easily
taken by the ismarians too he didnt
waste time thinking about it too much
he moved to the starboard rail
crouched there facing the rock and
took the minifilm reader from his
pocket

  he opened the flat little case and
held it toward the rock he thumbed
the projection switch

  a huge atom symbol glowed from
the face of the rock it was the same
design of nucleus electrons and their
orbits which had become in effect the
coat of arms for the people of the
alpha the thing that inspired an
uncomfortable sort of reverence every
time it appeared the symbol that
marked all their official seals and such
things as tech manuals-

  the bearded faces of the ismarians
were visible in the light reflected
from the image on the rock they
were all turned toward it ren could
see the ringed whites of eyes one
was trembling visibly and slowly
backing away from the thing another
was putting his forearm up in front
of his eyes

  one exceptionally large fellow fell
flat on his face before the symbol and
covered the back of his head with his
hands

  it was hard to say just who started
the rout maybe several did simultane-
ously but there was suddenly much
shouting and in the next instant the
skin-clad men were scattering-run-
ning pell mell away from there in
several directions

  ren didnt smile his face was
drawn and grave as he clambered
from the gravity boat and headed for
the bound captives

  challons voice sounded less metal-
lic than it usually did when he said
to ren well i dont know how you
did it-but you did it i guess youve
celestial landfall



got a permanent place in the alphan
annals now captain 

  but ren scarcely heard him most
of all he wanted to look into janas
grey eyes deeply he did this as he
unfastened the crude ropes about her
yellow dawn was breaking and he
could see her face in its broad clear
light he could see by her eyes that
she loved him too he spoke then
for everyone to hear but he was really
talking to jana

  ren said it wasnt coincidence at
all that we found ismarus it was
pretty much in our warp-curve after
all sometime somewhere the alpha
was bound to get to it

  whats this asked challon still
able to be just a mite pompous whats
this youre getting at now

  ren moved his eyes over the group
have you noticed the way you feel
on this planet the funny instincts
and emotions you get the kind of
things even our science cant quite
figure out he saw by their frowns
that they had not only ismarus but
its satellite and the whole solar sys-
tem-even its inhabitants-are like
those of earth there are slight dif-
ferences in mass and the shapes of
the continents for instance these
were the things that threw us off
challon had his finely formed head

cocked to one side you mean-this
is earth and theres been some kind
of flaw in time we came back in a
prehistoric period like the chellean

age

  not prehistoric said ren post-
historic theres been a catastrophe-
maybe to the very men who launched
the alpha the crater that interferes
with our nuclear devices by some kind
of radiation is probably a souvenir of
this i think well find lots of them
all over the planet whatever it was
it shook earth violently enough to
alter its mass and shape slightly
change the course of the rivers and
seas it must have been very terrible
and no wonder the savage descend-
ants of the survivors fear the atom
symbol when they see it

 they all stared at ren some
blinked not quite getting it

 now were home ren said to
them now weve got work to do
now weve got to start all over again
-and this time weve got to find some-
thing-some inner kind of something
-to keep the catastrophe from hap-
pening again he turned to jana he
took her hands and pulled her toward
him she smiled searching his eyes
and ren began to see where the be-
ginnings of this inner something
might be

    curtain call

  pike pickens had been the greatest t-v star on earth
  until he took that star trip was he now destined
  to put on the finest show of his carer just for an
  exclusive audience of man-eating fiends

 by len  moffatt

the history of show
business it will have
to be recorded that
vaudeville died two
deaths the first
death was caused by
the advent of the
moving picture and
the radio program- the rebirth of
vaudeville was due to the happy union
of television an ancient term for
video and die-hard vaudevillians

  as for the cause of the second death
of vaudeville  well there are many
different views on the subject it is
my own opinion that the so-called
new musicoloroma video shows
killed vaudeville-little over three
years ago people are so easily led into
eads i contend that these pseudo-cul-
ture programs of artistic and intel-
lectual significance will sicken and
die of their own stench and once again
video fans will howl for new and
different escapes vaudeville will re-
turn

  but im getting away from my
story i mentioned that there were
several reasons expounded as to why
vaudeville lost popular favor for the
second time one of the most popular
-and in my opinion most erroneous
-theories was that pike pickens
killed vaudeville now i could sit

right here and say that pike pickens
was one of the best comedians of all
time i could even say he was the
greatest all-round song and dance man
of all time and millions including
the pike pickens fan club in colday
jupiter would agree with me true
there are many who would disagree
especially those who get so much
stupid satisfaction out of musicolor-
oma for pickens and his show was
something you had to either love or
loath no fence sitters as far as pick-
ens was concerned

  now i rather liked pike pickens
and his video show knew him per-
sonally of course appeared a few
times on his program in fact but that
is still another story

  i thought you might like to know
what happened to pickens after the
second death of vaudeville oh you
know now of course but i bet you
dont know it all and anyway i mean
right after the depresh hit us

  i know i wondered where pike had
gotten to lost touch with him for
awhile you see most all ex-vaude-
villians were seeking employment in
other fields and we didnt always have
time for the old get-togethers like
we used to have   

  i finally got this job here not bad
when the customers are drunk enough
to be generous and yet not so drunk
as to miss the hat i often wonder how
much money i actually lose when the
coins roll under the table and are
retrieved by the damned busboy
who i know makes more than me in
tips and poor service he gives too   

 no one seemed to know what hap-
pened to pickens poor pike so very
famous presumed to be loaded with
the long green so what if vaudeville
did pffft they said old pike has
more dollars than he can spend in
two lifetimes thats what they
thought hah remember the sub-
space investment bubble pike and

a few others myself not excluded got
took good on that deal of course the
guys behind it didnt make out so good
either not unless they can spend the
stuff in sub-sub-space or wherever
they took off to when the govern-
ment boys cracked down on them

 well when i got to wondering
more than a little about pike and got
over the letdown of working in a
crummy joint like this i thought id
look him up i figured he was probably
doing as bad as me so neither of us
would have anything to be ashamed
of he didnt have me on his last few
programs got the idea it was me who




out of this world adventures

talked him into the subspace deal he
was just as excited about it as any of
us but i figured we were both too
poor to be sore at each other and then
there was always the chance that he
was doing a bit better than me and
might know of something extra in the
way of a break for me well you
know how it is

  i couldnt find pike anywhere im-
agine that if you can a big name in
show biz and nobody-but nobody-
knew where he was

it was only pure luck and by ac-
cident that i found out about him
i had the afternoon off    oh this
was over a year and a half ago i went
down to the spaceport to watch this
new job take off yeah i know you
know but listen all of it you dont
know

 everybody and his brother was
there everybody and his brothers
brother but im an old crowd dodger-
througher and managed to get as close
as the law allowed it looked like just
an ordinary spacer to me and i
thought hell i shoulda stood at home
and got it on video you remember
they were going to make a special
announcement about it and what the
special announcement was yeah sub-
space the government had taken it
over and had really developed it that
is the science boys with the un
though the way the announcer talked
youd think hed done it all by him-
self i think hes the same guy thats
on that early afternoon musicoloroma
show hell of a thing to wake up to
but it does give the correct time

  so this ship was going off into sub-
space and come out on the other side
of alpha watchamacallit yeah cen-
tauri ever hear pike sing his song
on that little did he know   

  and theyd be back within a year
according to the schedule yeah i
know you know all about that but i
wanted to tell you about pike pickens
he was on it a member of the crew

of the faraway world a messman
yet of course pike always was a
good cook gad the parties he used
to throw and the food none better

  pike-too old dont kid yourself
buddy sure we had that running gag
about his age but dont forget he may
have been around in show biz a long
time but he started young remember
the child star of video that was
him under his real name then little
lewey yoder didnt know that eh
why i thought every pike pickens
fan knew that   

  getting back to pike and the fara-
way world i found out he was aboard
when they read the list of crewmen
and their occupations at first it
didnt click and i almost didnt hear
it his name being down at the bottom
of the list of messmen and beginning
with a y too when the announcer
said lewis yoder it didnt mean
a thing to me til about two seconds
afterwards i does a double-take and
ask aloud did he say yoder

  the lady next to me said yoder
schmoder so what i still dont see
how a submarine is gonna work in
space and it looks just like any old
spacetub to me

 get it subspace submarine in
space she actually said it to ive been
saving that one when vaudeville
comes back   

  but getting back to yoder alias
pike pickens i knew i had found
him the announcer said something
about last minute visits of friends and
relatives i rushed to the administra-
tion building there at the spaceport
and put in a request to visit pike
yoder that is told them it was very
important etc thought pike might
refuse to see me since it looked like
he was hiding out from all of us  but
i was wrong he saw me and a half
dozen other show biz characters a
typical pike pickens going-away
party on a much smaller scale than
usual of course

  but all we needed was pike the
alpha centauri curtain call



bottle he was passing around helped
too but pike was pike at his best
which is the way he always is in my
opinion knocking himself out to get
a laugh anything for applause and
haw-haws he sang he danced he
cracked wise he out-punned jack
forst whom you know is considered
the worlds in fact the systems
champion punster he did imitations
good old pike he just threw the
whole thing at us in a half hour or so
wonderful all we had time for was
to say good luck and maybe weep a
little into the empty bottle

  then pike danced his way out of
the room-his usual half-drag half-
bounce exit-and he was gone gone
forever we thought for we had little
faith in the subspace thing even with
the un backing it now and the fact
that pike was sticking his neck out

well that didnt mean much not
that pike was the hero type but
he wasnt kidding me with all that
buck and wing glad-hand hoopla and
hokum all that song and dance was
just a cover up he was really low
believe me

  i saw him that way only once be-
fore and that was when his third wife
died never married again after that
you know really had a find in her
and bingo shes killed in that airbus
accident he put his show on that
night same as usual and a lot of people
said it wasnt right for him to do it
but pike would never let an audience
down never walk out on his loyal fans
it was tearing his heart out but he
went out there and put on one of the
best shows video has ever seen and
thats the way he was the day of the
take-off he was just putting on his
last show-for us his personal
friends swan song and dance and
then piiiit

  he figured like we did subspace
was the end he wasnt going to
stick around and see if vaudeville
would come back he was living now

and he couldnt stand living without
it so    death to pike pickens and
let lewis yoder messman live awhile
until    until whatever happens to
people who dare to enter subspace
happened it was supposed to be a
short cut to other systems he hoped
it would be a short cut to oblivion

  ok ok im telling it

  you see pike pickens wasnt dead
at all you just cant kill a good vaude-
villian how do i know i got it from
a spaceman who was also a crew-
member on the faraway world you
remember when the faraway world
returned and was covered with glory
and whatnot well of course i tried
to find out if pike got back ok but
when i got to the spaceport it was so
jammed with people i couldnt even
get into the place this time why they
didnt stay at home and get it on video
ill never know

 well i had a reason for going
down i had to see if our boy pike
got back finally i gave up trying to
buck the crowd and went across the
street to a bar thought id wait til
things calmed down

  a guy was sitting there drinking
beer and making loud smacking noises
and then hed bang his fist on the bar
and sing out for more i noticed he
wasnt paying and wondered about it
until the barkeep says for him to
drink up spaceman its on the house

  i been dreaming of this said the
spaceman i been dreaming of this
for months real honest-to-gawd beer
aaah

  maybe i should call you subspace-
man cracked the barkeep i got it
then this spaceman was a special
friend of the barkeeps and somehow
he had eluded the cheering crowd and
got into this quiet little bar to enjoy
his beer in peace this guy was a far-
away world crewman and maybe hed
know about pike so i asked him

  lewis yoder he repeated rather
doubtfully yoder  oh you mean
pike ow pike pickens hell we


out of this world adventures

recognized him right off him and
that fake name yoder who wouldnt
know pike why ive been a pike
pickens fan for as long as i can re-
member

  my heart warmed to this intelligent
young spaceman it is people like him
who will bring vaudeville back to its
true place in the world of show busi-
ness

  could you tell me-about pike
i asked i was a little afraid if any-
thing had happened to him    yet i
had to know you know how it is

  tell you about pike he said
could i tell you about pike i sure
as hell could t every man jack on the
faraway world could tell you about
pike i suppose itll hit all the news-
casts but wholl believe it or get it
right let me tell you about pike
pickens like he used to say voss
dere chollie

  he told me about pike

it seems that the trip through
subspace was a snap no one even
got spacesick in fact those who had
gotten spacesick from being in regu-
lar space felt good again when they
went into subspace drive-whatever
that means and got sick again when
they came out of it and into normal
space again they got to alpha you-
know and were coasting around look-
ing for a planet similar to terra or at
least one where they could use the
suits and masks they use on venus
jupiter etc this you must have
heard or read

  well after all their technical test-
ing and what not they land on this
small planet which proves to be sim-
ilar to good old terra in atmosphere
and gravity they divide the crew up
into scouting parties and take turns
going out looking for inhabitants
hotn fauna and other things and stuff
they look for on alien planets

  i guess the science boys had a great
time though every one else had been
ored by the trip and were even more

bored by the planet it was similar to
earth as far as gravity and air were
concerned but the landscape looked
like one big rock slab with cracks in
it here and there some crazy kind of
vegetation grew in clumps around
these cracks but otherwise-nothing

  incidentally the spaceman told me
that the boredom of the trip had been
alleviated by pikes putting on some
of his acts for the crew i guess most
of them liked it though the spaceman
said there were a few who actually
got up a petition asking him to can
it for a couple of days now how any-
one can be bored by the versatility of
pikes talents ill never know

  anyway like i said the crew was
divided up into scouting parties and
came the day that the party pike was
in though im sure it wasnt his favo-
rite kind of party heh-heh-heh was
supposed to do the scouting each
day the party on duty would make a
circle of the ship going out farther
each time i think it was the third or
fourth day of scouting if i remember
correctly

  the spaceman who told me this was
in this party too name oh yes his
name was wally wally said they got
pretty far away from the spacer they
had two of the techs with them the
scientists you know about all the
crewmen had to do was keep a sharp
lookout and let the techs know if they
saw anything unusual or saw trouble
coming etc they had stopped near
one of those big cracks in the rock
floor and the techs were messing
around with the vegetation growing
there

  wally was helping pike set up his
portable mess outfit as it was getting
near chowtime pike as usual was
singing and wisecracking while some
of the men laughed and a few dead-
heads grumbled

  then it happened

  something came up out of the crack
in the rock and absorbed the two
techs some of the men would never
alpha centauri curtain call



have saw it happen if the techs hadnt
screamed all the time they were being
absorbed it took several seconds i
guess

  of course the men were awe-struck
and just stood there staring then
they started to shoot at the things
with the variety of weapons they car-
ried with them everything from 
pistols to flame-throwers the thing-
which looked like a big mass of
orange-colored gelatin-wobbled up
out of the crack and came towards
them

  looking back over their shoulders
as they ran they saw that more of the
things were coming up for air too-
and for them the alien beings must
have had mental telepathy or some-
thing because presto more of them
popped up out of the ground several
yards ahead of them they were sur-
rounded cut off from the ship the
techs had been carrying the walkie-
talkie and it was gone with them

 eventually someone would come
from the ship looking for them even-
tually in the meantime the   the 
things would be eating them alive

wally or someone figured the
things could throw up an in-
visible shield around themselves only
way he could explain that the weap-
ons didnt stop the monsters the
things moved slowly but were closing
steadily in    everyone was scared
speechless

  that is everyone but our boy pike
pickens he was scared too but never
speechless

  maybe we can reason with em
he suggested get in contact   
think at them   

  this is no time for jokes croaked
someone they probably dont think
the way we do    theyre completely
alien   

  the man started shooting again
wasting their ammo

  wait a minute  called pike i
got an idea

 by this time the men were too
scared to object if they wanted to
so pike outlined his plan

 look guys he said when i
started on this tour i wasnt figuring
on coming back im surprised we
got this far as long as i dont have
vaudeville to go back to i dont much
care if i ever get back to terra or any-
where in our system then there was
a gal named melina    gone too so
heres what i propose ill do every-
thing i can to attract these things
attention ill try to get them to chase
me then maybe the rest of you can
find a break between and try for the
ship what can you lose

  nothing could they lose someone
suggested drawing lots someone sug-
gested that more than one person
make the sacrifice on the theory that
the monsters would be more inclined
to chase two or three people than just
one but when pike has the stage hes
the whole show no one can steal
scenes from him he insisted that they
do it his way and there was little time
for argument

  here i go he said thats what
he always said just before every show
just before the signal said on the
air   here i go

  he started off at an angle between
the two groups of monsters he faced
the group that was between them and
the ship if he could distract their
attention get them after him alone
he began a sidestep dance and sang
take me back to alpha cen-
tauri   

  the rock ground was really hard
and his metallic shoes made the tap-
clog sound good this was really his
swan song and dance yessir   

  he sang louder and danced harder
and gave that familiar shout between
lines   

  yaaaaaaaaa

  the alien beings began to move to-
wards pike pike alone it was almost
too good to be true was what some
of the crewmen said of course they


out of this world adventures

hated to see pike get it but the rest
of them would be saved  

  they could see the ship now if the
monsters would move just a little
more pike went into a buck and wing
and then began his imitations then
back to the song and dance routine
again hamming it up good

  the things kept after him and
pike kept moving

  the crewmen broke and ran half-
way back to the ship wally turned
around to see what had happened to
pike fie had heard no screaming in
fact he could still hear pike sing-
ing   

  there was pike dancing and singing

surrounded by the monstrous blobs

  he raised his voice a pitch higher
and -began all over again

  the monsters moved in    closer
   closer   

  then    they all dropped dead

  wally said pike felt really low-
down and blue about it all the way
back to terra until one of the techs
finally explained to him that it was
probably the sonic vibrations peculiar
to pikes voice or any singing human
voice which killed the alien beings
and not necessarily the quality of
pikes songs dances and snappy
chatter  

  beer dont mind if i do  

ders of the solar frontier

            continued from page 

ries asking her to use her influence
with pemberthy if she had any in-
fluence to try to get him the arms
that he so sorely needed

  its hopeless he said i cant
hght lethal rays with quarterstaves
and cutlasses and crossbows- he
passed his door and did not notice
would not have cared if he had no-
ticed- and that fat little beggar is
sitting on top of enough material
to turn this world into a fortress   

  ill see what i can do my dear
i wont promise anything but the
next time that he has me up to his
room for cocktails ill put your case
as strongly as i can the trouble is
he might be jealous

  what of

  nothing she smiled up at him
her eyes greenly luminous under the
rusty hair nothing at all alan but
whose fault is that

  perhaps mine

  yes perhaps yours

  but a man has certain loyal-
ties   

  why worry about loyalties when
time is so short tomorrow or the
ay after the black ship of the aliens

may attack she may even now be at-
tacking    and whether we win or
whether we lose it will have been
something to have had each other
and you talk of loyalties what cause
has lauranne given you to be loyal

  i wasnt thinking of lauranne
lied latimer i was thinking of my
duty to this world to the race i was
thinking- he lapsed into silence
and thought

  bloody liar of course you were
thinking of lauranne and yet-
ailsa is so different and itfs no use
kidding yourself that youre going to
win this forthcoming scrap and get
a free pardon and marry the girl be-
cause youre not even with thunder-
queens armory and workshops thrown
open to youf you wouldnt stand a
snowballs chance in hell all you can
do is fight to the last man and the last
gun if fatty pemberthy lets you have
the guns in time-and see to it that
that mousy little mutant fenwick
does his stuff before you blow the
last round away so why not but
lauranne   

  and there came to him the memory
o those lines of poetry that his wife
raiders of the solar frontier



had quoted when he was new oit
ceres only a short time ago it was
as men measure time but it seemed
that laurannes voice was coming to
him over unguessable gulfs

  there go the loves that wither

     the old loves with wearier wings

  and all dead years draw thither

     and all disastrous things  

  the dead years he thought and the
old love that has withered and a dis-
astrous thing drawing closer and ever
closer from the stars i wilt do my
best i will fight to the last man and
the last gun but i reserve the right
to snatch some few moments of per-
sonal happiness from the wreck  

they had come now to one of the
big park spaces at this hour it
was almost deserted and the sun lamps
in the blue haze of the high roof
were dimmed and across from the
wide expanse of lawn and beds of
flowering plants there were trees
and the azure mist seemed to curl
through their branches in this world
of caves and tunnels where there was
neither night nor day there was yet
the dim mystery of evening and the
knowledge that the twilight had been
turned on by some grubby little tech-
nician did nothing to detract from its
magic

  for the magic was within them-
selves

  slowly arms around each others
waists they walked across the grass
to the trees and in the privacy af-
forded by the overhanging branches
they found a couch of soft moss and
the girls face as she lay relaxed was
a pale glimmer in the dusk and her
eyes were like two of the stars that
were all that was lacking from the
man-made dusk

  latimer stood looking down at her
there was power in those eyes and a
depth in which he could easily drown
now that the moment had come the
opportunity he was strangely re-
luctant to press home the attack it

would be nice to be able to say that it
was the thought of lauranne that
acted as a deterrent but it would not
be true what held him back was
the realization that he was not the
attacker but the defender and the
dim knowledge that far more was at
stake than his unimportant virtueo

 ailsa said why dont you sit
down the moss is soft  

  and lauranne although far from
his thoughts was not far away in the
flesh the bushes briefly protested at
the rapid passage of a body through
their interlacing branches there was
the dull gleam of an uplifted blade in
the twilight and there was a sput-
tering shower of blue sparks as the
blade struck home

chapter v

the monsters in their midst

alan latimer was fast there
was only one thing that saved his
wifes life-and that was the strange
thing that had happened when she
buried her knife in the body of her
rival it didnt make sense and so
latimer who by his grip on laur-
annes wrists had prevented a sec-
ond blow did not turn the knife as
he could easily have done did not
end laurannes life as she had ended
ailsa raes

  but he said bitterly with grim in-
tensity you bitch

  im not sorry you cant make me
say im sorry you can break my
wrist and use my knife on me but im
glad i did it

 how did you know we were
here

  what does it matter i wanted to
see you-oh no nothing personal
merely something that you as big
white chief of ceres should have
known about and when you didnt
come i went first to the bosss of-
fice and there were two officers from
the ship just going in with a big
case but the guards wouldnt let me


out of this world adventures

in and while i was still arguing
kimball came out with the two men
from thunderqueen and told me that
you had been there with pemberthy
and wood about an hour ago  
you saw kimball

 and why not is there a law
against it

  no but it may interest you my
dear to know that the last time i
saw the boss wood was sending him
on a trip down to the fertilizer tanks
and he had his belly blown out   
but i saw him i tell you i saw
him  

  latimer relaxed his grip of his
wifes wrists he wanted time to think
things out it seemed that there was
some phony time element involved
but lauranne had said that she had
seen the boss after she had sent lane
with his message and the problem
was of -such importance that it
dwarfed into insignificance the fact
that at their feet the girl ailsa was
sprawled ungracefully supine a
broken doll he forgot ailsa but
lauranne did not

 before alan latimer could stop
her she had fallen upon the body was
ripping and thrusting with her knife
and a low moaning sound came from
the dead womans lips and her right
arm went up feebly jerkily to ward
off the attack and the right knee
flexed and then suddenly straight-
ened and again there were the sput-
tering sparks the smell of ozone and
something small and hairy scuttled on
long spidery legs from under the
body screaming shrilly and wordless-
ly as it ran

 lauranne threw her knife bilt
missed and latimer jerked himself
out of his mood of shocked stupefac-
tion and jumped he landed squarely
on the little monstrosity and as he
stamped its life out with his heavy
boots he found himself feeling grate-
ful that he was in uniform and not
shod with thin civilian sandals

  he turned to look at his wife and

she stood and looked at him and the
twilight seemed alive with stealthy
menace

  he said so thats the way of it
thats why wood never knew me al-
though he was executive officer of
thunderqueen when she picked up
pathfinders boat and thats why
there have always seemed to be too
damn many of these people from the
ship

he stooped over the body it
was now as lifeless and as un-
convincing as a dressmakers dummy
it was not even very cleverly made
just a roughly human robot of metal
and plastic latimer found the knife
himself began to rip and tear but
his use of the weapon was actuated
by curiosity rather than by vicious-
ness and he found that the robot
had a human brain part of a human
brain just a sliced and mutilated
mass of grey tissue floating in a
transparent container with wiring
running from it to the little com-
partment in the lower part of the
body that had housed the alien the
controls of the robot

  just a trojan horse murmured
latimer softly but how    oh
thats the way it must have been
theyre master psychologists these
   things and given the rough
framework as a basis they could
create the illusion of a living breath-
ing actuality and theyd have the
victims memory cells to work
with   

  he held the container in his hands
it-she-must still be alive   
and he felt an overwhelming re-
gret that he had never known the real
ailsa rae-and when his mind
slipped into imaginings of what must
have been done to her and to all of
thunderqueens crew he was glad
when lauranne jerked him back to
the present with a voice that was un-
naturally harsh

  so you fell in love with a thing
raiders of the solar frontier



like an overgrown spider arent you
grateful to me for saving you from
a fate worse than death she
sneered

  i suppose so he replied listless-
ly ungratefully but what was it
you wanted me for

  you can take an intelligent inter-
est now cant you well i went out
through the northwest gate its hard-
ly ever used as you know and i
found a ships boat there was a man
beside it he must have died almost
as soon as he set foot outside the
airlock the boat itself was damaged
some kind of projectile had smacked
clean through the cabin and the
pilot must have been wounded by it
got into his suit and lasted just long
enough to get down to ceres  

  a boat lauranne this is great
it means that we can get news
through to earth then his face
darkened for all that he or anybody
on ceres knew earth had fallen al-
ready to the invaders was overrun
with little horrors that scuttled on
long spidery legs that screamed
wordlessly as they ran he could not
hope to fathom the alien mentality
but it seemed to him that those who
had come in the captured liner would
hardly have bothered themselves with
ceres unless the penal planetoid was
merely the laboratory out of which
would come the formula for the con-
quest of the solar system

  we will see the boat he said

 what about this lauranne
spurned with her foot the wreckage
that had been ailsa rae and that
she pointed with her toe to the pulpy
mass out of which protruded one
long many-jointed leg

  yes youre right if they find this
mess the balloon will go up at once
and we shall have no chance either
to warn earth or to put the other
plan into effect   

  he took the knife and with its aid
scraped a shallow grave with scant
courtesy he pushed the robots body

into it and then gingerly lifted the
crushed remains of the alien and
dropped them beside the body he
stood with the brain case the pitiful
remnant of what had been the girl
ailsa bobbing gently up and down
inside it in his hands he made as
though to put into the grave hesi-
tated looked at the knife that he had
left lying on the ground

  lauranne snatched the case from
his hands she threw it down
snatched up the knife and put all her
strength into one chopping blow
the little plastic sphere split the
fluid and what had been floating in
the fluid oozed over the moss

  and thats all spat the woman
viciously bury it with the rest of
the rubbish and come and look at the
boat

the sun was harshly bright over
the northwest face of ceres when
they stepped out of the rarely used
airlock the lifeboat was not imme-
diately visible at first latimer was
inclined to doubt the truth of laur-
annes story to believe that she had
lured him out here for some dark
purpose of her own

  it so happened that the killing of
her rival was not murder was just
the first minor victory of humankind
over the aliens but he knew that this
fact was merely incidental and he
felt for his wife a new respect that
was more than the old respect re-
vived that had never held a tinge
of fear he was glad that she wa
leading the way that he did not have
to bear ever in mind his unprotected
back

  here we are said lauranne sud-
denly her voice tinny in the speaker
of the helmet set she was standing
on the brink of one of the many
craters that pitted the face of ceres
this one was almost circular was
about fifty feet in depth the walls
were rugged but it was the rugged-
ness of molten matter that in solidt-
no

out of this world adventures

fying has made a permanent record
of all the eddies the liquid turbu-
lence of its flow at first the boat
was almost invisible only the very
extremity of her bows reflected the
shaft of sunlight that slanted down
into the pit and then as the sun
rapidly climbed into the black
heavens she was revealed as by the
pulling back of a dark curtain

  carefully choosing each foothold
and handhold with caution lauranne
clambered down into the crater lati-
mer followed and it was not long
before he was standing on the fused
rocks looking up at the hull of the
boat that was of greater importance
to him and the race than to the crew
of the ship for which it had been
supplied

  he shifted his regard to the open
airlock the flimsy telescopic gang-
way and the body that lay at the foot
of the spidery contraption it was
that of a man and though his armor
was undamaged he himself had suf-
fered grievous hurt it was easy to
see through the transparent globe of
the helmet that one side of the face
was dark with clotted blood that
had the pilot lived he would never
have seen again out of that eye

  latimer looked up to the cabin of
the boat he saw the ragged hole that
had been made by the passage of a
projectile decided that the damage
had been done by one of the four-
inch guns carried by merchantmen as
a concession to those who demanded
that the liners of space go armed
about their lawful occasions he
smiled grimly if those antiquated
weapons couldnt even put a ships
boat completely out of commission
what use would they be against a
pirate or a raider from outside but
all this was irrelevant he climbed
the catwalk into the cabin

  once inside the little compartment
he ignored the bloodstains the dam-
age that was more spectacular than
serious what held his attention was

the log book on the desk by the con-
trol panel he read the words log
of the spaceship thunderqueen voy-
age  commenced april  
finished   

 and where the date should have
been filled in would have been filled
in had thunderqueen completed her
voyage was a dark splash it could
have been ink but latimer preferred
to think that it was blood it was
more symbolic

 with clumsy gloved hands he
tried to open the stiff board covers
at his first attempt he found himself
reading the details of the liners load-
ing at port curtis at the second at-
tempt he struck a days routine
record of orbits and positions all the
trivia of a well run ship and his
third attempt revealed only blank
pages

lauranne had followed him into
the boat

 shut the doors he ordered
both of them the woman obeyed
and then latimer went to the locker
in which were kept spares and tools
of all kinds took a sheet of thick
transparent plastic and hurriedly and
roughly cut it to shape with the big
shears he took the electric welder
out of the box hoped that there
would be enough power in the bat-
teries to operate it there was and
when the joints had been made to his
satisfaction he opened the valve of
the emergency air tank snapped
down the switch of the cabin heater

  why didnt he    began laur-
anne

 maybe he couldnt its easy
enough when you have two hands to
work with and its my guess that the
poor devil had only one    lati-
mer was stripping the thick metal-
plated gloves off his hands as he
spoke he flung open the visor of his
helmet and he snatched the log
book from the desk and started to
read aloud

chapter vi
to the last man

womanlike following his re-
cital of the dead mans log
lauranne had been inspecting the fit-
tings of the little cabin a switch
went down under her inquisitive fin-
gers and suddenly there was music
strains that abruptly faded and were
replaced by a mans voice

  on the last note it will be pre-
cisely eighteen hundred gmt it
said the measured notes came in
strong and clear then here is the
news    there followed a recital
of the past days events on earth and
in the colonies there was nothing
to merit a headline there was no
word of thunderqueen not a whis-
per of alien invasion

  latimer sighed gustily i was al-
ways afraid that we were the last
and not the first he admitted but
this is as far as theyve got then
hell the radio it works

 of course it works pemberthy
and wood-or the things masquerad-
ing as pemberthy and wood-went
along to our station with carter and
in charge of the box of tricks right
now will be a thing masquerading as
carter   

 heres the way i see it when
they indulge in their fancy brain
surgery they help themselves to all
the memories of the victim they
know a fair amount about earth and
they found out about ceres this
world has been just a laboratory
guinea pig theyre working out
techniques finding out how much
they can get away with and when
theyre ready theyll take over leave
a garrison and push off in thunder-
queen for earth

  and if they handle things really
well nobody will ever know that
theres been an invasion at least
not until they can afford to come out
into the open and slaughter the few
real humans who survive   

  and what do we do about it
now we have the boat we can
warn earth what sort of shape is
she in

  not bad    but how that poor
devil managed to land her-weak as
he was and with only one good hand
-is more than i can say the jovian
system is handiest now  if we
can take the boat there we can use
their wireless   

  but suppose   

 have to take that risk ive
checked the fuel even to ganymede
it means free fall most of the way
and the other plan the original
dont know but it would be safer
trouble is that we cant trust fen-
wick to go ahead with his part of it
unless he has moral support or a
pistol at his back  
raiders of the solar frontier



 yes it would be best that and
the boat and ill see what i can do
with fenwick  

  they clambered out of the lifeboat
down into the pit into which she had
been set as they passed the dead
man latimer thought briefly of giv-
ing him decent burial decided re-
gretfully that there where so many
other things of far more pressing
importance and the unknown watch-
officer of the jovian liner would not
thank them for wasting time on a
ceremony that would shortly be en-
tirely meaningless

  the sun had set and the cold struck
through their insulated suits lati-
mer looked up at the frosty stars
wondered whence had come the little
world with its alien invaders he
wondered how many other races had
fallen victims to its vampire inhabit-
ants then dismissed such queries
from his mind as being useless if
things went well nobody would ever
know anything about the aliens ex-
cept such scraps of information that
survived about their appearance
their methods of waging war the
log of thunderqueen would be the
tomb of a race if fenwicks doubt-
ful courage would stand the test

  they came to the airlock together
they entered the prison world of
ceres with its parks and its gardens
its cargo of broken lives its freight
of menace from beyond the stars to-
gether they walked along the softly
lit corridors closer to each other than
they had been for many a month and
together they entered the park in
which the false ailsa had been
killed

  it seemed-here in this world with-
out seasons-that there was the smell
of autumn in the air every breath
they took brought with it the sense
of the transitory nature of all things
but the spell was abruptly broken
when they came to the grave in which
they had buried the shattered re-
mains of alien and robot

  an open empty trench yawned be-
fore their eyes

it was fenwick who was first to
meet them

  as they hurried over the wide ex-
panse of park they saw a little agi-
tated figure stumbling towards them
and the grotesque haste of the little
man flitting through the twilight
like some agitated bat served to em-
phasize the distant mutter of side-
arms the roaring murmur of many
voices of which they had become in-
creasingly conscious

  latimer i gasped fenwick it is
you isnt it say it is you theyve
taken the controls of the moving
ways they hold all the airlocks   
and our people are holding out in
the marlowe memorial   

  how are they doing

  they cant hold much longer the
others have more guns-the only ones
that we have are those weve taken
from dead bodies and they arent
bodies latimer they arent bodies
 i tell you that theyre only flimsy
affairs of wire and plastic    what
are these things and theyve
brought heavy guns from the ship
mounted on carriages and theyre
firing them down the corridors and
tunnels  

  is the tunnel clear

  i dont know it was i came past
that way and i didnt see anybody
 or anything    but youre not
   say that youre not

  i am fenwick we are come on

  latimer pulled out the gun that
he had taken from the body of the
thing clothed as ailsa rae with his
left hand he gripped the arm of the
little thief lauranne on the other
side did likewise they hurried him
over the short grass towards the
mouth of the tunnel that would af-
ford the shortest approach to the big
burglarproof door proof-that is-
against the common run of cracks-
men but this fenwick was not of the


out of this world adventures

commonality star-b e g o  e n his
father a spaceman the faulty insula-
tion of some long ago broken-up ship
had produced in him a mutation a
gift that could have led to distinc-
tion fame in the world of science
that would have led to such distinc-
tion had it not been for the fatal taint
that had brought him to rot on ceres

  it was an awareness of more di-
mensions than three it was the abil-
ity with simple tools or no tools at
all to force the most complicated
lock of mans devising to his will
it was a gift that could have been
used to unlock the ultimate secrets
of matter and it was a gift that had
been used to unlock safes and the
vaults of banks

  it was a gift that in the end would
procure for its owner a world for a
funeral pyre

  as they left the park the thunder
of gunfire became louder more om-
inous the crackle of the smaller
weapons was almost continuous and
now and again would come the deep
reverberating boom of the artillery
latimer thought of his men hemmed
in in the marlowe memorial wished
vainly that he was with them and he
wished that he had some way of let-
ting them know that the rearguard
action they were fighting was not in
vain that every minute gained con-
tributed to the ultimate downfall of
the invaders

  there had been fighting along this
tunnel there were the bodies of men
and women some few had been shot
in the head those corpses had not
been violated the majority had been
killed by body wounds every battle-
field in mans long bloody history
has known the plunder of the slain
but never such gruesome pillage as
this

  at the mouth of the tunnel leading
to the door to the power plant there
were four guards they wore robot
bodies their own flimsy anatomies
could never have hoped to handle the

heavy guns that they carried but
these were no robots clothed in the
illusion of flesh and blood they had
a rough scarecrow similarity to hu-
mankind and that was all

  unaccountably they hesitated it
may have been that they took the
three running towards them for their
own kind although that in view of
their undeniable telepathic powers
is doubtful but they hesitated it
was only for a split second but it was
enough the circuits and relays ac-
tuating their mechanical muscles
could never hope to equal the speed
with which latimer aimed and fired
the sound of gunfire was thunderous
in the tunnel and before the last
echoes had even considered dying all
four of the alien guards were down
each with an explosive slug in the
compartment in which lived the con-
trolling intelligence

 and fenwick was down

he was not dead one of the
bullets fired by the guards had
struck the tunnel wall against which
he was crouched the explosion had
driven fragments of stone deep into
his side he was not dead yet laur-
anne knelt beside him doing what
little she could whilst latimer col-
lected the weapons of their fallen
enemies

 the wounded man writhed and
groaned

  stay with me he pleaded dont
let them open my head   
dont    he clung to laurannes
hand looked up at her with the
pleading eyes of a hurt spaniel

  ill stay she promised

  with pistols stowed all around his
person alan latimer came to his
wife and fenwick

  how is he he demanded little
of gentleness in his tone

  hell last replied the woman
long enough   

  they picked up the wounded man
carried him to the huge gleaming
raiders of the solar frontier



door that blocked the tunnel they
set him down on the stone floor they
looked in baffled wonderment at the
array of wheels and dials and sym-
bols set on the metal surface it
seemed to them that even if one
should have the right combination
the opening of the way to the power
station would be a task only to be
undertaken after prayer and fasting

  fenwick looked up at the door too
it was not the first time he had seen
it when he arrived on ceres he had
been taken by kimball who had
heard of his gifts to make an inspec-
tion the boss had asked him then
if he could open the door without
unleashing the doom that lay behind
it truthfully he had replied no if
he had been able to answer yes he
would have been after the boss the
most powerful man in ceres

 now he was the most powerful
man in ceres

  and the irony of it was that if he
were asked the same question as be-
fore the answer would be an un-
qualified affirmative

 in the past the power that lay
within his mind had been a wild tal-
ent uncontrolled and uncontrollable
it had been impossible to concentrate
to hold the flickering picture steady
not that it was ever a picture-the
word is used merely for convenience
but the sense of perception came and
went faded and waxed strong faded
again not to return for hours or days
or months now with the changes
wrought in his brain and neural
structure by pain by the slight de-
composition that precedes the death
of a living organism the picture was
bright and steady and his mind as
it were went out and handled the
beautiful intricacies of lever and
tumbler electronic flow and magnetic
field

  and understood

  are you sure you can tackle it
latimer demanded

  of course im sure l   

  he tried to rise to his feet reached
for the nearest wheel fell heavily
and a growing glistening pool on
the floor where he had fallen was
mute testimony to the inadequacy of
laurannes rough bandaging he
looked up at them his wizened grey
little face contorted with pain

  i can do it he whispered i can
see the levers and tumblers but one
of you will have to turn the dials
then but i dont want to die i
dont want to die

lauranne reached out she
snatched one of the pistols from
her husbands belt she cocked it
making sure that this simple opera-
tion was performed as noisily as pos-
sible she pressed the cold muzzle
against fenwicks neck

  now will you do it

  yes yes that dial there the
top right hand one turn it to
d-o-o-m-s-d-a-y   
doomsday she struck fenwick
across the face with the barrel of the
weapon she struck him again he
started to scream but she struck him
yet a third time   

  stop it shouted latimer you
are smashing the poor devils face
i know it now fenwick this
tdoomsday of yours that word has
an ominous ring    could it be   
her voice was low almost caress-
ing    that the dial you want me
to turn is one of the controls of what-
ever safety device this door must
have she raised the pistol threaten-
ingly answer me

  yes    whimpered the little
crook yes dont touch the dials
just the wheels and dont   
dont

  she said if youre lying again
they wont find any head on you
worth cutting open

  that lower right hand wheel   
babbled fenwick almost delirious
take it turn it to oh three seven
then left-handed to three four six


out of this world adventures

right-handed to oh three five  
wait she turned away from the
wounded man left him dabbing in-
effectual hands at the blood stream-
ing from his battered face she ran
back along the tunnel to where alan
latimer was standing guns ready
poised to fight off alien interruption
she caught his arm pushed her face
close to his whispered havent you
forgotten something

 what

  the boat you fool arent you
supposed to be galloping off to warn
the system

  not now we cant leave fenwick
by himself to open the door we must
stay

  only one of us need stay  

  of course youll find the boat
fairly easy to handle and remember
free fall as much of the way as pos-
sible

   cant handle a boat given un-
limited fuel for experiments i might
make ganymede provided that the
air and food and water hung out you
must go

  but we cant leave fenwick

  i shant leave him 

  then latimer turned to face his
wife he said youre right of
course youre right but cant you see
that i cant go

  lauranne said bitterly if ailsa
rae were sitting in that space scow
waiting for you youd be off like a
shot go damn you do you think
that i want to die with you after
what has happened

 latimer turned white under his
tan his lips worked but he said
nothing then at last the bitter
words came take these he said
pulling two of the pistols from his
belt you might want to shoot me in
the back

  he turned abruptly strode down
the tunnel lauranne stood and
watched him go half raised her arms
let them fall hopelessly to her side
wycu fool she whispered you fool

of course i dont want to die with
you i want to live with you

  slowly listlessly she made her
way back to where fenwick an un-
tidy bundle of rags was sprawled
on the tunnel floor she looked down
at the dying man then at her wrist
watch thirty minutes at least she
muttered have to give him thirty
minutes to get to the boat fifteen to

  and down the tunnel drifted the
sound of gunfire fainter but still
continuing showing that some few
defenders yet were gaining for her
the time she needed

  and thats that said the admiral
he was pleased with himself had
good reason to be so the forces un-
der his command had made a land-
ing had taken prisoners without loss
to themselves had blasted a little
world into a thin faintly luminous
haze and when the admiral let his
mind stray to those same prisoners-
obscene spidery things that scuttled
about their cages on many-jointed
imsy legs-he felt no compunction
over the act of destruction that he
had performed

  wheres that fellow latham   
latimer he demanded of an aide
think ill have him up for a
drink   

  but latimer did not come instead
came a messenger who told of how
the ex-lieutenant had burst into the
prison compartment had opened re
with two pistols slaughtered the
helpless aliens the guards had tried
to stop him one had been killed out-
iight the other was not expected to
live

 and he was saying something
concluded the messenger  couldnt
make it out sir but it sounded like
poetry something about old loves
and dead years and disastrous things
it sounded like

  but that was just before he shot
himself
   the first issue of out of this
  world adventures aroused a
  great amount of mail as might be ex-
  pected of any first issue and was surely
  to be expected of as different a first
  issue as ours if we were to do justice
  to all the letters that came in we would
  have to turn over all the pages of this
  magazine to letters alone were sure
  no one wants us to do that and we are

flying saucers

dear editor

  i have been a reader of fantasy stories
for a great many years and after perusing
the first issue of your new magazine i am
writing my first fan letter to tell you that
i really enjoyed the stories

  although i have always had a preference
for stories of prehistoric civilizations etc
i have become more interested recently in
out of this world adventures such as
space and time the flying saucers of
the present day  have become such a
controversial subject that one has the feel-
ing that there must be something going on
of which the general public is in ignorance

  of all the stories in your magazine the
one by mack reynolds stands out in my
mind    one wonders if his story the
discord makers is altogether fiction

  i am glad fantasy magazines are getting
away from horror covers i believe such
type of covers have been a detriment to
the magazines in the past for certainly
more people are buying stf magazines than
ever before some covers were much too
nightmarish for the general public who
would not buy them many people still
think of the stories as trash but i have
found some very interesting theories in
many of them

  wishing your new publication the best
of luck i am yours truly

with rifles by he door they nodded
and their rifles swung aruund
psycho clevenger said
ballances hands fumbled around
his desk came up with a revolver he
pointed it at burkeson who didnt
seem to notice or care particularly

 burkeson ballance shouted
crisply snap out of it man thats
mutiny youre talking insubordina-
tion guards take him back to the
rocket to the doc give him a hypo
and-

  burkeson laughed fools fools
he laughed until he cried poor
proud fools

  clevenger waded through a pile
of pneumatic cushions piles of tape
recorders and tape and files he
yelled at burkeson

 what happened to you you go
outside then you come back in a few
minutes later with your top blown
whats eating you burkeson
burkeson staggered the muscles
of his face twitched he opened his
eyes slowly and there was something
leaden and dying in them

  were humans he said and we
cant help what we are maybe we
got off on the wrong track some-
where i dont know i dont blame
you clevenger for being power-mad
and never able to think about any-
thing except how you can destroy
half the world and kill off billions of
people   

  burkeson

  no youre just something that
happened like everything else i
dont blame you clevenger or you
ballance i dont blame anyone i just
feel sorry for everyone now ill say
goodbye now because any minute the
cubes are liable to start doing what
weve taught them to do to hate
and-kill

  whatre you talking about clev-

enger stepped back his eyes flick-
ered

  ballance said explain yourself
or youll go back to the ship under
guard and youll be put in solitary
until you get back to earth for a
trial

  burkeson shivered maybe its bet-
ter this way weve gotten this far
maybe wed go on and on and where-
ever wed go we would always be
superior top dog any race that
didnt look like us-theyd be like
ants in an ant-hill like you said clev-
enger wherever wed go wed take
hatred with us and suspicion and
contempt and the ability to conceive
and wage mass warfare total slaugh-
ter and who knows clevenger
maybe were the only race in the uni-
verse who can even think of such a
thing no other animal on earth ever
thought of it maybe what the cubes
are doing is all right i dont know
its too late now to care

  burkeson raised a hand and leaned
against the wall his face was drawn
tight and perspiration made a stream
down his throat the two guards
shifted uneasily their rifles trained
on his stomach the weapon in bal-
lances hand wasnt steady he looked
at burkeson

  all right ill tell you burkeson
whispered a curious coolness slid
along his spine

  were all going to die maybe if
we start right now we could get out
of the city the cubes dont under-
stand yet all of the meaning of what
they got out of me theyve learned
about hate and the idea of killing
for self protection theyve learned
the art of killing to keep from being
killed it may be a little while yet
before theyre able to convert their
faculties to techniques of killing bat
there might be a chance so maybe if

out of this world advfntures

we get out of the city fast we can
snake it-

  clevenger smiled thinly we dont
run from a bunch of cubes burkeson
youre crazy thats the size of it
that sensitive artistic mind of yours
has cracked wide open that music
has been too much for you go on
back-

  wait a minute ballance got up
he moved around the desk in quick
tense strides maybe burkeson doe
know something these men are un-
der my command and im responsible
for their safety i cant afford to
overlook a possibility of danger
after all clevenger were in alien
surroundings we shouldnt gamble
with these mens welfare

  its too late burkeson whispered
harshly the games over

  what

  one of the guards covering burke-
son screamed shrilly he was on his
knees screaming the other guard had
disappeared his rifle lay on the
floor the second guard sprawled out
flat screaming hysterically pounding
his closed hands against the smooth
glistening floor

  he fell apart all at once and
nothings left of him he fell apart
crumbled away in the air he fell-
ballance yelled into his wrist
radiolal phone attention i atten-
tion i the cubes are attacking us
shoot your way out of the city now
now every cube is your enemy fire
full neutron charge into every cube
encountered   

  ballance was still giving out orders
and running toward burkeson when
he crumbled away to drift like dust
on the air the coiled revolver thud-
ded and spun across the floor and
suddenly the revolver also disinte-
grated completely leaving no trace

clevenger was staring at the
remaining guards sprawled body
as it was shaken to pieces vibrated
-out of existence the two guards

rifles followed into the air ft deemed
as clevenger watched

  he moved in short jerky steps to-
ward burkeson and he slid the heavy
coiled weapon from its case and lev-
eled it his eyes were dark and hot
and saliva quivered on his lower lip

  his whisper was dry you told the
cubes didnt you you let them
know why were here you little
sniveling crawling quisling

  burkeson shook his head slowly
sadly no no they found out from
me but i dont know how a uni-
versality of musical language maybe
or maybe just a coincidence that the
cubes had an emotional evaluation set
to music that is somewhat similar to
ours anyway they found out just as
i found out things about them

  clevenger-they knew only beauty
and peace-until now maybe they did
know other things way back some-
where in their beginning but it was
almost gone as a racial memory until
now we revived it gave it stark
meaning weve changed the music
of their language clevenger cant
you hear the thematic change cant
you feel it

  clevengers eyes fled wildly around
the hall his skin was gray and his
eyes were hot and black there were
two lines thin ugly lines crawling
down his cheeks to his mouth he
wet his lips carefully and the coiled
revolver shook in his hand

  theyve learned from us burke-
son whispered a new theme and
they might have forgotten the mean-
ing of fear and hate and kill they
knew what we felt they know that
more and more rockets would come
af they let them come and that more
and more hate and contempt would
come with the rockets and finally
destruction so theyre stopping us
now

  clevenger yelled something

  theyre stopping us now in the
only way we can understand

 clevenger screamed were not

out of this world adventures

finished yet maybe theyll get us
but therell be more rockets all right
thousands and thousands looking
for revenge for what the cubes are
and what theyve done to us theyll
atom-bomb this city to dust all right
so the cubesll get me but im going
to have the satisfaction of getting
you burkeson my way you dirty
little quisling

  clevenger started to fire the coiled
revolver the revolver and his right
arm disappeared clevenger stared at
the emptiness his face was a terrible
sculpture in wet shiny putty

 burkeson gasped no i dont
think any more of our rockets will
ever land here now or even get within
bombing range of mars not now
the cubes have mastered ultrasonics
and supersonics they can do things
our science wont reach for a million
years they can even induce high
frequency focused waves far out in
space to disintegrate any approach-
ing rockets thats what im won-
dering about now clevenger

  what is their limit what is the
isnge of their ultrasonic power
perhaps burkeson thought clev-
enger was wondering about that too
when his body crumbled away and
-drifted across the room in a cloud of
dissipating dust

burkeson staggered into the
martian afternoon he walked
down the wide beautiful street alone
he knew he was the only one left
alive now molecules shattered into
invisible forms by tremendous accel-
eration by forces no human mind
could understand

  a human body changed almost im-
mediately by ultrasonic frequency so
high there was no accompanying
noise or vibration audible into par-
ticles so small they floated in air and
were of colloidal dimensions

 and he felt the growing momen-
tum of the change in the musical
voice of the city

  he walked stiffly dazed and numb
with shock and wifch the other feel-
ings too of resignation and a sense
of the incredible beauty around him
not quite drowned yet by hate

  he sat down in the shade cast by
the rocket and waited there was
nothing else to do nothing else he
particularly wanted to do he knew
that after a while the music would
alter its theme to such an extent that
there would be no longer any sym-
pathy with him then they would get
him too as they had the others

  their hate would rise and rise until
he and the ship would become its ob-
jects so burkeson sat and looked at
the distant martian city spires finger-
ing the moonlight of phobos and as
he sat and waited the symphony from
the city gradually fell into the som-
breness of flat and minor keys it
lost slowly and forever its radiance
and warm joyousness of b and the
gay brilliance and alertness of d and
the noble elegance and grace of bb

  flats and minors dominated com-
pletely and the brooding thundering
hate rolled through the dark sadness
and agitation and doleful anxiety
changed to brutal sinister funereal
and violent hate

  what is the range of their ultra-
sonic radiative power burkeson was
thinking he looked up he tried to
pick out which of the stars in the
sky was earth but he was no astron-
omer and maybe that wouldnt make
much difference either

  the cubes had learned the value
of aggression that complete sudden
devastating offense was the only de-
fense again he looked at the stars
at a probable earth if the cubes
could focus and funnel enough power
-that far if they could they would
not wait for any more rockets to cross
that space   

  he stood up and raised has hand
their theme was altered now he
whispered good-bye beautiful peo-
ple
the city of singing cubes



 a few hours before the cubes
might have understood this senti-
ment but not now burkesons last
sensory impression was of a small
lonely chord in the major key of e
trying to be radiant and warm and
joyous and dying in a rising roar of
thundering discordancies

have been a novel with the theme well
thought out

  discord was just that an old theme
i read it but i always knew what was

  well well congrats the first ish of

eral level of the stories was good

 where did you dig up that cummings
story it reads like some of his older and
better novelettes ive always liked cum-
mings since i read space flight of ter-
ror some years ago but lately it seems
to me that most of what stories ive run
across by him arent much good the
planet smashers was different thol the
old cummings best story in the ish fol-
lowed by in this order omega and the
wolf girl the puzzle of priipiirii
terror of the mist-maidens the ship-
wrecked bogey man forbidden fruit

for this being the first of a van vogt

dear sir

  i was pleasantly surprised to find your
mag on the stands as you say it is some-
thing new in mags ill be honest with you
ed i just dont like comics the stories
were all very good im glad to see cum-
mings is making a comeback hes been
one of my favorites since i read his man
on the meteor i think the best story was
the shipwrecked bogey man that kind
of stuff is always good reading

  since this mag compares with the old
cosmic why not bring out another one
like stirring the short fantasy stories
in that mag are still good reading almost
ten years after printing sincerely

back ten years

dear sir

  what is avon trying to do put science
fiction back ten years comic books dont
belong in a s-f publication i have not
yet read the stories in your first issue
but however good they may be they can
hardly offset the distaste induced by your
illustrated fantasy stories i still can-
not understand how anyone could publish
such junk at this stage of science fiction
development

  there are a few improvements that could
be made with respect to the cover and
inside illustrations these however would
be waste of effort until you get rid of the
comics yours truly

                      claffin avenue
                     bronx  n y

  putting science-fiction back ten years
would bring it back to  a period when
it was showing a very promising boom
similar to todays and nipped only by the
war actually it is only in a period of
strength and vigor that a science-fiction
magazine like ours could venture to ex-
periment in an effort to enlarge the circle
of its readers our illustrated story section
is such a venture and rather than putting
science fiction back we are inclined to
believe it will help to spread the borders
of the rapidly growing mass of science-

hes choking	

  oh great ghul you have at last pub-
lished a cientifantasy magazine that has
everything-everything that fen have been
objecting to for years my aching back
first a corny cover with garish gal and
asinine alien- then a name that is literally
out of this world story plots some of
them that went out with horseless car-
riages illustrators who must inhabit pad-
ded cells short articles that should have
stood in bed untrimmed edges and not
yet satisfied you graciously throw a real
genuine -karet komic book in for good
measure ugh pardon me while i quietly
choke wake up man

approves adult comics

dear mr wollbcim

  it is with pleasure that we are able to
welcome out of this world adventures
into the realm of an ever increasing num-
ber of science-fiction and fantasy maga-
zines with the plethora of allegedly ser-
ious and semi-serious publications along
the same lines as o  t w a it is
somewhat of a refreshing stimulant to
have your zine along with the others due
to the very novel introduction of adult
illustrated comics centered around the
stfantasy medium something which has
not yet been tried elsewhere   

  albeit you have at least resurrected
the comics from a point of infancy to
the medium that it virtuously belongs to
as far as adult entertainment goes

  your selection of authors and their
stories is indeed commendable for a first
issue although name authors like van
vogt cummings del rey and tenn isnt
necessarily the rule for fine stories how-
ever it is more for the editor to judge to
the best of his ability rather than for a
large legion of readers to later on condemn
the publication

  the best stories-and they really were
excellent-in your first issue were

 the planet-smashers by cummings
   letter from the stars by van vogt
terror of the mist-maidens by chandler
and omega and the wolf-girl by wm
tenn regarding the other stories in brief
retrospect i can only add that they were
comparably equal to what most other
stfantasy zine editors go searching for
with a lighted lantern in order to find

bogey man first

dear mr wollheim

  out of this worlds first issue seems a
very promising one the fiction is inter-
esting and the artwork well-done here
is how i rate the stories

-	the shipwrecked bogey man

  this was a fine bit of weird stf and the
mcwilliam pic for it was equally good
the mcwilliam artwork by the way was
one of the highlights of the issue

-	terror of the mist-maidens
  chandler in this story near his best can

always be depended upon for an interesting
and thought-provoking story i am glad
that no false note of romance was injected
into totm-m

-	letter from the stars

  a departure from van vogts usual style
and a welcome one i like almost all of
vs stuff but a change of pace is in order
once in a while

-	forbidden fruit

  this was a very fine short story quite
good even for neville

-	omega and the wolf-girl

  lester del reys stories have undergone
a marked change for the worse within the
past few years but this was only a bad
story when compared to del reys better
work

-	the planet smashers

  the less said about a cummings story
the better this as all his others vas un-
adulterated hack

-	the discord makers

  reynolds disappointed me in this rather
poor imitation of conquerers isle

  the cover was very poor in contrast to
the almost uniformly good inside pics i
definitely disapprove of the comic section
if i want to read a joke book which i
dont ill go out to the newsstand and buy
one comic book stf is usually unoriginal
and childish

  it appears that ive failed to rate tenns
the puzzle of priipiirii id rank that story
sixth between omega and the wolf-girl
and the cummings opus scientifantastic-

disappointed

dear daw

  i have just finished reading the first
edition of out of this world and i must
say im disappointed i expected much
more from the editor of the avon fantasy
reader you should know better

  the cover wasnt too bad but i think
there are better mediums than water color
dont you the format of the contents
page was good but its hard to find words
to describe the picture the last time i
saw anything like it was in the note book
of an aspiring artist aged  years improve-
ment here is definitely needed

  the interior pics werent too good either
martin is all right but mcwilliam should
stick to comic books how about finley
lawrence and some of the other really
good illustrators

  the stories were neither good nor bad
they were not comparable to the stories
you have chosen in the fantasy reader

  and now here is my biggest complaint
comics have no place in this type mag
why use up good story space for that
trash i do hope the first will be the last
a reputation for good stories will sell far
more copies than heykids they got fun-
nies in the middle

  hoping to find vol  no  greatly im-
proved and wishing you all the success in
and out of this world i remain yours

a fine initial issue

dear mr wollheim

i have just read the first issue of the new

s-f magazine out of this world adven-
tures and would like to congratulate you
on a very excellent start certainly avon
is not unknown in this field but i think
few s-f mags if any can point to such a
fine initial issue

  i also approve of your editorial policy
concerning the stressing of space flight
this seems consistent with the title of the
mag	i

  the story by ray cummings i especially
siked but the others were good with may-
be a reservation or two

  i do have a few suggestions  ac-
knowledge the illustrator  next time
get a cover more in line with the accepted
for a science-fiction magazine  keep
mcwilliam if for no other reason for the
illustration for omega and the wolf-
girl  i may be in the minority here
but i do not especially care for the color

stories seems a bit like a comic book and

good but i thing occasionally a longer

  this letter is intended for your sta-

in making letter columns a highly typed
story is interesting chiefly for the treat-
ment and a fair yarn is down-graded for
a reader who has seen several in the same
pattern unless the handling is very clever

  now for comments on the stories

  the planet smashers by ray cum-
mings was poorly titled i have read a few
other stories by cummings and found them
rather dry this story was an exception it
had a wonderful setting-all the magic of
the mardi gras and the splendor of the
philadelphia mummers parade and the
magnificence of the festival of qen in the
ancient and forgotten city of sbanadu was
in that story the setting was very very
nice

  the plot however was weak that end-
ing was pretty bad it is like reading a
detective story and then having the detec-
tive solve the murder with a clue that
wasnt revealed to the readers you feel
cheated

 comic section wonderful

dear sir

  thank you thank you very much for
the finest magazine of fantasy and science
fiction literature in a long time it is really
an unusual magazine with a radical format
and a venture that no other mag has ever
attempted your comic section is very
wonderful

  avon has done more for the fantasy fans
than any other publishing house they have
given us such pocket books as fox woman
out of the silent planet and now princess
of the atom the latter i have just finished
reading and it is superb i am also glad to
see that it is a first of a series i now have
the whole group of fans here watching for
the second one-the green girl

  the planet smashers was a top story
but it was not up to the princess of the
atom but it was still a fine story van
vogts story wac also very good only one
story in the issue was not very good that
was the terror of the mist-maidens it
was lousy but no magazine can always
have the very best of the best every issue
but i can see now that you are striving
for it good luck you will make it fan-
tastically yours
