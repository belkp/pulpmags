dead mans chance

by francis lynde

author of  the taming of red butte western  the fight for

the gv  p etc

       the world has little use for a dead man and by all accounts the man
    in this story had been dead for two years nevertheless he comes back
    but the difficulties of beginning all over again are almost unsurmountable
    luckily there conies to his assistance sprague-scientific sprague whom
    you have met in other stories by lynde he is the government chemist
    whose hobby is the detection of crime reasoning of the high-grade kind
    is the key he applies to the unlocking of mysteries

i complete novel

chapter i

the big gap

somewhere in an old book that
i read when i was a boy there
was a story of a man who died
and came to life again merely to
spite a lot of relatives who were sitting
around waiting to get a hack at the
bunch of money he had assembled
taking it up one side and down the
other i believe i have that man pushed
so far off the map that he could never
find his way back lets see if i can
prove it

  in the first place my name is or
was on the other side of the big gap
jimmie shurtleff i was brought up
-raised as we say in missouri-by
two uncles one who was always spoken
of in my hearing as a sort of broken-
down mining speculator in the colo-
ib

rado gold camps and the other-who
did the principal part of the raising
-a fairly prosperous missouri farmer

  if uncle silas gave me the warm
end of it making me work pretty hard
on the farm for what schooling i got
and giving his son my cousin monty
a good bit better show i had no kick
coming my father had left no prop-
erty and i guess i was a sort of poor
relation anyhow let that go i grew
up like other boys got what a small-
town school could give me and was
about to drift into farming for a life
job when uncle perkins the mining
speculator wrote a letter from some
place down in mexico and came across
with a check big enough to-give me four
years in an engineering school

  where uncle perkins got so much
money all at one time was a mystery
to everybody in the missouri farm


the cpcpulcr magazine

town but that doesnt matter uncle
silas grumbled a little about losing my
help just as i had grown big enough
to do a mans work in the field but
he gave me the money andlet me go
and a year or so later not to let the
family get lopsided in the matter of
education sent his son monty to-yale
i think it was

  thats enough of the family history
in due course of time i got my college
sheepskin found a job toting a transit
and making field notes on a railroad
survey in montana knocked about on
various and sundry engineering projects
all over the western country and
finally brought up just after i had
turned twenty-five as assistant engi-
neer on the g v  p while that road
was an independent line under the cav-
anaugh management my headquar-
ters were in green butte and that is
where i met mabel carothers

  if you had known mabel about that
time youd guess what happened and
do it with both eyes shut i thought
she was just about the prettiest thing
that ever came down the big road and
she was slate-blue eyes hair like a
golden aureole when she had it fluffed
out a mouth that a man couldnt dare
to look at for more than a half second
at a time and a figure that had all the
old greek maidens backed off into space

  by the end of the first month she was
letting me buy seats for two to all the
good shows that came to green butte
and by the middle of the summer we
were beginning to take sunday even-
ing walks past a neat little cottage in
the green butte stiburb where most
of the young married couples bought
or built then came the thing that dug
the big gap

  i have said that i was assistant en-
gineer on the g v  p milligan was
my chief and he was the man who
meaning to give me a lift put me in
charge of the construction on a new
track-shortening proposition in the ju-

niper hills away down at the lower
end of the line

  it was a good -job and a boost it
gave me a step up the salary was a
raise and since the mails ran regularly
i could chuckthe daily letter into the
postal car for mabel besides the
junipers are only a couple of hundred
miles from green butte and once in
a while i could and did give myself
a week-end to run up to town and
walk mabel out to the cottage in the
suburb

  just the same there was a small fly
in my pat of butter about a month
before i got the boost my cousin
monty gershom had turned up in the
butte uncle silas had spent a good
bit of money on him and was still
spending it i inferred since monty
opened up a real-estate office in town
furnished it regardless and bought him
a motor car

  naturally since he was my cousin
about the first girl he met in the new
town was mabel they went chummy
right from the jump just a thin little
shaving too chummy i used to think
sometimes-and after thinking it id
go off and kick myself for being a nar-
row-minded ass for by this time you
see mabel was wearing my ring and
that usually settles it-or ought to settle
it-with any girl worth worrying about

  it was one of the week-end trips that
blew my little candle out for the
sake of getting a full night in the
sleeper i was in the habit of leaving
the job in the jawbone narrows at six
oclock on the saturday evening and
riding down to copah on one of the
construction engines this gave me
about eighty miles more ride than i
needed to take but it also gave me the
sleeper at nine oclock where otherwise
i should have had to go to grass val-
ley and catch it after midnight

  on the evening in question one of
my construction engines with mickey
donovan at the throttle shot me down
dead mans chance

to copah-our junction with the pa-
cific southwestern-and i had a bath
a shave and got my supper in the sta-
tion dining room at eight-fifty the
p s-w flyer camein from the east
bringing the green butte sleeper and
i shall remember the name of that car
the katinka as long as i live

  our g v  p northbound was
ready to pull out as soon as the through
sleeper should be coupled on and i
went down the platform to be ready
to climb on and go to bed while i
was waiting for the car to be shoved
up i heard mccormack the p s-w
yardmaster tellihg a couple of his men
that there was an excursion train fol-
lowing the flyer and that it was to
go north on the g v as second section
of our train a little later as we were
pulling out across the pannikin bridge
i saw the headlight of this special com-
ing down the canon and heard the engi-
neer whistle for the copah stop

  having had my supper and a smoke
i didnt sit up very long my berth
was a middle lower and the car was
only about half filled the passengers
were all men at least i didnt see any
women or children while i was sit-
ting half in and half out of my berth
to undress the fellow who had the op-
posite lower was also getting ready to
turn in i remarked him particularly
because he was doing the same stunt
that i was doing-stowing his clothes
as -he took them off in the unoccupied
upper berth

  i didnt notice much else about this
opposite of mine except that when we
stood up together in the aisle i saw that
he was about my height and build ahd
that the clothes he was tucking away in
the upper berth were a sort of rusty
brown-a color i have always detested
since my boyhood days when uncle
silas used to make me wear brown
jeans on the farm

  these were merely passing impres-
sions and i am jotting them down to

show that up to the turning-in time my
brain was working all right and things
were recording themselves with perfect
clearness from noting the brown-
clothes man to crawling under the blan-
kets and turning off the berth light
didnt kill more than a couple of min-
utes i should say and i fell asleep
about as soon as my head hit the pillow

  the next thing i remember is a hor-
rible dream in it i was at work on
the track-shortening job and i saw
everything just as it was the big gang
of shovelers was working in the cutting
and duxbury the foreman was mak-
ing ready to fire a heavy blast which
was to take out a good half of one of
the obstructing hills it was all per-
fectly natural all but one thing the
holes were all ready to be fired i saw
bixby the electrician connecting the
firing wires-which is never done until
the last moment but as yet nobody
seemed to have warned the gang work-
ing in the cutting

  while i seemed to be looking on the
frightful thing climaxed i thought i
saw bixby taking hold of the handles
of his electric firing machine to send the
spark into the dynamite i tried to
open my mouth and yell to the men in
danger strove in a mad frenzy and
found that i couldnt make a sound
then the great blast went off with a
noise like a world cracking in two and
i awoke dizzy half nauseated and
bathed in a cold sweat to find our
sleeper off the track and bouncing and
lurching to a wreck stop on the cross-
ties

  of course there was a crazy panic
by the time the pullman had success-
fully smashed its running gear and had
come to a stand it was leaning far over
to one side and seemed to be toppling
for a fall into the ditch with every-
thing torn up underneath the car there
were no lights and the dozen or more
men of us were crawling out into the
tilted aisle and groping frantically for


the popular magazine

our clothes i remembered that i had
put mine in the upper berth and in
the scramble i thought i was finding
them the man in the opposite lower
was also out and groping and he was
scared silly we bumped into each
other in the darkness and i could hear
his teeth clicking together as he chat-
tered oh god oh god like a
man in the last stages of a bad case
of the rattles i tried to ask him if
he were hurt was asking him in fact
when the end came along

  i didnt realize at the time what it
was though having heard the copah
yard talk about the second section that
was to follow us i might have guessed
a bright light coming from the rear
suddenly enveloped the wrecked car
shining in for a fraction of a second
at the broken windows and through the
deck transoms then there was an ear-
splitting crash-and that was all

chapter ii

from the far side

  we often hear how a man with death
snatching at him gets a sort of moving-
picture series in one short reel of
everything he has ever been or done
-particularly the bad things i
wouldnt go so far as to say that other
people who have been up against the
big jump in the dark and have come
back to tell about it are mere frilly
liars perhaps theyre not but when
the light glare and the crash came i
dropped out as quietly as a blind kitten
does when you hold its head in a bucket
of water i was killed so neatly that i
never knew-dont knowto this good
day-what hit me

   i say killed because that is the only
word that will come anywhere near fit-
ting jimmie shurtleff died right then
and there in that smashed pullman and
if i am to believe what other folks tell
me he stayed dead the man who woke
up about a million years farther along

in a log-built bunk shack with his head
bandaged and his arm in a clay plaster
cast was an entirely different human
proposition owning no part of jimmie
shurtleff save a bunch of jimmies rec-
ollections-absolutely nothing else

  realization didnt come all at once to
this new man there was a dull head-
ache to muddle things the shack in-
terior was fairly well defined but it was
as much as a minute before i made out
that the thing hanging over me was the
face of a man a kindly old face lined
and seamed and sunburned to a rich
mahogany and masked to the eyes by a
thick gray beard out of the beard
thicket came a gruff voice and it said
hello bobby air you workin round
to the good old daylight agin 

  i blinked and gasped and tried to get
the fuzzy blanket edge or whatever it
was away from my mouth so that i
could say i guess so you see ive
got to go on using the i and me
simply because the language makes no
provision for the big gaps then i
asked a question of my own were
the others all killed

  which-all others dyou mean
the other passengers in the pull-
man of course i returned weakly ir-
ritated at having to explain what ought
to have been the most obvious thing

  the man who had called me bobby
shook his head

  youre chasin lightnin bugs agin
he said with a sort of gentle sadness
in the gruff voice there wamt no
passengers an no pullman

  but i say there were i insisted
there was an accident and the pull-
man had jumped the track then the
following section came along and
smashed into us this deduction
which as i have said didnt occur to
jimmie shurtleff came to me now as
clear as day

  the old mans head wagged slowly
again and he puf out a big-knuckled
hand to straighten the blanket covering
dbad mans chance



  thatll be all right bobby son he
rejoined a good deal as a mother might
try to soothe a restless child youll
just have to keep quiet a spell longer
i reckon an then the crooks an tan-
glesll get lost in the shuffle you was
hurt bad mighty bad when that shot
went off we-all allowed you was sure
goin to pass out-and with the neardest
doctor plumb forty mile away acrost the
top o two ranges cassie an me we
made out to sot the broken arm best
we could but we couldnt do much fr
the busted head

  it was just here that i made an in-
credible discovery-which had been be-
lated i suppose because my wits were
still struggling for a foothold among the
amazing newnesses following the
fashion of the day i-the jimmie
shurtleff i-had always gone smooth
shaven the discovery was that the
woolly blanket edge i had been plucking
at with my free hand and which kept
getting into my mouth and tickling my
nose was my own beard and mustaches
-a good thick thatching of both

  the shock of finding all that hair on
my face was the same as a man might
have if he were coming downstairs all
nice and easy and suddenly the stairs
should be jerked away to leave him
falling into space i looked my patri-
archal nurse squarely in the eye

  tell me i said how long does it
take a man to raise a beard like mine 

  his gentle smile told me that he still
thought i was safely out of my head
but he answered my question

  i allow it might take a good while
i dunno how long it took you youve
always had a beard sence youve been
with us

  he was telling the simple truth and
i knew it he was not in the least the
kind of man who could be suspected of
inventing things as he went along but
that didnt help out any i recalled the
evening spent in copah-last night it
still seemed to me-and the bath and

the clean shave bought and paid for be-
fore i went to supper in the station din-
ing room

  how long have i been here i
asked

 he misunderstood me on your
back in the bunk you mean itll be
three weeks come friday sence you
got yourself blowed up in the mine
blown up in what mine
ourn-the chance 

  i set my teeth hard and said i dont
believe you are crazy and im trying
mighty soberly to believe that i am not
how did i come to get hurt in a mine
same as every other miner gets it
sooner r later if he keeps on a-monkey-
in with the dannymite you loaded a
hole an cut the fuse too short least-
wise thats the way we put it up-cas-
sie an me it was just afore supper
time an you was in the drift alone
whatever happened the shot ketched
you afore you could get out o the
headin	

  again i took a look at the shrewd
eyes of the old miner they were as
unquestionably sane as they were truth-
ful

  you say i was working in your
mine how long ago was it that i took
the job

  once more i got the head wagging
of compassion -

  its risin two year sence you blew
in here an asked fr a job he said
dont you ricollect it

  it occurred to me suddenly that if i
didnt want to be set down for a hope-
less maniac i must be crafty-exceed-
ingly crafty

  naturally i am a good bit muddled
-with this broken head i replied
just go over it slowly and ill see if
i cant pull myself together you say
i came here and asked for a job i
dont seem to get that quite clear in
my mind where is the chance

  the chance is in the western juni-
pers about forty mile from nowhere
to

the popular magazine

its all straight about your bio win in
here and askin fr a job but you never
would tell us-cassie nr me--where
you come from nr how you got here
your head was bad hurt at the time-
plumb in the same spot where the rock
hit you two weeks ago last friday-
an we thought mebbe that was how
come it you couldnt ricollect

  one more time i set my teeth and
tried to get a grip on the bewildering
muddle

  youve called me bobby twice in
these last few minutes is that the name
i gave you

  no but youve always answered to
it you took crazy sick the day after
you got here an we thought cassie an
me that you was sure goin to pass out
we hunted in your pockets an found
an empty onvelope with your name on it
in typewritin--robert jones denver
first chance we got we put a notice in
the denver papers but nobody never
answered it

  i see i said though i was as far
as ever from understanding or even
beginning to understand and after
i got well you gave me work

  the old mans head wagging this time
was in deepest pity

   it sure does hurt like sam hill to
have you lay there an ask me sich
things-it do fr a fact he protested
yes we was glad enough to have you
stay an make one of us i told you
straight out there was no money in it
iessn we should happen to strike it big
rich in the mine-not even day pay but
you said that didnt make no differ
and i never told you anything about
being in a railroad wreck

  nary single word

  i had it all now or enough of it to
last me for a good while in the way of
having something to chew on and think
about if my old man was telling the
truth-and i couldnt doubt this for a
moment-jimmie shurtleff had been
dead for two years and goodness only

knows how much more dead and
buried and probably forgotten and in
his place there was a broken-headed
broken-armed mine laborer calling him-
self-or letting himself be called-rob-
ert jones a man who owned nothing
belonging to jimmie shurtleff save a
badly mixed tangle of acute memories

  since you know my name i suppose
i ought to know yours i broke in
after a longish pause i hope youll
forgive me if i confess that i cant just
now call it to mind

  dont you worry none thats the
busted head agin you been callin me
dad fr about two year-dad crockett
want a drink o water

  i drank deeply from the tin cup he
held to my lips wishing with all my
heart that the water were the magic
kind that would enable me once more
comfortably to forget and lose the
whirling muddle of things which were
doing the imp dance in my brain if
jimmie shurtleff had weakly passed
out as the old man put it handing
his bunch of memories on to some one
of the myriad joneses he deserved to be
forgotten nevertheless there was a
sharp sting in the tail of that too jim-
mie shurtleff had left some pretty im-
portant things hanging up in the air
when he dropped out and at the mo-
ment i was too weak and sick to take
them up and try to straighten them

  reckon you could sleep a while if
you had a chance crockett asked
after i had fallen back and closed my
eyes and when i said id try he went
away and left me to grapple with the
new set of nightmares and to fling them
into the pit of sleep if i could

  for some little time the effort was
fruitless my head ached like the mis-
chief and the broken arm felt as if it
were dead and gone to join the van-
ished jimmie shurtleff identity be-
sides the strange environment asked
to be noticed there was a small win-
dow at the head of the bunk and i
dbad mans chance



could look out upon what appeared to
be a deep valley with high mountains
everywhere and a brawling stream
making a noise down below and out of
sight from the window

  the window outlook gave the im-
pression of considerable height as if
the cabin were situated upon the flank
of one of the mountains and when i
raised my head the impression was con-
firmed by the sight of the crest of a big
dump beginning almost at the cabin
door-the spoil from the mine

  with my own bewildering mix-up op-
pressing me i didnt dwell very long
upon the surroundings how had i
contrived to escape from the wrecked
pullman leaving no trace for milligan
or any of the railroad people to follow
up and escaping alive how had i
managed to wander off into the moun-
tains wounded and out of my head ex-
isting in some way for weeks as it
seemed-since my beard had grown in
that interval-and finally bringing up
here in this place forty miles from no-
where 

  i was still wrestling with the hopeless
tangle when i fell asleep the time
judging from the angle of the sunlight
streaming in through the square win-
dow must have been about noon

  when i awoke the sun had gone be-
hind the mountains all out-of-doors was
bathed in a purple light that was heav-
enly and to make the celestial simile
fit all the way around an angel stood
beside my bunk bed it was a woman
angel she had a clean-scoured biscuit
board for a tray and on it there was
something warm and steaming in a
cup

chapter iii

cassie crockett

  the woman angel smiled at me and
dragged up a three-legged stool to make
a table of it for the biscuit-board tray
having the jimmie shurtleff memories

 fresh and clear cut-counting them and
 being obliged to count them as mem-
 ories of  longer ago than the yester-
 day-mabel carothers was still the
 standard by which all other women were
 to be measured on the score of looks

   this young woman who was calmly
 getting ready to give me my supper was
 a striking contrast in every way to
 judson carothers daughter i have
 said that mabel was pretty and im not
 going to take it back she was more
 than that-she was beautiful but this
 slender brown-eyed girl sitting on the
 edge of the bunk and waiting to feed
 me was altogether a different propo-
 sition

   for one thing she wasnt pretty in
 the conventional sense not at all her
 mouth was bigger than mabels and it
 had stronger lines which were helped
 out by a well-rounded resolute chin
 her eyes were brown as i have said
 and they were too honest and frank to
 have in them the alluring little tricks
 which had always enabled mabel to
 v wind men around her fingers also this
 girls hair was dark to go with the
 brown eyes and the outdoor tinting of
 her skin and she had the thick masses
 of it done up in a way that would have
 given mabel who ran to fluffs and
 marcel waves the shivers for its very
 simplicity

   when she spoke her voice made the
 contrast still stronger mabel cooed
 when she wanted to get the best of a
 man but at other times her voice was
 rather high-pitched and a little just the
 least little bit inclined to be sharp if
 she were crossed but this girl of the
 mountains talked in music

   dad tells me that youve come back
 to us bobby dear or partly at least
 she said-or sang whichever you like-
 as she began the feeding process we
 weremiserably afraid youd never pull
 through it has been very dreadful
 with nobody within reach to help or tell
 us what to do for you


the vovulatr magazine

  you are cassie i take it i mum-
bled between spoonfuls then ive
apparently known you and been in-
debted to you for two whole years-at
least so your father tells me-and yet
i am just meeting you for the first rec-
ognizable time did you ever hear ot
anything more absurdly ridiculous than
that

  daddy tried to explain but i dont
understand she said with something
of my own former bewilderment cant
you remember anything that has hap-
pened during the two years

  not the first living thing i denied
it is gone as completely as if it never
was

  at the moment i couldnt begin to ac-
count for the warm red that surged up
under the pure flesh tints of her neck
and cheek for this or for the two tears
trembling in thebrown eyes though the
bobby dear ought to have told me
but an instant later i found an answer
that nearly made my heart stop beating
evidently only too evidently this man
jones had been a scoundrel of the sort
that makes love to the nearest woman
tell me what you do remember she
encouraged winking the two tears back
into the places they had come from

  i began resolutely telling her the story
of jimmie shurtleffs last night on
earth and she went on feeding me
quietly while i was doing it most of
the time her hand-it was a mighty
pretty hand-was steady- enough but
now and then i thought i could see it
trembling a little

  you can see that i am sane cant
you i pleaded i am really there
was a man named jimmie shurtleff and
i am that man-or what is left of him
how i came to drop two years out of
my life to go around masquerading as
robert jones i dont know possibly
i never shall know

  the light wasnt quite as good as it
had been but i had a notion that i saw
the two tears again trying to get out

  of course you are sane she
agreed looking a little away from me
as she spoke then what you have
just told me explains many things-
things that never had any explanation
before

  like what  i prompted

  you didnt seem certain about your
name after you began to get well two
years ago daddy showed you the en-
velope we had found iji your pocket and
asked you if the nam on it was yours
you looked puzzled and said you
guessed it was

  it was just here that i got a glimpse
of the jones origin

  what sort of a coat was i wearing
when i came here

  a brown one that is it hanging up
over there in the corner

  i twisted my head and looked there
was still light enough to show the color
of the coat instantly i recalled the
man who had occupied the berth oppo-
site mine in the wrecked pullman the
man with the brown suit and my new
name was accounted for in the con-
fusion following the derailment we had
got our respective locations mixed the
other man had dug into my upper berth
and i had got his clothes instead of my
own the darkness and the frantic
hurry had made the exchange the most
natural thing in the world

  i think i know who the real robert
jones is or was i said and i was
about to explain when a perfectly stu-
pefying thought came to choke me
what if the mangled and possibly
wholly unrecognizable body of jones
had been found in my clothes and had
been buried for me if it had there
was no need to ask why milligan and
my other railroad friends had appar-
ently made no effort to trace the crazy
wanderings which had led me to dead
mans chance

  you were saying that you thought
you knew the real robert jones she
dead mans chance



prompted after my choking pause had
strung itself out to a dead silence

  -	its only a guess but im mightily
afraid its the right one i faltered
then i told her of the irian in the op-
posite berth and of the probable ex-
change of clothing you see it is quite
possible and probable i ended if
there was enough left of him to gather
up he was doubtless buried as jimmie
shurtleff lets talk about something
else what have i been doing here since
you and your father nursed me alive
two years ago 

  you have been living with us and
working in the mine

 as a crazy man how did the
others take it-the other miners
there were no others she returned
with a sad little smile for my utter lapse
of memory dead mans chance is
only a prospect you know david
shelby discovered it and worked it for
a time and then daddy came and
worked it alone until we found you
dead mans chance i mused
what a miraculously fitting name for
the mine a dead man should wander
into how did your father ever come
to pick a name like that 

  he didnt it was named before we
came here a good many years ago
two men who had grown up as boys
together back in the states drifted out
here to turn prospectors one of them
was daddy and the other was david
shelby they prospected together for
a long time and made money and lost
it then they separated and for years
uncle david as we called him was
never heard from dont let me tire
you with all this family history

  you couldnt tire me if you should
try go on 

  when uncle david finally turnedup
and found us again he was sick and
dying he had discovered this gold
vein and had been working here alone
for a year and a half knowing all the
time that he wasnt going to live that

is why he named it dead mans chance
when he couldnt work any longer he
came out to die-and to tell daddy to
come here and take the mine for his
own

  is it a paying mine  i asked but i
neednt have asked if i had remembered
that she had said it was only a prospect

  she shook her head in some places
it is quite rich but we are so far from
a railroad or a smelter that we cant
market the ore in any quantity

  but how do you-how do we live
i asked

  again i got the pitying smile

  when we need things to eat we load
the two burros with a few sacks of the
best picked ore and pack it out across
the two mountain ranges to swansea
on the pacific southwestern it gives
me the queerest feeling to be telling you
these things when youve known them
all so intimately for two years

  you forget it was jones who knew
them and most unhappily im afraid
jones has lost out for good and all
she looked away from me why do
you say unhappily i should think
youd be over-overjoyed to have found
yourself your real self again

  im not so sure about that i re-
turned doubtfully the world has lit-
tle use for a dead man and by all ac-
counts ive been dead for a long time
havent you often heard people say that
theyd give anything if they could switch
off short and start in all over again
ive got that chance now and all things
considered i dont know but it will be
wise to take it--as robert jones
there was a look in the brown eyes
that i couldnt begin to fathom when
she turned them upon me and said
was this jimmie shurtleff youve been
telling me about such a bad man that
you dont want to take up his responsi-
bilities again

  oh not exactly what youd call bad
i hastened to say but im afraid he


the popular magazine

left things in a horrible muddle in
fact i may say i know he did

  you neednt tell me if you dont
want to she offered and her way of
saying it would have told me if i hadnt
already suspected it that robert jones
had been getting pretty close to her
this was a thing that would have to be
flailed out sooner or later and i was
never much of a hand to stand shiver-
ing on the bank when there is a cold
plunge thats got to be taken

  i am going to tell you i averred
but not until after youve answered a
question or two of mine this jones
person-how has he been behaving him-
self toward you and your father
robert jones has been a good son
to my father and--and a good brother
to me

  half of that statement ill believe
and the other half i cant believe-the
brother half

  why cant you

  because its against nature robert
jones wasnt your brother then i
took the plunge in all the history of
mankind there have perhaps never been
two people situated just as we are and
weve simply got to be frank with each
other i lifted her left hand on
the third finger there was a curious ring
which looked as if it might have been
hammered out of a piece of virgin gold
who gave you this ring cassie

  this time the two tears would not be
restrained

  you did she admitted in a tone
scarcely above a whisper in one of
the rich pockets in the mine there was
a lump of pure wire gold you made
the ring out of it and gave it to me
one-one evening when we were sitting
out on the jumbo waiting for the moon
fo come up behind the saddleback oh
dear it breaks my heart to think that
you dont remember it-to know that
you will never remember it again

  the truth was out at last and if i
didnt feel like a bigamist it was no

fault of the circumstances what could
i do what could any man do
clearly something had to be done ow-
ing more than any one man can pay to
two women i could at least try to
square things with one of them

   listen cassie i said and then i
told her the exact truth-about mabel 
how at the time of the railroad accident
we had been engaged and were waiting
only until i should get another step up
in my profession now you know it
all i said when the brief story had
been told for two years i have been a
dead man dead and gone to all who
used to know jimmie shurtleff dead
too to myself so far as the jimmie
shurtleff past was concerned

   yes she acquiesced but nothing
is really changed you are yourself
again now and you must take up your
responsibilities when you are well and
strong you must go back to green
butte and to-to this other girl

  wait a minute i interposed it
cant be settled offhand in that way it
is only fair to consider the other girl
and what may have happened to her
during fhe two years death cancels
all obligations and you couldnt expect
a girl to go into permanent mourning
for a man who so far forgot himself as
to die before the wedding day you re-
member the cousin of whom i spoke a
little while ago he would have made
love to mabel if we hadnt been actually
engaged i am sure of it if mabel
and monty are not married long before
this-

  she stood up and leaned over to
 straighten the bedcovers

  the two years must be as if they
had never been-for both of us she
said softly and then you loved this
other girl didnt you 

   it seemed passing curious at the mo-
ment that i couldnt answer the straight-
forward question simply and directly
if there had been no railroad smash-up
and no big gap it would have answered
dead mans chance

ii

itself i should have married mabel
and if the love hadnt been the one only
consuming passion that clors a mans
entire life i should never have known
the difference but now there was a
difference wholly undefinable but ex-
ceedingly real

  i guess i did at least i thought i
did i replied as she finished tucking
me in but now i cant help seeing
and feeling the huge chasm that the two
years have dug i dont want to go
back to green butte and find my little
house of cards knocked into smithereens
and dumped into the chasm you
mustnt make me do that cassie

  wait she counseled quietly you
are not strong enough yet to think
straight or to talk about it when you
are well again you will see what is
right and fair and you will do it i
must go now and get daddys supper
try to sleep some more if you can and
dont make yourself -worse by trying
to think daddy will be in again by
and by to see if you are needing any-
thing

  and with that she was gone
           chapter iv

out of the frying pan

  from the awakening to a full realiza
tion of things on that sunlit day in june
in the small log-built bunk room at dead
mans chance my recovery was rapid
in the course of time dad crockett re-
moved the clay plaster cast and the
broken arm was found to be well set
promising to be as good as ever the
skull wound which had apparently been
made by a flying fragment of rock and
which had cut squarely across the scar
of the older hurt healed more slowly
but i was up and around long before
i had the bandage off

  naturally as soon as i could get out
i became a curious prowler poking
around and trying to familiarize myself
with surroundings which though i had

lived in them for two years i was now
seeing for the first time with the jimmie
shurtleff eyes

  as i had gathered from my bunk-
room outlook the mine was situated on
a high bench of the mountain with a
steep trail leading down to the noisy
torrent in the little valley the house
to which the bunk room was a newer ad-
dition-built by my own hands they
told me-stood on the bench ahort dis-
tance to the west of the mine opening

  the mine itself was a wonder in the
way of hard-work accomplishment
david shelby had worked in it a year
and a half crockett had dug in it a
year before my advent and together he
and i-the robert jones i-had more
than doubled the development my en-
gineering education-and the succeed-
ing years of mining-country experience
-had given me some knowledge of min-
eralogy ahd dead mans chance looked
pretty good to me the ore ran un-
evenly as to values but there was a
world of it in quantity

  as i have said i prowled around like
a cat in a strange garret and got my
bearings during those weeks of conva-
lescence crockett and his daughter
were mighty good and kind to me and
after that first evening there was no
reference made to anything that could
stir the mud for me in the bog into
which i had tumbled if dad crockett
suspected from his daughters actions
or mine that the revived jimmie shurt-
leff wasnt living up to the robert jones
grade mark he was like most american
fathers he never said a word to me
about it and cassie-

  the girl puzzled me until my head
swam enough had been said in that
first talk to make it perfectly plain that
robert jones had been an accepted
lover but now she was evidently re-
garding it as a case of false pretenses
-innocent enough in the circumstances
but none the less false she was good
and kind to me but i could never get
		the tpotpulatr magazine

her alone long enough at a time to make
her talk again of the dropped subject

  on a certain moonlight night after i
had grown well enough to either go to
work or go away i sat with dad crock-
ett on a flat bowlder which marked the
boundary of the dead mans chance
claim it was the rock which had been
named the jumbo cassie was wash-
ing the supper dishes and the old man
and i had gone out to smoke our corn-
cob pipes in the open

  for a while neither of us spoke
crockett was at all times the least talka-
tive of men and as for me there was
a whole heartful of disturbing things
to be set in order before i could say
what i had been putting off from day
to day but the thing had to be said
and i finally broke the long silence

  i guess weve come to another turn
in the road dad was the way i began
ive been trying to make up my mind
what to do and it isnt easy

  he knew what i meant and his voice
was even gentler than usual when he
said i allow youre goin to do just
about what you think is right to do
buddy he had quit calling me bobby
after that first day and finding it rather
impossible to twist his tongue to the new
jimmie had compromised on th
southern mans house name for a son
itll come some like pullin teeth to
have you go away he went on but
i reckon thats about what youll want
to be doin

  im trying to decide i said jim-
mie shurtleff is dead and buried as
you know and it may be the greatest
possible kindness to all concerned to let
him stay dead on the other hand its
the keenest sort of a temptation for me
to stay right here and help you work
the chance out to a paying proposition
-as robert jones i suppose i could
go back and crowd myself into the
world again but i am not at all sure
that it is worth while

  oh i reckon youll find it worth

while he deprecated youve got
folks of your own to be thought about
and it dont seem just right to let em
go on a-mournin for you

  my nearest living relatives are two
uncles one of whom i havent seen since
i was a boy i replied whatever
mourning theyve thought proper to in-
dulge in has been done and forgotten
long ago

  i said this with a definite purpose
wanting to find out if cassie had told
him anything about mabel she evi-
dently hadnt and her loyal reticence
set the blood dancing in my veins
after a bit more of the corncob-fla-
vored silence crockett spoke again

  in the nature o things youll want
to be goin back i aint so old that i
caynt onderstand that buddy were
buried up here good an plenty cassie
an me an workin in a mine that caynt
be made to pay is a niighty little tin-
basin trot-around fr a young feller that
knows how to do somethin bigger an
better were goin to miss you a whole
heap but i reckon youd ort to go

  its funny but the more he talked that
way the less i wanted to go i hope i
wasnt too disloyal to mabel at that
stage of the game but i couldnt get it
out of my head thati was going to find
her comfortably married to monty ger-
shom and i had imagination enough to
see what a fierce mix-up i should pre-
cipitate by suddenly coming to life in
green butte yet the prompting to go
and see how it would feel to drop in
upon people who had been left for two
years on the other side of the big gap
was strong

  if i do go i shall have to borrow a
little money of you dad i said i
dont suppose there was anything of
value in the pockets of the brown coat
i was wearing when i came here
nothin but that one onvelope he
returned and then hemade the way
easy for me neednt to make no talk
o borrainv buddy we aint skinners
dead mjins chance

i

cassie an me to let you work here two
year for your grub an clothes an then
turn you away hongry well load the
burros with some o the picked stuff an
you can drive em over to swansea an
sell the ore at the smelter thatll give
you a stake

  i suppose there is a plain enough
trail so that i can find the way

  he looked at me curiously

  sounds sort o funny to hear you
talk that-a-way when youve made the
trip over an back three times in the
two year you been here

  that wasnt me i reminded him
it was jones

  thats so buddy i keep a-forget-
tin an i caynt seem to hep it bout
findin the way cassiell give you a
map at she made-r fr that matter
the burrosll keep to the trail you can
leave em at swansea an ill get em
when i go out fr another grubstake
im not gone yet i put in but
if i should go it will be partly on your
account and cassies youve got a lit-
tle bonanza here in the chance dad
if there were only some way to get the
ore to market

  reckon so 

  im sure of it your smelter re-
ports on the samples youve taken out
show it if i leave you it will be pretty
largely to see if i cant figure out some
scheme to help you get on your feet

i owe you that much-and a great deal
more

  crockett rapped the ash from his -
pipe

  haint told cassie nothin about
your goin away have you he in-
quired half as if he were afraid he was
intruding where he had no right to in-
trude

  not yet i wanted to talk to you
about it first

  he made no comment upon this and
the subject seemed to have exhausted it-
self crockett refilled his pipe smoked
it out and then went over to the little

blacksmithing shed to make a fire and
sharpen some drills a little later cas-
sie came out f the cabin and after a
word or two with her father at the
forge crossed to the flat bowlder and
sat down beside me

  dad says youve been talking to him
about your future she began without
any preface have you decided what
you are going to do

  no i replied

  there is but one way to decide she
said looking down you must go back
to those who are thinking they have lost
you

  i am not entirely convinced of that
it is the only thing to do she in-
terposed quickly you owe it to them 
or at least to one of them

  do i

  indeed you do its a duty and
duty always comes first and you will
find the inclination going hand in hand
with the duty after you have taken the
first step

  again i cant be sure cassie i ob-
jected duty is sometimes a many-
headed beast i told your father a few
minutes ago that my chief object in
going back to civilization would be to
devise some scheme for the marketing
of the chance ore  i am putting the
sentimental part of it wholly aside i
have no more idea than the man in the
moon that i shall find mabel waiting for
me to come back to life and marry her
its absurd

  nevertheless you owe it to her to
go and find out not all of the widows
have been married first and widowed
afterward

  you dont know mabel i protested
she isnt at all that kind

  how do you know she flashed
back you said you loved her

  i cant explain just how i know in
some ways-in nearly all ways-the two
years here are a blank to me but
somehow they seem to have given me a
sort of perspective that i didnt have


the pocpullr magazine

when i was jimmie shurtleff it is as
if i had grown two years older in a sin-
gle night im wiser now than i was
yesterday-the yesterday that lies on the
other side of the big gap

  no she returned definitely you
are not wiser buddy-she had adopted
her fathers name for me-you are
more generous so generous that you
are in danger of forgetting to be just
i shall never forgive myself for letting
you see how matters stood between
bobby jones and me if i hadnt been

so silly so wickedly foolish-

  let us be frank with each other lit-
tle girl i said it may be for the
last time i dont blame jones and you
mustnt blame yourself he couldnt
help loving you any more than he could
help breathing i have listened pa-
tiently to your talk about the duty part
of it but it doesnt go im safely dead
to mahel carothers and im alive only
to you cassie say one little word
and ill never go near green butte again
as long as the world stands

  i like you least when you talk that
way she said calmly if i wasnt
sure beyond all doubt that it is only
an excess of loyal generosity-the gen-
erosity that is telling you it is a shame
to let a foolish girls love be wasted and
thrown away-i could almost find it in
my heart to hate you-the jimmie
shurtleff you i mean

  the robert jones me was a better
man you think 

  much better in some respects he
was sincere and innocent and simple-
hearted

  and you think jimmie shurtleff
isnt ill show you

  there is only one way to show me
and that is by going back and doing all
the things you ought to do

  you mean that if i shall find mabel
a widow as you put it i shall marry
her

  of course you promised to didnt
you

 i knew she wasnt half as cold-
blooded as she was trying to make me
believe she was and just at that in-
stant i found myself attempting to
imagine mabel in the same boat send-
ing the man she loved away to marry
another woman merely because it was
right somehow the thing wasnt imag-
inable

  i did promise her yes but we can
let that go if i find her married to
monty gershom as i make no manner
of doubt she is what then cassie

  i suppose you will have to make the
best of it

  so i shall i shall come straight
back to dead mans chance

  no you mustnt do that she coun-
tered quickly

  but i say i shall you have prom-
ised to marry me you know

  no i didnt my promise and my
love were given to another man oh
quite another man

  for all her apparent coldness she
wasnt fooling me for a single minute
i saw what it was costing her to say
such things saw that she wasnt going
to be outdone in what she was mistak-
enly calling generosity by any such
newfangled rip van winkle as i was
at the same time i couldnt help feeling
that she had the big end of the argu-
ment if i could calrply turn down a
girl who might possibly-just possibly
-have been mourning me as dead for
two years this other girl was entirely
justified in seeking to pull me out of her
heart as unworthy of her love

  dad crockett was banging away on
his anvil and for a little while neither
of us out there on the flat bowlder
spoke when the old man thrust his
drill intp the fire again and the clack
and pur of the bellows took the place
of the ringing hammer blows it was
the girl who broke the silence

  you must go-and go soon buddy
she urged speaking low and softly for
the first time in that hard-hearted in-
dea mans chance



terview and you mustnt think of
me as my silly lack of self-control in
those first few mifiutes we were to-
gether after you came to yourself gave
you a right to think i am the wid-
owed one now the man i loved-the
man who made this ring and put it on
my finger-is dead and i shall never see
him again she sprang up quickly and
gave me her hand let us say good-
by here and now buddy it will be
easier than to put it off until you are
leaving that will be to-morrow morn-
ing wont it  please say it will be i-
i cant stand this any longer

  dad crockett was still poking his
forge fire and there was only the moon
swinging high over the saddleback to
look on perhaps your truly good man
would have crushed his natural feelings
into a crumpled  little wad and thrown
them over the slope to be drowned in
the brawling creek at the mountains
foot would have remembered his sa-
cred obligations and all that and would
have respected cassie crocketts utter
defenselessness

  but i make no claim to any such
high-planed and heroic virtue what i
saw was the most lovable the most win-
some the most desirable woman in all
the world of women standing there and
begging me to go away because her
heart was breaking for love of me i
stood up and took her in my arms and
for an ecstatic minute she let herself
go-let me kiss her breath away then
she twisted herself free and fled and
thus the final milestone in the dead
mans chance wandering flitted into
the backward-reaching distances

chapter v

back to earth

  it was with feelings about as mixed
and mingled as a man ever owns to i
guess that i made my going-away prep-
arations a little after daylight the fol-
lowing morning

  dad crockett got up with me at the
break of day sacked the ore which was
to be my grubstake and loaded the pack
animals giving me road directions as
he worked the trail to the smelter
town on the p s-w was a fairly good
one it seemed all i had to do was
to follow my nose and it dad said and
in the afternoon of the second day i
would be crawling down the final moun-
tain to swansea

  i didnt enter the cabin until after
cassie had come to the door to tell us
that breakfast was ready it was a
pretty solemn meal dad crockett
never said much at table at the best of
times and this time he did not open his
face except to feed it

  cassie talked a little made talk i
should say and i helped her out as i
could but a blind man could have
seen that it was a sort of funeral break-
fast all around i had come to life for
myself but it was plain to be seen that
i was dying for those two people whom
i was leaving behind i havent the
slightest idea that eifher of them ever
expected to see me again

  the actual leave-taking made it seem
even more like a death in the family
the loaded burros were at the cabin
door and when the meal was over
the girl jumped up said good-by
most abruptly and darted into the little
room which her father had boxed off
for her at the side of the cabin shut-
ting the door behind her

  crockett went out to the dumphead
with me wrung my hand until the bones
cracked and told me with a queer
huskiness in his gruffly gentle voice to
be good to my self fifteen minutes
later a crook in the trail shut the cabin
and the mine out of sight and a new
lap in the little ant gallop which we call
life was begun

  the forty-mile trip over the moun-
tains proved uneventful at nightfall
of the first day i camped at the foot of
the second range on the bankof a creek


thm popular magazine

that dad crockett had described for
me and at about three oclock in the
afternoon of the next day i had topped
the range and was looking down upon
the little smelter town in the broad val-
ley to the south

  there had been nothing in the long
tramp at the heels of the pack ani-
mals to evoke the slightest memory-a
robert jones memory i had to take
dad crocketts word for- it that i had
been over the trail half a dozen times
in the two years true i had had tio
trouble in finding it but that proved
nothing it would have been plain sail-
ing for the rawest tenderfoot and my
various engineering jobs as jimmie
shurtleff had made me a fairly good
mountaineer

  it was pretty nearly shift-changing
time at the smelter when i reached the
town and halted the burros at the door
of the assay-room office a keen-eyed
young fellow whom i took to be the su-
perintendent came out to meet me

  hello bobby jones he called
got a few more sacks of choice sam-
ples from the chance

  just here i made the first of a string
of mistakes but it seemed entirely ex-
cusable at the time i didnt explain
anything to hobbs the superintendent
it didnt seem worth while to go into
the statistics with him and i let him
go on calling me jones we made the
dicker for the ore it was to be ground
and assayed and sampled by the night
shift and i was to have my money in
the mornihg	

  you can have the check as early as
you like said the young superintend-
ent adding i suppose youll want to
be buying your grubstake and starting
back pretty soon after sunup 

  no i told him im not going
back to the mine this trip im going
out to see if i cant cook up some scheme
to turn the chance into a producing
shipper

  good man-thats the talk he ex-

claimed well make you attractive
figures when you can give us the ore
in quantities there is a midnight train
east and well rush things so you can
get your check in time for that if you
like the commissary will be closed
but ill arrange to cash it for you

  i thanked him and told him that
would hardly do that id have to make
some purchases-clothes and the like-
before i could leave town at that he
pulled a thick roll from his pocket and
skinned it twice for me

  youre all right bobby you and
dad crockett can have anything you
want out of this wikiup he said
will that be enough of an advance to
let you buy the glad rags while you
wait you can have more if you need
it

  i assured him it was enough and
more than enough and thanked him
again supper of a sort was ready at
the tar-paper-covered hotel across the
street and after i had eaten i rigged
myself out with a suit of ready-made
clothes at the towns one emporium
bought a suit case and stuffed it bought
a bad cigar and smoked it and an
hour before train time i had cashed my
check for the balance due on the ore
blinking a little at the bigness of it when
i saw the figures

  surprise party eh bobby laughed
the superintendent the chance lode
is getting a good bit richer as you de-
velop it if youve got much more run-
ning as high in values as this packload
weve just ground up it will pay you
and dad to put on more burros and
make a business of jack-freighting it
over the hills you dont need any rail-
road

  the cash-in was for eighteen hundred
and forty-five dollars and i knew ex-
actly what dad crockett had done he
had sorted the ore down to the finest
possible point putting in only the rich-
est specimens he could find it touched
me very nearly this bit of leave-taking
dead mans chance



generosity and i felt as though i ought
to leave at least half of the money on
deposit for crockett when he should
come over after the burros it seemed
hoggish to take it all

 but on the other hand i clung stub-
bornly to my determination to consider
the money merely as a loan to be paid
back dollar for dollar if i shouldnt
be able to make it help in some way for
the developing of the mine so when
i boarded the eastbound train at mid-
night i had most of the eighteen hun-
dred-odd dollars in a money belt next
to my skin

   breakfast time the following morn-
ing found me changing trains at copah
with an hour and a half to wait before i
could take the local going north on the
g v  p here i found plenty of
surprises copah was-and still is-
a division station on the p s-w and in
former times on the other side of the
big gap i had been fairly well ac-
quainted in the division headquarters
of this cur south end connecting line

   but the west changes pretty rapidly
there was a new division superintend-
ent and he had brought in a new outfit
with him all of the office men i had
known best were gone but mccormack
the homely faced scotch yardmaster
was still a fixture i found the yard-
master on the platform after i had
bolted a hasty breakfast

   hello mac i exclaimed offering
to shake hands

   as i have said the yardmaster was
scotch canny scotch at that and he
put his hands carefully behind him

  no ye dont my buckie he
growled im not the brither of yer
old friend back on the p d  q or
some ither road that nobody ever heard
of and ive got no money to lend

i laughed in his face simply because
i couldnt help it he hadnt changed a
particle and it didnt seem possible that
i had changed so much as to be entirely
b

unrecognizable to a man who had
known me so well

  take a good look at me mac and see
if you cant place me i urged you
ought to be able to

  he squinted his little gray eyes and
bored me through and through

  nothin doing my lad he grunted
at the end of the sharp scrutiny

  but there ought to be i insisted
two years ago you knew me well
enough to call me by my first name
and what might that be  was the
suspicious query

  jimmie--jimmie shurtleff

  of all the brassy liars that was ever
spawned he snorted contemptuously
then ill just save you from ever
tellin that one again poor jimmie
shurtleffs dead and buried these two
years man

  how do you know he is dead and
buried

  how do i know it why shouldnt
i know it wasnt i the boss of the
wreckin crew that went up from here
to help clear the g v track the night
he was killed more than that i was
the one that found him in the burned
wreck o the pullman put that in yer
pipe and smoke it ye lyin blastoderm
youd swear to that would you
i demanded

  of course id swear to it and not
only me but a dozen ithers-mr milli-
gan himself in the dozen he was
there why should there be any doubt
of it id like to know

  it seems to me there ought to be a
doubt

  well there isnt-mores the peety
the poor lads face was smashed and
burned till his ain mither mightnt have
known it but that made no manner of
difference dye see he was wearin
his ain clothes and the papers and let-
ters in his pockets would have told us
what is it yere tryin to put across on
me anyhow

  i didnt answer direct there was


the vovulatr magazine

something gruesomely fascinating in
thus hearing of my own death and iden-
tification

  you buried him i asked

  he was buried in green butte mil-
ligan took charge of all that there was
a girl he was engaged to they said she
was like to go mad wi grief but tell
me ye scamp how was it you took
jimmies name to play wi and claim for
yer ain yed ought to be jailed
again i refused to answer there
would be others who would not be so
hard to convince-milligan for one

  youll find out some day what a
blind old ass you are mccormack i
said and then have you seen mr
milligan lately

  that shows- what a blunderin hobo
ye are the yardmaster scoffed mil-
ligans been gone from this a year and
more

  milligan gone has he left the g
v  p

  there isnt any g v  p as yed
know if ye knew anything it was
leased to the transcontinental a twelve-
month since and its operated as a
branch of the big line the noo yed
better get posted a bit before ye run
around takin a dead mans name and
try in to bilk his friends for a hand-
out yell jump the next train out o
this my buckie or ill be handin ye
over to the police

  it was laughable in a way and in
another way it was a trifle unnerving
was i going to have the same difficulty
with- others  mac had known me well
if i should get a clean shave and be suf-
ficiently persistent in recalling myself
would i be able to convince him finally
that i was not an impostor one thing
held me back and that was the crass im-
possibility of making a man of mccor-
macks caliber believe in the two-year
blank and to explain at all i should
be obliged to tell of the blank

  while i was hesitating a young fel-
low one of hobbs clerks in the smelter

office at swansea came sauntering
down the platform and spoke to me

  hello mr jones ire said you
didnt know that i got on the train with
you at swansea last night did you
im on my vacation and im going up
to grass valley to see my mother

  mccormack was still eying me in sus-
picious hostility and he snapped at the
clerks salutation like an angry collie
barking at the heels of a sheep stealer

  so yere jones to this man are ye
and yell be smith tathe next maybe
if yere here after the next train leaves
yell be jugged for yere not needed in
copah then he turned upon the smel-
ter clerk if yell take an old rail-
roaders advice yell not be mixing
much wi mr jones laddie hes a
crook of the first water and hell be
doin ye out o ycr pocketbook

  naturally the clerk shied away from
me at this and a little later i saw him
talking excitedly to mccormack telling
the yardmaster no doubt what my
name and standing was or had been
in swansea still later i saw the boy
dodging into the station telegraph of-
fice  but even then i did not suspect
the size of the landslide i had set in
motion by the attempt to identify my-
self to mccormack or how the up-
coming of the swansea clerk to call
me jones was going to turn the land-
slide into an avalanche

  in due course of time the northbound
train backed down to the station and
the express and baggage truckmen be-
gan to trundle their stuff out over the
platform a glance at the train equip-
ment proved that mccormack had been
telling the truth about the change in
operative ownership cars and engine
were lettered t-c r and i saw no
familiar faces in the crew with the
loss of my identity i had also lost my
old railroad environment the g v

	p was apparently a thing of the past
and its place was taken by the trans-
continental branch
dead mans chance	

  when i got aboard and took a seat
in the smoker the smelter clerk from
swansea gbt up and moved out to an-
other car mccormacks warning had
evidently taken hold and the young man
meant to run no risk of mixing it up
with a confidence man i smiled at the
little incident but quite possibly the 
smile would have gone into innocuous
desuetude if i had known that the big
black-mustached man who followed me
into the smoker and took the seat op-
posite mine was a special officer in the
t-c r secret service a man who had
been hastily summoned by phone frpm
his uptown headquarters in copah and
had had ten minutestalk with mccor-
mack before he boarded the train

  this shadow business came as an aft-
erclap and being unsuspected it didnt
trouble me at the time during the two-
hundred-mile run to green butte i was
chiefly interested as a man coming back
from the grave in trying to set things
in their proper places trying to make
the two-year interval account as it
might for the many changes

  there were changes enough good-
ness knows the entire country seemed
to have suffered an unaccountable
blight there were fewer trains on the
road and the towns were dull and quiet
i saw my track-shortening job as we
passed over it it had been completed
on my plans but the lining up and bal-
lasting seemed to point to a lack of in-
terest or of money toward the last

  i marked a few rememberable faces
along the line but only a few many
of the station agents had been changed
and i saw no recognizable man ifi the
various train crews the t-c r had
made a clean sweep in taking over the
line as changing managements usually
do and i was a stranger in a strange
country i thought it would be better
in green butte though my acquaint-
ance in the headquarters city-outside
of our own railroad staff-had not been

extensive but here again i reckoned
without my host

  late in the afternoon the slowly
jogging local train clanked over the
switches in the green butte yards by
this time i had formulated a plan of ac-
tion of a sort i had already blundered
twice first in not explaining frankly to
hobbs at swansea and again in making
a beginning on the suspicious old scotch
yardmaster at copah very good tak-
ing a fresh start i would be cautious
and look twice before i leaped once
bearing in mind the fact that to people
who have actually seen a man dead and
buried a resurrection of the man is
going to seem like a poor joke

  following out this idea i went
straight from the train to the principal
hotel-the inter-mountain at the reg-
istry desk i was up against another
phase of my problem if i should reg-
ister boldly as jimmie shurtleff the
fight for reinstatement would be on at
once before i could have time to turn
around and get a fair squint at the
field

  having determined as i said to be
cautious i guess i overdid it i signed
robert jones and as i did it the big
man who had ridden all the way from
copah in the smoker seat opposite mine
pushed up to the counter anti stood
waiting for the pen when i finished
and gave it to him he wrinkled his bull-
dog nose at me

  jones of dead mans chance eh
he rasped gruffly queer name for a
town what 

  it isnt a town its a mine i an-
swered taking his butt-in for a bit of
ordinary western freedom but he
was already ignoring me

  any wire for me he asked of the
clerk

  the man behind the counter let me
wait for my room assignment while he
shuffled the pack of telegrams

  nothing for you mr allen

  all right give me my old room and


the popullr magazine

 if anything comes shoot it up to me
 quick

   the clerk fixed him up out of his
 turn and then got time to attend to me

  as he was looking over his room index
 to see where he could put me i glanced
 around the lobby to see if there were
 any familiar faces i saw none but
 among the strangers there was a man
 who was remarkable enough to make me
 look twice at him

   he was large ponderously large with
 a smcoth-shaven face that was almost
 boyish he was wearing a wide-
 brimmed soft hat and a prince albert
 coat and was smoking the biggest
 blackest cigar i had ever seen between
 a mans teeth

   when i first noticed him he was sit-
 ting in one of the lobby lounging chairs
 with his eyes fixed absently upon the
 great pendant electrolier swinging from
 the center of the lobby dome but
 while i was telling the clerk that i must
 have a room with a bath this big man
 got up and sauntered across to us-to
 ask for his key as it turned out

   in just one moment mr sprague
 said the clerk who had already put me
 off once to wait on the butt-in allen
 and then the big man turned to me

   youll excuse me mr jones im
 sure he said smiling good-naturedly
 i didnt know that gilman was still
 waiting on you take your own good
 time and make gilman give you exactly
 the kind of room you wtant im in no
 hurry people of my avoirdupois cant
 hurry you know

   i had  more idea than a goat how
 this big good-natured stranger had my
 sham name down so pat and i guess the
 little shock of surprise wrote itself out
 in my face gilman was still conning
 his room list and the man he had called
 sprague went on talking easily

   you have an exceedingly readable
 face mr jones he remarked tt
 tells me that you are wondering how
 i came to know your name after a

 man has been an analytical chemist as
 long as i have he learns to use his eyes
 you registered a minute or two ago
 and another gentleman registered imme-
 diately after you therefore the next
 to the last name in the book must be
 yours

  now this explanation was of the kind
that doesnt explain the registry book
had been reversed and pulled across to
gilmans side of the counter after allen
had signed his name in it and the swift
glance i shot at it in its new position
made me almost certain that my signa-
ture couldnt have been read upside
down by anybody standing beside me
-that is anybody whose eyes were less
than telescopic

  i used to know a man named robert
jones of omaha the big man went on
half as if he were talking to himself
but i dont believe he ever saw dead
mans chance then i had a shock
that nearly paralyzed me how did
you leave old dad crockett and his
pretty daughter cassie mr jones

  you know them i blurted out i
-i left them very well indeed no
longer ago than last tuesday morn-
ing

  fine old citizen dad is observed
this remarkable giant its a thousand
pities his mine isnt within shouting dis-
tance of some good transportation line
then entirely without warning dont
you remember me mr jones

  before i could reply or even get my
breath to reply the clerk was giving me
my number and calling a bell hop

  front show mr jones up to
 dinner at seven in the dining
room mr jones or you can be served
a la carte in the cafe any time you
wish

  the giant in the soft hat and the
prince albert who had asked me in
such a pleasantly offhand way if i didnt
remember him waved a huge hand in
genial dismissal

  never mind me and my foolish
dbad mans chance



questions mr jones go up and get
the bath youre honing for-youve had
a long ride and a dusty one well get
together a little farther on if you like
and ill see if i cant explain to you why
you really ought to remember me sup-
pose we make it a cafe dinner at half
past six you neednt be afraid gil-
man here will tell you that whatever
else i may be im not a confidence man
so long see you later

chapter vi

monty gershom

  i kept the dinner appointment with
mr sprague partly because i didnt
see just how i could very well dodge it
but more perhaps because i had a
hunh that as a man who had lost his
identity i was on the edge of what
might prove to be a pretty lonesome
little jomada in this vale of -tears-
which the same vale is rocky enough at
times even for those who have stayed
in it continuously

  from the consomme to the pastry
sprague was merely a good tible com-
panion chatting easily about everything
under the sun save and excepting the
extraordinary incident of his recogni-
tion of me as robert jones at the hotel
counter

  among other things he talked quite
freely of himself he had been a gov-
ernment chemist he told me specializ-
ing in soil analyses for the agricultural
department this work had taken him
all over the west and though he no
longer did it as a steady thing he gave
me to understand that -he still accepted
an occasional assignment from the de-
partment as an outside expert

  he was lately in from an extended
trip into the region beyond the juni-
pers he went on to say there was an
irrigation project on foot for some of
the arid lands west of the little juni-
pers and he had gone in as the govern-
ment expert tomake a report on the fer-

tility of the soils he was telling me
about his trip and its results when he
jumped suddenly from the technicalities
to things personal

  from the caliente desert and the
little junipers we can climb pretty
easily to cryolite creek and dead
mans chance mr jones was the way
in which he made the jump an irri-
gation project presupposes a water sup-
ply and the cryolite is one of the
streams which the engineers willprob-
ably utilize i wanted to see what it
looked like at its headwaters so i took a
little hike up the canon

  the cryolite the name is strange
to me i asserted

  thats odd since you have lately
been living within sight and hearing of
the stream for some time he put in
quickly didnt crockett ever tell you
the proper name of the torrent which
pours through his happy valley

  now it was entirely possible that the
name of the torrent had been a matter
of common conversation between rob-
ert jones and dad crockett but that did
me no good in my present individuality

  i dont seem to recall the name i
returned evasively it seems to me we
always spoke of it as the creek 
sprague was drilling me through with
a pair of eyes that could be made to
bore into the remotest comers of a
mans brain when their owner so de-
sired but his good-natured smile took
the edge off of the shrewd scrutiny

  the name of the stream is only one
of the things you cant recall mr
jones he said knowingly and it is
chiefly because you dont recall them
that you interest me less than three
months ago i spent a number of days at
dead mans chance sleeping in fact
iri a spare bunk in your own room and
it has been clearly evident-from the mo-
ment of our scraped acquaintance at the
hotel counter that you have totally for-
gotten me

  i laughed uneasily


the popular magazine

   perhaps i am a crook mr sprague
 and dont want to remember you i
 suggested

   no that is the singular part of it-

 or one of them though the casual ob-
 server-the fictional detective for ex-
 ample-might jump to the conclusion
 that rou are dodging the law i am very
 well convinced that you are not the
 criminal you are suspected of being

   what i demanded who says i
 am a criminal

   nobody has said it yet but i may
 say that you are as the phrase goes
 under observation turn your head
 slowly to the left and tell me what you
 see

   i obeyed mechanically the cafe was
 not more than half filled and most of
 the diners appeared to be easily typical
 of time and place but diagonally across
 from our table for two i saw the man
 with the heavy black mustaches and he
 was evidently dividing time pretty
 evenly between his dinner and the job
 of keeping a close watch on our table

   you see said sprague reading the
 direction of my gaze with the smiling
 eyes which seemed to miss nothing
 you are looking at mr cornelius al-
 len a railroad detective of the common
 or home-grown variety he has doubt-
 less followed you here-from copah
 perhaps since he registers from there
 you are not a criminal mr jones as
 we have just now agreed but why
 otherwise a curious person might ask
 is con allen shadowing you

   you can search me i declared

   nevertheless there is a small mys-
 tery about you the big man persisted
 gently to that mystery as i have
 said you owe my present interest in
 you notwithstanding your perfectly
 excusable evasion of a few moments
 ago it is patently evident that you dont
 recall me or my visit to dead mans
 chance

   i saw at once that there was no use
 in trying to keep any obvious thing hid-

 den from this big-bodied reader of se-
 crets

  you are quite right mr sprague
i confessed i dont remember a sin-
gle thing about you or your visit
strange he commented half ab-
sently it is the most curious of the
many curious things which have pre-
sented themselves to me in an experi-
ence which has been singularly rich in
difficult problems may i ask if you
remember anything at all connected
with your stay at crocketts mine

  i could not make up my mind to be
entirely frank with him his was the
most engaging personality i had ever
known but yet he was still a stranger
i simply couldnt tell him poor jimmie
shurtleffs story as a whole

  perhaps i can explain a little i of-
fered taking a new line of evasion
some four or five weeks ago i was
blown up in the mine by the premature
explosion of a blast a piece of the
porphyry hit me on the head and the
crocketts tell me that i was unconscious
for three weeks when i finally came
to myself there was a pretty big blank
behind me mr sprague

  thank you said my table mate as
kindly as ifi had made him a present
of something valuable now if you
could go a step farther-but i suppose
that is impossible you cant very well
go back of the record which was broken
by the flying piece of porphyry

  what farther step would you wish
me to take i asked

  you were not altogether the simplest
problem in the world before the bit of
porphyry knockedyou out mr jones
was the grave reply during my visit
at dead mans chance i found you in-
telligent unquestionably sane a man of
good parts who had evidently enjoyed
the advantages of a thorough technical
education am i clear

  perfectly

  yet you wouldnt or couldnt tell
me anything about your former life or
dead mans chance



experiences i asked you i remember
if you had been a mining engineer and
you evaded me a number of similar
questions touching your past your boy-
hood and early manhood met with the
same rebuff

  you doubtless thought i had some-
thing to conceal in my past i ven-
tured

  to be quite frank with you i did at
first but afterward i was convinced
that this was a mistake as a chemist
-purely as a chemist you understand
-it has come in my way to study criti-
cally the most intricate chemical com-
bination on earth-the human being it
was at that time that i decided that you
were not a criminal in hiding at the out-
of-the-way mine in the junipers in
other words i was convinced that it was
sheer inability and not unwillingness
which was making ou dodge these
friendly questions of mine about your
past

  i cant help you there i put in still
determined not to tell him jimmie
shurtleffs story

  his smile was the expression of arj in-
sight that was almost uncanny

  you mean that you wont help me-
on such a short acquaintance as the
present one then he looked me
straight in the eyes you cant say
truthfully now that you dont remem-
ber your boyhood mr jones

  it was no use but i was resolved to
yield only as i was compelled to

  i wouldnt attempt to say it i do
remember my boyhood and it was as
commonplace as that of thousands of
other boys i wars raised on a missouri
farm by an uncle and another uncle
gave me an education for some years
i was a field engineer in various capaci-
ties and in the course of time i drifted
over into the junipers and stumbled
upon the crocketts father and daugh-
ter does this bring me sufficiently up
to date

  it proves that you can lay down a

plan of action and stick to it with some
considerable fidelity was the good-
tempered rejoinder never mind for
reasons of your own which doubtless
appeal to you as being good reasons
you have determined not to be entirely
frank with me it is all right i am far
from wishing to force your confidence
later on perhaps you will give me vol-
untarily what i have no notion of trying
to extort by any third-degree methods
let us drop that part of the problem
and come to another part why is con
allen shadowing you 

  that was a question which i could
answer truthfully and without the
slightest reserve

  as i have said i have no more idea
than the man-in the-moon

  yet the fact remains after you
went upstairs this afternoon allen
came down and asked gilman a lot of
questions about you none of which of
course the clerk could answer later
he got a telegram and was careless
enough to sit in the chair next to mine
while he read it it was from swansea
a little smelting town on the p s-w
and it was signed hobbs would you
like to know what it said

  i certainly should if it concerns
me

  it read something like this

  jones is employee or partner crockett
dead mans chance mine came in yester-
day with small lot picked ore which we
bought  left burros and took night train
east to make arrangements for developing
mine he said we paid him without written
order from crockett but have done -so sev-
eral times in past dont arrest till you hear
further from us

  sprague finished the quotation with
 smile how does that strike you
he asked

  it strikes me that this man allen is
a meddlesome crank who ought to have
his head punched i broke out dad
crockett gave me the ore and told me
to sell it for my own account its no-
bodys business but his and mine


the cpocpulacr magazine

  very true was the suave rejoinder
but allen is the kind of man who will
make a case if he doesnt happen to find
one ready-made however even that
kind of a man has to have some sort of
a starting point you are not ready to
tell me just now what you have done to
earn allens attentions and it doesnt
matter so long as you live here
cpenly and aboveboard he cant annoy
you

  perhaps he can i answered remem-
bering that it might be difficult to com-
municate with crockett and so to prove
my right to the money which had been
paid for the picked ore

  if he becomes too officious let me
know and perhaps i can persuade him
to quit said sprague

  i was trying to thank my new-found
friend for his offer of help when a thing
happened that shot the thanking busi-
ness up in the air and left it hanging
there like mahomets coffin there was
a vacant table just across from us and
while i was speaking a couple a man
and-a woman came in to take seats at
it the man was young gray-eyed and
he wore little curling blond mustaches
with the ends twisted cunningly into the
latest barbers fad and the young
woman-

  i looked again and gasped the natty
young man with the curled mustaches
was my cousin monty gershom and
the round-armed beauty who was put-
ting her dimpled elbows on the table
opposite to him was mabel

chapter vii
uncle perkins legacy

  for a moment i was dumfounded
though i dont know why i should have
been since i was expecting to meet
these two sooner or later it wasnt
twenty feet across to the table where
monty and the girl had taken their
seats and they couldnt help seeing us
if they looked in our direction while

monty was giving his dinner order i
had a chance to catch my breath and
to get ready for the inevitable it didnt
come the dinner order given monty
glanced up and recognized sprague
with a nod i dont believe he saw me
at all

  one of our rising young men
sprague informed me in low tones
after he had returned the nod

  and the girl i queried

  she is miss mabel carothers her
father is the cashier of the security
bank

  then they are not-not married
not yet but they are engaged i
understand it is a good match-espe-
cially for the young woman

  i grappled frantically for a decent
measure of self-control it would never
do to let sprague suspect how vitally
interested i was

  she is beautiful enough to make it
appear the other way around as a good
match for ger-for the young man i
remarked

  i spoke in terms of dollars which
is the modern definition of eligibility
sprague qualified with a wry smile
the young man has lately come in for
a fortune and it is whispered about that
carothers the bank cashier has been
making some investments which with a
pretty extravagant family will make
him practically a poor man

  i nodded i see but you say the
young man has a fortune what is
his line of business

  he is a real-estate speculator but
his fortune didnt come out of the spec-
ulating it was left him by an uncle
once more i had to grapple for hand-
holds there was only the one uncle
-montys and mine uncle perkins the
mining broker whose broking ac-
cording to the home gossips had been
altogether of the bucket-shop variety
it was unbelievable that uncle perkins
had had a fortune to leave and still
more incredible that he should have left
cdeicd mans chance



it to monty for whom he had always
entertained a most cordial disliking

  sprague saw my grapple i dont
think he could have helped seeing it

  you look surprised he said do
you know gershom 

  he looks something like a man i
used to know i rejoined is he still
in the real-estate business 

  he retains his offices in the trotter
building they are on the same floor
with my temporary laboratory but i
fancy he doesnt do much in a business
way he is too much occupied in devis-
ing ways and means of spending his in-
come

  the couple at the other table had been
served and i could not take my eyes
from them mabel hadnt changed a
days worth in the two years or more
and if she were mourning for me or
for anybody she didnt show it to any
marked extent

  i caught the gleam of a diamond on
her left hand-a much bigger diamond
than mine had been and she was wear-
ing a necklace that must have cost a
small fortune she was evidently on
the best of terms with herself with the
world and with her dinner companion
and if poor jimmie shurtleff figured as
a regretful memory i was ready to
swear that it was a mighty dim one

  sprague had finished his small coffee
and was taking one of the huge black
cigars from his pocket case

  shall we adjourn to the lobby and
burn a little incense  he asked and
since i had no reasonable excuse for lin-
gering i rose with him

  i dont know whether it was by ac-
cident or design that he led the way past
the two at the other table but anyhow
he did it following him i passed so
close to mabel in going behind her chair
that i caught a whiff of the perfume
she had always used and it brought on
a rush of foolish memories that pretty
nearly made me faint

  but that wasnt the only dramatic

touch at the critical instant monty
looked up and saw me as i hesitated
for the barest fraction of a second be-
hind mabels chair they were drinkr
ing champagne and he had just lifted
his glass one wild-eyed glance he gave
me and then the wineglass stem broke
in his fingers and the fragile bowl fell
to smash itself in his plate

  i was wondering if sprague had seen
montys stare and guilty start after we
had found a quiet corner in the lobby
and had lighted our cigars i was not
left long in doubt

  im afraid our friend gershom has
been hitting a rather rapid gait since he
came into his fortune was the big
mans half-absent remark did you
see him drop his glass as we passed

  i made the sign of assent

  a bad case of nerves youd say
sprague suggested lie looked as if
he had suddenly seen a ghost then
after a longish pause do you suppose
you were the ghost mr jones

  i grinned inwardly it was a sure
thing that my cousin had seen a ghost
and since he had taken the ghosts place
in the affections of the ghosts fiancee
there was ample cause for the case of
nerves

  i may have been i answered
possibly he saw in me a fancied re-
semblance to somebody he had known
spragues laugh was silent but it ran
in waves over his big body shaking him
as if the bottled-up risibility threatened
an explosion i didnt see exactly where
the joke came in-not even after my
companion had explained

  it was well worth the price of ad-
mission he said chuckling again
young mr monty gershom is usually
so cocksure about everything that it is
positively refreshing to see him go to
pieces once in a while the more i
think of it the more certain i am that
he must have seen a ghost that is the
way the seers always act in the story-


the popular magazine

books isnt it now i am wondering
how he contrived to square himself with
miss carothers in response to her
scared why monty

  i too had heard the girls half-fright-
ened exclamation and i was magnani-
mous enough to be glad that mabel had
not seen what monty had seen mixed
ups with that was a feeling of satisfac-
tion it was perfectly clear that monty
had recognized me at once in spite of
my beard and if he knew me there was
a good possibility that others would
just the same i saw that my cousin had
promptly taken the alarm and i had a
large hunch that in him i was going
to find the biggest obstacle to my at-
tempted resurrection of the jimmie
shurtleff identity his present rela-
tions with mabel would answer for that

  beyond this the gershom incident
as a talk topic dropped otit of its own
accord and sprague gave me another
demonstration of his abilities as an all-
around conversationalist through two
of the long cigars and the better half
of a third he told me entertaining stories
of his experiences in the chemical field
many of which had more than a touch
of expert detective work in them

  as he went on it became evident that
while his business might be purely and
technically scientific his hobby was this
same detective field in which he had
worked with more or less enthusiasm
for a good while reasoning of the
high-grade sublimated sort was the key
he applied to the unlocking of all the
hidden doors and his methods as he
described them were about as far re-
moved from the ordinary thief catchers
as light is from groping in the dark

  it was ten oclock when he finallygot
up and stretched his great body yawn-
ing like a sleepy boy

  by jove look at the time mr
jones he protested youll have to
forgive me for boring you so incor-
rigibly when i get started on my pet
subject and find a patient ear i never

know when to stop youve had a long
journey and you must be tired i know
you want to turn in and well say good
night and hope for another day go
to bed and sleep up and dont dream
too hard about the ghosts our friend
monty gershom spills his wine over

   left to myself in the still well-peo-
pled lobby i was minded to take the
good advice just where i was to begin
in the task of reidentifying myself as a
dead man come to life i could not yet
determine but at all events there was
nothing to be done before another day
what the day might bring forth was a
question that only the day itself could
answer and with this thought to put
the cork in the bottle i went over to
the desk to get my room key

  it was while i was waiting my turn
at the key window that i once more be-
came disagreeably conscious of the es-
pionage of the man allen knew that he
had materialized out of some out-of-
the-way corner to follow me across the
lobby in other circumstances i should
have had it out with him in short order
but the cursed foolishness which had
led me to sign jones instead of
shurtleff in the registry book tied my
hands until the mask which had been
so idiotically assumed could be thrown
aside i could not fight in the open
realizing this i took my room key and
ducked for the elevator counting it as a
small victory that allen didnt follow to
shadow me upstairs

   with the door of my room closed be-
hind me and the electric lights turned
on i could smile at the nervousness
with which i had chased downthe long
upper corridor but the smile was short-
lived before i could turn around twice
some one tapped at the closed door
and when i went to open it anticipat-

-	ing nothing more formidable than a tip-
hunting bell boy my cousin monty
walked in without a word and jerked
my hold on the knob loose to shut the
door with a slam
dead mans chance



chapter viii
montys ultimatum

  they say that the temperament that
goes with light hair and gray eyes and
runs to foppishness in clothes and the
barber-shop adornments is seldom dan-
gerous but my cousin montmorency
certainly did resemble a fierce little wea-
sel at bay when he jerked the door out
of my hand and slammed it

  you are not going to get a single
half inch the start of me you crook i
was the way he opened up on me i
know who you are and what youre
here for and if you dont drop it and
get out of this town by the first train
youll land on the rock pile

  i pointed to a chair and sat down
this was a brand-new role for cousin
monty and i wanted to see how far he
could carry it besides a sort of slow
anger was boiling up somewhere inside
of me i assumed of course that he
had recognized me in the glass-shatter-
ing instant in the cafe and it made me
hot to think that he the only kinsman i
had in green butte should be the first
to run in and try to cut my throat

  i always knew you were a little vil-
lain monty but i didnt suspect until
now that you could be a great one
i said when he had dragged up a chair
and planted himself on the opposite side
of the small writing table whats
your object in coming here and jumping
onto me in this way

  youll find out if you try any of your
funny business with me you dirty black-
mailer he ripped out then youve
got gall enough to swim in-calling
yourself by the name of a man who has
been dead and buried for over two
years

  i couldnt help grinning across at him
here was a man of the kind you read
about the pin-headed blunderer who
will promptly hang himself if you will
only give him enough rope

  youve given yourself away cousin

monty i retorted the name i wrote
in the hotel book is robert jones and
you are the only person in green butte
thus far who knows my real name

  i dont pretend to know how many
names youve got he snapped but i
do know this that no longer ago than
this morning you tried to palm yourself
off on a certain man in copah as my
cousin james shurtleff who was killed
in a railroad accident over two years
ago i dont know why you sprung the
imposture on the copah man-unless it
was because you wanted to try it first
on the dog

  this took a little of the edge off the
assumption that monty had recognized
me immediately in that one glance
across the cafe table and was here be-
cause he had done so but it did not
remove the assumption entirely his
knowledge of the mccormack incident
proved that he had been talking to
allen the railroad detective who had
doubtless got his information direct
from the yardmaster but this did not
prove that montys dinner-table shock
was not genuine it was more than
likely that the shock had preceded the
talk with allen by some little time in
other words monty fter he had rec-
ognized me had been digging for in-
formation wherever he could find it

  monty i can prove conclusively to
you that i am james shurtleff and you
know it i asserted there are a
thousand things that passed between
you and the boy you grew up with on
your fathers farm in missouri which
couldnt possibly be known to anybody
but yourself and that boy that being
the case i cant understand why you
should be making a needless ass of
yourself

  im not here to argue with you
he broke out

  but listen a minute why should
you deny me the right to live and own
my own name youve got it all
havent you-the fortune that uncle


the vovuljlr magazine

perkins might not have left to you if
he had known that i was still alive
the money and the girl i was going
to marry  in heavens name what
more do you want

   jimmie shurtleff is dead i tell you
i saw him and helped to bury him
but wont you give me a chance to
at least try to prove to you that fie
isnt dead

  yes by jupiter ill give you a
 chance-a dead mans diance

  consider a little i urged sup-
pose that by the rawest kind of a
miracle jimmie shurtleff wasnt killed
in that accident in two horse gulch
try to imagine just for the sake of a
hypothesis that the man you helped to
bury and who was so badly disfigured
that nobody could be positively certain
of his identity wasnt jimmie shurtleff
at all put yourself in jimmies place
and see how youd feel if the people
you knew best should turn you down
i had no idea that any sort of an
appeal would move him but i took a
sort of malicious delight in making his
turndown of me look as hard-hearted
as it really was how far i could have
carried it i dont know but he shut
off all the appeals with a brittle accu-
sation and a threat

 you are a rank impostor and the
minute you go to calling yourself jim-
mie shurtleff in this town  have you
pulled and prosecuted

  youd do that would you

  yes that and more ill shove you
until you land where you belong-in
the penitentiary

  and you wont give me a chance to
try to prove to you that i am really
jimmie shurtleff you know very well
that i couldnt do it as an impostor
as i told you a minute ago im not
here to argue with you he stormed

  the slow anger was blazing up now
and i had hard work to keep my hands
off him i dont believe my worst en-
emy ever accused me of being vindic-

tive but montys vicious hostility was
stirring up a feeling akin to that which
prompts the average human being to
hunt forth a stick or a stone when a
snake coils itself in the path and begins
to run its tongue out and hiss

  you talk as if the scrapping was
going to be all on one side monty i
put in quietly isnt there a bare pos-
sibility that you might provoke me to
hit back

  you try it his upper lip was
twitching to show his teeth under the
carefully barbered mustaches and the
face wrinkling was like that of a dog
getting ready to bite you try it on
just once and ill show you where
youre due to get off you blackmailer

  hold on monty i interposed
that is twice you have used that word
if you say it again im going to hit
you now listen once more you as-
sume that i cant get back at you
what about mabel you are engaged
to her they tell me what is going
to happen in that quarter when she
learns that jimmie shurtleff is still
alive

  that touched him he bounded out
of his chair and for a minute or two
gave a lifelike imitation of the at-bay
weasel hunting for a good biting place
under the wing of the eagle that has
nipped him when he stopped tramp-
ing up and down and came to fling
himself into his chair his face was
ghastly

  you are up in all the tricks of your
sneaking trade he said hoarsely i
cant stand for anything like that and
you know i cant how much is it go-
ing to cost me to hire you to fade away
into whatever hell it was that you came
out of

  this was the final straw but still
i was calm enough or angry enough-
whichever way you like to put it-to
draw him on

  how much would it be worth to
you i asked
dead mans chance



  a thousand dollars cold cash

  so much as that i sneered is
your chance at happiness worth all that
money

  two thousand then

  two thousand dollars i am bid for
a choice bit of silence and absence i
retorted mocking him going at two

thousand-

  make it five

  going at five thousand do i hear
the ten

  you devil he hissed theres

another way and-

  monty was always pretty quick-mo-
tioned but the way in which he whipped
a thirty-eight automatic from some-
where in his clothes and covered me
with it was simply lightninglike

  now he gritted youll get
money enough to pay your fare to
south america or to hell and thats all
you will get say your say and do it
quick or ill drill you

  i dont know as i have mentioned the
fact that jimmie shurtleff played three
of his four years in college on the foot-
ball team but he did and i dont
believe monty was a particularly bright
and shining light in athletics at yale
-or wherever it was that uncle silas
sent him anyhow it doesnt matter
things happened pretty rapidly at the
pistol flashing for one a decently
husky ex-half back went headforemost
over the little table at the weasel and
for another the pistol was quickly 
wrenched loose and flung under the bed

  cousin montys collar and necktie
were somewhat disarranged when he
picked himself out of the wreck of the
spindle-legged chair in which he had
been sitting and b was working his
jaw like a swimmer out of breath

  ill get you for this he gasped
let me out of here

  the door is right where you left it
when you came in i suggested

  ill get you he repeated i dont
want you to go away now i want you

to stay right here and give me a chance
to show you up for every time you
call yourself jimmie shurtleff youll
get one more year in the pen ive got
money and ill spend every dollar of
it shoving you to the limit and if you
go near mabel carothers i-ill kill
you

  the door is still available but per-
haps youd rather try the high dive from
the window i hinted making a grab-
bing motion in his direction

  that settled it one jump took him
to the door but when he was halfway
through it he turned and cursed me like
a pickpocket vanishing only when i
made another dive to pin him between
the door and the jamb

chapter ix

blind trails

  since excitements of any kind are
poor soporifics my first nights sleep
in green butte wasnt particularly rest-
ful with monty for an enemy the
thing which had looked so easy from
the dead mans chance point of view
bristled suddenly with difficulties i
had confidently expected to find him
and mabel safely married and in the
circumstances i should not have looked
for a very hearty welcome from either
of them but i had not looked for open
enmity or a fight

  none the less as it appeared the
fight was on i knew my cousin well
enough to be sure that he would stick
at nothing if he thought his chances
with mabel were endangered and i
was mean enough or human enough
to be willing to give him as much trou-
ble as he meant to give me and since
the first move in the trouble giving was
to resurrect jimmie shurtleff for those
who would have no ax to grind in keep-
ing him dead i went at the job imme-
diately after breakfast the following
morning

  i wouldnt wish my worst enemy to


the populah magazine

have a more dismaying experience than
those forenoon hours gave me start-
ing in with the railroad colony i drew
a string of blanks that was simply ap-
palling not one man of the old g
v  p staff was left on the road which
was now a branch of the t-c r my
former associates were scattered to the
four winds milligan they told-me was
locating a new railroad in british co-
lumbia tobey and mike jorkins his
second and third assistants were in
honduras varick office man and map
maker had gone with milligan and so
it went straight on down the list

  in digging out these facts i made fre-
quent inquiries about one james shurt-
leff some few of the railroad men
with whom i talked remembered him-
by hearsay he was killed in an acci-
dent wasnt he oh yes now they
recollected it was a rear-end collision
down below grass valley shurtleff
seemed to have left a good taste in the
mouths of those who had heard of him
an all-around good fellow was the
phrase i heard oftenest and then my
informant would go on to tell me what
a rousing funeral the railroad boys had
given him

  after the railroad blank drawing i
took to the streets of the city here i
learned something that i had never be-
fore realized namely that the average
man has a good many casual acquaint-
ances whose faces and names are famil-
iar enough but about whom he knows
nothing intimately and who are in the
same fix regarding him in other
words the number of people who are
on an intimate footing in any mans life
is strictly limited

  i saw many familiar faces in the
streets and in some instances i could
recall the names but when i would
make some sort of an excuse for talk
and begin to ask about jimmie shurt-
leff i was always- promptly met with
an oh yes poor old jimmie he
was killed in an accident about two

years ago did you say he was a friend
of yours

  not to any of these people would it
have been safe to assert thqt i was
jimmie shurtleff come back to life
they were all too complacently sure
that i was crumbling to dust in the
green butte cemetery i could see in
imagination the shock of surprise that
such an assertion would produce and
how it would be instantly followed by
a freeze-up of suspicion and incredulity
so i didnt attempt to make myself
known not even to judson carothers
into whose bank i dropped just before
noon ostensibly to open an account with
my money-belt wad but really to see
if the old man to whose daughter i
had been engaged wouldnt recall me
without having to be told who i was

  he didnt he looked me full in the
face and told me as all of the others
had that jimmie was dead sad very
sad mr-er-what did you say your
name was  it was a great blow almost
like losing a-er-a son in my own
case you know if you were a friend
of jimmies you will probably know
that he and my daughter were engaged
to be married

  you can judge for yourself what a
temptation it was to blurt it all out to
carothers taking all the chances of
being set down as a madman or an im-
postor apart from the fact that he
was mabels father i had always liked
him in the old days he was a harassed
little man prematurely old and gray
devoted to a frantic chase of the dol-
lar not for his own use but to keep
his wife and daughter in the swim and
sprague had told me that he was now
in deeper water for the same reason

  the temptation was strong but some-
thing kept me from yielding to it since
it was the noon hour carothers was
substituting for the receiving teller who
had gone out for his luncheon to open
an account i had to have a name and
when carothers shoved the identifica-
dead mans chance



tion book out to me for my signature
i hesitated only for a fraction of a sec-
and then signed-robert jones

  while the old man was making out
my pass book he asked me where i had
known jimmie shurtleff i told him
truly enough that i had known him in
college had eaten slept studied and
recited with him at this he evinced a
greater interest in me

  dear me he said peering through
his glasses at my freshly written signa-
ture  so you were a college classmate
of jimmies i thought as much when
you began to ask about him you are
much like him in a way too there is
a sort of resemblance about the eyes
how does it come that you didnt know
he was dead

  i-i have known very little about
him for some years i stammered

  of course he agreed we all
drift so dreadfully after the college
years but you bring your credentials
when you come as jimmies friend we
must know you better mr jones per-
haps you would like to call at the house
some evening- ute avenue wte
were all very fond of poor jimmie and
i am sure any friend of his would be
very welcome and perhaps you would
like to go to the cemetery we-that
is a few friends of jimmies mr mil-
ligan among them-had a little stone
put up so youll see that he isnt for-
gotten

  i broke away by main strength and
awkwardness after a time and was re-
called from the door to get the pass
book which in my confusion and haste
to get away i had left behind at the
second attempt to escape i bumped into
a man on the sidewalk and at a back-
ward glance i saw that it was allen
the railroad detective at first i thought
he was going to follow me but he
didnt and i wtas disappointed at that
moment i think i should keenly have
enjoyed a free fight with somebody

  sprague was at the hotel when i got

back for a late luncheon i didnt want
to talk to him or to anybody else just
then and tried to dodge but he nailed
me

  gilman told me you hadnt been in
yet and i determined to wait a few
minutes on you mr jones he said
with the boyish smile adding by
which you may infer that you are still
interesting me shall we try the cafe
again its so much more homelike
than the dining room

  i was half wild to get off by myself
somewhere to think over the fresh snarl
i had just been adding to my tangle
carotherswould be sure to speak of
me to monty would say that i had
opened an account as robert jones
would be told by monty that i was an
impostor and as an officer of the bank
would promptly raise the hue and cry

  im afraid youll have to excuse me
this time mr sprague i began but
the big-bodied chemistry expert was not
to be put off so easily

  no i shant excuse you he
laughed your face tells me that
youve been having adventure this morn-
ing and i am positively stagnating for
a little excitement beyond that i may
have something of interest to tell you
-another detective story for exam-
ple

  he was pushing me along toward the
cafe as he talked and presently i found
myself sitting opposite him at the table
we had occupied the previous evening

  ill give you my story first my
captor began after the waiter had taken
our order i think i mentioned last
evening that mr gershoms offices hap-
pen to be on the same floor of the trot-
ter building wtith my own temporary
den didnt i 

  you did

  very good they are not only on
the same floor they chance to be in the
next suite there are three rooms in
each suite and the rear one in mine-
the one t use for my workshop-has a


the vqcpulatr magazine

door communicating with the third
room of gershoms three the door
is locked of course and it has no tran-
som but the door itself must be made
of some very curious kind of wood
it has the property of transmitting
sound waves almost as clearly as the
earpiece of a telephone did you ever
hear of anything like that

  i said that i hadnt and made no
comment i was too full of my grow-
ing dilemma to understand what he was
driving at

  well it is a fact and i have often
wondered if in the strictly ethical view
of the case i oughtnt to warn ger-
shom that he hasnt any very great
degree of privacy in his third room-
which happens to be his private office
at least not when any one chances to
be occupying my workshop on the
other hand i have been arguing that
it is none of my business to guarantee
his privacy how would you look at
it

  i am not interested in gershoms
affairs i broke out irritably

  no he said inquiringly that
is a bit odd-when he seems to be so
deeply interested in yours

  i know he is i retorted he had
the nerve to come to my room last
night after i went up to go to bed
he began by calling me hard names
and wound up by pulling a gun on me
and getting himself thrown out

  ah said my table companion
the plot thickens now we may put
two and two together with a little bet-
ter grace mr gershom had a number
of callers this morning among them our
friend allen the railroad detective
with that treacherous door at my ear
i couldnt very well help overhearing
the talk mr gershom as i gathered
was offering large rewards to allen and
to others of like kidney for your scalp
mr jones for evidence of any kind
against you which would serve to clap
you in jail you are to be carefully

and systematically dogged and the first
trap you walk into will be made to snap
you by the leg

  if you have heard that much you
have heard more i said looking him
squarely in the eye

  i have was the even-toned reply
but id much rather have you tell me
about it yourself

  all right you shall have it cold i
rapped out have you ever by any
chance heard of a man named james
shurtleff

  yes indeed he was a young civil
engineer in the service of the g v 
p a cousin of gershoms and was en-
gaged to be married to miss mabel
carothers happily or unhappily as
you may choose to view it he was killed
in a railroad accident before the orange-
blossom episode came along

  what else have you heard i de-
manded

  nothing much that could concern
mr james shurtleff dead something
like a year and a half after the sad
event or to be exact on the twenty-
sixth of last december an uncle of
shurtleffs and likewise of gershoms
died in batopilas mexico leaving a con-
siderable fortune it seems that he
hadnt kept up very well with the fam-
ily history for he left his money by
will to his nephew james with a re-
version to his nephew montmorency
only in case james should no longer be
in the land of the living

  i have often wondered since how mr
calvin sprague could sit there and
calmly beat up the vinegar and oil-in
a spoon for his salad dressing while he
was telling me a thing that was equiva-
lent to sticking a lighted match into a
barrel of gunpowder

  in a flash the whole tangle so far
as monty gershom was concerned in
it straightened itself out with a snap
monty had taken my fortune as well
as my girl maybe he had believed me
to be dead but a big doubt even of

                                                    r
dead mans chance



that was beginning to loom up in the
background anyhow he had recog-
nized me in that glass-breaking instant
the night before and it had been with
deliberate criminal intent the intention
of bullying me and driving me off that
he had come to my room after his in-
terview with allen

  mr sprague i said when i could
control my voice i am going to ask
you to believe the unbelievable i am
james shurtleff

  he nodded as coolly as if i had
merely remarked that it was a pleasant
day

  of course he rejoined i had
arrived at that conclusion some little
time ago in fact i was beginning to
reach it after i had met and talked with 
you at crocketts mine some months
ago tell me the rest of it

  i did itr going over the whole thing
circumstantially from the beginning
and omitting none of the details so far
as i could recall them when i came
to the end sprague was nodding
thoughtfully

  its a beautiful case he com-
mented ati evil fate seems to have
stacked the cards on you at every turn
you snatch the wrong clothes in the
wrecked sleeper and another man gets
yours you disappear completely and
the other man wearing your clothes
with your papers in the pockets is so
badly disfigured that the clothing and
the papers are the only means of identi-
fication added to all this you suffer
a total loss of memory for two entire
years everything is supplied nothing
is lacking to make you dead and to
make you stay dead

  now that i am on this side of it it
is blankly incredible even to me i ad-
mitted desperately

  it neednt be there have been
other and similar cases of the memory
loss many years ago a sea captain
in a storm off the coast of france was
struck on the head by a falling spar
b

while he was in the act of giving an
order his skull was crushed but he
lived to be taken ashore and to become
a patient in a paris hospital perhaps
youve heard of his case

   no i rejoined

  he recovered became as well and
sane as he had been before the accident
but he suffered a complete loss of mem-
ory didnt know who he was or any-
thing about himself three years after
the accident a daring surgeon operated
on him and lifted the section of de-
pressed skull bone at the relieving of
the pressure on the brain cells the cap-
tain went on and finished the order he
had been giving three years before in
the midst of the storm

  and at this recovery he was un-
able to recall the events of the three-
year interval i asked

  completely so the three years
were a total blank the case is of
record and it excited a good bit of
comment in the medical journals of the
time however this is merely by way
of illustration your involvement is
singular but as you see it is not un-
paralleled we may dismiss the aca-
demic side of it innocently or know-
ingly your cousin has deprived you of
your fortune do you want to get it
back

  in the old days i had never cared
too much for money-big money but
now there were new motives cropping
up i wanted to help dad crockett and
if i could do it with my own money
so much the better beyond that a
-huge anger flamed up in me there
was still a possibility that monty had
not robbed me consciously when he be-
came the alternative inheritor under the
terms of uncle perkins will maybe
he did believe i was dead safely dead
and buried at the time but now he
knew i was alive and he was deter-
mined to hold on-to mabel and to
the money as well


the popular magazine

  yes i want the money i said
gratingly

 very good now we can go on
from where we left off a few minutes
ago as i was saying your cousin
has been colloguing with the detectives
to-day you are to be dogged and
driven out of green butte or perse-
cuted if you persist in staying here
i dont pretend to know what curious
twist of your mentality prompted you
to register in the hotel as robert jones
but--

  i dont know myself i interrupted

  but well credit the prompting to
your good angel if you like he went
on it was most fortunate in every
way i hope you havent been spoiling
it by going about this morning and try-
ing to make people remember you as
james shurtleff

  i told him what i had been doing
and how i had been withheld from an
nouncing my true identity even to jud-
son carothers

  more of the good angel was his
laughing comment for the time be-
ing you must continue to be robert
jones and if any one accuses you
of the shurtleff identity you must
promptly deny it

  i dont follow you now i ob-
jected

  i didnt suppose you would but i
think i can make at least two points
clear to you in the first place ger-
shom has either robbed you consciously
or he hasnt if he did it consciously
that is if he knew you were not killed
in the accident-or rather let us say
if he knew that the man who was
brought here and buried was not james
shurtleff-how are you going to prove
it

  there is only one way to prove it
conclusively i admitted that is by
making monty admit it himself

  ah yes but under the law the
poorest criminal is not required to in-
criminate himself so we are up against

obstacle number one number two is
still more insurmountable though in
another way you have absolutely
nothing by which you can tie the james
shurtleff of two yeais ago to the james
shurtleff of the present there is what
the metaphysicians call a solution of
continuity the crocketts knew you
for the greater part of the interval but
only as robert jones but a certain
other part of the interval is totally un-
accounted for james shurtleff disap-
pears at the wreck some time after-
ward a time long enough to account
for a good growth of hair on his face
a man turns up at crocketts mine forty
miles from the scene of disaster do
you see what i mean

  i did see it very clearly the record
was broken hopelessly broken it
seemed to me

  still i cant see what is to be gained
by waiting and living under an assumed
name i objected

  perhaps there isnt anything to be
gained but it can do no possible harm
on the other hand if you make an
open fight youll be defeated the
courts will refuse to give you the ben-
efit of the doubt and the chances are
that youll be branded as an impostor
and dealt with accordingly

  im all at sea i confessed what
do you advise me to do

  for the present nothing and even
less than nothing go on living quietly
here at the hotel as robert jones if
you want some ostensible reason you
have it ready to your hand you are
interested in a mine down in the juni-
pers  your business here is to interest
somebody with capital to the end that
the mine may be made productive
but where will it all end
v that is a future was the smiling
retort though you may not appre-
cite it you have enlisted the services
of the one man in green butte-but i
mustnt brag sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof
vem mans chance



  he -was rising from his chair and
i rose with him as we were leaving
the cafe he turned upon me suddenly

  did you happen to bring that brown
coat with you from dead mans
chance he asked abruptly

  i told him i had that it was up in
my room

  thats lucky he said lets go
up and get it now before somebody else
beats us to it

  i hadnt the slightest idea what he
meant but i went with him to the desk
for my key and afterward to the ele-
vator at the snapping of the key in
my room-door lock i bgan to under-
stand-just a little the room looked
as if a cyclone had hit it my grip
had been broken open and my belong-
ings were scattered all over the place

       chapter x

           mabel

  a disinterested onlooker might sug-
gest that we spent too much time over
our luncheon was spragues good-na-
tured gibe at the torn-up room evi-
dently your cousin doesnt believe in
skipping any bets suppose you take
an inventory and check up the losses

  i gathered up my scattered raiment
there wasnt much of it because i
hadnt cared to buy much in swansea
oddly enough there seemed to be noth-
ing missing though the search for what-
ever it was that the room thief had been
after had apparently been thorough

  sprague picked up the worn brown
coat which had been flung into a cor-
ner the pockets were turned out and
i saw him examining one of them with
the help of a small magnifier see
here he said on the inside of the
turned breast pocket there was the
tailors tag a bit of white cloth upon
which the lettering showed dimly i
deciphered the words while sprague
held the glass for me

made for
r jones
by z zwigler omaha

  the first and last lines were printed
but the name r jones was pen-
written in indelible ink in one corner
of the tag there was a diagonal ar-
rangement of figures that looked like
a compound fraction it was the date
the coat was made in the march of the
year of the summer wreck in two
horse gulch

  have you ever seen that before
sprague inquired

  i said no that it had never occurred
to me to examine the coat closely
sprague sat on the edge of the bed and
propped his head in his hands

  i am trying to find some logical ex-
planation of their failure to take the-
coat he said after a time the only
one that suggests itself is that they
were in so much of a hurry that they
didnt stop to read that tailors tag
but why should they take the coat 
i queried

  sprague pointed to the turned pocket
and the tag

  for that reason if for no other
consider a moment no matter what
your cousin has been believing for two
years past he knows now that you are
not dead but he also knows that a
man wearing your clothes was brought
here to green butte for burial the
deduction is plain if you escaped from
the wrecked pullman you were wearing
somebody elses clothes that tag on
a coat that looks fully old enough to
fill the bill and has its date written on
it points inferentially at least to the
man you exchanged with

  well what of it

  dont you see that tag gives us
a clew which your cousin would be
quick to remove he knows now that
some other man was buried under your
name and that if you attempt to prove
an alibi for yourself it will be highly


the cpgpulacr magazine

necessary for you to prove conclusively
the identity of the man who had
usurped your place in the green butte
cemetery this tag is your clew it
is reasonable to conclude that it would
have been destroyed if it had not been
overlooked

  you are going upon the supposition
that monty did this rummaging him-
self i offered

  quite so there was a possibility
that you might have papers or other
proofs of your identity as james shurt-
leff your cousin took the short cut to
prevent your using them he made the
search in person because he alone would
know what to look for also if the
proofs were to be found he wouldnt
care to trust the finding to anybody
else

  it was along about this time that i
began to acquire a large and growing
respect for mr calvin spragues rea-
soning machinery it ground right
along without a hitch and its output
was always as logical as a demonstra-
tion in mathematics

  you spoke of the rummagers as
they a moment ago i suggested

  of course there were doubtless two
of them-one to stand guard in the cor-
ridor while the other did the search-
ing your cousin has plenty of con-
federates he hired them this morning
he always had a mean streak in
him as a boy i am beginning now to
believe that he is a criminal with in-
tent mr sprague

  he has given one indication of it
here by overreaching himself as crim-
inals usually do just the same you
will have to be careful it is evident
that he means business he knows his
fortune is at stake and he is going to
fight for it will you wrap this coat
in a piece of paper and let me take it
with me

  i got one of the lining papers from
a bureau drawer and made a package
of the brown coat

  you dont mean to say that there is
any possibility of tracing our particular
robert jones through this thing i de-
murred

  stranger things have happened he
returned soberly you are telling
yourself that there must be some thou-
sands of robert joneses in the west-
ern hemisphere and there probably
are quite possibly too the one who
had this coat fitted in omaha is not
the only one of the name who has
bought clothing of mr z zwigler
but once in a blue moon the chapter
of accidents permits itself to be reck-
oned with three years ago while i
was crossing from denver to san fran-
cisco i made a number of acquaint-
ances in the smoking room of the pull-
man among them was a machinery
salesman by the name of robert jones
and he told me he traveled out of
omaha

  great goodness  i exclaimed do
you remember all the men you meet
in the pullman smokers 

  oh no not all of them of course
but i am blessed-or cursed as you
may choose to put it-with a fairly re-
tentive memory for names and faces
i can recall this man quite clearly per-
haps because he told me such a pitiful
story of his loss of a wife and three
children in the course of a single year
those things make an impression and
stick you know

  i had rearranged my belongings and
was ready to go down but the big
man still sat on the edge of the bed
nursing a knee in his locked hands

  there is one other small matter
he resumed looking past me at the gar-
ish figure of the wall paper while
we have a bit of real privacy perhaps
it would better be spoken of you can
snub me down if i go too far it con-
cerns the young woman in the case

  i laughed at that and told him he
might go as far as he liked
dead mans chance



  meaning that you are no longer in-
terested in that quarter

  meaning that she is wearing another
mans diamond and is probably as
deeply devoted to him as she was to
me

  that sounds a bit cynical and cyni-
cism is a poor dog in any kennel you
mustnt be too hard on miss carothers
she was sufficiently grief-stricken at
your funeral as i can assure you
you were here at that time i asked
in some surprise

  yes i had been up in the quare-
taro country making some soil surveys
for senator blount that was the year
before i went to egypt with mrs
sprague

  mabel has consoled herself i said
sticking to my text

  which is entirely justifiable in the
circumstances as you must admit you
couldnt expect her to remain a maiden
widow indefinitely and that brings
me to what i wished to say you
mustnt make the young woman suffer
for gershoms sins shurtleff if you
do im out of it

  i had no intention of doing so none
whatever

  no but you are going out to the
house to renew your acquaintance with
the family-or rather to begin another
one you tell me carothers has asked
you-and youll go

  i dont know why you should be
so certain about it when i havent yet
made up my min i myself

  thats all right i know human
nature my boy you couldnt stay
away from  ute avenue if you
should try go if you like but give
me your promise as a gentleman not
to mess or meddle with miss mabels
sentimental affair youllbe tempted
your cousin has set you the bad ex-
ample of unfair fighting and youll be
telling yourself that there is a possi-
bility-just the barest possibility-that

the girl hasnt totally forgotten james
shurtleff

  it was as true as if he had read my
thoughts moreover as you may re-
member i had already threatened
monty along that line my sense of
honor wasnt quite as keen as this big
mans but i gave a qualified promise

  i shant begin it i asserted i
am not even sure that i shall go to the
house but if i do go it will be as
robert jones

  i thought he ought to be satisfied
with that but he wasnt

  tell me one thing he adjured me
gravely are you still in love with the
girl

  i dont know i guess not

  you ought not to be he flashed
back

  why

  because during the two-year inter-
val you have been making love to an-
other girl

  that was robert jones i evaded
but how do you know

  good lord it was plain enough
i was three days at crocketts mine
but three hours or three minutes would
have told the story i am your friend
shurtleff partly because you need help
but partly also because a certain little
girl down in the junipers-a girl well
wdrth a dozen miss mabels-believes
that the sun rises and sets in you
youve got to play fair with cassie
crockett

  cassie crockett knows the whole
story and shfc sent me here-to marry
mabel if mabel should be still so
minded i replied doggedly

  of course she did that is exactly
the kind of girl she is i wish i could
be as confident of what the other one
will do

  i shook my head

  you neednt borrow any trouble
about mabel carothers mr sprague
monty has the money and for all she
knows he is likely to keep it its a


the popular magazine

mess any way you look at it i owe
mabel something for having died on
her hands if i swipe uncle perkins
legacy from the man she is intending to
marry its going to look a little like
adding insult to injury if i could
find some way of helping the crocketts
to realize on the value of dead mans
chance i dont know but id be content
to drop out and let monty keep what
he has or i should if he wasnt so
spitefully vindictive about it

  sprague grinned up at me looking
more than ever the good-natured over-
grown boy

  wait until mr montmorency ger-
shom hits you one good lick between
the eyes then youll change your mind
pretty suddenly my dear fellow all
i ask is that you wont take it out on
the girl but this wont do for me
ive got to get back to my workshop
if youre ready well go down

  sprague left me in the lobby but at
the key-returning moment he spoke to
gilman the clerk

  you want-to discharge your man
on floor five john he said quietly
he lends his master key to the wrong
people will you do that and see to
it that a trusty fellow is put on in his
place thank you

  with most of the afternoon left on
my hands i tried to carry out spragues
program-the one he had laid down
for me-scraping a few acquaintances
in the lobby to whom i could talk mines
and mining writing a long letter to
cassie crockett addressing it in care
of hobbs at swansea to be given to
crockett when the chance offered past
that i wrote to hobbs himself explain-
ing or trying to explain the disturb-
ance that allen had kicked up telling
him not too specifically how the wire
hullabaloo had grown out of a poor
joke i had tried to play on an old rail-
road man in copah

  while i was in the writing mood i
wanted to send a letter to milligan

whose probable british columbia ad-
dress had been given me by one of the
t-c r men but here my assent to
spragues demand for a complete in-
cognito got in the way and i had to
let milligan wait later at dinner time
i looked for my big-bodied friend and
when he did not put in an appearance
i ate alone wrestling like an athlete
with the temptation which was trying to
get an underhold and throw me in the
direction of ute avenue

  in the end the temptation won out
just as sprague had said it would my
swansea-bought store clothes were
hardly fit for an evening call but i had
money and there was an outfitting shop
across the street from the hotel by
eight oclock i was togged out in a
passable evening suit of the fit-you-as-
you-wait kind and was boarding an elec-
tric car for the well-remembered sub-
urb

  with all this i came mighty near
turning back from the gate of the famil-
iar two-story brick house in the avenue
the mere lifting of the latch brought
a rush of memories that sang and stung
and bit and made my heart jump and
my brain whirl but when i realized
that they were only memories i marched
up the walk and-rang the bell praying
rather desperately that judson caro-
thers himself might be the one to admit
me

  of course the prayer worked back-
ward wthen the door opened it was
mabel who turned the knob and stood
smiling up at me wit the old-time man-
melting look in her eyes instantly she
put out her hand and gave me my wel-
come

  this is mr jones isnt it she
said sweetly papa was telling us
about you at dinner about how you
had once been poor jimmie shurtleffs
closest friend come in and let me
take your coat mamma and papa have
both gone out but papa will be back
in a few minutes

across the gap

  when mabel said that her father
and mother were out i would have
givenmy new bank pass book and any-
thing else in sight for a chance to duck
and run a solitarj- tete-a-tete with
the girl who had once been my fiancee
and who was now monty gershoms
was a lot more than i had bargained
for but there was no possibility of
escape 

  i supposed of course that she would
take me into the family sitting room
and make formal company of me but
she didnt instead she led the way
through the hall to her fathers den
a cozy little snuggery which judson
carothers seldom occupied and which
had been tacitly surrendered to us two
in the courting days of that bygone
summer the evening was chilly
enough for a handful of fire in the
grate and the fire was there with two
easy-chairs wheeled out before it

  i sat in one of the chairs and held
out my hands to the bit of blaze

  this is immensely comfortable i
began dreading nothing so much as a
silence that might lead to the lord only
knew what

  yes she returned curling herself
kittenlike in the opposite chair the
nights have been remarkably cool this
summer but perhaps you have been
in green butte long enough to find that
out for yourself

  this is my first day in green butte
i hastened to say

and you came from the east

 no from the south-from the
mountains i am a mining man as i
think i told your father or perhaps i
didnt

  he didnt speak of that she said
and i saw right away that this line of
talk was going to peter out in a minute
or two and leave me stranded high and
dry

  no we talked chiefly of shurtleff
i broke in taking the plunge which i
knew must come sooner or later and
wishing very heartily that carothers and
the mother would come back and re-
lieve the hair-raising situation

  poor jimmie mabel cooed softly
with her eyes on the fire of course
you know-you have been told-

  i nodded and because there was now
no hope of wading out i plunged still
deeper i have been told some of the
circumstances but not all it was a
railroad accident wasnt it

  yes he was coming home for his
week-end it was a terrible shock
please dont make me talk about it
tell me about the jimmie you knew-
in college

  here was an opening of a sort and
i took it gladly for the better part
of an hour i told stories of college life
in which jimmie shurtleff figured as
my classmate and roommate it isnt
so frightfully hard after you once get
started-this telling of your own story
at secondhand it merely requires the
step aside and the detached point of
view which every fellow gets now and
then when he pulls up to take a look
at himself impersonally so to speak

  all through the story-telling i was
watching her as a cat watches a mouse
from first to last she sat staring into
the fire prompting me now and then
with a question and always sympa-
thetically along toward the end i
found myself talking desperately
against time the little bronze clock
on the mantel was pointing to ten min-
utes of ten would carothers and the
mother never come back

  you knew jimmie very intimately
didnt you she said when i was just
about talked to extinction on the college
score adding i know you must have
because so many of these things are
things that he told me himself years
ago then did you keep in touch
with him after you left college


the vovuultr magazine

  pretty well up to within the last
few years i replied thinking i could
go that far with safety

  i suppose we all idealize our friends
more or less after they are dead and
gone she remarked still refusing to
let me see her eyes then you have
made jimmie live again for me in this
little talk mr jones it was a perfect
idyl-our love affair i can speak
freely of it to you who knew him so
well we were both young and-and
dreadfully foolish i suppose but it was
very precious while- it lasted

  i could hardly help smiling this
was so like the mabel i knew best to
put the best foot forward and to fling
a pleasant little glamour over the past

  you have no cause for regrets i
dare say i put in boldly jimmie
shurtleff as i knew him was a good
bit of an idealist and the idealists are
never able to make much of a show as
money getters

  no she agreed with naive frank-
ness and money is so exceedingly
necessary in this world we live in jim-
mie would always have been able to
command a good salary i suppose but
nothing more

  and that isnt enough for the woman
who doesnt wish to make her own
clothes you would say i suggested

  she looked up quickly lets not
quarrel mr jones she began and
then in the turning of a leaf i saw
an instantaneous change sweep over the
pretty face the ripe red lips paled the
slate-blue eyes became fixed and star-
ing and the next thing i knew she had
faded away-fainted and fallen back
into the depths of the big chair

  now that the mischief was done i
was cool enough to be myself ajgain
in times past i had known my way
about the house and i found a pitcher
of ice water in the dining room that
and a table napkin there was a
leather-covered lounge in the fire-
lighted den and when she came to i had

her lying down and was dabbling her
face and hands with the cold water

  oh jimmie jimmie shurtleff-how
could you she murmured with her
first little gasp of returning conscious-
ness and then i knew that the mischief
was done good and plenty and with a
vengeance

  i didnt mean to i returned with
more truth than kindliness perhaps
tts the last thing on earth i meant
to do other people havent recog-
nized me and i supposed you
wouldnt

  monty has she interposed quickly
jlast evening in the inter-mountain
cafe i had the strangest feeling when
i saw you at table with that big man
mr sprague and then with a queer
little smile i dont like the beard and
i thought the enoch ardens were all
in the storybooks havent you been
dead at all 

   took my cue instantly

  t have been-and still am jimmie
shurtleff vanished something over two
years ago and from present indications
he is going to stay vanished i came
here to-night as robert jones and pres-
ently i shall go away as robert jones
i didnt come back to green butte to
smash things for you mabel

  she sat up and i gave her a dry
corner of the napkin to wipe her face

  then you dont love me any more
she queried and i saw then what i
hadnt been able to see in the more girl-
ish mabel-that no matter how many
men there were she couldnt let go her
hold upon any one of them

  that issue is out of print i told
her plainly you are promised to an-
other man and i have neither the right
nor the wish to interfere

but you have interfered she put
in promptly do you think things can
ever be the same for me as they were
before-well before this evening
im sorry if i have made them any
dead mans chance



different you are going to marry my
cousin and-

  she nodded half absently

  monty is nice to me nicer than you
were jimmie he hasnt any of your
masterful ways he lets me do just as
i please

  thats better i said

  but i am going to make you pay
for giving me such a horrid shock i
know what is the matter youve found
another girl somewhere wherever it
is youve been hiding all these years
if i wanted to i could make you forget
her

  this was still more like the mabel
i had known and i drew a good deep
breath of relief it wasnt any very
badly broken heart that was palpitating
so visibly under the cobweblike evening
thing she was wearing

  ill pay i promised trying to match
her new mood how much is it going
to cost me 

  that will depend you are going
to be awfully nice to me now that
youve come back i dont know but
what you are going to show monty that
he isnt the only man in the world after
all

  the daring audacity of such a sug-
gestion made me gasp

  but you are forgetting that monty
knows who i am i exclaimed

  no i am not that is what makes
it so deliciously exciting he knows
and he doesnt know that i know you
may continue to be mr robert jones
to me and to everybody else you know
-just as long as--well until you do
something to make me tell on you

  the thing was more than incredible
it was a nightmare that she or any
right-minded girl would want to play
fast and loose in that way with the man
she had promised to marry was unbe-
lievable

  im afraid you cant count me in on
any such deal as that i protested

  very well then i shall tell every-

body i know that you are not robert
jones at all that you are jimmie shurt-
leff come back to life you wouldnt
like that would you for some reason
best known to yourself you want to let
jimmie stay dead dont you

  yes at least for the present her
bald directness fairly buffeted the truth
out of me

  i thought so now we shall get
on better as i say you are going to
be nice to me and ill be nice to you
--so nice that when you come to think
it all over youll be sorry for me and
you wont want to spoil my life a sec-
ond time by fighting with monty

over-- the doorbell tinkled and

she sprang up hastily thats papa
and it will be better if you are just
leaving as he cornea in an engagement
that youve got to keep or something
of that sort you know you can come
again when we are all at home

  i had met judson carothers at the
door had shaken hands with him and
made my excuses and was going dowtn
the walk to the gate before i realized
how deftly mabel had shunted me out
of the way but for another reason
than her fathers home-coming as it
presently appeared my escape was
made none too soon as i turned the
corner toward the car tracks an auto-
mobile came tearing up the avenue to
stop with a squeal of the brakes at
the carothers gate there were three
men in it when it passed me and two
of them jumped out almost before the
car had come to a stand the two
made a quick rush for the gate and
the street arc lamp identified them for
me they were allen and my cousin
montmorency allen had shadowed me
and had gone to fetch his principal

  there was no electric car in sight
when i reached the other street and i
walked on townward meaning to let
the car overtake me my head was in
a good bit of a whirl yet and i was
trying as best i could to fit the mabel


the popular magazine

i had just left with the girl i had
known-or thought i had known-on
the other side of the big gap when a
thought came to fairly knock the breath
out of me

  in a flash i saw what her sudden
change of mood had meant what she
herself had meant in that last sentence
which had been broken by the ringing
of the doorbell she knew that uncle
perkins money had been left to me and
not to monty and she was going to
play her hand for all it was worth to
keep me from taking the money away
from the man she was going to marry

chapter xii

at the athletic club

  when i met sprague at the breakfast
table on the morning following my ad-
venture in ute avenue he asked me no
questions and i told him no lies later
he introduced me to a man named
hughes a fine upstanding young fel-
low in charge of one of the govern-
ment reclamation schemes in the north-
ern part of the state

  this is the gentleman i was telling
you about last night gordie said
sprague to my new acquaintance
carry him off to camp with you if
you like and show him whats in your
mind about that juniper project

  the government engineer laughed
are you good for a few hours on a
broncho mr jones he asked looking
me over as i thought at the time
rather curiously

  i said i was but that i wasnt sure
my business in green butte would sanc-
tion a vacation just then

  sprague gave me a glance that was
as full of meaning as a nut is of meat

  that is exactly the point he put
in you are applying yourself too
closely to business a few days in the
hills will do you a world of good

  i understood by this that for some
one or another of his inscrutable rea-

sons he wanted to get me out of the
city for a time and that the suggestion
was in fact an order to go hughes
backed it up cordially and after i had
given a sort of halting consent he went
out to order the horses sprague broke
it off short with me when we were alone
together

  you are quite right he said read-
ing my thoughts as usual for a num-
ber of reasons i want to get you out
of the way for a few days take your
trip and have a good time with gordie
who is of the salt of the earth give
me an even week and then come back

  i grinned i never was much of a
hand at playing blindmans buff i
said cant you give me a hint

  two of them if you like i need
time ive got to have time i dont
want you around under foot with your
handsome cousin feeling for a grip on
your windpipe while i work-it dis-
tracts me ive set a rumor afloat that
youve taken a job with the government
and are going out with hughes that
will serve to kill off the shadow busi-
ness for the moment

  i see i said

  the other hint is strictly personal
to you hughes is likely to have charge
as chief of construction of the recla-
mation project in the junipers hes
got a notion in his head that may ap-
peal to you get him to talk about it
hell do it when he finds out that you
have put in two years at dead mans
chance

  if i wondered a little at what mabel
would think of my sudden drop-out i
didnt let it worry me in fact i was
rather glad than sorry that i was going
to be safely out of her reach for a few
days a fool man is a mighty curious
proposition where a woman is con-
cerned knowing as well as i wanted
to know anything that mabel was go-
ing to play a deep little game of her
own with uncle perkins money for
the stakes i wasnt at all sure that
dead mans chance



she wouldnt contrive to make me sit
in with her-with my eyes wide open

  an hour farther along hughes and
i had taken the northward road to-
gether and we gave the bronchos a loose
rein all day with a single stop for horse
bait and a bite to eat at a ranch house
nightfall found us at the reclamation
camp and i was given the freedom of
the outfit with the privilege which
i hadnt enjoyed for many a day of
sitting in at a camp-fire circle with a
bunch of men of my own trade and
swapping stories over the tobacco it
was good to be in the swing of it again
and when the time came for bunks and
blankets i slept the sleep of the just
and the weary

  with such an auspicious beginning
my vacation week went on wings
hughes had a considerable problem on
his hands in the dam building and i
put in the days most of them on the
job with the staff enjoying every min-
ute of the time mail came from green
butte every two or three days but there
was nothing for me nothing to break
the spell of the wholesome change to
the clear sane atmosphere of the great
hills it was not until my last night
at the camp after we had outsat all the
other members of the mess at the smoke
fire that hughes spoke of the junipers
and his notion

  sprague tells me you have spent a
couple of years on cryolite creek-
and he probably told you i was to have
the job of construction on the caliente
project was the way he began he
also mentioned the fact that you were
interested in crocketts mine

  i looked up quickly and caught him
as i had a number of times before re-
garding me curiously

  you know crocketts mine i said

  instead of answering he looked
straight at me and said ive been let-
ting you take your own time for a wteek
dont you remember me

  i knew at once that it must be an-

other of the jones lapses but of
course i was perfectly helpless

  ought i to remember you  i
asked

  he took time to consider i dont
know as you ought he qualified at
length its nothing very singular if
you dont lets let it go and get back
to crockett and his mine you are
interested arent you

  yes i rejoined but only as a
friend of crocketts hes got a big
thing in the chance but its safely bot-
tled up as you know-no transporta-
tion

  the engineer nodded were in the
same fix on the irrigation project but
there is a profitable scheme in sight if
i could only find and convince some
practical railroad engineer who could
influence a little capital its this way
weve got to have material a lot of it
cement steel dimension timber to say
nothing of our machinery our near-
est railroad point would be laputo on
the p s-w sixty miles away by the
trail over the range or forty-two miles
through coyote canon

  i know the canon i volunteered
i ran a preliminary survey through it
about four years ago for mr ford
president of the p s-w

  the dickens you did hughes ex-
claimed then it was your stakes that
we found last summer

  yes mr ford was negotiating at
the time for the purchase of a coal field
in the little junipers but the deal fell
through-some trouble about the land
titles i believe

  ive got you going said hughes
exultantly could you interest mr
ford again in that coal proposition

  i dont know maybe i could
why

  because the department investiga-
tions have cleared that title muddle up
and the coal lands are for sale at a bar-
gain

  lay out your scheme


the cpovulacr magazine

  its this to get our material in for
the dam at caliente wed have to build
a wagon road through coyote canon
a very little more work would make
it a practicable grade for a narrow-
gauge railroad the railroad could tap
the coal field at chipeta and from dead
mans chance to chipeta a hauling road
or an overhead transmission line would
provide an outlet for crocketts ore

  by jove--i believe youve got it
i exclaimed then my enthusiasm went
out as suddenly as it had flared up
either a wagon road or a bucket line
from chipeta will take a pot of money
and crockett hasnt any neither have
i

  the young government man looked
up quickly

 i must have misunderstood
sprague he remarked i thought
you were well fixed

  oh no i replied im only a
workingman like yourself but i can
pull for your railroad anyhow ill
write mr ford as soon as i get back
to the butte

  thats mighty good of you he re-
turned heartily we government men
are handicapped in that field you know
we cant turn a wheel when it comes
to promoting a private enterprise even
when the enterprise is going to serve
us more than it will anybody else and
perhaps the mine matter will dovetail
in somehow when we get the railroad
also perhaps the day will come some
time when youll remember where you
saw me last pipe out shall we turn
in its getting pretty late-for a pair
of workingmen

  i left the camp in the hills the next
morning at daybreak and hughes was
up to see me off there was nothing
more said about the caliente railroad
project or about the other thing but
nothing more needed to be said
hughes promised to see me again be-
fore long in green butte and so my

vacation ended and i took the return
road to civilization

  having made such an early start i
reached town by the middle of the
afternoon returned the hired horse to
the livery stable and went to the hotel
to get a bath in the lobby i found
sprague he was writing at one of
the small desks in an alcove but he
got up and came across to the counter
while i was shaking hands with gil-
man

  back again are you  he said cheer-
fully feeling pretty fit after your
week in the open thats good gor-
die hughes is a fine fellow as im sure
you have discovered for yourself by
this time youre pointing for a bath-
tub i suppose ive ridden that trail
a few times and i know how dusty it
is wouldnt you enjoy a good swim
just about now

  sure if i could find a tub big
enough to swim in i laughed ive
been eating dirt since five oclock this
morning

  would you really enjoy it-the
swim i mean if you would just send
your bag upstairs and come along with
me over to the athletic ill put you
up as my guest and well take a dip
weve got the finest swimming pool
this side of the missouri river

  it struck me as being a sort of an
odd invitation to be extended to a man
just in from a hard trip but my short
acquaintance with mr calvin sprague
had led me to look for oddities in him
i said something about taking a bath
first and going with him afterward but
he overrode the suggestion with his
usual genial masterfulness and the up-
shot of the thing was that i went with
him to the athletic which was only
two blocks away and around the corner

  on the way the big-bodied one talked
a blue streak asking me a thousand
questions about hughes and his work
and the kind of a time i had had and
never by any chance giving me an atom
deav mans chance



of a show to wedge in a question about
how things had been going on in green
butte during my absence at the club
it was the same way we chatted for
a few minutes with the man at the
desk while sprague was registering me
and presently got a couple of locker
keys and went down to the big gymna-
sium

  while we were stripping in the locker
room i had a small revelation sprague
was such a whale of a man that i had
gotten the idea that he was fat he
wasnt i dont believe there was an
ounce of superfluous fat on him he
was simply the picture of an athletic
giant whipped and corded with great
muscles that stood out in rolls and folds
all over him

  gosh i said in honest admira-
tion you are certainly a mans man
mr sprague did you ever play foot-
ball 

  played on the team four years and
coached two more he laughed thats
why i hitch up to an athletic club
wherever i happen to be stopping over
i like to keep myself fit

  i used to play myself i remarked
sbut i guess i never was in your class
yet you made a very creditable rec-
ord that game you played with indi-
ana in your last year wasnt anything
to be ashamed of

  what do you know about the indi-
ana game i queried

  not much about the game maybe
but a good bit about you was the
smiling rejoinder you see ive had
a full week in which to get a line on
you since we had our last talk are
you ready bet you a dollar i beat
you to the lower end of the pool

  his splash into the ninety-foot basin
was like the fall of a house and he
did beat me in the race for the dollar
by two good lengths we had a glori-
ous swim i was in fairly good con-
dition myself but this whale of a man
could do all the stunts that i could

and then some after a half hour of
it i climbed out glowing sprague ral-
lied me a bit on cutting it so short but
he followed me to the shower room and
was only a step or so behind me when
we went back to the lockers

  i was toweling myself vigorously
when the singular thing happened
sprague had been whipping his back
with a clubbed bath towel and was
diving into his locker for his clothes
suddenly the rather dark basement
room was flooded with a blinding light
and there was the snap and hiss of a
small explosion

  catch that beggar roared my com-
panion and when i spun around i saw
the curious spectacle of the big man
still stripped to the buff dodging in
and out among the rows of lockers ap-
parently in eager pursuit of somebody

  the pursuit was seemingly fruitless
since sprague came back in a minute
or so panting and laughing

  wasnt that the nerviest thing you
ever heard of  he gasped

  i dont know yet what it was 
returned

  somebody took a flash-light snap-
shot of us possibly for some sort of
an advertisement of before and after
taking or something of that sort i
call it pretty cold nerve theyll
change the faces of course but even
at that it was an outrage

  i took my turn with the laugh who-
ever did the thing wasnt after me it
was my gigantic companions picture
that was wanted

  im safely out of it-with my face
at any rate i chuckled the flash
came from somewhere behind me
youll take it up with the club mana-
ger 

  ill do better than that ill lay it
before the board of governors at the
next meeting its a pretty how de do
if a man cant bring a friend here for
a quiet little swim without running the
risk of getting his picture an naturel


the pocpulair magazine

into some yellow newspaper i never
heard of such a thing

  he was still fuming only half good-
naturedly i fancied over the snapshot
incident when we passed out through
the club office though he said nothing
of it to the manager but on the way
back to the hotel he broke out laugh-
ing and showed me a pocket camera

  it isnt so bad as it might have been
he explained the fellow dropped his
box in his hurry to get away and i
captured it thats why it didnt seem
worth while to say anything to the
manager come around to my work-
shop this evening after dinner and well
develop the film and see what he got
fine swim wasnt it well do it again
the next hot day that comes along
then with a nod to a young fellow in
brown duck and a cowboy hat who was
passing i quit you here ive got
a little work to do before dinner see
you in the cafe at half past six if
ybu beat me to it just reserve our
corner table so long

ttte calm light of reason

  sprague was on hand to share the
cafe dinner with me as he had prom-
ised to be and as on a previous occa-
sion we secured a corner table with
a fair degree of privacy

  youll have a very natural curiosity
to know whats been going on in your
absence was the way my enlighten-
ment began after the waiter had taken
our order but by way of an appe-
tizer before the full meal i hope youll
let me say that you did an extremely
foolish thing on the evening preceding
the day when i hustled you into the
background with gordie hughes
calling on the carotherses you
mean i queried

  calling on miss mgbel carothers
and letting her discover your identity
he said definitively

  how do you know she discovered
me i demanded

  if you had specialized in chemistry
in your technical course you wouldnt
ask such a question as that he re-
turned in jocular reproach one of
the first things an analyst learns is not
to let any step in the experiment process
go unnoted never mind the means in
the present instance let it be sufficient
to say that i do know a witness who
could have no motive for distorting the
facts was looking in at a convenient
window when the lady fainted and you
went to get a pitcher of ice water 

  call it a bad break on my part and
ill admit it i put in

  it was imprudent to say the least
and it had prompt consequences your
cousin was on the spot almost imme-
diately after you left the house

  i saw him drive up in an auto with
allen i said

  ekactly your cousin is a man of
some considerable acuteness he knew
you had been there and i fancy he was
able to draw his own conclusions as to
what had happenec you cant blame
him much if he took it as a bold chal-
lenge an open declaration of war on
your part up to this time he had been
content to set spies upon you meaning
to prosecute you as an impostor if you
should declare yourself but that very
night changed his plans

  did your telephonic door tell you
so i inquired

  it did said the big-bodied one with
his grave smile there was another
late-hour conference in the private office
which has no privacy i was in my
workroom thinking-in the dark i
can always think better with the lights
turned off there were four men talk-
ing in the adjoining room your cousin
two others whom i took to be operators
from a private-dfetective agency and
allen your cousin opened the discus-
sion by saying that he now had proof
that you were a dangerous criminal and
dead mans chance



that you must be brought to justice be-
fore you had a chance to do any more
harm

  pro bono publico of course i
laughed

  oh certainly he didnt hint that
he had any personal interest in the mat-
ter farther than to say that you were
preparing to impose upon some friends
of his allen immediately reverted to
your sale of the ore at the swansea
smelter and gave it as his conviction
that you had boldly stolen the rich sam-
ples from crockett that would be
grand larceny and if hobbs the smelter
man could be persuaded to swear out
a warrant you could be arrested and
taken to arroyo county for trial

  but in that case it would be crock-
etts quarrel and not hobbs i inter-
posed

  the smelter company would be lia
ble if it paid you money without a
proper authorization from crockett and
it would do the prosecuting your
cousin accepted allens view and
jumped at the chance of laying you by
the heels not doubting for a moment
it seems that you were really guilty
of the ore theft the two private de-
tectives were to keep you under sur-
veillance and allen was to make a quick
trip to swansea to see hobbs and get
him to start the legal machinery

  whereupon you decided that it
would be prudent to get me out of town
for a while i suggested

  sprague nodded for that and for
other reasons i wished to have an un-
interrupted week he said we have
agreed you and i mr shurtleff that
you are not a criminal but not to let
the enemy get a touchdown on us i
sent a trustworthy young fellow down
the railroad to ride in to crocketts
from the nearest point on the burnt
hills extension my emissary and
allen your cousins returned on the
same train last evening and now we
know exactly what we are up against

  which is the little end of nothing
of course i put in crockett gave
me the ore outright and hobbs
wouldnt swear out a warrant unless
he kjiew wht he was doing

  again the big-bodied expert gave me
a glimpse of the grave smile flickering
at the corners of his eyes

  your reasoning isnt at fault but it
doesnt take into account the perversity
of that thing which our forefathers used
to call fate he rejoined allen in-
terviewed hobbs and the smelter man-
ager very properly refused to take any
action until he had communicated with
crockett a range rider was sent in
over the trail with a letter to crockett
and allen waited at swansea for the
reply hobbs messenger and the
young fellow i had sent in by way of
the burnt hills trail reached crock-
etts mine on the same day and they
both made a rather astounding discov-
ery the mine mouth was bulkheaded
the cabin was locked and the place was
deserted

  crockett and cassie gone i gasped
where for goodness sake

  there wasnt anything to indicate
where they were gone or for what pur-
pose  the mine was posted with a
proper notice and that was all my
young man was prudent enough not to
betray his purpose in visiting dead
mans chance he told the other mes-
senger that he had just happened along
they rode out together over the swan-
sea trail my young man-his name is
tarbell and he was the window watcher
who saw miss mabel faint when she
recognized you that evening a week ago
-made himself invisible in the smelter
town and saw and heard what went on
after hobbs range rider had made his
report

  go on i pressed impatiently

  allen being the garden variety of
detective jumped at once to a conclu-
sion which was not altogether unwar-
ranted you had sold a lot of valuable


the cpocpulacr magazine

samples and had decamped with the
money the range riders discovery
made it more than probable that there
was a double murder behind the ore
theft hobbs was urged to take action
at once so that you could be held on
the charge of theft while the disappear-
ance of the old miner and his daughter
was being investigated

  heavens  i ejaculated that man
allen has missed his vocation hes a
freak

  my table companions smile was
wholly lenient

  suspicion is the stock in trade of
the allens you must remember he
went on it never occurs to them that
the reasoning ability is the only one
which counts for much in the detection
of crime but to continue hobbs was
in a dilemma without more than half
accepting allens view of the case he
allowed himself to be overpersuaded
the warrant for your arrest was sworn
out and allen has brought it here with
him

  its absurd-a ridiculous mares-
nest i protested

  easy my dear boy we musnt emu-
late mr cornelius allens ready facility
for jumping to conclusions was the
big mans caution suppose the crock-
etts cant be found you didnt mur-
der them to be sure and we hope no-
body else has but if they cant be
promptly located your cousins purpose
will be handsomely served you will
be held in jail in an out-of-the-way
county and he will have time to marry
miss carothers turn his green butte
property into money and lose himself
and the money in the big crowd

  i saw at once that this cool-headed
giant was right monty had but to
press the button and the law would do
the rest the facts were all against me
i had sold the ore on my own say-so
and allen and the old scotch yard-
master mccormack would swear that

i had tried to change my identity and
my name the very next iay in copah

  well said sprague when the si-
lence had grown overlong

  i guess im backed into a comer
i said i dont see why monty doesnt
pull the string and spring his trap
what is he waiting for

  up to this afternoon he has been
telling himself that he was merely wait-
ing for you to return from hughes
camp the trap is ready and as i
happen to know allen is growing a bit
impatient

  well why doesnt monty get a
move i persisted

  for the third time sprague let me
see the grave smile

  every man has his limitations my
dear boy and your cousin is no ex-
ception to the general rule i told you
on a former occasion that he had given
one evidence of criminality by over-
shooting the mark within the past two
days he has given another and even
more convincing proof that his hands
are not entirely clean the psalmist
would class him as on of those who
are afraid of the arrow that flieth by
day

  what do you mean by that

  just this mr montmorency ger-
shom has learned from various and
sundry sources that somebody is look-
ing up his record tracing him step by
step through the mazes of a somewhat
devious path that he chose to walk in
on a certain mournful occasion two
years in the past he is like a man
with his finger on the firing key of a
loaded mine which may have ramifica-
tions entirely unknown and unsus-
pected  which may possibly shoot the
wrong way when the spark is applied
in other words youve been scar-
ing him out i suggested

   something of that sort maybe just
the barest hint you know to be en-
tirely frank with you there is no evi-
dence against him-not a shred rea-
dead mans chance



son the calm logic which disentagles
a knot thread by thread or fiber by
fiber if need be is the only enemy he
needs to fear if he has committed
any criminal act in the past i can as-
sure you definitely that it can never be
legally proved against him save by his
own confession

  you are miles beyond me now i
protested cant you put it in words
of one syllable

  no but i can put it in a sentence
every discovery that has ever been
made has been based upon a hypothesis
previous to the discoveiy somebodys
mind has groped out ahead in the dark-
ness feeling for the facts which his
reason has told him must exist is that
clear 

  perfectly

 very good i have formed a
hypothesis based upon the knowledge
that within certain well-defined lines
the human mind moves from cause to
effect almost mechanically in other
words if there is a certain object to
be accomplished ninety-nine men out of
a hundred will go about it in the most
obvious way one step leading logically
to the next and so on to he end
really it is only the starting point
which is hypothetical in the tracing of
these steps reason itself carries the
processon once it is given the tracing
thread

  you have discovered what monty
did two years ago

  no i have merely projected his line
of action as a logical supposition thus
far there is no evidence that he did any
of the things i am supposing him to
have done and yet the line of reasoning
is so clear that i am perfectly convinced
that he did do them

  and what have you learned about
me i inquired

all that i needed to know when
you come into your fortune or if you
come into it you will have a good-sized
telegraph bill to pay with possibly some
b

 other expenses which neednt be par-
 ticularized now

  did you succeed in tracing the
 brown coat

   easily it was made for the robert
 jones whom i once met in a pullman
 smoking room as i have related-the
 machinery salesman and that isnt all
 singularly enough this same robert
 jones disappeared with the omaha tai-
 lors bill for the brown suit still un-
 paid it seems something over two years
 ago and has never been heard of
 since

   and no search was made for him
 oh yes a rather earnest search
 like many traveling salesmen he had
 authority to make collections for his
 house at the time of his disappear-
 ance he had several hundred dollars of
 the companys money in his possession
 he was last heard of going west on the
 tp s-w and though he had always
 borne a good reputation his employers
 reluctantly concluded that he had
 yielded to temptation of some sort and
 had left the country with the money
 though the sum was so small as to make
 the conclusion almost untenable

   robert jones is buried in my own
 personal grave and the money was
 doubtless burned in the sleeping car
 katinka i said

   even so said sprague but my
 investigation did not stop quite as short
 as the one which was instituted two
 years ago by the omaha machinery
 company when the proper moment
 arrives we can prove that a man an-
 swering jones description and even
 bearing jones name since he wired
 ahead from a town in the southern part
 of the state for his reservation boarded
 the sleeping car katinka at copah on
 the night of the disaster

   the leisurely dinner was over and
 sprague was fingering one of the huge
 black cigars

   id like to stay and smoke with you


the voular magazine

he said but i cant this evening i
have another engagement

  but you havent told me yet what
im to do i put in leaning upon him
as i think all men did when they came
to know him

  i am trusting confidently in that
small limitation of your cousins he
remarked with the good-natured
chuckle sooner or later he will ac-
quire the courage of his convictions and
hit out at you but he hasnt acquired
it yet go along quietly in your own
way and dont give yhim any fresh
provocation i need a few days more
and after that perhaps we can make a
small move of our own i think thats
all for the present

  we parted in the lobby sprague say-
ing nothing further about his offer to
take me to his laboratory to see the
snapshot film developed left to my-
self i was minded to go to bed early
with the long ride from hughes to ac-
count for three-fourths of it it had been
a rather strenuous day

  going across to the clerks desk for
my key i found an envelope in my box
secured and opened it proved to be the
cover of a note from mabel the note
was undated but the freshness of the
ink showed that it had been lately writ-
ten this is what i read

  you are not keeping youi part of the bar-
gain i saw you on the street this afternoon
with mr sprague there is to be a little
dance this evening at butte springs and i
am inclosing an invitation which i have per-
suaded mrs calthrope to give me for you
dont you think youd better come and make
your peace with me

  the note was signed m and as i
have said was without date or super-
scription i thought it over for a mo-
ment it was plainly a small dare i
knew the mrs calthrope bunch cal-
thrope was the president of the secu-
rity bank and while the set with which
his wife and daughters used to go was
not exactly what would be called fast
it was given somewhat-or it used to

be in my time-to late suppers and auto-
mobile parties and road-house dances

  mabel had run with this set more
or less in the old days and it had
adopted monty right from the jump
it had had small use for a working en-
gineer on the railroad but mabel had
dragged me into it now and then in
spite of all i could do i realized that
she was trying to drag me in again and
quite probably for some selfish purpose
of her own with spragues story and
his caution still ringing in my ears i
ought to have had more sense than to
think of taking mabels dare but it
is not only little children who are fond
of playing with forbidden fire at the
end of it l went upstairs to change my
clothes

  half an hour later i was back at
gilmans desk asking him to get me a
cab ninety-nine times out of a hun-
dred there would have been no mention
made of the purpose for which i wanted
the cab but luckily for me this proved
to be the hundredth time

  just for a town drive gilman
asked and i said no i want to go
to butte springs

  the rig i got was a taxi a few min-
utes later the mongrel motor car was
whirling me out of town on the springs
road and i was in for whatever lay
in front of me going at it bullheaded
and telling myself easily that monty
knowing me for what i really was
wouldnt dare to spring his trap

   but as it turned out the only sensible
thing i had done since parting with
sprague was that telling to gilman
where it was that i wanted the taxi to
take me-and that was merely a hap-
pen-so

chapter xiv

at butte springs tavern

  butte springs tavern a wayside
clubhouse summer resort in the hills
behind the outpost mountain which
gives the city of green butte its official
dead mans chance



name was-is yet for that matter-a
big rambling house with broad porches
and a spreading roof to give it the ap-
pearance of an overgrown bungalow

  though it was no later than nine
oclock when my hired taxi set me down
at the porch step mrs calthropes
dancing party had already taken pos-
session in force there were a good
many automobiles in the pine-groved
yard and the big brilliantly lighted
clubhouse was overflowing the over-
flow showing up in groups and couples
mixing and mingling under the chinese
lanterns on the porches

  telling my driver to consider himself
engaged for the evening i was making
my way to the door when i saw mabel
in one of the porch groups she saw
me at the same instant and came up as
i was giving my coat and card to the
man at the door

  i thought you would come she
said giving me her hand and a bright
smile to go with it then still wear-
ing that dreadful beard

  yes and still answering to the name
of jones i reminded her

  i dont like either the beard or the
name she retorted with a pout of the
pretty lips but if youll keep your

promise to be nice to me-

  the interruption was the upcoming of
a-man who had separated himself from
a little knot of cigarette smokers at the
porch rail i felt rather than saw that
it was monty mabel rose to the re-
quirements without so much as the
quickened quiver of an eyelash

  monty she said sweetly let me
introduce you to mr robert jones the
gentleman who was your cousin jim-
mies most intimate friend in college
mr jones this is mr montmorency
gershom

  notwithstanding all that may be said
to the contrary civilization and the
common conventions have really done a
little something for us in the way of
toning down- the purely barbaric im-

pulses montys nod wasnt very cor-
dial to be sure and we didnt shake
hands or pat each other on the back
but i doubt if the most observant of
bystanders would have taken us for a
pair of sworn enemies each feeling fig-
uratively for the others throat

  mabel made talk out of nothing for
a minute or two and i helped out as i
could monty said nothing and i could
see a malignant little devil in his eyes
watching us both to mark the first slip
that might betray either of us i must
admit that mabel carried it off splen-
didly with a cool daring i had never
in the older days suspected her of pos-
sessing

  i want you two to be real good
friends she hubbled especially you
monty mr jones is a stranger in
green butte and you know everybody
he has a claim on us for poor dear
jimmies sake you know then she
excused herself lightly to gershom and
laid a hand on my arm let me take
you in atid start you right with mrs
calthrope and the honorees mamma
isnt here but that doesnt matter in our
own set and monty didnt stab me in
the back as we turned away which may
count one more for the humanizing in-
fluences of our day and generation

  in the big reception hall mabel did
the honors with as neat a grip on her-
self as she had shown in that perfectly
volcanic situation on the porch to
mrs calthrope and her daughters i was
presented as a lifelong friend of poor
dear jimmies you know and when
monty -came in a few minutes later
with a cast-iron smile on his handsome
face and bloody murder in his eyes i
had been cleverly passed on to one of
the calthrope cousins who was trying
to find a vacant number for me on her
dancing card

  i called it a little respite and made
the most of it knowing blessed well that
mabel wasnt through with me yet that
she hadnt taken the trouble to get me


the cpocpulacr magazine

out to butte springs merely to give me
a chance to shake a leg on the clubhouse
dancing floor things went on smoothly
enough for a while the calthrope
cousin gave me one dance and a young
woman whose name i lost the minute
after it was handed to me gave me two
more there were familiar faces
aplenty and some few of the names i
remembered as those of people whom
i had met on the other side of the big
gap but there was never a gleam of
recognition for me or rather for poor
dear jimmie in any eye that met mine

  i noticed that mabel danced with
mont just often enough to take the
curse off-their engagement being an-
nounced he paid no attention to me
looking straight over my head if we
happened to meet but the malignant
devil was still lurking in his eyes when-
ever i managed to get a sight of them
and before long i began to wish myself
safely out of this fresh and wholly
unnecessary tangle into which i had
walked with my eyes wide open

  a little farther along i had a shock
like that of a small boy caught with his
fingers in the sugar bowtl when i saw
sprague shaking hands with mrs cal-
thrope and apparently apologizing for
his late arrival in the circumstances
he was about the last man on earth
that i cared to meet since i vas ex-
pressly disobeying his instructions sos
being without a partner at the mo-
ment i slipped through one of the open
french windows to the porch

  i didnt mean to make the dodging
retreat a gumshoe proceeding but i
guess it figured that way for the couple
occupying a porch seat just beyond a
big potted shrub flanking the open win-
dow the two were mabel and monty
and they were talking about me it
didnt seem prudent to show myself and
i couldnt go back without taking a
chance of running into sprague so i
stood still and made believe i wasnt
playing the eavesdropper willingly

  i tell you mabel i know what i
am talking about my cousin was in-
sisting angrily the- man is a double-
dyed scoundrel he hadnt been in
town six hours before he was trying
to play a confidence game on me and
it was bolder than the one he is play-
ing on you and your father

  he hasnt been trying to get any
money out of us was the calm reply

  he is working the social graft on
you monty gritted you say he
poses as one of jimmies college friends
what would you say if i should tell
you that he braced me with a threat to
produce jimmie himself alive and well
if i didnt make it worth his while not
to

  i should find it rather hard to be-
lieve

  its true by some underhanded
means he has learned a lot about jimmie
and about uncle perkins will he is a
thief a blackmailer and quite possibly
a murderer i dont want you to have
anything more to do with him

  how would he go to work to pro-
duce jimmie when we all know that
poor jimmie has been dead and buried
for more than two years the girl
asked apparently ignoring the crimi-
nalizing epithets

  im no mind reader i cant tell what
infernal fairy tale he has got up his
sleeve  was the impatient retort but
i wouldnt put it beyond him to im-
personate jimmie himself if he thought
he could scare me into being black-
mailed such things have been done
and in a new country like this it isnt
so easy to show an impostor up all
the people who knew jimmie best-his
railroad friends and the like-have left
town and if this fellows got a story
ingenious enough to make it appear that
jimmie is alive when we all know he
has been dead and buried for over two
years he might make a horrible scan-
dal if he couldnt do anything worse
you mean that he might take the
dead mans chance



property matter into the courts came
in the low voice of the girl

  yes only he isnt going to get that
far along

  in that case they would be sure to
call upon me wouldnt they theyd
say that i would know the real jimmie
shurtleff if anybody would

  certainly they would i shouldnt
wonder if that is why hes trying to
make up to you now hes getting
pointers on the way things stood be-
tween you and jimmie in the old days
so that he may throw them into your
face on the witness stand

  there was silence for a moment and
then the girls voice came again

  you are a foolish boy monty dear
i believe you are more than half afraid
that this mr jones might bully me into
believing that he really is jimmie shurt-
leff come back to life

  there was another silence and i fan-
cied monty broke it only under com-
pulsion 

  i cant tell what youll do no man
can ever tell what a woman will do
you played it pretty fine that night a
week ago after this fellow had called
on you but you didnt more than half
fool me mabel you were holding
something back and i knew it tell
me plainly didnt jones try to make
you believe that he was jimmie

  he did not the answer was posi
tive and unhesitating

  thats good as far as it goes you
mustnt believe it no matter what he
says or does

  it all seems very absurd-his threat
to you and your fear that he might
possibly carry it out said the girl
how could he have any chance at all
if he wasnt telling the truth

  he wouldnt take a dead mans
chance he doesntseem to know that
jimmie always went clean shaven
there is a slight resemblanceabout the
eyes as you may have noticed if he
should take off his beard tell a plausible

story and talk long enough and loud
enough he might get a good many peo-
ple to believe in him and we both know
sheeplike human nature well enough to
be sure that he would get some ill
be frank with you mabel girl when
i saw all the possibilities  how he might
drag you into court and all that i-i
offered him money to go away he
wanted more-too much more and
when i refused he threw me down and
choked me it was in his room at the
hotel

  my legs were getting pretty tired
and every muscle in my body was ach-
ing from the sustained effort to efface
myself in the shadow of the potted
shrub but i couldnt have moved if my
life had depended upon it man and
boy as i had known him monty had
always had a yellow streak in him but
he was breaking all the records now

  you wouldnt let him fool you he
couldnt possibly fool you could he
he went on you saw jimmie when
they brought him here for the funeral
and you know he is dead

  i know that you are a foolish boy
also that your name is on minnie will-
sides card for this next dance was
the temporizing rejoinder and then they
got up to go in

  for a second i was half paralyzed
for fear they would come around the
potted plant and so catch me red-
handed but they went the other way
but before they were out of earshot i
heard montys final confidence

  now that ive told you so much ill
tell you a little more he said lowering
his voice jones is a criminal and i
have the proof he has stolen from a
man down in the juniper country and
there is a warrant out for his arrest
there is also good reason to believe that
he committed murder to make the theft
possible you will probably see a no-
tice of his arrest in to-morrow morn-
ings paper

  i guess there is a good deal erf hu-


the popular magazine

man nature in all of us at first i had
been rather sorry for monty sorry that
it was going to come in my way to
claim the fortune that had really been
left to me but now i was glad just
plain humanly glad that it was up to
me to put him out of the game

  there wasnt any sentiment about it
not an atom i saw mabel for pretty
much what she was-neither all bad nor
all good just an ambitious little beauty
who was cold-blooded enough to make
sure that her nest was going to be well
feathered-and the sight sent every
thrilling love nerve in me scuttling into
space to whatever corner of it was
holding the girl who had been too hon-
orable to listen to a love word which
migh possibly be due another woman

  i wanted to be away from it all to
be back in the peaceful mountains to
be sitting on the big flat bowlder at
dead mans chance with cassie and
telling her that her sacrifice and mine
were as unnecessary as a new ordering
of the stars in the heavens with that
fiying-away-to-be-with-you-love idea in
my head i stepped down from the
porch and strolled across the bit of
greensward to the pines only one side
of the grove was given up to the parked
cars at the other side there were
rustic seats and paper lanterns hung in
the trees

  i dropped into one of the seats and
was feeling in my pockets for a cigar
when i heard a faint swish of clinging
skirts when i looked up the house
lights blinded me then a whiff of the
perfume i had known so well in the
other years came to my nostrils and i
twisted around quickly to find mabel
sitting beside me in the tree-shadowed
half of the rustic seat

chapter xv

the woman of it

  with the poorest possible ear for
music i shall never hear that particular
piece the dance orchestra was playing

without getting a sharp memory picture
of a starlit night in a pine grove and a
girl sharing a rustic seat with me and
a mingled fragrance of pines and
crushed violets making the still night
air heavy and half intoxicating

  do you know you havent asked me
for a single dance this whole evening
was the way mabel began on me

  i laughed and said that i didnt know
i was expected to

  she turned to face me in her end of
the wooden seat

  i wouldnt be as cold-blooded as
you are for millions of dollars jimmie
shurtleff she burst out reproachfully
dont the old days mean anything at
all to you

  yes they mean precisely as much to
me as they do to you

  that is simply boyish and barbar-
ous jimmie and you know it did you
expect to come to life after being dead
for two whole years and find me still
waiting like mariana in the what-you-
may-call-it grange

  of course i didnt i expected to
find you safely married to monty
and you are disappointed because
you didnt find me that way you may
as well say it as think it

  disappointed isnt just the word
i objected  curious hits it off better
how have you contrived to stand
monty off so long

  she let me see her eyes the man-
melting light had gone out of them for
the moment and a sort of age-old wis-
dom had taken its place

  until quite recently you know
monty hasnt been such an overpower-
ingly desirable match she countered
coolly hes nice to me most of the
time but he has a frightful temper
you shouldnt talk that way about
the man you have promised to marry
dont you know that

  you think i ought to be sentimen-
tal  i had my little fling at that two
years ago jimmie and i cant afford to
                 -dbad man
                         

take another its too-well too ex-
hausting

  then you are marrying monty for
his money i queried more than a lit-
tle shocked at this newest revealment
of the girl i had once thought i knew
so well

  i certainly shouldnt marry him
without it was the calm reply then
that is why i asked you to come out
here this evening are you going to
take the money away from him jim-
mie 

  now sordidness is a sufficiently un-
lovely thing in a man but in a woman

  i cant somehow seem to place you
inihis new light mabel i blurted out
its horrible

  oh no she temporized you
have the conventional point of view
thats all sentiment is all right in its
place and i suppose everybody has to
be really in love-once i know i was
and i thought at the time that you were
it was a mistake i guess-or wasnt
it jimmie dear

  by this time she had me grappling
for handholds was she deliberately
trying to stir alive a fire that had been
cold ashes for two long years

  as things have turned out it was
aiming to be about as miserable a mis-
take as two people ever tried to make
wasnt it i rejoined youve got to
call it either that or a tragedy

  perhaps it was a tragedy or at least
half of one she said speaking softly
and with her face turned away you
dont love me any more now jimmie
and for that reason you can see only
the unlovely part of me-the part that
has grown up like an ugly weed oh a
grave you are saying to yourself that
i have changed frightfully in the two
years but so have you-or havent
you 

  yes i suppose i have changed i
admitted even my name isnt the
same

s chance	

  she looked up quickly why did
you change that

  it was changed for me its a long
story and you wouldnt believe it if i
should tell it to you jimmie shurtleff
has really been dead most of the time
he came alive again only a few weeks
aga

  you were hurt in the railroad acci-
dent then you have been out of your
mind all this time

  something like that yes

  i knew it-knew it the moment i
recognized you in daddys den that night
a week ago oh jimmie jimmie

  i think at that moment i would cheer-
fully have given another two years of
my life if i could have found myself
safely back in my room at the green
butte hotel the situation was simply
impossible and it was growing more so
every minute if monty should happen
to stumble upon us there would be a
murder-and a not entirely unjustifiable
one either

  its all past and gone now and
neither of us can help it i hastened to
say as i have said i expected to
find you married to monty and of
course i didnt know anything at all
about uncle perkins money i didnt
come back here to make trouble for
you mabel	-

  then why did you come back at
all she flashed out

  it didnt seem as if the plain truth
could make things a single atom worse
than they were so i told it

  i came back to green butte to keep
the promise made to you two years and
a half ago-if you were unmarried and
still wanted it kept

  but you have changed your mind
since you came she put in quickly

  yes i have you are engaged- to
another man and-

  and you are as good as engaged to
another woman she retorted hitting
out at me with what i knew was only a
blind blow in the dark


the popular magazine

  that is true too i confessed

  she leaned over and her breath came
in little gasps

  did you tell her about me jimmie
i did-when i came to myself
what is she like-this other girl
somehow it seemed like a profana-
tion to be talking of cassie crockett to
a woman who had just admitted that
she cared more for money than for the
man she had promised to marry and
i refused to be dragged into that ditch
weve been dodging all over the lot
and getting nowhere i said what
do you want me to do mabel

  i told you a week ago i want you
to be nice to me

  if you were an empty-headed
schoolgirl trying to throw one man at
another mans head i might understand
you i returned as it is youll have
to make it a bit plainer

  i want time give me a little time
to think wont you please jimmie
dear she pleaded

  it came to me like the smack of a
blow that she merely wanted time to
see how things were going to turn out
between monty and me if monty
could make good and shove me to the
wall she would marry him but if i

should win out-

  wait a minute i interposed lets
stand this thing squarely upon its feet
you asked me why i came back and i
told you if in defiance of all the
probabilities i should find you still true
to a memory-to a dead man-i meant
to do my part you dont want me
mabel and ou dont particularly want
monty what you do want is uncle
perkins money

  even at that she wouldnt let go
you are bullying me now jimmie-
just as you used to in the old days
she faltered with the proper little catch
in her voice i was foolish enough to
admit that i-that i-havent forgot-
ten  if you were only the

  same as you used to be-if that other
girl hadnt come between--

  something had to be donfe if i didnt
mean to let this pretty web spinner wind
me up into a hopeless helpless mummy
and i got up on my feet

  it was the other girl who sent me
back here to do my duty i broke out
roughly but she doesnt expect me
to be monty gershoms understudy and
im not going to be mabel this is
one time when you cant be given the
chance to run with the hare and hold
with the hounds

  it was brutal enough in all con-
science sake but it seemed to slip from
her like rain from a ducks back when
she stood up and shook the creases
from her gown she was smiling
sweetly

  you used to eat out of my hand
once jimmie and perhaps before long
youll wish you had a chance to do it
again- she said quite amiably i came
out here to tell you something-some-
thing that concerns you rather vitally
but since you persist in pushing me
over to the other side-

  you cant tell me anything that i
dont already know monty will fight
and he wont be very particular about
the weapons he chooses i retorted
then i added the capstone to the pyra-
mid of foolishness you may tell him
from me that i know what he is plan-
ning to do and that i also know he is
too big a coward to do it shall i take
you across to the house

  she made a little sign of dissent and
went alone choosing i noticed the
streak of shadow lying between two of
the light beams pouring from the house
windows after she was gone i had a
chance to look over the battlefield and
count the dead and wounded there
was one small gain at least if there
had been any lingering illusions they
were dead now-as dead as pharaoh
but on the other hand i had given
monty gershom an ally who was twice
 mans chance



as quick-witted as he was-and infi-
nitely more reckless of consequences

chapter xvi

he who fights and runs away-

  i didnt feel much like going back to
the house and pretending to enjoy my-
self with the dancers after i realized
that i had just sharpened a spur which
might goad monty into sudden action
so i found that cigar i had been search-
ing for when i discovered mabel sit-
ting beside me lighted it and dropped
into the rustic seat to wait until things
should clarify themselves a bit

  the cigar ash had grown to be a
couple of inches long when i saw a
gigantic figure making its way toward
me among the trees it was sprague
and he too was smoking though he
appeared to be strolling without any
particular object he came straight to
the sheltered seat and sat down beside
me without a word i thought id let
him start the merry-go-round and
after a minute or so he did it

  you seem to have a most unhappy
faculty of climbing out upon the high
tree limbs and sawing them off between
you and the trunk mr shurtleff he
began in gentle deprecation what-
ever possessed you to come out here to-
night

the devil i guess i answered

  he looked around fixing me with
that steady eye of his

  this is an invitation affair how did
you get your card

  there was never any use in trying
to dodge him so i told him the bare
truth

  i thought as much he returned
half to himself then what did she
want of you

  i told him the truth again

  i dont know but what you have
earned all that is coming to you he
commented after another little pause
have you forgotten what our friend

billy congreve back in queen eliza-
beths time said about a woman
scorned you have made an enemy
who has more resource in her little
finger than your cousin has in his whole
body-and who isnt lacking that last
little fillip of nerve which drives the
knife home and twists it around in the
wound

  im an ass i agreed and he took
me up in a flash

  but in the present exigency you
must run like a giraffe its lucky gil-
man was able to tell me where you had
gone when i went back to the hotel
he looked at his watch holding it up
to the light of one of the paper lan-
terns it wants a quarter of eleven
there is atrain north on the g v
branch to castleton at eleven-fifty-five
can you make it

  ive got a taxi i said

  all right we mustnt let them ar-
rest you-at least not before the crock-
etts turn up ive seen men buried for
life on circumstantial evidence no whit
more convincing than that which your
cousin is preparing to pull down upon
you

  you mean that monty has at last
acquired the courage of his convic-
tions 

  i mean that the young woman has
pushed him over the edge a few min-
utes ago- she told him privately as she
no doubt thought that if he had any
evidence against you now was the time
and it was his duty to act at once he
hung off a bit in deference to those
limitations i have spoken of and then
went to the telephone and called up the
green butte police headquarters

  then the officers must be already
on the way will they come in a car

  most likely you have no time to
lose go in and say your leave-takings
to mrs calthrope-and do it quietly
then get your coat and hat and slip
out through the conservatory ill be
waiting for you


the cpcpulr magazine

  i went at it promptly following
spragues instructions to the letter i
found the bankers wife in the refresh-
ment room said the needful platitudes
and got out without meeting either
monty or mabel at the parked-car
end of the grove the big-bodied chemist
was holding the door of the taxi open
for me

  i have given your driver the hurry
order he said in with you and
dont show yourself in green butte
again until you hear from me

  but how will you know where to
reach me i asked clambering in in
obedience to his curt command

  ill take care of that was the brief
reply all you have to do to-night is
to disappear neatly then with an
abrupt change that seemed almost lu-
dicrous in the circumstances do you
shave yourself

  yes i used to on the other side of
the big ditch

  he thrust a small black pocket case
upon me take that and use it when
you get a chance he directed and
when you take the beard off scrape
the name jones off with it thats all
good-by he shut the cab door and
the next moment the taxi was spin-
ning along the gravel driveway to gain
the road

  it was a mildly exciting get-away
with all sorts of possibilities hanging in
the air and my driver made it more so
by speeding up like the mischief after
he had warmed his machine and some
way his back didnt look quite familiar
though i couldnt make him out very
well in the starlight after a while i
saw what made the difference my man
had worn a derby hat on the way out
and the fellow at the wheel was wearing
a soft hat which was pulled well down
over his eyes

  you would say there was plenty to
keep me awake on a twenty-mile dash
to the city doubtless we were due to
meet the police machine somewhere on

the road and the thought occurred to
me that the officers might possibly stop
my man and make him show me up

  in spite of this disquieting suggestion
however the rhythmic drumming of the
motor began presently to make me
drowsy youll recollect that i had
been up before daybreak at hughes
camp and had put in ten solid hours of
this high-speed day in the saddle with
the hum of the motor in my ears i fell
asleep and for aught i knfew i might
have been out of the game for one hour
or fiye when i was awakened by a sud-
den stopping of the car 

  the driver slid the front window and
skewed himself to face me

  bust up o some kind he an-
nounced briefly adding and i guess
im sort o off the road

  i opened the door and got out there
was no road of any kind so far as i
could see we seemed to be in a broad
valley with mountains on all sides and
the only sign of human habitation was
a small cabinlike house looming darkly
at the right the taxi engine was still
running and i asked what was the
matter

  broken clutch i reckon was the
grumpy reply sposeou go and rout
em out at that cabin and see if they
can put us up fr the rest o the night
i was beginning to get a little wider
awake now and the incongruities were
asking to be heard

  how does it come that you got off
the road i demanded then i looked
at him a little mere closely youre
not the man who drove me to butte
springs

  who said i was was the counter-
demand then were stuck all the
samee you go over to that house and
holler fr a bed

  it was at this point that i began to
suspect something crooked but the
strange driver didnt give me time to do
much suspecting before i realized
what he was about he whipped out a
dead mans chance



gun and in the uncertain light it looked
as big as a cannon

  i told you to hump over there and
rout that house out he barked i
aint goin to sit here all night waitin
fr you

  i was completely dazed and dum-
founded when i obeyed mechanically
how had my civil derby-hatted jarvey
got himself exchanged for this drunken
maniac who first lost his way on a plain
pike road and then menaced his fare
with a deadly weapon the mysteries
were crowding in so thickly that i be-
gan to wonder if i were really awake
or only dreaming the cabin had no
dobr on the near side and i went
around to the other side there was
a door here and before i reached it i
saw that it was standing wide open in
a flash it came to me that the house was
uninhabited and that my strange taxi
driver knew it

  stopping short i wheeled and ran
back meaning to have it out with the
gun-toting bully if it should take a
hand-to-hand battle to clear up the mys-
tery but i wasnt quite quick enough
when i had made the half circuit of
the cabin in reverse the taxi was gone
and the drumming of its motor was no
more than a fading murmur on the
night wind

chapter xvii

lost mountain valley

  with the taxi gone and no hope of
overtaking it i turned back to the cabin
luckily i had matches and after call-
ing at the open door to make sure that
i shouldnt be shot for a night marau-
der if there should happen to be an oc-
cupant i entered and struck a light

  the flare of the first match showed
me a bare interior with a rough sleep-
ing bunk a stool a long benchlike table
with little heaps of rusty earth on it a
cupboard contrivance in one corner and
a rude fireplace a second match gave

me a glimpse of a candle stuck in a bot-
tle on the bench table and i was able
to make the light permanent the bet-
ter illumination revealed nothing more
hopeful there were no signs of any
very recent occupancy of the cabin and
nothing to indicate the purpose for
which it had been built and used

  the bunk was mattressed with fir
twigs and these were withered as if
some time had elapsed since their cut-
ting there was a pair of cheap blan-
kets spread over the twigs and in the
corner cupboard i found what i took
to be the remains of a prospectors
grubstake canned meat beans and to-
matoes a sealed tin of ships biscuit
a piece of salt meat in which a field
mouse or some other rodent had begun
to make inroads and half a dozen extra
candles

  on the clay hearth there was an arm-
ful of chopped wood and the sight of
the wood made me realize that the night
was cool almost to frostiness which
would argue that the lone cabin must be
high among the hills at a much greater
altitude than that of butte springs

  i pulled out my watch the time was
half past two i had left butte springs
at eleven or thereabouts the taxi
even on mountain roads would be good
for at least twenty miles an hour
therefore i might be sixty miles or
more from the springs and if the flight
had been to the westward-as the
mountain surroundings seemed to indi-
cate-eighty or more from green butte

  putting the candle aside i knelt to
make a fire in the clay-daubed chimney
with a cheerful fire going i pulled
up the stool filled my pipe and started
in on the mysteries there could be but
one explanation for this imprisonment
in the wilderness montys nerve had
failed him even after he had taken the
final step of telephoning the police
until he could find out why he was him-
self under surveillance and investiga-
tion he couldnt muster up the courage


the pcpuljcr magazine

to fire the mine which however surely
it would efface me might also kick back
and blow him up

  what then  i figured it that he had
changed his mind between the match
scratching and the powder lighting and
had invented a rough-and-ready alter-
native he had bought off my driver
and substituted one of his own paid vil-
lains i was not to be murdered out of
hand i was merely to be kept on tap
so to speak until it should be safe to
produce me and turn me over to the
arroyo county authorities

  i had a quiet little laugh at sprague
when this solving of the mystery had
established itself for once he had been
handsomely outwitted i thought bur-
rowing so deeply that monty had no
inkling of the identity of the investiga-
tor who was prying into his past he
had left the inference wide open that i
was the one who was behind the prying
that being the case if monty had any-
thing to conceal he would be afraid to
give me a chance to talk to a bunch of
police officers

  at the end of the pipe smoking i
chuckled again this time at the idea that
a well man used to knocking about in
the mountains could be confined for
any length of time within four hours
automobile run of a city and a railroad
a little later i took that thought to bed
with me and rose up with it in the
morning when the sun lifting above the
eastern valley rim looked in at the open
door and woke me i had only to
make a pack of the provisions some-
body had so opportunely left in the cor-
ner cupboard and tramp till i got some-
where

  the notion was carried out-partly
at least-as soon as i had made a fire
and warmed me a bite of breakfast
with the remains of the canned-goods
grubstake slung over my shoulder in my
bagged top coat i cut a figure which
would have made a wooden indian
laugh i was still in evening clothes

youll remember which were by this
time much the worse for having been
slept in but the killing feature of
it was my shoes which were dancing
pumps

  it was the pumps that knocked me
out arguing that the night flight must
have been westward i ignored the taxi
tracks which ran in exactly the oppo-
site direction and struck out for what
seemed to be a pass at the upper or east-
ern end of the valley picking my way
in those cursed dancing shoes it was
fully noon before i came to the moun-
tains themselves there vas no road
no trail but there was the stream which
ran beside the cabin to follow and i
followed it

  by the middle of the afternoon i was
done up beyond he hogs-back range
there were mountains ind still more
mountains some of the higher peaks
showing snow balds above timber line
it was no use those fool dancing slip-
pers had practically crippled me and
i was getting nowhere had evidently
taken the wrong slant from the start
there was nothing for it but a return to
the cabin and i made it hobbling and
resting alternatively and getting back
away deep in the night sodden tired and
half murdered by my swollen feet

  none the less after a few hours
sleep i crawled out of the fir-twig bunk
determined to try again it was an-
other perfect day neither too hot nor
too cool but at the breakfast-fire-
making moment i made a discovery that
took the hurry out of my plan for a
fresh attempt to break jail the cor-
ner cupboard door was half open and
the shelves which i had stripped the
day before to fill my tramping pack
were restocked with a supply of every-
thing that a hungry man might need

  two conclusions came to me with the
dispatching of a hearty breakfast con-
jured out of the new stores one was
that i wasnt to be immediately starved
to death and the other was that my kid-
dead man

napers whoever they might be were
confidently counting upon my inability
to scape unaided or at least without
shoes from the lost valley i had no
means of knowing when the fresh sup-
plies had come whether it was during
my absence of the previous day or in
the night while i had slept but any-
way they indicated that the cabin was
to be my base and that it was supposed
that i wouldnt stray so far away from
it as not to be able to get back for
something to eat

  during that second day i slept a good
deal and gave my feet a chance to rest
up in the waking intervals there were
opportunities to think and speculate
but nothing came of the mental gym-
nastics every query that propounded
itself hung like the prophets coffin be-
tween heaven and earth

  toward evening the waking intervals
grew longer and i began to feel the
drag of the loneliness and isolation
more and more the whole fantastic busi-
ness was taking on the characteristics
of a nightmareish dream was i
shurtleff or was i jones part of
the time i wouldnt have sworn to
either identity monty had said he
would give me a dead mans chance
putting one thing with another it was
measurably certain that i wasnt get-
ting a live mans

  out of these reflections came a recru-
descence of sanity of a sort i had
been a donkey to allow myself to be
led by sprague or anybody else into the
maze of indirection and concealment
which had finally landed me in this out-
of-the-world hole barefooted as you
might say and wholly at the mercy of--
a trumpery little villain who hadnt the
honesty to give me back my money or
the courage to kill me off out of the
way if i should ever get back to civi-
lization again-

  i was sitting before the blaze of pine
knots chewing over the different things
that i was going to do to monty ger-

 chance	

shorn if i ever got another hack at him
when i heard the unmistakable squeak
of a motor-car brake and a subdued
murmur of voices the short twilight
had faded and the open cabin door
framed a square of inky blackness my
first thought was that my captors who-
ever they were had come for me but
you could certainly have knocked me
out with a feather duster when i looked
up and saw the natty figure of my lov-
ing cousin framing itself in the black
doorway

  no bad breaks if you please he
growled shortly when i started to my
feet the other time we talked you
choked me and took my gun away from
me but this time another man is hold-
ing the gun on you and youll be drilled
if you dont keep quiet

  i thought it was a bluff but it wasnt
as he came in and sat down on the edge
of the bunk i saw the muzzle of a
rifle peeking at me around the edge of
the door jamb i wasnt committing
suicide just then so i sat down again

  it was right good of you to look me
up monty i said have you come
to tell me that you are ready to turn
uncle perkins money loose

  the cursing i got in return for this
neednt be set down here it wouldnt
look well in cold type it didnt hurt
me any and it did monty a lot of good
to be able to sit there in perfect safety
and turn his abusive machinery loose on
me he had a good vocabulary-yale
or whatever college it was he had gone
to was responsible for that-and he
worked it hard

  not knowing how long the sulphur
geyser was going to spout i began to
refill my pipe

  you didnt come all the way from
green butte over a mountain road just
to swear at me did you  i asked when
he stopped to take breath

  no i didnt he snapped i came
to tell you what youre in for and to
give you one more chance to save your


the popular magazine

-more of the unprintable adjectives-
hide i told you a week or more ago
what id do to you you are a crim-
inal you stole a lot of rich gold sam-
ples from an old miner in the junipers
and its an even bet that you killed the
miner and his daughter to get the
chance theres a warrant out for you
and its in the hands of the green butte
police

  anything else i asked

  yes if i take you back with me
to-night-ive got the men here to do it
if we have to hog tie and gag you-
youll go down country to stand trial
for the robbery and perhaps for mur-
der how does that strike you

  i grinned across at him forgetting
for the moment the menacing gun muz-
zle at the door

  it might make me nervous if i didnt
know you so well monty i told him
you never could quite rise to the kill-
ing point unless youd assured yourself
over and over again that there wasnt
going to be any back kick you must
remember that jimmie shurtleff grew
up with you and knew you like a book
your short way out of it was to have
pulled the trigger on me that night in
my room at the hotel but you couldnt
summon the nerve two nights ago you
had another chance when you called up
the police from butte springs tavern
but once more the thing got your goat
and you ran me off here

  he sat back and locked his hands
over one knee

  there is at least one thing i can
do he gritted i can leave you right
here until you rot youve been trying
to walk out-your shoes prove it you
couldnt do it in a month of sundays
and when your grubs gone youll
starve

  in that case i suppose youve come
to propose some sort of an alternative
what is it 

  its this ive got a car here and
by driving all night we can reach cam

elot a cattle station on the northern
central west of castleton at camelot
you can take a train for the pacific
coast and a man will go with you to
pay your fare and see to it that you
keep your mouth shut at san fran-
cisco your passage will be paid to any
south american port you may name
and when the steamer is ready to sail
youll be given enough money to see you
through the next few years without
work

  i grinned again you say i am an
impostor and youve given me to un-
derstand that you believe i am a crim-
inal on some other counts doesnt it
occur to you that in making this offer
youre showing your hand pretty badly
monty 

  no he snarled

  it does to me if i am the criminal
you say i am it is your plain duty to
turn me over to the courts and be rid of
me and done with it instead of that
youre trying to bribe me to leave the
country just as you might if you really
believed i am the man whom you have
deliberately robbed

  ive robbed nobody he broke out
jimmie shurtleff is dead and you cant
prove that he isnt if you swear your-
self black in the face

  have you ever noticed how a critical
peril delayed sometimes makes for utter
recklessness of it i could still see the
gun muzzle at the door jamb and i had
faith to believe that the man behind it
was some unscrupulous asassin of
montys hiring who would kill me in
cold blood if monty should give him the
signal yet i couldnt keep back the
crowning insult

  iad a rattling good chance to prove
it two nights ago when mabel caroth-
ers slipped away from you and came to
me in the pine grove at butte springs
tavern she knows who i am monty

  he was white and trembling when he
got up frotn his seat on the bunk and
moved toward the door
dead mans chance



  youve settled it for yourself im
going to starve you to death for saying
that he said and he was so furious
that he was able to say it quietly and
without an oath you are forty miles
from the nearest ranch and if you climb
the range youll do it on your hands and
knees

  but im going to have the last
word i retorted you have known
all along that i wasnt dead monty
gershom you knew it at the funeral
and you knew it when you signed the
papers and took over the fortune that
belongs to me you know it now when
you are hoping to buy with the fortune
the woman whom i could have taken
away from you two nights ago if i had
chosen to hold up a finger and say
come i may stay here and rot as you
say but id rather do that than to go
back to the world and live the life you
are going to live from this time on

  he clenched his fist and for an in-
stant i thought he was going to strike
me under cover of the pointed rifle
but at the deciding second he wheeled
and ran out and a moment later i heard
the roar of a starting motor and i was
alone

  for more hours than i cared to count
i sat before the embers of the dying fire
smoking pipe after pipe and passing in
review the fantastic happenings that
had led up to this incredible climax in
the solitary mountain wilderness with
the days experience before me i
couldnt help seeing that montys threat
was not altogether an empty one many
a hidden gulch or valley in the moun-
tain solitudes can show the whitening
bones of some poor gold hunter who
has let his grubstake run too low before
he would consent to turn his face to-
ward the peopled plains and without
shoes or food my finish would come in
the coarse of time

  when my watch told me it was past
midnight a sort of sardonic thought
seized me my overcoat had been

thrown across the benchlike table and
i saw in one of the pockets the black
leather case sprague had given me at
the moment of the butte springs get-
away i took it out and opened it it
was a safety-razor shaving set with
soap and brush and a tiny square mirror
framed in the lid of the box

  i took an empty bean can and stum-
bled out in the darkness to find the
rushing torrent that was drumming over
its bowlders a hundred yards below the
cabin with the water for the one thing
lacking i lighted a couple of the spare
candles and after five or ten minutes
of hacking and scraping i saw the face
of the jimmie shurtleff i had known
on the other side of the big gap look-
ing back at me out of the square of
quicksilvered glass

  why did i do it i dont know as
i could explain the motive but perhaps
back of the outer shell of prompting
there was a feeling that when the
searchers should find me if they should
find me at all i should like to have
them find the clean-shaven jimmie
shurtleff instead of the bearded robert
jones

chapter xviii

jehu tarbell

  as you would imagine in the light of
a new day after a few hours sleep on
the spicy fir tips and a breakfast-with
hot coffee made on the coals in the fire-
place-that jacked nothing but good
company to make it a feast of reason
and a flow of soul all that midnight
nonsense about starving to death fig-
ured as mere bosh

  monty may have thought that he had
me by the leg and an indoor man in my
fix might have had some excuse for
sitting down to eat himself out of the
chance of tramping back to civilization
but i had no such excuse and i could
laugh when i saw how montys visit
or the mysteries or my sore feet or all


the popular magazine

of them together had conspired to give
me a fit of the midnight blues

  after the good breakfast i went
about the business of breaking jail with
a little more judgment than i had ex-
hibited the first day discarding the
wretched dancing shoes i made indian
wrappings for my feet out of strips
torn from the bed blankets back of
the cabin to the southward there was
a bare mountain which looked as if it
would be easy to climb and also as if its
summit would command the view that
ought to enable me to locate myself or
would at least show me the road by
which other people found it so easy to
get an automobile into my trap

  accordingly with a couple of the
ships biscuit for a midday snack i
hiked for the outlook mountain taking
it easy because i expected to spoil the
day anyhow and meaning to save my-
self as much as i could for the longer
tramp that would lie beyond the path-
finding

  over on the lower slope of the south
mountain i found the reason for the
lone cabin in a series of shallow holes
dug in a stratum of red marl i recog-
nized the marl at once as the stuff in
which the metal tungsten is found evi-
dently my predecessor in the cabin had
been a tungsten prospector and here-
upon one of the mysteries vanished
sprague had told me that montys real-
estate operations had included deals in
mining lands he had doubtless visited
this out-of-the-way valley as a prospec-
tive buyer of or broker for the tung-
sten claim and so had learned its loca-
tion and the road that led to it

  the outlook mountain gave me a
harder climb than i had bargained for
and it was past noon when the summit
was topped as i had hoped there was
a good view though the cabin location
itself was cut off by a wooded shoulder
of the mountain lower down to the
northward and eastward and rearward
to the south the sky-pitched ramparts

of the valley were fairly unbroken and
the passes if any there were lay high
above timber line but to the westward
there was a gap in the distance it
looked like the upper portal of a canon
and since the stream ran that way there
seemed little doubt that the outlet was
at the distant western extremity of the
valley

  with the trail thus marked out for
me-in precisely the opposite direction
from which one would naturally look
for it-i determined to go back to the
cabin load up with what food could be
carried and make the start at once
night would overtake me of course
before the distant canon could be
reached but that would make little dif-
ference since the long tramp would
have to be broken by a number of night
camps before i could hope to find my
way out of the labyrinth

  from the summit i saw that i had
taken the hard way to climb the lookout
mountain and that the descent could
be made moire easily by rounding the
wooded shoulder to the east accord-
ingly i chose to go down that way and
since the forest extended almost to the
little plateau where the cabin stood i
got no further view of the valley until
i broke cover out of the wood a hun-
dred yards or so back of the cabin site

  there was a stunning shock awaiting
me when i issued from the forest thick-
eting for the last half mile i had fan-
cied i was smelling smoke and the
cause lay before me as i shuffled out
of the wood in my absence the cabin
had burned to the ground and there
was nothing but a heap of charred and
smoldering logs to mark its site and
what made the disaster a catastrophe
was the fact that the fire had devoured
my overcoat the blankets and the pre-
cious food supply which was to have
provisioned the fresh attempt to walk
out of the trap

  at first i thought i had only my own
carelessness to blame to be sure i
dead mans chance	

had covered the embers of the break-
fast fire before leaving the cabin but i
remembered now that the chimney was
built of sticks mud-daubed and that
it was a risk to leave any fire in it at
all then suddenly i got another angle
monty had promised to starve me had
he left one of his hired assassins be-
hind to hurry things a little by burning
me out 

  i dont recall the events of the next
few hours very clearly the conviction
that my cousin had deliberately de-
stroyed my last hope of escape made a
vengeful madman of me for the time
being and i had but one furious im-
pulse-to find and kill with my bare
hands the fire-setting fiend who as i
argued must still be in hiding and not
far off

  of course the search was fruitless
the wood on the slopes of the south
mountain was the only possible hiding
 place and i had worn myself out quar-
tering it back and forth before reason
reasserted itself assuring me that the
incendiary if there had been one would
have no object in staying to see what i
might do reason also told me another
thing it reminded me that in all mv
trampings on this day of catastrophes
and the other i had seen no game of
any kind save an occasional jack rabbit
and a few prairie dogs

  it looked like a starving proposition
safely enough when i finally wandered
back to the site of the burned cabin
this was along in the shank of the
evening when the sun was poised like
a great ball of fire over the summits of
the western range already i was be-
ginning to feel the first gnawings of
hunger having had only the two biscuits
for a midday meal there were fish in
the river in the still pools i could see
them plainly but they might as well
have been in heaven for all the chance
i stood of catching them

  i dont much like to recall the
thoughts of the hungry night watch that

  b

followed after i had dragged together
a few of the smoldering cabin logs and
made them blaze again with dead
branches from the forest more and
more the nightmare theory thrust itself
upon me and the rank incredibility of
all the resurrection incidents seemed
fitly capped by this grotesque immure-
ment in the solemn wilderness

  to all appearances poor jimmie
shurtleffs effort to struggle up out of
his grave was destined to figure as a
shocking example for those who have
once been safely killed off and laid
away under the sod monty was safe
as safe as a house he could go on en-
joying his stolen fortune and he would
lie to mabel telling her that i had at
last consented to take his bribe and
vanish that lie would be cleverly
passed on to sprague and the big
good-natured expert in qualitative an-
alysis who liked to play with the detec-
tive puzzles that came in his way would
drop the puzzle which he would say
had lacked a man of sufficient honesty
of purpose to make it even mildly inter-
esting

  it was that thought of the likelihood
of montys smug escape from all the
pains and penalties due to his villainy
that kept me from turning my face to-
ward the distant canon in the west and
tramping until the engine should stop
for lack of fuel sooner or later monty
would come back to make sure that
there was no mistake this time about
my blotting out and in the nature of
things he would be likely td come alone
if i could only contrive to keep life
enough and strength enough in me and
sense enough to hide and spring upon
him for the final grapple i thought i
should die better satisfied

  mixed up with these vindictive long-
ings there was a thought to provoke a
grim smile does death ever overtake
a living soul whose various jobs are all
completed and the accounts comfortably
dosed and balanced i guess not


the cpocpular magazine

once before i had left a number of
things hanging in the air and now hav-
ing what few people ever get-a second
shy at it-the abandoned or about to
be abandoned muddle was even worse
cassie crockett would be left more
truly a widow than mabel was ever ca-
pable of being and i had struck no lick
on the job of helping crockett to real-
ize upon his mine

  this last was the- bitterer pill to swal-
low because from what hughes had
told me it had appeared that i was the
one man who might hope to persuade
president ford to build the coal road
up coyote canon i had promised to
write ford forgetting for the moment
that i would first have to convince him
that i was still in the land of the living
and now the chance was gone

  i dont know just how the dreadful
night wore itself out between thinking
and dozing before the charred-log fire
like most outdoor men i had always
been a hearty eater and i suppose that
is the reason why the hunger gripped
me so fiercely in those first few hours
after the sun came up and i had drunk
at the stream and had crawled back to
the shelter of the forest it was not so
bad if it had not been for that grim
determination to wait for montys com-
ing i thought i could have made a good
few miles along the road toward the
westward canon and so i might have

  but the resolve born in the night was
stronger than ever now that i realized
the full cold-bloodedness of my cousins
purpose a chill wave of discourage-
ment submerged me at the fear that he
might come too late to give me my
chance for vengeance if the fire had
been accidental if it had not been due
to his agency he might confidently fig-
ure that i had days to live on the
other hand if he should come soon i
should know beyond doubt that the
cabin burning had been incendiary-a
knowledge i thought which would

nerve me for the final grapple if noth-
ing else would

  not to take any chance of being
caught unawares i chose the day hiding
place on the rib of the mountain shoul-
der where i could see down the valley
for a long distance hour by hour the
day dragged on my watch had stopped
because i had forgotten to wind it and
there was no measure of time save the
advancing shadows of the trees slowly
the sun swung to the meridian and be-
gan to decline and with the missing of
what was practically the fourth meal
i was glad i  had the account-squaring
thought to keep me from dwelling too
continually upon the faintness which
had now succeeded to the hunger pitch

  there was still about an hour of day-
light left when a moving dot came into
view far down the valley i staggered
to my feet to get a better outlook it
was a motor car coming on at the head
of a comets tail of dust of its own rais-
ing early in the day i had picked a
broken tree limb for a club i groped
for the weapon and as i found it the
car a big stripped roadster painted
gray shot up and made a skidding stop
within a few feet of my hiding place

  if i had waited for a second glance
at the khaki-clad young fellow who was
swinging himself from behind the steer-
ing wheel i might not have made that
madmans charge upon him with the
club upswung he did not see me at
first i think he saw only the charred
and blackened ruins of the cabin but
he heard me in time to wheel and ward
the blow and for the next minute or
two we managed to keep each other
pretty busy in a hand-to-hand tussle
that ended in a clean fall for the husky
driver of the gray car

  quit it he commanded as i vainly
tried to free myself and kick him off
of me with a clumsy foot and then
what in sam hills the matter with
you anyhow you aint got no fight
cornin to you with me
dead mans chance



  damn you i gasped gershom
sent you to see if i was dead did he
let me get up and ill show you
gershom nothin was the cool re-
ply mr sprague was the one that
sent me quit your frothin at the
mouth and ill let you up

  some glimmerings of reason were be-
ginning to return by this time and when
i quieted down the stalwart young fel-
low helped me to my feet the scrap
short as it was had got me and i had
to sit down on the running board of the
car

  they-they burned me out and i
havent had anything to eat since yes-
terday forenoon i told him when the
dizzy fit had passed

  sure said my late antagonist
thats why im here mr sprague
got onto the little arson play right after
dinner to-day and he told me to get a
car and burn the wind i been lookin
fr you all along the road thought
maybe youd try to hike out then
with a good-natured grin you lock
a heap more like yourself with all that
stubble stuff off your face

  how do you know how i ought to
look i demanded

  thats how he returned fishing a
card photograph from an inner pocket
of the khaki coat and showing it to me
it was a copy of a picture i had had
taken in one of the green butte studios
for mabel in the long ago and i had
forgotten that it was in existence

  youre tarbell arent you i que-
ried and he nodded

  used to be a cow-punch but ive
been with mr sprague now fr a couple
o years off and on hes the biggest
man this side o kingdom come-in more
ways than one gettin your nerve back
a little

  as much as i can hope to until i
can put a square meal under my belt
did gershom actually give orders to
have me burned out

  the young man dragged a fat silver

watch from his fob and glanced at its
face then he reached across me and
got a paper-wrapped package from
some hiding place in the bowels of the
gray road car

  chem em sort o slow he cau-
tioned stripping the paper and giving
me a couple of meat sandwiches then
yep i reckon the little cuss sure did
give the order it cost him five hundred
plunks and a ticket to seattle fr the
tinhorn that did it thats how mr
 sprague caught on take it easy on
them sandwiches you got plenty o
time i got to fill the radiator before
we start back to town

  let me write it down before i forget
it that those sandwiches took me right
back to the boyhood days on uncle
silas farm when i used to lose my ap-
petite in the hayfield-and find the
wolfs tarbell rummaged out a rub-
ber bucket from the inwards of the car
and began to make trips to the creek
for the benefit of the steaming radiator
in the pouring intervals he straightened
out a few of the tangles for me

  yep mr sprague knowed theyd
changed taxi drivers on you that night
at butte springs but he let em go-
just to see where theyd fetch up i
had my tip-and a motor sickle with a
good quiet muffler on it the taxi beat
me here by about fifteen minutes that
night i reckon and when i peeked into
the cabin you had a fire goin and was
smokin your pipe all cozy and com-
fortable

  with the next bucket he went on
my orders was to trail you and re-
port so i skinned back to town mr
sprague he just laughed sort o quiet-
like and gave me some money  mr
shurtleff may be gettin hungry and
youd better take him somethin to chew
on was whpt he told me and as i
was moggin off he allowed that it
would be just as well if you didnt know
where the grub came from

   i didnt i put in


the popular magazine

  you bet you didnt-with the good-
natured grin i crope up on you
whilest you was asleep the next night
when i got back from feedin you mr
sprague give me the job of trackin
gershom he acted like a man that had
got hold of a bull by the tail and didnt
know whether to leggo r pull the tail
out by the roots

  there was another water-carrying
break and in the next pouring space i
said gershom came out here the night
after you brought the canned stuff- did
you know that

  sure i did there was four of em
and it didnt seem worth while to raise a
rookus so long as it was only talk so
i laid out in the dark heldin a gun on
the litle snipe that was settin on your
bed and doin the fancy cussin i didnt
allow he was goin to give any shootin
signals but if he had started tos he
wouldnt neverve give any more--not
none whatsoever

  the sandwiches were gone to the
final crumb and tarbell was putting
his rubber bucket away

  if youre about ready he said with
another glance at the fat silver watch
theres goin to be some sort of a
theayter show in the ladies ordinary of
the-hotel to-night and mr sprague al-
lowed like you might want to be there
can you climb in by yourself 

  i showed him that i could and a min-
ute or so later he had backed and turned
the big roadster and we were flying
westward over the trackless flat of the
valley at a pace that put all talk out
of the question on the canon climb at
the outlet my jehu driver was obliged
to slacken the breakneck speed and here
he gave me what proved to be his final
word

  weve got sixty good miles to go
and the order is to shoot you in by seven
oclock at the side door of the inter-
mountain you hold your hair on and
ill show you how this old boatll do it
any description of that frantic race

against time around and over the moun-
tains and across the plains would be
inadequate simply because i cant write
fast enough to give any just notion of
the recklessness of that young fellow
tarbell if there were any road i
never got a glimpse of it until we struck
into the well-remembered pike some dis-
tance west of butte springs

  by this time it was pitch dark and
tarbell was running without the lamps
how he managed to keep the road and
to miss all the vehicles we met or over-
took i shall never know but he did it
some way and promptly on the stroke
of seven we pulled up at the side door
of the hotel in green butte

  how i should manage to get to my
roonv hatless with my clothes a wreck
and my feet wrapped in blanket strips
without making a holy show of myself
i could not imagine but apparently all
this was carefully prearranged- a cor-
ridor man met me at the door flung a
long bath robe over my shoulders hus-
tled me to the nearest baggage elevator
and so to my room where i found clean
clothes laid out for me on the bed and
a good hearty snack of a meal spread
ready and waiting on the small toilet
table

 i had bathed and changed and was
painstakingly putting away the few final
morsels of the small supper when there
was a tap at the door and sprague en-
tered his big round face beaming and
the boyish eyes twinkling

  weve missed you he said in ge-
nial mockery how is it the pinafore
rhyme has it

we miss his presence in his customary
     haunts

and so do his sisters and his cousins and
     his aunts-

one cousin in particular speaking of
pinafore reminds one of theatricals in
general and were staging a little movie
play to-night-for an invitation audi-
ence-that im sure youll want to see
that is my only excuse for sending
dead mails chance



tarbell to break so rudely into your
seclusion in lost mountain valley
have you finished your supper

  i looked up quickly

  a moving-picture play what has
that got to do with me and my trou-
bles 

  his laugh was good-humoredly in-
fectious

  nothing at all perhaps but you
have earned a bit of recreation and you
owe it to me to come and look on the
play is my own concoction and i ac-
tually took many of the pictures for it
myself it involves a few new little ex-
periments in the art-it is an art isnt
it-and that is why i am giving a pri-
vate exhibition to a few friends first
before i try to sell it to the film people
no you wont need your coat and hat
our theater is in the ladies ordinary
shall we go down

chapter xix

a dead mans chance

  the ladies ordinary a rather small
dining room partitioned off from the
corner of the mezzanine in good part
by heavy portieres was in twilight
darkness when sprague held one of the
curtains aside for me and we slipped
unnoticed into a comer

  the picture machine which was
mounted in the high orchestra balcony
was already in operation a curtain
had been stretched across the opposite
end of the room and upon it there was
appearing a series of scenes from the
european capitals-a very ordinary
film as it seemed to me the audi-
ence as well as i could make out in the
twilight gloom was select-as to num-
bers at least there were not more
than a hundred people in the ranked
chairs but when my eyes began to get a
little accustomed to the light or the
lack of it i could hardly believe what i
saw

  not a word whispered sprague at

my ear and the warning was needed
in one of the chairs so near that i
could have reached over and touched
him sat milligan my old-time chief
and just beyond him i saw and recog-
nized tobey and mike jorkins and var-
ick and half a dozen more of my old
office cronies of the jimmie shurtleff
days across the aisle from milligan
sat mccormack the p s-w copah
yardinaster with his arms folded and
his shrewd old eyes fixed upon the flit-
ting pictures of europe hobnobbing
with mccormack and apparently se-
renely regardless of the distance which
intervenes between a yard boss and the
president of the road was mr ford the
empire builder who had once sent me
into the junipers to survey the route for
a coal branch up coyote canon

  each succeeding row of chairs re-
vealed more astoundments as i passed
the faces of the sitters in review from
my corner it seerjied as if everybody i
had ever known in the west and in
green butte had been summoned to
gather in this one small audience room
hughes was there with two men whom
i did not recognize two of my foremen
on the track-shortening job in the jaw-
bone narrows were there judson ca-
rothers was there with his wife and
just behind them i saw monty and ma-
bel with a big bunch of townspeople
many of whom had known me well
enough to call me jimmie in the
older day

  it was like an old home-coming and
i was still gasping in astonishment when
sprague quietly thrust me into one of
the nearest chairs making an emphatic
sign for silence as he did it it was well
that he gave me the tip my seat was
next to that of a young woman when
i looked around a small firm hand had
crept into mine with a cautionary little
squeeze and i found myself staring like
a man in a daze into the brown eyes of
-cassie crockett

  hush she whispered and then she


the cpocpulicr magazine

passed my hand across her lap to the
gray-bearded old fellow sitting next to
her on the other side and i got a big-
knuckled mining mans grip that fairly
made me wince

  tell me i breathed into the pink
ear beside me ive got to know how
you came here

  i-i havent been very well she
breathed back we found a little
pocket in the mine richer than the
others and daddy took me out to aspen
-for treatment and the change mr
sprague found us and sent for us to
come here we just got in this after-
noon

  i knew why she hadnt been very
well little girls who send their lovers
away to marrybther people are pretty
apt to pay for it one way or another
a handsome picture of an italian street
scene was flitting over the screens but i
dont believe she saw it when she whis-
pered again is that the-the other
girl-the one sitting on the left of the
man with the curled mustaches 

  yes thats mabel and the man is
my cousin theyve been engaged for
six months or more

  she nodded mr sprague told me
and tried to point them out for me as
they came in a little while ago but i
wasnt sure that i got the right ones
do you know why he has got us all
together here to-night 

  no more than the man in the moon
neither do i but he made us come
daddy and me he said wed know why
after we got here

  people were still coming in a few
at a time and among the later comers
i saw tarbell slipping to a seat behind
monty and mabel somehow the at-
mosphere of the place seemed full of
electricity as if everybody was waiting
for something to happen-something
more startling than the string of scenery
pictures

  this sort of tenseness which ap-
peared to be gripping every one tight-

ened like a clamp when the last of the
street scenes faded from the curtain
leaving a blank circle of glaring white
light on the stretched sheeting in the
hush sprague stood up pretty well
down in front and turned to face his
audience

  as you all know the cinemato-
graphic art is still only in its beginnings
and experimenters the world over are
constantly trying new processes he be-
gan speaking in low distinct tones that
reached every ear in the darkened room
used at first only as a source of en-
tertainment it is now entering many
other fields-the educational the scien-
tific the demonstrative and even the
moral and religious my own experi-
ments-which i warn you are only
those of an amateur-have been along
the line of an attempt to carry the art
into the psychological field

  is it possible i have asked myself
to portray in a series of pictures a chain
of events apparently unrelated which
shall so dovetail themselves together in
the portrayal as to impress themselves
upon the observers as a complete story
of facts which could not possibly have
been photographed in their reality  as
i have said my attempt is only an ex-
periment you yourselves shall be the
judges of its success

  he sat down and as he did so the
screen went black for a single instant
then the name of the play stood out
for a flickering moment a dead
mans chance and i could feel rather
than hear the little gasp of quickened
interest that ran through the room

  the first of the moving scenes staged
itself at the track-shortening job in the
jawbone narrows and then i knew in-
stantly what was coming-or at least
a part of it-and why tarbell had
ruined a perfectly good set of tires get-
ting me to town the pictures were
astoundingly real considering the fact
that the background must have been
wholly made up we saw the men
dead mans chance



working in the great cutting saw the
steam of the shovel whistle as it blew
for six oclock quitting time saw the
men trooping off to the bunk shanties
and presently saw the old  with
mickey donovan leaning from his win-
dow pull down to the center of the
picture to take me on for the run to
copah

  following this there were glimpses
of the racing engine proceeding on its
way down the canon a glimpse of the
station at copah of the barber shop
with myself sitting in the chair and well
lathered of the dining room where i
was eating supper of the train platform
where i was climbing the steps of a
sleeper whose name flashed clear and
distinctly katinka 

  astoundment followed amazement
when i realized how next to impossible
it must have been for sprague to get
his backgrounds for all this entirely
out of my descriptions and from the
scanty memories of others but the
climax came when the pictures began
to show the northward flight of the reg-
ular train with glimpses of the second
section chasing it the race ending for
the regular in a startling picture of
the derailed sleeper and the actual
scramble in the aisle in which jones
face and my own as we fought for
our clothes came out distinctly on the
screen

  up to this point there had been no
explanatory line flashed upon the screen
but now there was a single sentence
shot between the hurrying scenes

he changes clothes with the
other man

which was instantly chased off the
screen by a lifelike picture of a horrible
rear-end collision with coaches bunched
up an engine lying on its side in the
ditch and a pullman with the medal-
lion name katinka still showing
plainly  its upturned side crushed
and shattered and in flames

  the lapse of time between this and
the next picture was merely indicated
by a momentary darkening of the cur-
tain then the work of the wrecking
crews staged itself rapidly the two big
cranes pulling and tugging at the debris
the finding of the bodies burned man-
gled and disfigured in the charred
skeleton of the pullman the finding in
particular of one body with mccor-
mack and milligan-recognizable to me
if to no one else-bending over it and
examining the papers taken from its
pockets

  i never realized before that moment
that one could actually do two things
at one and the same time or keep up
two separate lines of thought and hold
them apart i know i lost no detail of
the scenes which were holding me in a
vise grip of marvelings but none the
less i had a perfectly clear side glimpse
of the way all this was plowing fur-
rows up and down monty gershoms
back

  what would he do  the question an-
swered itself like a flash he would be
crafty enough to sit still and do noth-
ing no matter how far the revelations
might go it was his only hope of
safety to ignore the whole business as
a matter entirely extraneous to him as
if the thing were what everybody else
was doubtless supposing it to be a piece
of pure fiction still if he were in any
manner guilty i could well understand
how the cold chills were running over
him how he would have given all of
uncle perkins fortune for a chance to
run and how he knew that he shouldnt
dare to run even if the chance should
come and pluck him by the coat sleeve

  meanwhile the scenes on the screen
were changing again a sheet had been
thrown over the burned body that mc-
cormack had found and a group of
railroad men carried it away on a rude
stretcher another shift and the funeral
train came backing slowly down on the
temporary track the body with sev-


the popular magazine

eral others was lifted in and the train
moved away

  once more the curtain went black
for a flitting instant and then a new
background displayed itself a rocky de-
file in the mountains and in the fore-
ground four men-one of whom i rec-
ognized instantly as hughes the young
government engineer-bending over a
fifth who was on his back and was
apparently dead or dying hughes was
binding a cloth about the head of the
recumbent man and the subsequent pic-
tures showed the little surveying party
at its work on the march or camping
overnight in the mountain wilderness
it numbered five now and one of the
five had his head bandaged and his
beard was growing almost visibly it
seemed

  the last picture of this series showed
a deep-gorged valley with high moun-
tains on sides and on a bench of
one of them a mine dump anda cabin
in this picture the man with the beard
and the bandaged head was leaving the
others striking off in the direction of
the cabin and turning now and then to
wave good-by to his late companions
another change and two people an
oldish man and a girl were waiting at
the head of the mine dump for the
climbing deserter at the last they
reached out and helped him supporting
him between them until all three had
disappeared in the cabin presently the
two the oldish man and the girl came
to the door of the cabin the old man
searching in the pockets of a coat an
envelope is found and they scrutinize
it closely a flick of the machine brings
the envelope face toward the spectators
highly magnified the superscription
reads

denver colorado

  what followed this came as a most
ingenious bit of sceneshifting a huge
clock face appeared on the screen with

the hands revolving rapidly backward
as the hands spun around a calendar
index showed the resetting to be six
weeks earlier in time when the clock
face vanished the funeral train from
two horse gulch came once more into
view showing that the main thread of
the story was once more to be followed
there were glimpses of an orchard
country of mountain and plain always
with the racing train in sight and at
the last the entry of the train into a city
station crowded with people

  other glimpses showed the removal
of the sheeted bodies from the baggage
car and i knew that i was now about
to witness my own funeral the line
of undertakers wagons drove away and
pulled up in a crowded street the
bodies were lifted and carried in and
i could pick out my own or rather poor
jones by the sight of milligan and his
office staff walking beside its stretcher

  once more the machine in the or-
chestra balcony clicked the scene this
time was a room in the undertakers
establishment a single body lay on a
cooling board covered with a sheet as
we looked the ghastly interior grew
dim the door opened and a man en-
tered crossing quickly to the dead
man he lifted the sheet and appeared
to be trying to turn the body over on
the board then he replaced the sheet
and hurried away

  my eyes had now become accustomed
to the twilight and i gave a quick
glance in montys direction he had
collapsed in his chair but as i looked
he straightened up and made as if he
would rise for half a hundred clicks
the scene remained as it was then
a window at the back of the dead room
opened slowly and the same man re-
appeared climbing stealthily into the
room at the side of the sheeted body
he took something from his pocket and
a shift of the film showed us a bottle
marked iodine

  hastily the stealthy intruder stripped
dead mans chance



the sheet from the dead man and roll-
ing the body on its side he began to
paint a brown spot the size of a childs
hand just below the left shoulder blade
in the act and throughout the entire
scene he had kept his face averted but
now as if he had heard some disturb-
ing sound he twisted his head around
and we saw the fear-distorted face of
my cousin monty gershom

   a yell like that of a lost soul broke
out upon the half-horrified silence of
the darkened dining room and with it
came the shriek of a woman while
the merciless film held the accusing pic-
ture interminably we heard monty
shouting like a madman cursing the
undertaker who had given him away
cursing the druggist who had sold him
the iodine cursing the wreck which had
killed the wrong man cursing most
shrilly the brain whose cleverness had
unmasked him

   the picture machine stopped and the
electric lights went on at the same in-
stant everybody was afoot and i had
a brief glimpse of monty struggling in
tarbells arms but for myself i had
but one thought and that was to get
cassie out of it swiftly when it was
accomplished and i had seen her and
her father safe in their room on an
upper floor i hurried back to the ordi-
nary the little dining hall was already
empty but sprague materialized out of
somewhere and drew me to a seat be-
side him in the open mezzanine

  they are buzzing too hotly down
there in the lobby and we wont go
down just yet he remarked coolly
of course i know youll want to be
shaking hands with all your old friends
who have been mourning you as dead
for a couple of years but that will wait
-or wont it

   it will wait until you have told me
how on earth you did it i broke out

  the plan was based upon pure rea-
son as you may have guessed the
clew which led me to identify you with

the missing james shurtleff was given
by hughes who told me nearly two
years ago of his finding of a wounded
man ragged and half starved in the
mountains no great distance from the
scene of the train wreck and on a date
which as he recalled it was only a few
days after the disaster

 you were that man and when
hughes had told me how you had com-
pletely lost your memory and how you
left his party one day to go to crocketts
to ask for a job as you phrased it
i became curious to see you and talk
with you the chance didnt come until
last spring when i made the hike up
the cryolite to crocketts beyond that
visit it was merely a simple task of
putting two and two together i was
confident then that you were shurtleff
though as you had lost your identity
with your memory there was nothing to
be done at that time

  but montys part in it how did you
get on to that 

  i had been suspicious of your cousin
for a long time as i have told you
i was here at the time of your funeral
-or rather jones-and his ostensible
sorrow for the loss of a relative was
curiously mixed up with a sort of fur-
tive fear i thought though what the
fear was about i had no inkling then
your turning up here in your proper
identity put an entirely new face on
the matter and aroused my interest-
with the result that you have just seen
yes but good heavens how could
you build the thing without a single
stick of timber to work on you didnt
see monty paint my birthmark on
jones body did you

  far from it my son that is where
the good gift of reason comes in see
how easy it is when you construct it
a syllogism at a time the fortune
wasnt at stake at that time but your
cousin wanted to marry the girl to
whom you were engaged thats the mo-
tive he wouldnt have killed you out


the cpocpular magazine

of the way perhaps hut he couldnt
be inconsolably unhappy when an acci-
dent removed you all clear so far

  perfectly

  all right call that fact number one
and hold it in mind when the accident
came and an absolutely unrecognizable
corpse was brought here for burial it
says itself that your cousin of all
others would be the one who would
want to assure himself beyond question
that the corpse was or was not yours
you had been boys together had doubt-
less been in swimming together many
times if you had any bodily peculiari-
ties your cousin would be sure to know
them a little inquiry at the under-
takers developed the fact that he had
been permitted to go alone into the dead
room and upon that small fact i built
my theory the snapshot photograph
taken of you that day when we went
together to the athletic club cleared
away all doubt

  i dont see it i protested

  you dont why its perfectly
plain to the reasoning mind you have
a birthmark the body of robert jones
didnt have one your cousin knew
of the mark and he would naturally be
afraid that before the body could be
buried somebody else who knew of the
mark might happen along hence the
iodine and the stealthy return to the
dead room i reasoned it out first and
proved it afterward partially at least
one dark night tarbell and i and two
others became grave robbers we ex-
humed what was left of the body of
robert jones i neednt go into details
ill merely remind you that i am an
analytical chemist and that iodine is
one of the most imperishable substances
known i may have gotten some of the
details of the dead-room scene wrong
but i built it very carefully on a good
bottom of reasoning and after a care-
ful study of the place and all the cir-
cumstances which could be recalled by
everybody who was questioned

  then that scene in the undertakers
place was wholly imaginary  i queried

  oh yes all the pictures were
staged of course that one with the
others

  but how did you get montys face
with that horribly scared look on it
the expert chuckled softly there
were two ways open to us one was
to have the actor who was playing the
part make up to resemble gershom as
nearly as possible i was afraid to risk
that the entire success of the demon-
stration would turn upon that one criti-
cal climax so i made up my mind that
gershom must really see his own face
in the picture he scares rather easily
as you may or may not know tar-
bell held him up for me one night as
he was leaving his office and i got a
snapshot picture of the way he looks
when he is frightened having the
real photograph it was easy to trans-
fer it to the film

  but how did you get monty here
in the audience

  that was easy he didnt suspect
me at all and i made it a sort of social
affair inviting mrs calthrope and her
set and the carotherses

  i am beginning to see i admitted
but the immense labor of it all the
staging of all these pictures and the
work it must have involved the round-
ing up of milligan and all the others
who used to know me-and all upon
the one small chance that you might
possibly shock monty into a confession
its fairly staggering to think of it
that is where the scientific training
comes in laughed the big-bodied ex-
pert good-naturedly no trouble is
too great to be taken no process too
intricate or involved to be gone through
with if there is a truth to be demon-
strated i will admit that i was some-
what hustled for time in preparing the
films and i was beset by the fear that
i couldnt keep you quiet long enough
dejd mins chance



to give me the needful interval that
is why i permitted your cousin to kid-
nap you-it offered a few more unin-
terrupted days for the make ready
mr ford who is an old friend of
mine helped me with the railroad pic-
tures and one of the bills youll have
to pay out of your new fortune will
be for the stage properties and the serv-
ices of the film company which i wired
to los angeles for on the day when
you told me that you were the long-lost
james shurtleff with the sure-enough
shurtleff memories but i have as-
sumed from the first that you wouldnt
question the expense unless we could
force gershom to give up voluntarily
there was no smallest hope that the
courts would make him let go it would
have been dragging along on appeals
when you were both gray-headed
sprague had lighted one of his im-
mense cigars and the ash had grown
a full half inch on it before i said
well where do we stand now do
i prosecute this loving cousin of mine
and send him to the penitentiary where
he belongs 

  i think not was the ca-lm reply
i know he meant to leave you in
lost mountain valley-if he could mus-
ter up the nerve to do it-and that he
had your food supply destroyed per-
haps he would have left you to starve
but i doubt it remembering that limi-
tation of his of which we have both
spoken at other times tarbell has his

orders to turn him loose and im al-
most sure you will hear from him be-
fore you sleep-most probably with a
proposal to turn your fortune over to
you if youll give him enough of it to
vanish on decently youll do it i
know and now i mustnt keep you
any longer from your old-time friends
down in the lobby they are waiting
to give you what the newspapers to-
morrow will call an ovation-

  i guess ive proved what i set out
to havent i  or if i havent it isnt
any use dragging the thing along for-
ever i said i had the man who died
and came alive again just to spite his
relations backed off the map and it still
looks that way to me

  monty  oh yes he got down on
his knees to me and when he told me
that mabel-mabel mind you the girl
that i had thought didnt have loyalty
enough in her to stick to anybody-was
willing to marry him and vanish with
him i gave him as much as he had
once offered to give me with a few
extra thousands thrown in for mabel

  and cassie  why god bless your
soul yes shes been mrs jimmie
shurtleff for quite some little time now
and when mr ford agreed to build
that coal branch up coyote canon for
his railroad it was uncle perkins
money that financed our telpherage

by vingie e roe
author of  when the red hills threatenn  the steeds of summit passetc

            a job for the warden in the forests of the trinity range-a job which
            peeved him at first because of its seeming impossibility of accomplishment
            but which eventually was to be reckoned among his finest memories

a rifle spat on a hillside the
clean sharp snap of a thirty-
thirty kenset sitting his pow-
erful red horse on a slant so
steep that his left toe braced on the
earth lifted his head a scowl drew
deep between his eyes

  at it again darn him v he said
aloud

   iister the big red horse flipped an
inquiring ear backward an amazing
understanding existed between these
two a sympathy so fine that mister took
his cues from kensets evidence of
mood-the fiddling with his mane say
when the master was puzzled mister
felt that a few wisps directly under the
bridle hand must have become ragged
these last few weeks so persistently had
kenset twisted and pulled them

   for some one was defying the law of
the forest that kenset stood for and
keen as the ranger was he had failed
to discover one small clew to the vandal

   it was late in november and the sea-
son had closed over a month back yet
three times in the past two weeks he had
heard that clean sharp snap yapping on
the slopes

   it was glorious in the trinity range
no railroad screamed its challenge
nearer than forty miles no town worthy
of the name marred the wildness here
and there in the deep creases of the
tumbled hills tiny clusters of houses
huddled above the leaping white-water

streams relics of the days of  pros-
pectors still panned on the bars and
down below a huge dredge worked me-
thodically in the river bed

  there had been a rain or two and the
nights were sharp with frost

  here and there a bush or a tree
flamed with the scarlet flag of autumn
but for the most parf the land looked
like summer all the mighty slopes
were clothed in pine and fir with here
and there a cedar

  buck grass still hung in great
feathery bunches along the rocky edge
of the river a cool high sun bathed
this wild world in brilliant light while
far off the peaks of other ranges swam
in a soft blue haze

  it was good to be in thehills in fall
and kenset was alive to every pulse of
his lonely land he had a cabin high
up on a shoulder of pappoose moun-
tain and he could hear and see for miles
along the dropping slopes it was
there in his own dooryard as he sat
smoking an evening pipe and watching
the red veils creep over the blue haze
as the sun went down that he had heard
that first shot a fortnight back-and he
knew some one was after a buck once
again he had caught the faint far snap
a few days later and here it was again

  he gathered his rein and put mister
softly down along the hill toward it
for ten minutes he rode then he drew
the horse into a thicket and dismounted
in the lonesome land



hanging the rein over the pommel mis-
ter was trained to stand at attention-
for hours if need be-and to come at
a whistle and he wanted no dragging
straps to hinder

  kenset a sturdy figure in his khakis
puttees and wide-brimmed rangers hat
went forward as gently as an indian

  the woods were thick with fern and
tiazelbrush and slippery with dry nee-
dles and try as he would he could
not help a sound now and then the
slant was rugged with a bold jut push-
ing a brazen front of seamed and splin-
tered rock out to command the valley
far below as he approached this van-
tage point he raised his eyes and looked
up along its face into his line of vision
a head was coming a bold black head
running with short curls it wriggled
up on the crest of the rock and an arm
came into view reaching for holds here
and there and in a moment a figure
lifted itself out on the rocks top with
the strength and grace of a cat

  kenset remained where he was ab-
solutely still for it was the figure of a
woman she gathered herself together
tucked a foot beneath her and leaned
back comfortably against a convenient
shelf of the bowlder behind

  and she was as startling a figure as
one would come across in a lifetime
she wore what had once been a good
khaki climbing skirt now it was thin
with long wear faded with washing
and it was ragged from contact with
rock and thorn and bush a mans blue
flannel shirt in the same state of de-
cline covered her shoulders and lay
open at the throat while upon her feet
were the most disreputable pair of knee-
laced boots kenset had ever beheld but
if lie appraised her raiment keenly he
did it swiftly for no one could look
long at her garments who saw her face
above it was in profile to him but
even so it was magnetic as the north
pole a spirited boyish face with a
sturdy small chin a full mouth of rav-

ishing sweetness and a straight nose a
bit tip-tilted

  one hand hung out with the arm on
her raised knee the other trifled idly
with the ragged sole of her boot

  kenset was young and he hadnt seen
a woman for four months-he said to
himself even in that amazed first mo-
ment that he had never seen one like
this girl therefore he stepped softly
out beside the rock and took off his hat

  good afternoon he said

  the girl jumped as if his deep voice
had been a rattlers whiz she was on
her feet in an instant ready to fly and
then seeing him she dropped quietly
down again and smiled

  scared me she said shortly

  but that smile had sent the blood hot
in kensets cheeks for he had looked
full into two eyes as black as thr curls
on her forehead as slow and sleepy and
mysterious as he had always fancied
cleopatras to have been for such
eyes men have lost jobs and wrecked
kingdoms

  im kenset he said ranger and
warden did you hear a shot a few mo-
ments ago over here somewhere

  the girl nodded

  yes over in that wash

  she pointed with a long shapely arm
the index finger out the others curled
under the ancient efficient way

  kenset hesitated

  did you see who fired it

  no

  she looked down at him quietly tak-
ing him in from head to foot with a de-
liberation that was almost insolence

  the interview was ended it seemed
and there was nothing on earth for
kenset to do but raise his hat to her
set it firmly on his head and depart
which he did feeling that he had blun-
dered somehow

  of course there was nothing and no-
body over in that wash he did find
tracks of a big buck made but a few


the popular magazine

moments back in the soft loam but that
was all

  he went home to his high cabin with
more food for thought than he had had
for months

  who was she  where did she live 
where had she come from

  he thought he knew every cabin in
the hills ah that was it the old
tumble-down house at the deserted out-
look mine hed bet she lived there
it was the nearest place possible and he
hadnt been by there for six weeks-
no it was two months and more since
he had ridden that way

  all that evening while he smoked in
his lonely dooryard he conjured her
vital face and listened again to her low-
pitched throaty voice

  he had never seen any such pretty
bold black head as hers before no fore-
head under shining curls like that and
her mouth he felt his blood stir pleas-
antly at memory of it a spirited reck-
less mouth yet full and soft oh she
was wholly adorable and she seemed
in the barest poverty though kenset
knew that the mountain people were a
careless lot

  he had known mine owners worth
more money than he ever hoped to have
to wear such clothes as any hodcarrier
in a city wouldnt be caught out in

  he shook his head knocked the dottle
out of his pipe and went to bed

  once in the week that followed he
heard that defiant shot he pulled mis-
ters mane savagely for he knew he
was being baited and he rode the hills
continually

  on the thursday after that first meet-
ing he came sharply on the girl again
she was coming down a faint small
trail that led from the high brush mead-
ows to a stream below a deer trail cut
and hollowed by light sharp feet that
traveled it nightly

  ho cried the ranger startled
you scared me this time

  yes she said in that case you

oughtnt to be out in these hills alone
theyre full of scares

  so laughed kenset then how
about yourself 

  she shrugged her shoulders expres-
sively and spread out her hands they
were strong-looking hands fine-skinned
and brown

  im not afraid of much she said
succinctly

  youre a stranger hereabouts
asked- kenset

  well no-hardly ive been here
some time

  would you mind telling me where
you live  i thought i knew every habi-
tation in here

with my father she said calmly
kenset blushed feeling like an over-
inquisitive child that has been rebuked

  i beg your pardon he said but the
girl looked up at him and smiled

  you neednt these hill billies are
all inquisitive

 for the love of- look here-

do you take me for a hill billy

  the ranger halfway off his horse
hung arrested in his stirrup and gazed
with angry eyes over his shoulder he
was suddenly and thoroughly mad
well she said slowly i can only
judge by manners

  kenset got down stepped close to
her put deliberate hands on his hips
and searched her smiling face with an
insolence to match her own

  do you know what i think he said
at last too angry to be cautious do
you

  the black eyes returned his gaze
without a quiver first looking into one
of his own then into the other as if
she found the color interesting

  no she answered and i dont
care a cent

  well said kenset i think youre
a badly spoiled child that thinks impu-
dence smartness

  yes

  she flipped a clinging brier from her
in the lonesome land



soiled khaki skirt ran her fingers
through her beautiful black curls and
shook her shoulders

  the little play was as insolent as any-
thing could be-and it set the mans
heart to jumping with sheer joy in her
daring

  and also he said swiftly-the tem-
per was fast ebbing out of him-i
think you are a darling

  yes she drawled well i cant
return the compliment and whats
more youre proving what i said about
manners

  and without another word she turned
back up the faint trail slipped around
a thick growth of young pine and disap-
peared

  kenset went home with more diver-
sified feelings stirring inside him than
he knew what to do with he was hu-
miliated still a bit ruffled ashamed of
his temper and decidedly interested in
this wild juno of the mountains

  but however much of new interest
had sprung up for him in his autumn
solitude he was still keen on the trail
of the poacher last year he had had
no end of trouble with illicit slaughter
of the deer had made an enemy or two
and heard a bold boast that went about
among the old-timers that they had
never been without meat no winter
sence  an no young snipe o a forest
rangerd change the custom

  but this year kenset had decided that
there would be a shining example of
the nations punishment if he caught
them at it

  so he was out early and late about
his business

  he saw the black-haired girl no more
for a week at the end of that time he
determined to go to the old house at
the abandoned outlook

  it was a morning so crisp with frost
in the shadowed places that every light
foot left its telltale mark the dry
needles slipped and slid under misters

careful hoofs and the forest hung still
and glorious

  as they were going gently down a
long shallow slant of the hills there
suddenly cut on the living air that clean
snap that kenset was beginning to
know mister halted so sharply that
he sat back upon his tail and thunder-
ing out of the ferns ahead a great
buck came leaping up along the slope
it was a magnificent animal carrying
eight prongs laid well back on its shoul-
ders and kenset thrilled to his toes as
it went by in such high long leaps as
only a frightened buck can make but
with its disappearance the rangers lips
came together in a grim line and he slid
off mister that shot had been very
near the one who fired it must be
on this same hill he would have small
chance to get away for kenset could
see both ways and anything moving
among the underbrush must attract at-
tention therefore he drew the blue
gun that hung always at his hip and
went forward

  he went boldly though cautiously
for he well knew that he took his life
in his hand many a man was found in
the deer season and always the verdict
was accidentally shot by hunters

  one ranger the less would be slight
catastrophe to the region

  keeping first a treethen a bowlder
then a tree again between him and the
point from which he had heard the shot
he covered the hillside from end to end
he even found the spot where the buck
had been feeding saw the scattered
frosty needles disturbed by its first star-
tled bound but search as he would-
and he wasted two hours-there was
neither trace nor trail of the vandal

  he would have been hugely surprised
had he known that two eyes sharp as a
ferrets watched him from under a big
rock while a cramped hand held an old
rifle along its owners back pressed up
against the sheltering stone

  it was ten oclock when he gave over


the popular magazine

hi search tftounted mister and rode
away he was vexed and at outs with
himself

  but he let himself think of the girl
and whether or not he would find her
at the outlook once in the olden
golden days the outlook had made
millionaires in a night had seen its
blood and buried its dead on the slope
below had sent its name into the great
world and had lost its lead in a day
therefore going the way of all the world
when its heyday is over now it was
but a gloomy tunnel high on a moun-
tain a worn and ancient shack a monu-
mental pile of rust which had been a
forty-stamp mill and a long blue
dump trailing down the hill face like
a soiled and ragged ribbon

  it was solitude and unspeakable
loneliness and desolation materialized
and kenset hoped devoutly that he
would not find her there

  the doors of the house were open
beside the spring which lay sweet and
clear in the trail there hung a tin can
with the top melted off and the trail
bore evidence of use

  out on the rickety porch a man sat
in a shabby wheeled chair his ftmbs
covered by a faded plush lap robe
white hair hung in soft rings about a
fine brow and blue eyes lopked eagerly
down at the stranger as he dismounted
and came up

  come right up sir he cried in a
beautiful old voice glad to see you
unspeakably glad to meet you

  he held out a thill left hand which
kenset took the other lay with the
curious seeming of finality that always
accompanies paralysis in his lap

  he searched the young mans face
with the eagerness of those whose ways
of the outside world have been sharply
shut upon them

  im kenset sir said the ranger
ranger and warden and coming by
this way i thought id stop we have

so few neighbors in the hills that we
must make the most of each other

  you are right indeed my name
is clarendon-colonel clarendon
ninth kentucky volunteers sit down
sir there is another chair inside i
believe if you will kindly fetch it
you see i am not worth much these
days my daughter went out for a
little climb around the hill it is lonely
for a young person but she will soon
be back

  kenset flushed a bit as he stepped in-
side the crazy doorway

 so she did live here and-

holy smoke what utter poverty it
was right then-that first suggestion
of the ragged shoes the frayed old
skirt

  inside there was the very atmos-
phere of bygone days that most un-
speakable sort of loneliness the wistful
air of decay and nonuse

  and there was little else the wide
boards of the floor had been scrubbed to
painful cleanliness there was nothing
on the walls but rotting paper and here
and there pasted flat ancient and ri-
diculous wood cuts taken from papers
one of these bore the date 

  there was a table made of a goods
box two smaller boxes nailed to the
wall with a thin white curtain strung
before them and in the room beyond
kenset could see a pair of springs set
up on small sawed sections of a young
pine tree while iri one corner another
narrower bed was made high on an
abundance of fir boughs whoever had
arranged this interior had made the
best of natures gifts with an aptitude
and quickness that spoke well for life
in these wilds where one had to forego
luxuries

  one uncertain kitchen chair stood be-
side the table which was covered with
a clean white cloth kenset carried it
out and for a long quiet hour he for-
got his vexations in a delightful con-
versation his host had no need to tell
in the lonesome lan



of the old days in the south sir his
every motion attitude and inflection
was a dignified delineation of that bet-
ter time the morning slipped away
and the still shadows of the pines crept
under them heralding the noon and
presently there came a step on the steep
trail by the spring and the girl swung
up to the crazy porch she looked
weary and she carried a battered tin
lardpail full of ripe manzanita berries

  so you foundme out she said to
kenset in a tone that nettled him in-
stantly though he smiled at her with
the inevitable sympathy of youth

  come now miss clarendon there
isnt a reason in the world why we
should quarrel

  he turned to the older man

  i met your daughter on the hill the
other day and she accused me of bad
manners

  daughter daughter said the
colonel though his old eyes softened
with affection im afraid she is a
bit spoiled sir

  she set down the pail and leaned
against the high porch floor

  kenset offered the rickety chair but
she shook her head all the soft black
curls fluffed and fell back again with
the motion and he thought he lpd
never seen anything so entirely en-
trancing	j

  and she suddenly looked up at him
a wistful tired look wholly at vari-
ance with the usual expression of those
imperious eyes

  kenset felt his head go round and
he stooped and picked a berry from
her pail

  what will you do with these he
asked turning the hard dark red little
sphere in his fingers breaking the thin
flaky dry outside from the thick seed

  the girl glanced swiftly at her fa-
ther and then down

  the indians used to make a certain
flour from them she said and i
b

thought id try it you see one cant
get fruit in here

  no broke in the colonel and as
we have been here nearly two months
now our stores of such things are-
ah-running low so to speak

  why began kenset eagerly there
is a stage running from conniston
down below one can order will you

let me-

  no said the girl sharply we have
plenty for the present	

  it was high noon when kenset rose
to leave and though no one in the big
hills allowed a guest to leave at meal-
time neither father nor daughter asked
him to stay though the eagerness in the
old mans voice as he begged him to
come back again caused him to promise

  the girl said nothing sitting inso-
lently against the pdrch post but when
the ranger had ridden jauntily away
down the precipitous trail she flung
herself face down on the worn boards
and wept hard

  darn him she sobbed oh darn
him i wish hed die i do 

  child child quavered the old
man his thin left hand working on the
lap robe let us go out there is

still the money for the journey-

  the girl sat up

  never shecried defiantly arent
you better cant you move both feet
now youll walk by spring never

  and kenset riding in a brown study
along a wash far down came abruptly
upon a man-a slouch-hatted booted
individual tall handsome in a wild
way and grinning

  out fer game warden he asked
thought i heerd a shot somewhere
hereabouts this mornin

  the ranger knew this youth for one
of the reckless spirits of the region-
g c maclaw

  he looked at him keenly

  yes and i shall get him g c he
said sooner or later ill get him and


the povular magazine

hell pay well to the law for his indis-
cretion

  kenset rode on but from that mo-
ment a light seemed to fall upon
things i wonder he mused i
wonder is it g c and could she
care- well if she does that ex-
plains her venom toward me

  but try as he would he could not
accept that version perhaps because of
her beauty and the fact that it gave him
a savage hurt to think of her as being
against him because of another man--
any other man

  a few days later he came upon a
piece of evidence he was going over
the hillside where he had seen the big
buck tearing away from danger and
he was searching it every inch some-
thing seemed to tell him that he must
do this for an hour he hunted
then standing by the big rock from
which those two sharp eyes had watched
him that other day he suddenly stooped
and looked beneath it

  there in a shallow cave lay a gun
he pulled it out and examined it it
was a thirty-thirty and it gave evidence
of long use a worn brown weapon effi-
cient as only a long-used true gun can
be it worked in the hand as softly
and truly as the hand itself its for-
ward sight was handmade a tiny
sharp wedge its rear sight was a late
improved peep bored out a bit for
rapid work he who owned this gun
was a hunter and no mistake

  kenset mused a bit on that bored-out
sight old hunters good hunters
sometimes did this knowing that the eye
would automatically find-the true center
of the hole from the fact that it was
the brightest point therein the outer
rim being darker

  he recalled its voice yapping on the
slopes its keen clean voice

  and yet with all this evidence of
skill he who had fired it had missed
the big buck-had missed at other times
he had reason to believe

 who owned it and why did he
leave it here

  kenset looked it over from butt to
muzzle ah ha just under the fore-
sight on the right side were scrawled
as with a penknife two crude initials-
and they were a g and a c

  triumphantly the ranger put the rifle
back where he had found it but in the
next moment the triumph had wilted
from him like frost in sunlight

  so it was maclaw all right and the
girl knew it and hated him-kenset-
for being so hot on his trail he took
off his hat and ran his fingers through
his hair and he was suddenly tired of
the chase

  but good heavens it wasnt right
to let her waste herself on a man like
g c he lived at brandts saloon up
at the forks-he drank and gambled
and kenset recalled his ugly tongue his
boasts about women

  for ten minutes the ranger stared
down the silent green slopes and when
he turned back to where he had left
mister there was resolve and determi-
nation in his gray eyes

  he rode toward the abandoned out-
look

  but he had no need to hurry for
halfway there he heard her coming
light-footed through the ferns he
stopped and waited and when she came
suddenly upon him he did not lift his
hat

  perhaps she liked the rough-and-
ready sort

  hello kid he said

  he almost quailed at the flash of her
eyes but laughed quietly at her and let
the admiration he felt for her show
plainly through his half-closed lids

  she had stopped close both hands
holding back the ferns her little bold
black head was up and the red lips
were parted over her pretty teeth

  kid she said slowly did-you
-call-me-kid
in the lonesome land



  sure said kenset easily didnt
you call me a hill billy

  get out of my way she said and
passing insolently around misters
heels she raised a hand and struck him
on the flank

  but kenset his heart leaping hard
against his ribs his breath fast in his
throat turned as swiftly and reach-
ing down caught her shoulders in the
curve of his arm he was strong and
he drew her to him hard against his
breast

  beauty he said softly oh you
little wild cat

  he wore on his right hand a heavy
masonic ring the crest of its double-
headed eagles joined by a low-set dia-
mond and a shaft of the brilliant sun-
light coming through the pine tops far
above struck full upon the stone in
its opulent glory it cried to heaven its
contrast with the old blue shirt whose
frayed fringe stopped at the girls el-
bow

  kenset caught that contrast and the
next instant he was hot with shame and
sorrow

  poor she was pitiful in her rags
and she was alone and what business
was it of his if she liked g c 

  in two seconds he was off his horse
his hat was on the ground and he was
holding her hands

  forgive me he cried say what
you will miss clarendon i deserve
it all i cantapologize enough i
i

  but there he floundered stopped at
perfect loss for the girl her face white
as chalk her somber eyes flaming had
opened her mouth with a gasp to flay
him with rage and then the eyes had
suddenly dimmed with tears the lips
quivered pitifully and snatching her
hands away she covered her face and
cried

  she turned her back to him and wept
and kenset felt like a condemned crim-

inal he put a diffident hand on her
shoulder but she shook it off

  miss clarendon he begged i
cant tell you how sorry i am--

  prove it then she cried from the
shelter of her hands go away
quick

  and without a word he obeyed

  for two weeks kenset kept clear of
the outlook he was after maclaw
and the handsome youth grinned at him
and baited him openly at the forks

  try as he would he failed at every-
thing he touched it seemed and he was
torn on the rack beside and then at
the end of that second week he came
upon a circumstance that put him far
at sea

  he heard that maclaw was going to
be married-to a girl at conniston

 what did it mean what did-

  say he sat up in his bed that night
and cold chills went over him he slept
no more and he was out on the hills
at dawn restless driven waiting until
he could decently go to the outlook

  what might not have happened in
those two weeks fool fool that he
had been why had he not investi-
gated 

  he rode to the outlook and his heart
was in his throat he had not waited
for good day so eager had he been
cold blue shadows huge as the hills
themselves lay mysteriously in the hol-
lows white frost sparkled on rock
and drooping fern snakes the wicked
rattlers of the peaks and rocks were
safely holed for the winter-and the
deer were taking their handsome winter
coats it was a glorious country a big
wild country scarce fit for a girl to
roam at will and he fell to thinking of
her as mister picked his way up along
the faint old trail

  the sun was just lifting above the
range when he came around the spring
and saw the shack there was no sign
of life about it the door was a bit


the popular magazine

ajar and kenset felt cold fear at his
heart

  had they gone-disappeared like the
mists of the night a mysterious pair in
a mysterious setting

  he slipped off mister hid him in a
thicket off the trail and went softly up
on the rickety porch pushed the door
wider and entered the blue light of
early morning revealed the pitiful pov-
erty of the place without mercy ken-
set stood a moment searching then
he stopped quiet as a cat and looked
into the other room

  on the springs set on the pine sec-
tions the old man lay asleep his white
hair spread on the folded coat that
served as a pillow a candle and a
worn old bible lay on a box beside him
its unsightliness hidden by a clean white
cloth the narrow bed on the fir
boughs in the corner was empty

  long the ranger looked conscious of
an aching pity and wholly oblivious to
the fact that he was rude beyond apol-
ogy

  then he deliberately went to the
tumble-down kitchen beyond and
searched it from top to bottom

  and a great light grew with his in-
vestigations

  it was spotlessly clean that wistful
place of a forgotten day its old shelves
covered with newspapers its rough
floor scrubbed and polished but it was
bare as a mans palm newly washed

  kenset looked in all the few pots and
pails and there was nothing there on
the bottom shelf there lay the last of
a piece of bacon as big as a boots sole
while beside it stood a shallow dish
half full of a grayish-white mixture
which looked like some kind of batter

  kenset dipped a finger in it and
tasted it

  manzanita he whispered so this
is what she meant and this is all
all

  he straightened up and stared at the
empty shelves and he saw again that

day when he had meant to kiss her-
saw the ragged sleeve of her old blue
shirt against his diamond and the tears
in her black eyes

  he struck a doubled fist softly in
his palm and writhed in real pain was
it possible that one could starve like
this in an abundant land

  ah yes he knew the lonely pock-
ets of the hills and how if one had
not the price and the way it could
easily be done

  and he-he had persecuted her had
suggested that she order-had tried to

kiss her oh he--

  but there he lost his abasing thought
for some one was coming up the trail
some one who stumbled and panted
with whistling breath he could hear
it where he stood and a sweat
prickled out upon him it was so strange
a sound presently a foot struck the
steps slipped off and tried again and
then came up heavy dragging a bur-
dened step that stumbled and all but
failed and then a voice cried amid
its panting and he knew it for her
voice that sweet deep voice which had
thrilled him that first day

  father it cried father and
the exultation in it was beyond descrip-
tion  it waited then it called again
between the heavy breaths

 father dear come out come
quick come quick 

  kenset heard the slow heavy move-
ments of one who could move both
feet getting himself slowly into the old
wheel chair and he waited tense in
every limb until the crazy vehicle
crossed the empty room beyond and
passed through the door

  why daughter why daughter
there was pride ineffable and joy
and relief in the old voice

why what a girl you are now let
us thank god for his bounty my dear
this is indeed famous famous
and the colonel raised his left hand
and sent up to that one who watches
in the lonesome land



over his loved and his own the
quaintest thaftksgiving in the arld

  at its close kenset stepped softly
from his hiding place and deliberately
stood in the doorway behind the chair
he looked across the colonels white
head into a pair of eyes startled to the
point of panic filled with such fear as
he had never beheld

  the girl stood on the top step a
picture in the sharp gold light of the
risen sun she was wet to her knees
with wading some mountain stream
and she was flushed and sweating with
great labor

  in her right hand held by the muzzle
its butt upon the floor there trailed the
old brown gun that kenset had found
beneath the rock while hanging on
her shoulders feet tied across her
breast with one of the laces from her
ragged boots a young spike buck shone
blue in its winter coat

  jcenset had a wild desire to paint her
at that tense moment this diana of the
hills with her game upon her and the
panic in her eyes

  all the triumph went out of her and
she swayed upon her feet

  the gun slipped from her hand and
clattered down the steps

  the red lips ashen now opened and
closed without sound and kenset
springing past the wheel chair caught
her just in time

 i-i- she said thickly and

closed her eyes standing slim and
weary in the circle of his arm

 why-why sir-- quavered the

old man wonderingly how-

and as the magnitude of kensets pres-
ence dawned upon him he picked at the
faded rolse across his knees

  he bowed his head and for a long
moment there was no sound save a
wild hawk screaming in the garge
then the old man looked up the dignity
ofl his years and his simplicity upon
him

  you have caught us sir he said

gently and you will do your duty but
first we must explain so that you will
know it was necessity not wanton law-
lessness that drove my daughter to
break the law we-

  stop sir stop i beg you cried
the ranger hoarsely but the colonel
shook his head

  we came in here in the late summer
because a doctor at-at the soldiers

home told my daughter- she did

realize sir when she went in the des-
peration of poverty that i had fought
on what is now the wrong side-that i
might improve in the high mountains
a neighbor told us of these deserted
habitations in the old mining sites
and so we came with our last resources
because my daughter-my daughter so
loves and guards me sir that she must
needs take any risk that i may walk
again

  he stopped and looked at the girl
with tragic old blue eyes and kensets
arm tightened about her--and the little
spike buck

  but we found our provisions were
-were inadequate and so my daugh-
ter who never held a gun in her life
must rent this blunderbuss from a youth
who comes this way sometimes-i must
not divulge his name for though he
did wrong in the eyes of the law in this
arrangement he would have helped us
greatly she has tried and tried and
ever she missed the pretty creatures
that it wrung her heart to try to kill
for you see sir she had no skill-
and these cartridges cost too much for
practice we-we were-low i might
say on foodstuff and so-so we were
elated this morning you see-

  kenset groaned aloud and gently
loosing his arm he cut the thongs and
took the little buck from her shoulders

  hush he said as the old man
would have added yet more to his dig-
nified justification

  as this brave little girl has hunted
the deer colonel he said so i have


the popular magazine

hunted her for in my blundering i
thought i had my man spotted and i
intended making an example of him
to-

  as you still will sir if you do your
duty said the old warrior gravely

  as i will certainly when i catch
the vandals who shoot for daring
but-he turned to the girl and lifted
the pretty black head no longer bold
and imperious but drooping against the
post of the dilapidated porch-but
more than all my duty all my desire
to uphold the law i stand for is your
welfare to me can you love ever so
little a hil billy like me my young
wild cat  look at me  can you 

  he held her away and forced the
long black eyes to lift themselves to
his

  answer me fairly curly head he
said softly for i have loved you from
that first moment when you climbed out
on the big bowlder that day and i
scared you so

  a his words the red came running
back into the ashen lips and the ador-
able lips curled albeit somewhat trem-
ulously

  scared me she said a bit trembly
i knew you were there when i climbed
up it was i who fired that shot

 well of all- but answer mei

what of a hill billy like me

  she turned the little buck with a
ragged toe and glanced at her father
from the comers of her eyes

  i-i think i like the breed she
said

  kenset reached for her and as his
arm went round her the diamond spar-
kled triumphantly against the faded
flannel shirt

  he held out the other hand to the
colonel

  sir he said with so much joy that
he could not keep his voice quite steady
i have a dandy cabin high up where
the air is ai there is room for us
all-and i have but your consent to
gain before i ride for a preacher down
at conniston

 why-why-- said the colonel
blankly this-this is sudden but
youth-ah youth i mind sir when
i rode a wild way once for a girl who
had my daughters eyes ah yes
ride sir i know a man when i meet
him-and so does my daughter ride

  kenset bowed and kissed the ador-
able lips for the first sweet time as
her mother did before her he said
as he dashed down to where he had hid-
den mister-and mister knew that all
was well for the wisp of mane beneath
the bridle hand lay with its waving
mates and they went a swift journey
down amid the flaming autumn flags

a new kind of shell game

a n abandoned-looking character evidently the victim of too much conviviality
was brought into the baltimore police court on the charge of disorderly
conduct

    whats your business asked the judge

    my business  echoed the prisoner in a dazed manner

    yes said the judge sharply tell me what your business is

    ive got a good business the wretched-looking man answered proudly
    well what is it

    im a conchologist

    a conchologist exclaimed the judge i never heard of such a business
    thats what i am-a conchologist

    explain yourself said the judge severely what do you do

by leavitt ashley knight
author of  the arm of as-samsi  etc

   the perpetual problem of society is the problem of protecting mankind
against the devastations of genius and economic progressthis is one of
the arresting sentences in this noteworthy story and you will understand
its significance when you read of the genius that produced the millennium
engine and created a panic such as this countryhas never equalled and a
money loss unique in the worlds history

time finally enables us to answer
the old vexed question about
armitage and bartlett for
twenty years after the second
industrial revolution historians
fiercely debated whether these two as-
tonishing men were mad those who
said they were agreed that the madness
of armitage was not the madness of
bartlett armitage they said was
money-mad bartlett charity-mad but
others insisted that armitage was noth-
ing but a common self-respecting busi-
ness man of the nineteenth-century type
magnified one hundred diameters as
for bartlett said they he was one of
those rare minds which blossom forth
among mankind once in a millennium
a great-hearted man strangely impelled
at the same time by remorseless logic
and empowered with diabolical inge-
nuity

  now that the outcome of the second
industrial revolution is entirely clear
we know which of these opinions about
the men who precipitated that cata-
clysm is correct a simple report of
the facts will dispel the superstition
which still lingers vigorously in many
quarters

  the facts are these

  in  the railroads of the united
states were in the middle of an era of
healthful prosperity they had entirely
recovered from the long series of politi-
cal attacks that had been directed
against them in the first decade of the
twentieth century even the new york
new haven  hartford was earning
five per cent of wholly honest dividends

  remarkable as this was though it
was overshadowed by the development
of the motor truck and the automobile
highways between  and  no
fewer than  motor trucks were
manufactured annually it was in 
that new york city boston chicago
and detroit passed antihorse laws for-
bidding all animal-drawn vehicles to
traverse their streets small freight
passengers and the mails were by 
almost universally moved about by mo-
tor within the hundred-mile radius of
every large city gone was the famous
old infamous old commuters local
with its sooty locomotive its stifling
cars of tinder and its stiff jolting jog
trot vanished was the leisurely old
rural free delivery postman thumb-
ing through the countrysides post cards
while his white mare ambled along nib-
bling grass by the roadside the en-


the popular magazine

tire country was ribboned with mag-
nificent macadam roads like the lincoln
highway-the first large one to be built
when in august  the great gulf
road from tampa to galveston was
thrown open the enormous interurban
system was complete and you might
have raced over a rock roadbed seventy
feet wide from any city of ten thousand
to any other city of ten thousand in our
country

  it was inevitable that all this should
have affected the railroads but the
effect was much less serious than one
might have guessed prior to the facts
true all local passenger service by rail
had ceased everybody came and went
by motor cycle by car or by motor bus
but the railroads did not complain
tney had never made much money out
of commuters most of whom they had
hauled at from one-fourth to one-half
cent per mile local freight of the
lighter sort too had all been diverted
from the way of steel but once again
the railroad presidents shrugged their
shoulders and said well lose a little
but not enough to make us worry
short-haul freight is expensive and its
a horrible nuisance and they cited
familiar statistics to show that the labor
charges and the delays in handling
mixed car lots of local freight ate up
nearly all the profits and that the big
money for the common carriers all
came from the transporting of bulk
freight over long distances

  hurrah for the motor truck said
president wheeling of the pennsyl-
vania it has swept our tracks clean
of every confounded local train pas-
senger and freight alike and it has
left us with a clear way for solid trains
of coal iron wheat and lumber
thanks to the great god chauffeur we
railways are better off than ever

  on a sun-washed may morning in
 there crawled out of the door of a
great office building in lower broadway

a strange almost comic little car
through the throngs on the sidewalk it
wormed its way to the road and there
halted while a crowd gathered

  it was a weird contrivance that car
it seemed to be made wholly of copper
its wheels carried tires a foot wide and
spokes half an inch thick yet the
whole car was smaller than a five-hun-
dred-dollar runabout the crowd
laughed so did the two men aboard
the car then they started it up broad-
way very slowly and the engine roared
like a hungry tiger roared so loud
that even its muffler seemed like a gauze
veil hung before its fury when the
crowd heard that they followed won-
dering

  a little above forty-second street
the car overhauled two giant no 
motor trucks which were panting des-
perately over an enormous ninety-ton
steel girder the girder rode stolidly
on three sets of wheels and refused to
move more than ten feet a minute the
driver of the little copper car signaled
to the two giants no  to uncouple
they did so while broadway mur-
mured then up dashed the little cop-
per toy slipped beneath the titanic
beam lifted a couple of heavy jacks
screwed them up from the cars plat-
form until they bore firmly against the
girder

  then a lever moved the tiger in the
invisible engine roared again and ninety
tons of metal leaped forward like a
grasshopper

  good lord theyre making thirty
miles an hour a man in the crowd
yelled hysterically then the street lost
its head men shouted as at a victori-
ous army a swarm of motorists raced
after the vanishing copper car far up
broadway traffic policemen were bel-
lowing to its driver halt halt

  but the comic copper car did not halt
on it screamed and overhead the nine-
ty-ton girder raced until it reached a
store in the upper nineties there it
the millennium engine



drew up at the curb and the pursuing
multitudes of motorists saw in a show
window a duplicate of the comic copper
car and on the plate glass in front of
it this sign

 amos bartlett	john armitage

 a host of excited noises rippled
through the crowd and the name of
john armitage rose rhythmically above
the blur of gossip and excitement for
john armitage was -the copper king
he it was who had been the private
secretary of the elder guggenheim from
 to  then in that memorable
wave of religious revivals during the
summer of  the entire guggenheim
family joined the catholic church and
all the guggenheim men became do-
minican friars john armitage headed
the syndicate that bought the guggen-
heim properties and after four years
armitage was the majority stockholder
in the syndicate then the three moun-
tains of pure copper were discovered
on armitage lands in peru men esti-
mated the armitage fortune at eight
hundred million-and that was con-
servative

  then fate played a wild trick she
set a young chap in hartford connecti-
cut at work upon the problem of tem-
pering copper and within ten months
this amos bartlett had discovered the
now well-known process of polarizing
copper atoms it turned the soft metal
into a stuff  times as strong as the
finest vanadium steel the process as
every high-school boy knows was al-
most as cheap as picking up a copper
bar and setting it down again

  but this was not the most startling
quality of the polarized copper one
night while he was monkeying with a
bar over an electric furnace young
bartlett discovered that the coefficient

of expansion had been reduced eighty-
eight per cent while the melting point
had been raised by polarization from
twelve hundred degrees centigrade to
about thirty-five hundred for nearly
a year these facts lingered in amos
bartletts mind as mere curiosities
then one night as he was falling
asleep a great light from within
seemed suddenly to be kindled so he
wrote afterward and i saw in that
vast space which imagination holds but
which lies nowhere between the stars
an engine of polarized copper racing at
a speed invisible to mortal eye racing
with every shaft and bearing red-hot
an engine driven by nitroglycerin
an engine enduring easily the fright-
ful heat of explosives i sprang from
my bed crying like a lunatic i shall
overturn the world 

  remember it was in may  that
the first millennium car driven by ni-
troglycerin burst upon the bewildered
gaze of mankind backed by the im-
measurable fortune of john armitage
the comic little thing in copper was
manufactured simultaneously in eight
stupendous factories and through an
ingenious system sold directly to the
public the engine was of incredible
simplicity-a worm-gear shaft stuck
inside a pipe so the popular saying
ran at the time- selling at one horse
power one dollar bartlett  armitage
cleared at least one hundred dollars 
their smallest cars-five hundred horse
power

  armitage went around chuckling to
himself like a silly schoolboy he
boasted that he would die a multibil-
lionaire he opened a chain of banks
to handle the avalanches of gold that
were pouring into his coffers and yet
at times he scowled sulked and fell into
a strange melancholy  the reason
whereof men soon discovered through
a babbling stenographer in the office of
armitages corporation lawyer the


the popular magazine

worm that gnawed armitages cruel
heart and scheming brain was young
amos bartlett for amos was a con-
necticut yankee-one of the old bart-
jetts from back of farmington ridge
you know and he had joined the cor-
poration of bartlett  armitage with
the explicit and binding agreement that
one amos bartlett own fifty-one per
cent of the stock and be not required to
divulge his secret polarizing process

  in the largest of the bartlett  ar-
mitage factories there stood a huge
low windowless building surrounded
by two high fences of copper wire
through which flowed day and night a
deadly electric current every morn-
ing amos bartlett entered this place
alone an hour later there rolled from
the south end of the structure a mon-
ster emden electric truck bearing ten
thousand tons of polarized copper-
enough for the days output of the eight
factories when unloaded the truck
was heaped with pure copper bars and
swiftly vanished within the house of
myetery

  in november -six months
after the millennium car had been
placed on the market-the four largest
old-style motor-truck firms went sud-
denly into the hands of a receiver ten
days later eleven more announced that
they would close on christmas day
of the two hundred and twenty-one
commercial motor factories which had
been flourishing for years there re-
mained only eight and these eight were
the bartlett  armitage plants

  in january sixty-five of the finest
abandoned factories were bought-by
bartlett  armifage armitage said
he picked them up to avert a national
panic but the only person who be-
lieved him was amos bartlett

  september and harvest in the opu-
lent main street of chamberlain south
dakota there came together of a cool

 autumn morning the twenty bonanza
 farmers of brule county they and
 their families rode in great limousines
 and behind them followed their hired
 men driving giant trucks loaded to the
 top with wheat

    sixty trucks there were each as large
 as a small old-fashioned freight car of
 thirty tons capacity and beneath each
 there purred a millennium engine at
 a signal the parade whirled into the
 missouri river highway and headed
 southeast

   the twenty bonanza farmers of brule
 county were taking their crops to mar-
 ket as their ancestors did of old they
 were going to a breakfast-food factory
 in paterson new jersey and after
 cashing in there farmers families and
 hired men were going over to new
 york for a hilarious week of celebra-
 -tion

   from wheeler to yankton the great
 highway veered northward from the
 missouri and followed the railroad as
 the marketing tourists whirled over the
 macadam at a steady thirty miles an
 hour a small boy in one limousine cried
 out oh mamma what are those
 yellow streaks out there

   the mother looked those my dear
 are steel rails-trains used to run on
 them

    but steel is black objected the lad
    the yellow is rust-thick rust

   at that an older farmer laughed
 harshly and chuckled  weve got em
 at last-those thievin wall street fel-
 lers  fifty years an more theyve been
 squeezin us with their freight rates an
 their rotten service an their dirty poli-
 tics theyve made their millions by
 crookedness an now theyre losin em
 all the millennium engines a great
 victory fer th common people

   the yellow streaks followed the party
 like a specter to sioux city from sioux
 city to chicago from chicago to cleve-
 land from cleveland to paterson
 sometimes there were two streaks
the millennium engine



sometimes four and in the great towns
a hundred in the vast sidings and
switch yards of the old-time railway
centers there stood huddled in a dismal
congestion and hideously forlorn si-
lence miles upon miles of abandoned
box cars hundreds of huge black lo-
comotives clustered about the still
roundhouses cold and unguarded

 why should they be watched 
thieves do not steal worthless things
and all these properties of the greatest
business in america had been reduced
to junk almost overnight the wall
street journal in its famous edition
of the second black friday had esti-
mated conservatively that the millen-
nium engine had cost the united states
as follows

paid-up capital   

estimated market value of

  real-estate holdings  

estimated value of rolling
  stock rails and other equip-
  ment as junk  

realizable assets  

absolute loss    

  add to this the losses of the rail
mills car shops equipment factories
and other industries directly dependent
upon the railway business the wall
street journal computed these to be in
excess of nine hundred million dollars
so the millennium engine in less than
a year had ruined nearly nine billion
dollars worth of property it was the
devilish business ingenuity of armitage
that had accomplished this second in-
dustrial revolution at such a dizzy
speed absolutely sure of the possi-
bilities of the millennium engine the
copper king had flung his entire fortune
into it he had bought up the greatest
mechanical geniuses of the country he
had retained the six cleverest advertis-
ing managers he paid his workmen
a minimum of five dollars a day and
sped up the output of his seventy-three
factories to sixty-six thousand cars a
d-ay on the morning of the second

black friday there were in service on
american highways nearly four million
cars-or one to every thirty inhabit-
ants

  for all these cars bartlett  armi-
tage had received spot cash four hun-
dred millions net profit in six months

  of course the railroads had fought
desperately to hold their long-distance
bulk-freight business but it was a
hopeless struggle in the first place
the freight train was completely out-
stripped by the millennium engine
few persons are aware that the aver-
age speed of the american freight train
in the early twentieth century was only
one mile per hour from the time of
loading to that of unloading this ri-
diculous velocity was due to the un-
avoidable delays in switch yards on
sidings-waiting for clear headway-
and at loading and unloading points it
was clearly proved as early as 
that mule-drawn canal boats hauling
directly from producer to consumer
traveled more than twice as fast as en-
gine-drawn trains on steel rails the
historical reader interested in curious
facts may verify these startling com-
parisons in the railway statistics of that
day

  the second cause of the railroads
failure to compete against the millen-
nium engine was the staggering cost
of making and breaking cargo a ship-
per by rail was obliged to cart his goods
to a freight station dump them onto a
platform have them weighed and
recorded then loaded into a car the
receiving party had to go to his freight
station with teams or motors wait his
turn-which sometimes took half a day
-load his freight and haul it home
perhaps a block perhaps five miles
now all these heavy charges were un-
avoidable they were the consequence
of the railway system itself which by
having a highly specialized roadbed
was compelled to place its receiving and
distributing stations along that roadway


the popular magazine

  the millennium engine on the other
hand loaded at the shippers door and
unloaded at the buyers one man ran
it easily from chicago to new york in
forty hours with sixty tons aboard
unlike thenineteenth-century cars this
one carried steel tires a foot wide and
every highway was rolled as smooth as
a table and as hard as solid rock every
time a millennium engine traversed it

  amos bartletts breakfast coffee
stood untasted and cold behind his
morning newspaper for the day was
the second black friday and the in-
ventor and multimillionaire was reading
the black-bordered wall street journal
which announced that the combined
railroads of america had after long se-
cret conferences confessed themselves
hopelessly bankrupt they declared
that their creditors would not receive
more than twenty-five cents onthe dol-
lar the stockholders would receive
nothing the article continued

  this is the most appalling single disaster in
the worlds history all the money losses of
napoleons wars were trifling beside this
one who is it that must bear the brunt of
the frightful shock the  stockhold-
ers of the railways and affiliated industries
the  stockholders of the banks which
have held the bonds and short-time notes of
the bankrupts and some  other
creditors

  but does the violence of the blow reach no
farther answpr after you have considered
that during the past sixty days  men
have been discharged and are standing on
the street corners wondering dumbly to what
they can turn their hands and how they may
feed their children conductors locomotive
engineers brakemen wipers firemen boiler
makers signalmen trackmen section gangs
gatemen ticket agents freight agents-a
mighty army robbed of the opportunity to
earn a living and to them there look for
bread and clothing a greater more helpless
multitude of eight or ten million women and
children

  if this is the price of progress then better
th old sooty locomotive and the commuters
local and the weary weeks of waiting for
slow freight

  amos bartlett rubbed his brow as

 if something was stinging the inside of
 his head he flung the paper down
 seized his hat and started for his fac-
 tory to prepare the days supply of
 polarized copper

   a doorman in gorgeous uniform
 opened the heavy carved oaken portal
 for the gaunt young man who had in-
 vented an engine and chaos amos
 bartlett stepped out-and his foot came
 down upon something soft dumbly
 he glanced down

   on the doorstep lay a gray-haired
 woman her dead face contorted by
 some cruel poison beside her two
 dead children in her stiff hand a note
 which as by intuition amos seized and
 read with bulging eyes

    you have robbed me of all i had it was
  only a few shares of pennsylvania stock i
  hope you are enjoying yourself maybe you
  are fiddling nero did when rome burned
  you will say i should have gone to the char-
  ity societies but i will not take doles from
  anybody	sarah mellerton

   not to the factory amos snapped
 to his chauffeur go to mr armi-
 tages-fast too 

    armitage met his partner at the door
 his fat wrinkled chin vibrated mali-
 ciously and he cackled well my
 boy weve got em on the run eh
 told you wed put em under inside two
 years went faster than i figured did
 you clean up on the stock exchange
 what  amos asked dully

   armitage stared uncomprehendingly
 aint you been selling short on rail-
 roads these past two months i tipped
 you off long ago remember say
 boy dont mind telling you that ive
 cleaned up two hundred million at the
 short game ive placed thirty-day sell-
 ing orders on every railroad stock i
 began delivering ten days ago cleaned
  up fifteen points or better

   what are wre going to do about
 this amos broke in sharply and he
 thrust the newspapers tale of horror
 under his partners eyes
the millennium engine



  i guess weve done enough already
armitage winked heavily guess wed
better lie quiet for a while im going
to north africa-hunting trip you
know some of these agitators or fel-
lows that are stung will go dippy and
come after us with a gun better come
along amos

  im going to see this through
amos clicked his jaws

  you want to buy up a lot of bank-
rupt railroads and banks-make twenty
per cent like any junk dealer eh
armitage half shut his wicked eyes
keep away amos sure money but
almighty dangerous youve got half
a billion all in safe stuff-cash or cop-
per or our own stock dont be
greedy

  you dont understand amos
laughed harshly you and i have made
four hundred millions in six months
how by a new engine of my invent-
ing that has wiped out nine billions of
railroad property wiped it out as by
a fire there are honest men and
women starving this morning-all over
america ive got to do something
about it and then he told of what he
had found on his doorstep

  armitage paled a little not a bad
idea amos he wagged his head
well give a few millions to the char-
ities relief fund yknow tell our
advertising managers to get the stunt
run as reading matter in all the papers
will keep the cranks away yep fine
idea my boy put me down for-mmm
-well ill begin with a million if
people cheer ill follow it up with
more

  that doesnt sound right to me
amos frowned those poor devils
dont need charity its an insult to
them they need work-honest work
they need to be-well insured ajainst
the horrible losses theyve suffered

  insured armitage stared in
comic bewilderment what the devil
dye mean

  its simple now that i get to think-
ing about it amos rushed along
here ive invented an engine that has
done more damage than all the fires and
earthquakes and wars of the last fifty
years it has ruined people who arent
to blame for the ruin at all they
werent careless they werent doing
anything wrong the thing hit them
like a cyclone-out of clear sky
humph snorted armitage
thats the fortunes of business
every man takes that sort of chance
-just as he does with fire and cy-
clones

  but the sensible man takes out in-
surance against fire and cyclones and
death amos broke in excitedly why
armitage theres insurance against al-
most every sort of calamity to-day the
employers liability law is insurance
against accidents around machinery
over in germany and france the gov-
ernments insure everybody against sick-
ness old age and death in england
the insurance companies insure thou-
sands of people against bankruptcy
burglary defalcation and a hundred

other business misfortunes-

  sure armitage half sneered

but-

  theres no but amos sprang up
a new light in his swift gray eyes if
people can be insured against ordinary
bankruptcy and other losses they can
be insured against progress

  arc you out of your head my boy
armitage put his hands on bartletts
shoulders

  never clearer in my life i see
everything in a new light thats it
thats it armitage progress its
the great curse and the greatest bless-
ing in the world its like a fire that
burns a forest to the roots mid enriches
the land with the ashes ilfs a disease
that wracks a man horribly and then
leaves him in better health than ever

  now if some of us are allowed to
reap the rewards of progress under the


the cppulr magazine

protection of patents or by processes
which the government allows us to keep
secret why in simple justice ought not
those who suffer through our prosperity
be somehow protected

  they are protected armitage per-
sisted stubbornly look at the chari-
ties-thousands of em-every kind-
loan associations and all that-

  rot armitage bartlett sneered
would you be willing to cease insuring
this fine house of yours against fire
and when it burns to the ground would
you go whimpering to the united char-
ities society and say good people my
home is destroyed give me shelter for
the night and to-morrow please build
me a nice new home-a little twenty-
five-thousand-dollar one will do seeing
that i am an object of charity 

  insurance is another thing-

  it is as things are but it ought
not be thats my point armitage
men have insured themselves against
the lesser evils and against the greater
ones which happen often and with vis-
ible violence but heres a tremendous
evil which strikes somewhat indirectly
indirect but its course is perfectly clear
it cant be suppressed because progress
is the most precious thing in the world
why not pay a fair price then for this
precious thing why not pay for its
damages

  people cant take out insurance after
the house has burned armitage pro-
tested feebly

  your mind smiled bartlett is
under the spell of law im not think-
ing of law im thinking of the empty
bellies of those two million poor devils
who are standing on the street corners
this morning

  what are you going to do amos
the copper king asked with hardening
voice

  im going to washington to see the
president of the united states the
inventor rose and headed for the door
and by the way armitage id like to

have you give me power of attorney
over-well say about five hundred mil-
lion dollars of your wealth

youre out of your wits armitage
raged i wont let you give any such

wad away to a pack of bankrupts-

i wont give it away but i may in-
vest it at a pretty low interest rate
no sir ill give you five million
for relieving distress-if youll see that
my names decently mentioned but

  then amos said slowly as he set
his hat on his head i withdraw from
the firm-and fny polarizing process
goes with me gpod-by armitage

  hold on there my boy d-d-dont
do anything rash the copper king
chattered like a frightened ape well
-ill-i guess you can have that five
hundred m-m-millions you wont
throw it away will you amos youll
be very careful with it w-wont
you 

  youll get it all back some day
amos smiled call your lawyer
quick

  there remains little to tell but that
little marks one of the great turning
points in the worlds history all day
saturday all day sunday amos bart-
lett toiled over figures in the east office
of the white house around him sat
the haggard financiers of new york-
the stoical pale ruined mill operators
of the pittsburgh district the heartsick
bankers of chicago and the frightened
babbling useless leaders of the senate
and the house the president snapped
out questions now to one now to an-
other amos scribbled commented ar-
gued

  on monday morning came the presi-
dents special message to congress it
called a special session and announced
that the firm of bartlett  armitage
had made the following extraordinary
offer to the government

  i	bartlett  armitage would turn over
to the united states treasury  in
the millennium engine



cash and the highest grade of negotiable
securities-mostly bonds national and muni-
cipal-and would accept in exchange there-
fore united states bonds on which the pay-
ment of the first ten years interest might be
deferred

  	this exchange would be made with the
understanding that the government would
raise a like sum by a special tax upon the
four million millennium cars in operation
and by a special highway toll on all vehicles
and by other means to be selected by con-
gress

  	of the total  thus raised
the government would loan to embarrassed
banks against good security sufficient cash
to enable them to resume business

  	similar loans would be made to factories
and businesses of high standing provided
these might readily manufacture or deal in
other goods than those called for exclusively
by railways all such loans would be made
under the condition that business be imme-
diately resumed and the men who were dis-
charged as a result of the panic be re-
employed

  	the government would buy at its actual
value all real-estate holdings of the bank-
rupt railroads and pay for the same in long-
term bonds if no use could be found for
the land occupied by rails it might be sold
off in small parcels

 	the government would immediately
issue emergency bills and distribute them to
large business enterprises and banks in ex-
change for first-class national and municipal
bonds on the basis of  for every 
par value of bonds this would be done on
condition that the bank or business receiving
the bills resume business within forty-eight
hours after the exchange

 congress met at noon two days
later the panic was over every bank
in the country opened its doors within
a week nearly every large factory was
in full blast

 there remains to note only a para-
graph or two in the presidents special
message after the horrors of the past
fortnight had passed said the presi-
dent

 thanks to the sudden masterly in-
sight of amos bartlett we know to-day
what the greatest task of a government
is and how that task must be faced
and discharged the perpetual prob-
lem of society is the problem of pro-

tecting mankind against the devasta-
tions of genius and economic progress
this cannot be solved by suppressing
genius and making progressiveness a
crime the human race depends for
the continuous furthering of its happi-
ness and welfare upon the revolution-
ary ingenuities of master minds with-
out these we should to-day be living in
caves garbed in the skins of wild beasts
and gnawing roots

  but every revolutionary invention
has played havoc with thousands of in-
nocent honest people the invention of
powder ruined armorers all over eu-
rope the invention of steam engines
ruined whole armies of sailing masters
and coach drivers the invention of
the locomotive ruined the owners of
canal boats and road houses and so
 through the entire list

  it used to be the fashion to say that
there was an industrial revolution in
the late eighteenth century we now
know that there is industrial revolu-
tion sometimes violent and swift some-
times mild and slow it is not an event
it is a continuous flux of affairs the
machinery of life is ahvays changing
always growing more effective it is
always bettering the world in the long
run it is ahvays crushing somebody

  the social and political problems of
the past generation were overwhelm-
ingly problems about insuring people
against the pangs of progress until to-
day men have been blind to this and so
radicals and conservatives alike have
misinterpreted the issue the conserva-
tive did not know that industrial revo-
lution is continuous he thought that
once in a thousand years society might
be upset by some new device but for
the rest of the time business conditions
and political methods were-or ought to
be-immutable uniform static hence
he fought honestly for the preservation
of the status quo

  the radical on the other hand did
not realize that the horrors of the sweat


the popular magazine

shop the sickening congestion in the
city slums the grotesque miasmic ex-
istence in pennsylvania iron mills the
evils of contract labor and reckless im-
migration the absurd injustices of the
law-that was worded to fit conditions
long since extinct-and nearly all other 
acute diseases of the social order at the
beginning of the twentieth century had
their origin in progress itself it was
the railroad that made the crowded
cities it was the inventor with his
power looms peggers and lathes who
filled the upper stories with workmen
it was the telegraph that hastened
agreements between men far apart and
quickened the pace of business appall-
ingly it was the exceeding simplicity
of operating the stocking-knitting ma-
chine and the burnisher and a hundred
other instruments that drewchildren to
the mills where once only men had
toiled

  the radical did not see that the em-
ployers who figured in this whole hide-
ous system were simply doing what
they had been educated to do-what
their fathers before them had done
the radical did not see that the old
rules of business had become monstrous
as a result of the greater intensity of
all business and its wider range and its
vaster proportions

  radical and conservative alike were
in error they did not see that great
men and new ideas are perilous to man-
kind and yet must be encouraged they
are the higher forces of nature and
like sea fire and lightning they are
good servants and bad masters so-
ciety must insure against them by pro-
tective devices and by money neither
radical nor conservative saw that nearly
all of the old-time trusts grew up and
flourished on the strength of some pat-
ent monopoly granted by the state the
harvester trust would have been im-

possible had not the government allowed
inventors to own and traffic in their
revolutionary devices the standard
oil company would have had a much
more modest career if it had not been
auowed to buy and control secret refin-
ing processes and patent machinery and
to use the same in competition regard-
less of consequences the telephone
trust coirfd not have become the most
powerful of its day but for the hun-
dreds of patents it controlled

  ninety-nine times out of a hundred
such patent monopolies worked injuries
too slight or too diffuse to be discerned
clearly at the time but nobody was
looking for injuries had a careful
seeker done so he would have discov- 
ered hundreds of little factories that
had been closed thousands of men
thrown out of work scores of firms
brought into bankruptcy

  the old-fashioned individualist and
the radical friend of progress seem to
have combined in writing the patent
laws and the result seen in the light
of a later day was weird and ghastly
virtually they said to the man with a
revolutionary device you have had a
great thought you deserve a rich re-
ward to encourage you and others
in the way  of economic progress we
shall make you absolute master of your
device for many years you may ruin
all your competitors and thereby throw
thousands of men out of work you
may make worthless thousands of rival
machines people may not like that
but theyll have t endure it it is the
price of progress

  hereafter we shall say enjoy the
rewards of your patent up to the point
where its manufacture causes disaster
from that point on the government will
control it so as to prevent or at least
compensate for the pangs of prog-

the high lander of the fannie
jackson

by william slavens mcnutt

 author of at thq moon trails end etc

the attempt that was made to make a respectable chauffeur out of a toughened sailor whose

   home had been on the sea gambling his life

tom hunt opened his huge
rope-roughened fist and four
hundred dollars in gold clanged
on the polished bar
igive us a drink he ordered thickly
set em up for the house come on
everybody were goin to have a whole
flock o drinks

  captain ellis of the codfisherman
fannie jackson the old man under
whose stern command tom hunt had
been through the long months of bitter
work in the bering sea slapped him
familiarly on the back

  show em a little speed there tom
old boy he counseled well make
em all sit up ahd watch our smoke to-
night

  the crowd in the brilliantly lit and
elegantly decorated saloon breasted the
bar three deep one and all they lifted
their glasses in salute to the tall broad-
shouldered young man ungainly in his
ill-fitting and palpably new shore
clothes who had bought

  the captains roving eye caught sight
of the marine reporter of the seattle
enterprise coming through the door
and he beckoned to him

  meet tom hunt the high lander of
the fannie jackson  he introduced him

  hunt gulped his whisky and en-
veloped the reporters hand - with his
own huge paw

  glad to know you he greeted him
  

 in the stormy dark against demoniacal winds

 i read your piece in the paper this
 mornin about our gettin into port
 that was a nice piece you wrote

   he picked several twenties from his
 pile of gold on the bar and tendered
 them to the reporter

   take one he invited go ahead
 need more take em all

   no keep your money the reporter
 laughingly protested

   take one you fool the captain
 whispered hell only blow it all any-
 how	

   well ill buy the house a drink with
 this one the reporter conceded hey
 pete give us all a drink to the good
 health of the high lander of the fannie
 jackson

   thats me hunt nodded gravely
 the high lander of the fannie jack-
 son caught more fish by a third than

  class is right

  well lets have another drink im

  heres to the high lander of the
fannie jackson  the crowd roared as
the glasses were lifted

  thats me hunt acknowledged
loudly an were goin to go some
well crack on all sail an drive her to
glory to-night stay writh me boys

  a little past midnight the desk ser-
geant at headquarters opened the door
of the reporters room

  guy beat up in a king street sa-
loon he informed the man on late
watch

  bad

  i dunno he looks it they got him
upstairs

  wearily the reporter ascended to the
hospital and gazed with a bored eye at
the bloody remnant of the high lander
of the fannie jackson

  live he queried of the young in-
terne

  sure hes beat up pretty bad but
hell pull through he threw back the
blanket from the still form on the cot
and nodded at the huge beautifully
muscled body give that the once
over

  some man

  hes a wonder

  any money 

  clean as a sea gull you might get
his name from some papers hes got in
his coat there

  ah hes no good to me unless he
croaks the reporter scorned him
whistle me up if it looks bad for him
will you 

  tom slowly opened his eyes gazed
up at a white ceiling to either side of
him at the rows of white cots each dis-
torted with its lump of human misery
felt gingerly of the bandages on his
head and methodically set his brain to
work to figure out his situation

  a young white-capped nurse with
brown hair and mischievous dark eyes
stopped by his bedside and smiled down
at him

  how do you feel now  she in-
quired

  tom regarded her gravely all
right he replied say could you find
out for me if theres any money in my

clothes 

  i know there isnt any you didnt
have a cent

  what day is this

  friday

  an we only got paid yesterday
gee they got me quick didnt they 

  did you have some money yester-
day

  i had about eight hundred dollars

  the girl gave a quick gasp of sym-
pathy and gently touched his shoulder
oh thats too bad im sorry you
be a good boy now and well have you
out of here in short order

  lie was a handsome fellow in a big-
featured aggressive way and his gray
eyes were frank and clean looking she
smiled archly at him patted his shoul-
der again and tripped away

  tom watched her until she had left
the ward and then relaxed with a deep
sigh unconsciously he caressed the
spot on his shoulder where her fingers
had rested his eyes as he stared at the
ceiling were misty and tender but his
big jaw was set in the way that made
mates love him when there was a risky
bit of quick work to be done at sea
and hate and fear him at all other times

  me for that he whispered you
bet

  tom had probably never heard of
the high lander of the fannie jackson 

othellos method of enthralling the
choice of his heart but instinctively he
copied it a good-looking young man
who has spent a score of his twenty-
eight years at sea and can tell of his
adventures in a terse crudely dramatic
way might tnterest an older and less im-
pressionable girl than grace summers

  her father was a wealthy real-estate
man and her motive for serving in the
hospital was not a financial one she
had dabbled in sociology and was in-
terested in types

  she formed the habit of lingering
often by his bedside to hearken to his
stories of his life and works on the
seven seas and in the ports of the
world

  and from his stories she gathered a
dim realization of the tragic futility of
a sailors life a sense of the irony of
the pittance paid men for facing death
ind hardship at sea

  but youve had big pay days from
your fishing trips north she reminded
him once why dont you save your
money when you do get it

never could seem to catch on

  oh its a shame for a big natu-
rally intelligent fellow like you to lead
such a life the girl broke out i
wont let you you wait im going to
see that you do catch on

  the next day she appeared radiant
good news she called gayly-
youre to go out to my home and go
to work for daddy they need a man

around the place just now for some
light work and by the time youre
strong again you can learn to run the
car and hell keep you as a chauffeur
isnt that great

  you bet

  do you think youd like to run an
automobile

  i like anything that goes-goes high
or-or fast he said hesitantly his eyes
gldwing

  do you think you can learn to run
it all right

  the man who could tie a rose knot go
aloft on any ship in stygian darkness
and lay his hand on any designated rope
or furl a flying jib in a howling gale
when the vessel was burying her bow-
sprit deep in mountainous waves at
every plunge regarded her blankly

  why not  he inquired

  egotist she laughed at him pertly
you can leave here in two or three
-days now and well take you right out
home

  she hurried away filled with the
warm glow of self-appreciation she
would have felt had she found a crip-
pled orphan child a home

  tom lay back on his cot and in his
eyes was the distant look of men who
embark on long voyages with full

suitors as they came with one quick
glance and knew them one and all for
his inferiors

  after his second month with the
summers he undertook a course in auto-

night school the same ebullient rest-
less energy that had brought him to

drove his brain through work in one
year that it would take the average man
four years to accomplish

  not a word or action of the men of
breeding and education with whom he
came in contact escaped him he noted
all they did or did not do and copied
them religiously

  at the end of the year the quaker
car company offered him a job and he
left the summers to take it

  in six months he was made a sales-
man he was a striking figure of a
man wore good clothes with an air
used good english in a blunt com-
pelling way knew the strong points of
the quaker cars and the weak points
of prospective buyers six months later
he was made manager of the seattle
branch and celebrated the promotion
by calling up grace and asking her to
go for a drive with him

  it was the first time he had spoken
to her except at accidental meetings on
the street since he had left her fathers

  far out on the bothell road where
the highway was a fragrant tunnel be-
tween the tangled walls of the forest
high roofed by the overarching green
boughs of the giant spruce and hem-

the girl beside him

 ive made good havent i  he asked
abruptly

  tom you surely have she assured
him proudly beyond everything i
could have dreamed of for you its
wonderful

  t havent got much money yet he
went on gravely but ill be rich in a
couple of years im oh the inside in
some real-estate deals that cant lose
this shore game is easy when you catch
on right

  he stared thoughtfully into the green
twilight of the forest for a time and
then turned to her

  when ive got as much money as
your father will you marry me

 why-why tom what do you
mean 

  you know what i mean will you 

 you- why tom you mustnt

ask me that i- why i never

thought of such a thing

  why not you think of it when
these other men take you out and im a
better man than any one of them you
know why not

  i-i dont-love you

  i can make you will you give me a
chance 

  she was possessed of a panicky desire
to jump from the machine and run she
had never thought of him before ex-
cept as a sociological experiment of
which she was proud and never before
had she sensed his formidable strength
now the tremendous pulsant power of
him frightened and repelled her she
tried to be indignant and was angered
because she could not when she an-
swered him her tone was half fright-
ened and half sulky

  no and you mustnt see me any

more after-after- take me home

please

  why i love you more than any
one else ever will when i first saw
you in the hospital i made up my mind
to have you you can see what ive done
with myself with that end in view do
you know any other man who would do
as much ive been straight for two
years im a success i know that
theres no reason for you to be ashamed

  she was trembling uncontrollably and
crying i want you to-to take me
home now it-it isnt fair for you to
act like this after--i-got you your

start and-

  why not he laid his hand gently
on her arm and she recoiled from him
with a scream of fright

  dont you touch me she cried hys-
terically oh you brute you dont
you dare to touch me

  a headstone on the island of tahiti
and another on the shore of the arctic
ocean marked the last-resting places of
two men who had seen the expression
that came over hunts face then both
of them had witnessed it immediately
prior to their violent demise when he
spoke it was in the same velvety voice
with which he had warned each of the
men mentioned to keep away from him

  dont be afraid i wont touch you
but tell me why

  oh cant you see the girl sobbed
it-its impossible tom i dont want
to hurt your feelings but you-you
make me dont you see that you-you

are-i-

  i see all right he interrupted her
so thats it no matter what i make
of myself to you im just the drunken
sailor that was lugged into the hospital
after hed been rolled in a saloon i
see

  he started the engine and turned the
car toward the city

 im sorry tom	

  oh thats all right

  he lolled back easily on the cushions
with his eyes fastened on the road
ahead she glanced at him furtively
and saw the ghost of an ironic smile on
his wide firm lips the continued
silence grew unendurable to her

  you-youll find some one else
tom she assured him tremulously

some one who-

  i dont want anybody else

  there was nothing melodramatic
about it it was a simple statement of
fact simply made a score of trite
consolatory phrases came to her lips
and balked at the absurdity of anoint-
ing this mans wound with words

  still with the ghost of an acid smile
playing about his lips he guided the
car up to the curb before her house and
helped her out

  tom-please please dont do any-
thing youll be sorry for she begged as
he climbed back into the car

  his eyes traveled over her in a slow
appraising survey when he spoke it was
impersonally as of a third and absent
person

  you could have made a fine man of
me he said regretfully its too bad

  he threw in the clutch and the car
shot away down the street

 it was nearly sundown when he
reached the garage he put up the car
changed to a jersey a pair of grease-
stiffened overalls and a crumpled cap
as he strolled leisurely down pike
street he thrust his hands into his pock-
ets and hunched his shoulders his slow
gait took on the insolent roll of the
sailor ashore in search of trouble and
his fixed smile grew broader and more
bitter

  on a viaduct running over the rail-
road tracks to the water front he
stopped the sun had set but the west-
ern sky was a vast golden flame and
etched black against its brilliance tow-
ered the lofty spars of five big square-
rigged cannerymen loading for the
spring voyage north every yard and
rope in their rigging spoke to him of
wild black nights aloft gambling his
life in the storm dark against demoni-
acal winds flying sodden canvas and
wildly plunging groaning masts as they
jerked in great erratic circles to the
mighty surge of the angered sea of
long watches on flooded decks the
brain-deadening roar of the breakers on

 a mountainous coast the splintering
 crash of broken masts and the rending
 death crunch of a stout hftll on the
 jagged rocks

   just a drunken mutt he muttered
 to himself thats all

   to his left the three topmasts of the
 fannie jackson outfitting for her an-
 nual trip to the far-away icy bering
 showed above the top of a warehouse
 tom made his way to the slipwhere she
 lay and stepped through the little door
 in the picket gate

  hey there what dye want a
 burly blond-mustached man in a side
 door of the warehouse called to him
 im the mate o the fannie jackson
 i am

   well i was high lander of the old
 tub before you ever heard of her an i

can lick any stub-toed swede--

 that ever went mate in her

   the old man strolled up out of the
 cabin and squinted up at the two men

   hello tom he called out

   oh hello cap he squatted on the
 string piece and leaped down onto the
 cluttered deck

   a lashing november rain riding a
 moaning wind made the seattle water
 front a place of chill and gloom the
 afternoon the fannie jackson was
 towed into her slip after six months in
 the bering a few hopeful longshore
 moochers with dry and expectant
 throats who had some claim to ac-
 quaintance with mefmbers of the crew
 shivered on the dock in the cold rain
 and skirling fog praying that the pay
 day would be big and their friends gen-
 erous it was nearly dark when the bat-
 tered and dirty old schooner was at last
 made fast and the gangway run ashore
 the first man up was tom hunt again
 high lander of the fannie jackson

   see you in the sumpter bar at seven
 oclock cap he called back to the old
 man on deck

   the loafers greeted him eagerly

reiterating acquaintanceship real or
fancied he included them all with a
welcoming gesture

  come on boys come have one on
the high lander of the fannie jack-
son

  a boisterous profane avid thirsty
crowd they followed him into the dark
warehouse a slim figure stepped tim-
idly from behind a high pile of crates
and called his name the crowd hes-
itated scowling and muttering at the in-
terruption

  wait for me outside tom growled
curtly and his companions straggled
away the girl he had loved so utterly
came close to him and stood silent nerv-
ously twisting her interlocked fingers
it was too dark for him to see her face

  well he questioned shortly

  tom come-come back please she
faltered you-you mustnt-

  no you dont he interrupted her
harshly i played the game your way
for two years and lost this may be a
rotten game but its mine and the peo-
ple i play it with arent afraid ill get
em dirty with my touch the best i ask
of you is to let me alone

  and then the girl threw her arms
about his neck and pressed her sob-
shaken body close to his great chest

  oh tom forgive me my big boy i
love you i loved you all the time and
never knew it until id lost you afraid
of your touch oh my lover how ive
longed for it all these months tom-
kiss me

  the mate emerged from the ware-
house on to the street and surveyed the
chilled forms of the longshore moochers
huddled miserably in the scant shelter
of the eaves with a surprised eye

  why wheres the high lander he
inquired

  one of the sodden parasites swore
wearily and drew his damp coat collar
closer about his neck

  aw some jane beat us to him he
explained dispiritedly
no luck at all

by bertrand w sinclair

author of  piano   the threatening eye  etc

hitting the trail with two unfortunately-linked families who had agreed
to disagree when they parted company it looked like good fortune for
one branch annihilation for the other-but luck is beyond human ken

all the way from the rolling
country beyond ellensburg to
the wooded foothills of the
coast range bert kerr and
fred bishop had been grouching at each
other not openly for in that case they
would have locked horns and there
would have been a suddan end to their
quarreling and they could not afford
to quarrel of all the party they
were the only two able men kerrs
father was crippled with a poorly
mended broken ankle a man past fifty
barely able to keep his seat on a horse
bishop had with him two sisters mar-
ried and with three children between
them their husbands had gone ahead
on foot across the range a month ear-
lier in search of work besides these
there was a half-witted brother a non-
entity except in the matter of consum-
ing food bishop had four horses and
no money-kerr had a few dollars but
no horses neither his father nor the
women could walk that long rough trail
to the western slope they all wanted
to get across before the snows of com-
ing winter caught them on the dry-land
side of the range horses would carry
them and their few belongings-money
would buy food

  so they joined forces the last of
three dry years had driven them out of
a region never intended by nature for
farming-an arid hot treeless area into
which they had been lured by the prom-

ise of cheap land and abundant crops
the land was cheap enough it could
be had by the quarter section for the
filing fee but the abundant crops
failed to materialize and the kerrs and
bishops gave over the struggle with
sagebrush and sand flies and parching
drouth and set their faces toward the
timbered coast country out of which
they had originally come to make their
fortunes in wheat

  kerr had money to buy grub and
bishop had horses to carry them as i
have said he was little more than a
boy bert kerr slim and wiry slow
of speech but incredibly quick on his
feet bishop was bigger and older and
arrogant according to his size and age
he made the common error of thinking
bert kerr was a trifle afraid of him be-
cause kerr did not flare up at every
slight or grumbling word bishop
drifted into the attitude of the natural
bully it afforded him a certain cheap
satisfaction to see kerr flush and his
black eyes snap-and stilt say nothing
kerr was afraid of him sure  he had
the indian sign on the black-haired kid
and he did not guess that bert was only
holding his peace because bishop owned
a horse that his crippled father must
ride over snoqualmie pass if he were to
get through at all

  three weeks on a trail that was beset
with many a privation and shift brought
them to a noon halt one days journey


the cpocpular magazine

short of the summit on a little creek
whose length was scarce two hundred
yards from where it came spraying over
a cliff to where it merged with a clear
blue lake the tiny stream split a level
bit of treeless flat from there up the
mountains lifted sharp great ragged
peaks guarding snoqualmie pass
through which ran the way to a kindlier
land patches of snow capped the
mountains already the chill of ap-
proaching winter was manifest in the
air even at noon-the day itself cloudy
any hour the snow might strike them

  the days were short and because
they had to get over the mountains be-
fore the first storm piled twenty-foot
drifts in the pass and blocked the way
they hurried through the meal-getting
with the last cup of coffee the women
the children and the old man took horse
and struck the trail their progress
was slow for each animal bore a double
burden and the grade was getting steep

  bishop was lazy and with no one
to shame or frighten him into his full
share of the work he put more and
more of it on kerr now he fooled
away along the creek bed instead of
helping bert wash up the dishes and
pack the outfit so that they could get
on after the others bert said nothing
it had become a daily occurrence the
western man despises a shirker on trail
-any place for that matter but the
man who lies down on camp work is
an especial abomination and latterly
this neglect of bishops had caused him
continual hurry in order to get the out-
fit together and catch up to the others
before it was time to camp again in
the meantime bishop strolled along at
his leisure

  this day kerrs black eyes glowecl as
he rinsed off the tin dishes in the creek

  blast him he muttered at last
for two pins id spread his nose all
over his face id do it in a holy min-
ute if it wasnt for the old man itd
kill him to walk and im broke now

from buying grub to feed this hungry
bunch i guess mister bishopll keep
but wait till we hit snoqualmie falls
or the first place that looks like itll fur-
nish me a job

  he had no more than finished this
brief soliloquy when bishop came
across the creek to him

  gimme a-aw that there fryin
pans the thing he said and reached
for the utensil named theres some
black sand here im goin to wash out
a little of it

  youd better be washin the dirt off
these dishes and helpin me pack kerr
remarked pointedly

  aw youre a pretty good single-
handed packer bishop returned care-
lessly and squatting on his haunches
a few feet away began scooping sand
and gravel into the pan

  bert consoled himself with anticipa-
tion of the future when he would repay
this and like incidents he foresaw a
keen pleasure in giving fred bishop
what was coming to him-the same
being a scientific manhandling that
he could administer it was not a matter
of any doubt to bert kerr-for some
four years earlier and under another
name he had fought in a dozen pre-
liminaries in and around seattle and
boxed his way to a decision over one
lightweight of more than local reputa-
tion a knowledge of offensive and de-
fensive boxing superimposed on natural
fighting instinct put it up to fred bishop
to do the worrying if he had known
lashing the bedding across the sawbuck
pack saddle bert wished fervently that
the time to square accounts was at hand

  he had everything else packed and
now led the horse to the creek where
the dishes were piled he sacked them
and looked over at bishop

  say i want to pack that pan he
observed

  by gosh im gittin colors fred
returned look here

  hang the colors  you can get them
no luck at all



any place this side of the range kerr
retorted impatiently wed better be
hittin the road if we want to catch up
with the rest before dark come on
with the pan 

  you just take a look at this here
bishop persisted

  bert went over to take a look inas-
much as he had half a notion to take the
frying pan away from bishop in the
bottom of the pan among the thin film
of black sand there was not one or two
but a dozen shining specks bert leaned
over interested in spite of himself
bishop was already chattering of pay
dirt there is strange magic in the
sight of the yellow metal taken by a
mans own hands from mother earth
bert watched him winnow out another
batch of dirt then he took the other
pan himself and tried his luck

  for half an hour or more he jiggled
and shook and swirled and got colors
in every pan these he saved picking
them out with a knife point and drop-
ping them into a tiny pill bottle he hap-
pened to have in his pocket

  idly half his mind on fred bishops
shirking overbearing way bert win-
nowed the stuff down to the last grain
in half a dozen pans of dirt it quick-
ened him more than a trifle to see the
dull specks show here and there he
had prospected with his father in real
gold country and he knew likely stuff
and the simpler methods of handling
it there were colors all right plenty
of them but alas not the coarse gold
that spells pay dirt the particles were
woefully minute still there is a most
unholy fascination about gold in the
raw as many a grizzled member of the
prospecting clan will testify bert for-
got for a while about the party trailing
up to the summit ahead he moved a
few steps and tried another place

  after a time he realized with a start
that he should be on the road he had
secured perhaps half a teaspoonful of
stuff in the bottle in which the yellow

specks were almost as numerous as the
grains of black sand out of the lot he
had glearred one real grain of gold it
little bigger than a pinhead but he
could not stay any longer

  i got to pike he declared by
jiminy i wish it was summer and i
could stay with this i might make
wages anyway-i must a got forty or
fifty cents worth there oh well darn
it i got to catch that bunch of pilgrims
or itll be dark on me

  he lashed the cover on his pack

  im goin now he called to bishop
you can bring that pan along with
yuh

  aw theres no  rush bishop
growled

  no bert returned if they make
good time and we have to pitch camp
in the dark youll be the first to holler

  and that it transpired was an ex-
cellent forecast bert plugged along
leading the horse bishop caught up
and passed him the road lifted up
through a crooked gulch after it crossed
the creek climbing always to a greater
height by curves and bends that shut
off all view ahead and though he
hurried the pack horse it was growing
dusk when he turned a bend and met
bishop coming back to see what had
delayed him he chose to rid himself
of some rather pointed remarks

  saw off bert interrupted you
grouch worse than any woman in camp
if youd helped me pack and come along
when i wanted to i wouldnt be so far
behind the less you say to me right
now the quicker well get to camp

  bishop forbore pressing the matter
he growled some sneering reply which
kerr chose to ignore and presently they
came in sight of the others with the
horses staked out and a fire started

  dark the pitch dark of a cloudy
night closed in on them as they un-
packed and set about cooking supper
there was plenty of dry timber dead
and down pine at this camp bert


the popular magazine

built up another fire and made down
a bed for himself and his father close
by it the women and children settled
down bert lay on the ground beside
the blaze a mite disconsolate when
a man has put in three years of hard
work and finds himself walking penni-
less away from the scene of his labors
he is apt to feel as if luck was sadly
against him he helped the old man re-
bandage the sore ankle and fixed the
blankets over him and then resumed
his brooding prone by the fire

  the camp grew hushed except for
the little wind that droned among the
swaying pine tops over behind a clump
of these scrub pines bishop had with-
drawn his bed and started a small blaze
beyond that again the horses grazed
on picket as bert lay staring at the
sinking embers he heard the unmistak-
able sound of a horse struggling on a
rope he listened a second to see if
bishop would straighten him out but
when there was no sign or sound of a
move bert went himself the horse
had quieted but there was always the
chance of the stake rope being foul on
his leg and that if the brute struggled
during the night meant a crippled horse
-and the four were none too many
so bert walked over to make sure

  a straight line to the picketed horses
took him close by the clump of pines
light-footed and treading dry grass
and pine needles he made no more
sound than some nocturnal animal and
as he passed just outside the nimbus of
light cast by bishops fire what he saw
brought him up standing he stared
stole furtively nearer and made sure
then he stepped into the narrow circle
of light bishop sitting cross-legged on
his blankets hastily tucked something in
his pocket and looked up at kerr with
an expression that was part snarl and
part sneer

  what the devil are yuh sneakin
round here for he demanded

  you had that all the time kerr
challenged

  well its none uh your darned busi-
ness is it bishop declared

  of all the miserable petty-larceny
cheap skates i ever got mixed up with
you take the medal berts voice fairly
whistled youve been heeled that
way and you whined about a grub-
stake you-you--

  bishop heaved himself up bodily
what his intentions were bert did not
trouble to ask or wait to see  but
launched a straight-artn blow at his
bulkier trail partner he rocked bish-
ops head with it pivoted on his left toe
and his right fist landed on the others
mouth with a smack such as arises when
one smites the water with the flat of an
oar bishop staggered and rushed into
a clinch in which bert beat a tattoo on
his midriff that almost knocked the
breath out of him

  by this time the women and children
had observed the ruction and each
lifted up his or her voice according
to their individual temperament alto-
gether creating a considerable disturb-
ance the half-witted brother rushed
to bishops assistance berts father
hobbled hastily over in his hand he
carried the camp ax and he shouldered
himself in between the fighting men

  you boys quit it now quit it i tell
yuh first one uh yuh makes another
pass ill rap him over the head with
the handle yuhd ought to be ashamed
uh yuhselves whats all this row about
anyway 

  the entire party variously garbed
surrounded them now and bert kerr
pointed his finger at bishop

  a month ago bert broke out pas-
sionately when we were all gettin
ready to hit the road he pleaded pov-
erty didnt see howhe was going to
feed this layout all the way across
the mountains claimed he was
just about broke and couldnt even
sell his horses ive spent the last
no luck at all



blamed nickel i had feedin him and
his folks and all theyve done is
this-this cheap skate has been pullin
a poor mouth and at the same time
packin around a roll of money big
enough to choke an ox

    aint either bishop brazenly de-
nied

   youre a liar kerr promptly chal-
lenged him i stood right there and
 watched you count off six or seven ten-
dollar bills you say you didnt and
ill take it out of your pocket and shove
it down your throat

   he started for bishop again but his
father menaced him with the ax

  there aint goin to be no more
fightin over a thing like that the old
man declared we all will split up in
the mornin you bishops take your
own trail youre a miserable lot all
around old an crippled as i be im
ashamed to travel with yuh

  that for the time being was the
end of the matter bert went back to
the fire with his father and turned in
but he did not sleep for long hours
he lay staring up at the black veil of
the clouds trying to figure how he
would get a crippled man through sno-
qualmie pass before the snow came
it looked like hard times ahead even
if they did get over and bert wished
fervently that he had a few of the dol-
lars he had cheerfully shared with these
poverty-stricken bishops-who after
all it developed had greater money
resources than he but presently he
dropped into a doze somehow it would
come out all right things always did

  at daybreak he was astir bishop
carefully avoided him and bert went
through the mixed camp outfit and took
all the food he could lay hands on
which was a meager enough supply he
left them enough flour and coffee to get
over the range a matter of two days
travel when he had stacked this by
his blankets he set about cooking break-
fast for himself and his father so did

the others the slatternly sharp-voiced
women keeping up a shrill fire of re-
marks about them kerrs once the
meal was finished bishop hastily
packed his horses and moved his outfit
on bert experienced a real glow of
satisfaction at the visible amount of
damage he had been able to inflict on
the others countenance in their short
set-to

  well dad said he when they had
seen the last horse disappear up the
canon trail were afogt and alone and
a long way from the snoqualmie coun-
try yet maybe i was kinda hasty about
jumpin fred bishop i wish we had
a horse for you to ride -

  we never died a winter yet son
the old man replied i dont blame
yuh i seen him givin yuh the dirty
end of it right along im glad yuh
pasted him good well manage
weve got two weeks grub i
guess bert said hopefully i believe
it would be a good idea for me to scout
around and see if i can pick up a deer
you cant tell there might be a ranch
tucked away in these hills where i could
get a job to carry us over the winter
still i dont like the looks of the
weather

  the wind whistled more strongly
through the pine boughs as day grew
the overcast sky was a dead lowering
gray and it was cold the backbone
of the range lay hidden in drifting
misty vapors

  oh say dad

  bert recollected the bottle of black
sand and gold and brought it forth
telling how he had come by it the old
man poured the stuff into the palm of
his hand and examined it closely

  that pinhead chunk is only about
half the size uh one bishop got bert
said if we had a winters grubstake
dad we might wrk that place and
make wages there might be some-
thing there

  the old man shook his head


the populjlr magazine

  colors thats all he said despond-
ently flour gold you cant save it
ive seen lots uh this bert taint
worth a damn you can get colors any
place along this east slope but no-
body ever struck dirt that paid as much
as three dollars a day

  oh well well make out anyway
bert declared ill go look for that
deer if i dont raise no deer nor any
ranch well pike on this afternoon but
by jiminy i dont like the look of
things it feels like snow

  he did not succeed in getting venison
nor did he sight a ranch two blue
grouse was the extent of his kill but
these fat birds were savory pot meat
he got back to camp easily one weary
eye on the weather and even while
they cooked a bite a few desultory
flakes of snow fluttered down

  they started on making slow time
bert heavily burdened with a shoulder
pack the old man limping painfully
with his sore ankle they gained a
scant five miles that afternoon working
up into higher mountains harried now
and then by squally bursts of sleet and
snow snoqualmie pass looming still
above them was hidden in the murk
of the threatening storm that night
the flakes drove down into the camp
fire with a steady pst pst vanishing in
the flame morning came and they
trudged on through six inches of snow
with a silent eddy of flakes steadily in-
creasing the depth and before ten
oclock the old man lagging a bit be-
hind sat down on a fallen pine trunk
and called his son back

  i kaint go no farther bert he
said brokenly i just kaint drag m
legs  more i guess the old mans
about done

  with a horse youd a been through
the pass by now young kerr said bit-
terly

  he shook his fist up the snow-blurred
canon and cursed the bishop tribe root
and branch then he laid aside his

pack and rifle and with the little ax
began to chop wood for a fire

  bishop nursed a grievance nearly as
painful as his blackened swollen eye
and the raw bruise over one cheek bone
for a few miles then he cheered up
and began to chuckle to himself it was
a pretty fair stroke of business after
all he reflected he didnt think bert
kerr had got much the best of him in
the rap and it was a blamed good
thing to be rid of the pair-now that
they were of no further use to him
kerrs money had come in handy to
grubstake the outfit as long as it lasted
if the blamed fool had no more money
he was just as well satisfied to see the
last of them they t wouldnt be ex-
pecting him fred bishop to be help-
ing them out when they were over the
mountains he had enough to do to
look after this bunch the rest of the
way

  he fingered the roll of bills hoarded
in his pocket a hundred strong
that would help some precious little
of that he was going to waste on this
layout beans and bacon for them till
they struck snoqualmie falls theft
their own men could look after em
jobs or no jobs it did not matter to
bishop that two of these women were
his sisters and all of them blood kin
he had to look out for himself and
he figured that a man with no strings
on him and four horses and a hundred
dollars should do pretty well on the
west side even in the wet season

  thus fred bishop look out for
yourself-that was his code and he
lived by it consistently they hurried
through the pass and got below the
snow line bought enough supplies at a
ranch house to take them on to sno-
qualmie falls once having got them
there bishop took no thought of their
further welfare but packed his bed on
one horse tailed the other two on be-
hind and with these in tow behind his
no luck at all



mount headed on alone toward the
coast before these needy relatives
should make any appreciable inroad on
his hoarded funds one brother-in-law
had a job the rest of the bunch fred
told them bluntly could live on his
wages till they themselves got -work

  all down the fertile valley in which
he traveled and in numerous other fer-
tile valleys of the pacific slope the roll-
ing wheels of time have scattered count-
less opportunities timber and land
and fisheries coal and minerals a splen-
did soil and a climate to match the
dwellers by puget sound draw upon the
natural resources of an inland empire
and flourish accordingly

  but bishop did not get rich he held
his own now and then perhaps he
might have seen himself a thousand or
two ahead of the game no more
if he never experienced the press of
hunger and the discouragement of ab-
solute pennilessness it was because he
looked for and took the best of it al-
ways shared nothing but the knocks
with any partner he ever had and left
the other fellow in the lurch when he
could

  he left snoqualmie falls fully deter-
mined to recross the range in the spring
and prospect that little creek with the
passing of the snows he carried about
with him all that winter the wheat-grain
nugget of gold and the few colors gar-
nered in a bit of paper there might
be something good there he often
thought even if bert kerr who had
done some real prospecting did turn up
his nose at it

  but spring came and bishop did not
go he had a working job for his four
horses there was certain money in
that-a fixed profit and he had
neither the imagination nor that intan-
gible zest for the unknown that spurs
men to take chances to risk anything
on a gamble

  nor did he go the next spring nor for
many succeeding springs and those

seasons lifted him up and down on va-
rious waves of fortune till at last a
bigger wave than all the rest in the
troubled year of  lifted him a little
higher than any of the others and in
its swift unaccountable recession left
him stranded high and dry on the finan-
cial rocks

  he walked out of seattle flat broke
for the first time in seven years
strapped as he had left bert kerr
strapped in the mouth of snoqualmie
pass he walked the ties to ballard a
suburb eight miles out got a meal there
-and a job-hired himself as a laborer
on the milwaukee grade east of the
mountains and was shipped thence with
a score of others in a stinking day
coach

  he reached the scene of his pros-
pective labors and found himself help-
ing to pave the way for steel across the
very rolling arid land where he had
made that abortive attempt at farming
he had looped a topographical loop and
come back to his starting point with less
in his pocket than when he had cursed
the dry hot country and forsaken it
seven years before

  economic stress the dire necessity of
food and clothing makes man a willing
plowhorse bishop held down the
grading job for three months despite
the incessant drive of the bosses then
it ceased the grade was done a long
brown streak of raw earth snaking
away across the land the country
swarmed with idle men turned loose
from the camps

 no use hanging around here
bishop said to himself i guess ill
roll my blankets and hike over through
snoqualmie might strike a winters
job in the woods

  he made inquiries and learned that
the snoqualmie trail no longer ran
through unsettled country settlers had
come in here and there along the mil-
waukee survey-which line almost par-
alleled the old wagon road and crossed
no

the popular magazine

the range through snoqualmie pass on
its way down to the pacific there was
a grading camp or two besides a man
could be reasonably sure of food and
shelter if he were pressed there might
even be work at wages by the way

  bishop made up a shoulder pack of
his blankets and some food he wished
he had a horse but that was only one
of many futile wishes he made horses
were high priced now and his capital
was less than fifty dollars-and that he
might need badly before he got an-
other job

  a weeks hiking along the milwaukee
grade brought him to the foothills over
ground that opened out in more or less
familiar vistas he recalled that other
trip-and wondered idly what had be-
come of bert kerr the country lay
unchanged except that in far hollows
he could descry the painted roofs of
ranch buildings and saw a greater num-
ber of grazing stock from horizon to
the enfolding hills ran the fresh-piled
earth of the grade waiting for the steel

  barrin a ranch or two and that
railroad the country aint changed a
speck he reflected i wonder if any-
body ever prospected that creek by
-jiminy ill lay up there a day or two
an see if i can pan anything them
was good colors me an bert kerr
found might as well a done that long
ago for till the good workin has done
me

  he rounded a hill one forenoon and
walked into a cluster of houses by the
road a post office and store a black-
smith shop and half a dozen shacks
before the store stoop was drawn up a
big gray touring car low-bodied mas-
sive powerful in the tonneau sat a
white-haired man reading a newspaper
bishop laid off his pack and sat down
on the stoop the old man looked over
his paper and nodded pleasantly 

  pack in off the grade he asked
quite a ways with a pack

  you bet it is bishop responded
feelingly

  i hear theyre about ready for track-
layin between here and the pass the
old man remarked be a great thing
for this country

  i spose so bishop agreed yes
theyre waitin for steel laid off all
the graders grades most done be-
tween here n ellensburg 

  the old man resumed his reading
he was well dressed bore all the out-
ward and visible signs of prosperity
and bishop felt diffident about pursuing
the conversation still there was some-
thing familiar about that fine-looking
old man his voice and his features
vexed bishop with his inability to place
him he tried but could not recall
when or where he had seen him before
not until a young man came out of the
store and tossing a package into the
tonneau said to the old man

  theres a box of havanas marks
sent you from spokane dad he was
tickled to death with that last bunch of
beef he wrote me

  bishop shrank back a little the man
stood within five feet of him a little
older looking heavier-bodied but as
peculiarly light and quick in his move-
ments with the same keen dark eyes
and straight black hair bert kerr gave
him a careless glance and went on talk-
ing to his father a good cigar rested
in one corner of his mouth he wore
tailored clothes

  bishop shouldered his pack and took
to the road again sore and envious and
keen to escape recognition bert kerr
by all the signs had made fortune stand
and deliver in the face of his plight
that hurt bishop grievously he felt
abused and he wanted to get away
he took it for granted that bert kerr
would hold a grudge would twit him
with being down and out

  a mile or so beyond the place the
gray car came roaring up behind him
when it drew abreast kerr stopped
no luck at all

iii

  have a lift up the road a ways he
cafled cheerfully headed up the
grade 

  yes over snoqualmie pass bishop
managed to return

  pile in ill drop you where we turn
off kerr invited

  bishop bestowed a doubtful glance
upon him and decided that kerr did not
know him from adams off ox-and
stepped into the toijneau beside the old
man a ride was a ride he had never
been squeamish about accepting favors

  resting on ten-inch upholstery
bishop sat back and watched the car
eat up the road while he himself was
eaten up with envy five miles-six-
ten-and a fork in the road brought the
flying machine to a halt

  heres where we turn off kerr
said sorry we cant boost you over
the summit so long 

  then they were gone a wavering
ribbon of dust streaming white in their
wake as the car rolled down to where
red and white painted buildings be-
tokened a ranch bishop shouldered
his pack and bore on the victim of
mixed sensations

  the next day at noon brought him
up near the little creek and the clear
unruffled sheet of water into which it
emptied here except for the deserted
grade and a small cabin to one side
was no visible change a tiny vegetable
garden surrounded the cabin and a
man sat in the doorway smoking
bishop concluded to try for a meal
the settler greeted him pleasantly and
invited him to eat after the meal they
lit their pipes sitting outside three
hundred yards away the little creek
foamed over its rock wall bishop could
hear the soft murmur where it tum-
bled in spray at the foot and began its
short placid flow to the lake

  ever do any prospectin round
here he inquired craftily

  some the settler returned never
struck anythin like pay dirt though
nothin but colors-flour gold never
was any gold taken out around here but
once-an that was before my time
funny thing too see that little creek
over yonder

  bishop nodded

  old feller name uh kerr an his boy
tried to get through the pass seven year
ago this fall got stalled in the snow
an turned back wintered here-an
darned near starved to death they say
in the spring they struck pay dirt on
this creek-between the falls and the
lake taint over two hundred yards
long that bed they put in a sluice
an peeled her to bed rock worked
four months-an took twenty thousand
dollars never was no pay dirt found
in this country before or since

  bishop looked away to the sky line
blinking running his tongue over his
lips

  thats what they did the rancher
continued they got em a big stock
ranch about twenty miles below here
bert kerr an his old man richern
blazes now they say yes sir twenty
thousand dollars in four months

  after a little bishop took up his bur-
den and went on at the crossing of
the creek he tarried for a look seven
years had not effaced the marks there
were the rotting sluice boxes and the
torn bed of the stream and a great pile
of tailings where the sluice had emptied
on the shore of the lake he stared
at it all a minute and went slowly up
the trail his lower lip sagging in pen-
dulous sullenness

  an i thought i was so blamed smart
ditchin em here he mumbled whin-
ingly twenty thousand dollars all in
a chunk i never did have no luck

the best man wins

by william inglis

   how dan the champion of champions was knocked out twice in one
night and thereby ceased to be the best man in the world and became the
happiest man in the world instead the story of a professional fighter who
took his profession as seriously as any other war lord a nights battle
that will be talked about when the rulers and the wars and ail else of this
day are forgotten

dan odonnell was the best
man in the world no one dis-
puted it that is no one had
offered seriously to dispute it
any time in the last four years which
is not to be wondered at when we con-
sider what had happened to the dis-
putants who came forward in the six
years before that one by one they
had fallen asleep it was dans right
that rocked them the left wasnt of
much service to him he used it only
to chop down the enemys guard -but
then-oh then-swift as the lightning
bolt after the dazzling flash the right
fell upon the victim dan hurled it
like a cannon ball or swung it like a
club the result was always the same
-the enemy whether he were lithe
and swift as dan or half as big again
and correspondingly strong dropped
like six feet of chain

  dan preferred the big ones they
diffused an air of confidence which
spread quickly through the community
brought more people into the house-
with more dollars and besides as a
result of many experiments he had for-
mulated a rule about them-the big-
ger they are the harder they fall-
which you will often hear quoted to
this day though few there are who

know that they are indebted to dan
for the aphorism not that dan ever
cared it was his custom to prove a
fact then docket it in a formula of a
few right words and pass on to new
deeds of glory he was no wordsmith
he was a doer and when i speak of
him as lithe and swift you who know
him to-day as a burly gray man may
laugh if you like at the description
but i do not flatter  him in my day
dan was lithe i have seen him run
the hundred in eleven flat-and in
smooth shoes and without ever having
learned how to start moreover when
the gong rang at the ringside and he
shot out of his corner i always thought
of a charging tiger oh yes he was
lithe and swift

  but all this is neither here nor there
for the thing i want to tell you is how
dan himself dan the wonderful dan
the champion of champions was
knocked out twice in one night and
thereby ceased to be the best man in
the world and became the happiest man
in the world instead there are few
who know about that double knock-out
those who can tell you all about the
one in the ring have eyes that never rise
above the records and the dope book
and those who know most about the
the best

second knock-out are such superior per-
sons that they cannot put two and two
together-which is often a failing of su-
perior persons it is because i have
the honor to be dans friend that i hap-
pen to know the whole history i was
lucky enough that night to know dans
secret and i have kept it for years-
long enough to let the world forget him
so that there will be no danger now
of his identity becoming known for he
scorns to let the world know anything
about his private history

  during the first part of his reign dan
had plenty of entertainment at least
twice a year some good man challenged
him for the championship and on those
occasions after the drudgery of four
weeks training dan enjoyed the pleas-
ure of battle the wild cheers the yells
of the partisans and always at the end
the thunders of applause for him but
the occasions became fewer and fewer
good men were either conquered or
awed dick hillman sent all the way
to australia for a maori giant who was
well known to combine in his person the
grace of apollo and the strength of
hercules

  dan played a practical joke with this
superman having started him rapidly
retreating he swung his right under the
jaw with such force and accuracy that
the giant flew over the ropes and fell
inert upon dick hillman who was
cheering madly for him it was the
only time dan was ever known to laugh
in the-ring for he took his profession as
seriously as any other war lord  he
was more merciful to the champion of
england for he settled him in the
fourth round without leaving a mark
on him or an ache in him and then
took him out to supper and gave him a
thundering benefit the following week

  there followed years of idleness and
undermining luxury dans astute man-
ager gathered a company of strong men
and with them toured the world they
gave able exhibitions of the manly art

 b

man wins	u 

which whetted the appetite of the spec-
tators to the keenest edge then dan
appeased the appetite by putting to sleep
the local pet or champion or strong
boy or whatever he called himself hfe
offered one thousand dollars to any one
who could retain his grip on conscious-
ness during four queensbury rounds
which is to say fifteen minutes in his
deadly company many tried but none
stayed awake i guess that thousand-
dollar bill has long since passed into
the limbo of expired currency

  now fighting keeps a man healthy
and happy and well employed-at least
as well as stockbroking or practicing
law but the consequences of success
in the game are more deadly than those
of success on change or at the bar dan
formed the habit of eating late suppers
and taking too much champagne there-
with also he saw life as the fellow
says he lost his judgment of time and
distance for alcohol robs the eye first
of all he put on flesh far too much
flesh which he had much difficulty to
reduce by strenuous training his old-
time endurance was lacking and his ter-
rific tiger speed was diminished

  the critics knew this talked about
it wrote about it published it to all the
world thereupon a small group of
astute men seeing a chance to get rich
quickly paid the training expenses of
the pride of davenport-iowa-and
backed him against dan in thousands
all the way from one to five down to
four to five at the ringside

  the pride had his fall five seconds
after the first tap of the bell and to
this day there are old friends who quar-
rel bitterly over the question of whether
it was dans right or left that did the
business nobody knows the ex-
pride when asked always makes the
same honest reply namely i just seen
him jump out of his corner-thats all

  poor dan the years that followed
were cruel times for him he toured
the country with his troupe making
the cpocpuljlcr magazine

money so fast that he had to call in a
crowd of hungry and thirsty parasites
to help him spend it his footfall grew
heavier every day and his girth in-
creased slowly-for he was a man of
marvelous constitutional as well as dy-
namic energy-but none the less surely
he was drifting down to soggy decay
only thirty-four years old his temples
once coal black were gray his eyes
were froggy and there were two pink
rolls beneath his chin many wise ones
said too bad we shall soon see
him in the gutter

  and the prophecies might have been
realized if dan odonnell had not hap-
pened to drop in at the fair for the
benefit of the organ fund of st mala-
chis church father morris the par-
ish priest had been a boyhood chum of
the champion and dan wanted to help
him by spending a hundred-dollar bill
at the fair and by bringing in the hun-
dreds of visitors who would be sure to
flock around him so that they could
boast forever after that they had actu-
ally shaken the terrible right hand of
dan odonnell and that he had conde-
scendingly rumbled at them in his deep-
est voice hw are yuh hows the
health 

  like most potentates dan could un-
bend and treat those about him with un-
affected courtesy and make them feel
for at least a few happy moments that
they were his equals he was cheering
the souls of a closely packed crowd by
relating some humorous thing that had
happened to him in melbourne when
his glance fell by chance on a young
woman in a booth across the hall in
which tickets for a drawing for a grand
piano were being sold

  now dan had rushed against the fists
of many a good man and never felt a
shock indeed felt only a pleasant sting
and burn that inspired him to hit his
hardest yet the mere sight of this girl
gave him a shock that jarred every
nerve in his great frame to the ordi-

nary observer she was merely a beau-
tiful girl with kindly eyes that were
both gray and blue and gave a hint of
sadness also she was tall and fair
and her thick hair simply coiled above
her slender neck was a plastic mass of
color that was neither silver nor gold
but had gleams of both

  dan stopped talking as he stared he
had been admired by many women
openly courted by some but all these
had meant nothing but momentary in-
terests trivial incidents along the path
of victory the mere sight of this sweet
and kindly countenance convinced him
that she was the one he hardly dared
breathe in the presence of such a heav-
enly vision he gazed fascinated at
her sad eyes and wished with all his
might that he could cheer her make her
happy make those tired eyes smile
then some subconscious sense warned
him he was staring that his stare would
attract attention to her and the in-
stinct to protect her instantly brought
him back to self-control and he finished
his anecdote and basked in the admira-
tion of his hearers but not for long
he had not shakenmore than thirty
hands when father morris made his
way through the crush and carried him
off

  well dan old boy he said why
were you so anxious to have me rescue
you were my men tearing off your
right-

  say eugene dan interrupted tell
me something who is that girl selling
the grand piano youve got to give
me an introduction

  easy there dan the priest replied
you know what i think of you and
for that reason id be slow to put you
in an awkward position that young
woman is frank oneills niece the fin-
est girl in my parish-and she has no
use for fights or fighting men

  come on was all that dan replied
as he started for the booth and a few
the est man wins



seconds later father morris was pre-
senting him to miss oneill

  pleased to meet you was all that
dan could stammer as she held out her
white hand to be swallowed up in the
thick right fist that had smashed hun-
dreds of men into oblivion for per-
haps three or four seconds he felt dizzy
and conscious of a wild desire to say a
prayer to this divine creature then
the unconquerable fighting spirit that
was the breath of his life asserted it-
self here stood smiling at him the
greatest prize he might ever hope to
win he must make her his friend
make her like him then by persistent
effort he would some day make her his
even as he was now-in every fiber and
atom of him-her man therefore by
a great effort he got himself in hand

  ive taken quite a fancy to pianos
he said how many chances have you
got left on this one

  three hundred and fifty she re-
plied after a glance at a little long red
book

   ill take em said dan and before
she could express surprise he put in
her hand three yellow bills each with
a c on its corners and one yellow
bill similarly marked with an l

  margaret oneill was astounded
could the man be mad no father
morris would never introduce a mad-
man  besides she observed with a
sense of irritation the tranquil and
kindly smile not unmixed with sophis-
tication that her evident confusion
spread upon the rugged features of mr
odonnell rugged features mr
odonnell  could this be the odon-
nell dan odonnell that all the world
was talking about yes he looked like
the pictures she had seen on the first
page of the newspapers ever since she
was a little girl-except that now there
was no trace of the scowl or the glare
that were famous only a little while
out of her convent school she had never
seen a man of this type and her curi-

  osity was piqued it might be interest-
ing to discover whether he was really
human or whether he was merely one of
the grat brutal destructive troglodytes
she supposed such men to be at all
events he seemed quite civilized and
he wore his evening clothes gracefully
enough

  im rather afraid to take so much
money from one person she said by
way of drawing him out

  afraid nothing he exclaimed
no no excuse me i mean you
neednt worry miss oneill it just
comes rolling in to me and thisll be bet-
ter than-well it will do some good
you keep it

  youre sure you wont regret it
she pursued

  sure dead sure he replied easily
i never made a mistake in my life

  the which goes to illustrate the
glorious overwhelming self-confidence
that had made dan the champion of
champions-for most of his life up to
this time had been spent in making one
grave mistake after another but now
he saw a new heaven and a new earth
he felt inspired he would win this
girl and hereafter do nothing but make
her happy perhaps the exaltation he
felt excused his boast

  when the fair was closed for the
evening at half past ten dan was again
at the piano booth

  a little fresh air would do you good
after being cooped in here so long he
said to miss oneill i live over your
way will you let me walk home with
you 

  why mr odonnell she began
i dont know-

 good thank you come on
said dan and they went away together

  margaret oneill was accustomed to
the deference and admiration of all the
young men she knew but she soon de-
cided with a little touch of amusement
that she had never guessed to what
heights admiration and homage could
the populak magazine

  soar until she saw the glistening eyes
and heard the reverent voices of the
young men who swept their hats very
low as they cried good night mr
odonnell clearly forgetting that she
even existed

  now dan was so used to worship that
it had ceased even to bore him auto-
matically he raised his hat bowed
smiled and went on talking with her
while all the time one question was
burning in hi mind should he ask
her  why not  this would be as
good a time as any well then-

  yet somehow the overwhelming tor-
rent of self-confidence that had never
slackened in the face of any gladiator
however truculent had now dwindled
to a mere trickle as dan looked down
at the gentle creature whose daintily
gloved hand rested very very lightly in
the crook of his thick right arm he
wondered what he should say and his
throat grew dry and tight and for the
first time in his life the big fellow trem-
bled with apprehension yet the habit of
courage could not be altogether eclipsed
and he nerved himself for the ordeal by
remembering the old thought that had
cheered him in his early battles bet-
ter be knocked out than back out

  nevertheless his knees were quivering
and his hands were cold and moist
within his gloves as he suddenly stopped
in the little park near her home his
voice was husky he could hardly hear
it above the thumps of his galloping
heart

  miss oneill he rumbled youre
the only woman in the world-under-
stand i love you will you marry
me 

  the sudden stoppage of their walk
had alarmed the girl and dans abrupt
speech fell upon her ears as something
monstrous and absurd yet what
woman was ever offended by this ques-
tion honestly asked in one swift
glance she met dans eager troubled
questioning gaze noted the tremor in

  his voice and that his chin was quiver-
ing and faith she might have looked
at many a worse sight than big dan
presented at that moment she could
not repress a momentary thrill of sym-
pathy and yet a certain fierce maiden-
liness possessed her and she answered
coolly enough

  mr odonnell i cant understand
-how can you say such things to me

i dont know you

  oh yes you do he insisted warm-
ing as he always did in the encounter
with opposition you know all about
me everybody does that goes with
my position

  well-but its simply absurd---
no it aint dan interrupted ex-
cuse me miss oneill for seeming to
contradict you but you see this means
life or death for me im a rough fel-
low all right but im on the level at
that i love you and im going to
marry you-well i didnt mean to say
it that way but thats the truth you
may as well say yes

  it is absurd she insisted i wont
consider such a thing you seem to be
a pleasant man and you might be a
faithful friend-but then pugilism has
little to do with friendship i suppose
look here dan declared a man
that dont stick to his friends is no good
in any game im going to marry you
but just now all youll take me for is a
friend all right just to show you
the kind of a friend i am ill tell you
this from this minute im out of the
game just because you dont like it-
understand and ill tell you some-
thing more im on the water wagon
too from this minute i made a living
before i ever climbed through the ropes
or touched wine ill show you what i
can do and youll see whether you can
trust me or not

  margaret began slowly to walk home-
ward dan feeling embarrassed inas-
much as her silence gave him nothing to
combat stalked beside her eager to
the bbst man wins



plead anxious to convince her yet
tongue-tied by his wholesome ignorance
of the arts of wooing

  ill be going now he told her at the
door i hope you wont think wrong
of me for speaking out so sudden but
youll see-im going to get you good
night

  margaret stood in the vestibule listen-
ing to his footsteps as he went briskly
down the silent street

  he walks she mused like a man
who has never taken no for an-an-
swer  but he will this time i marry
a pugilist the idea

  and yet there was something not al-
together displeasing in the honest ad-
miration of the troglodyte and in the
masterful way he said im going to
get you

  uncle frank oneill talked of only
one thing at breakfast the next morning
-dan odonnell had given up the
championship resigned thrown it away
made a fool of himself the news-
paper was full of it uncle frank was
grieved shocked outraged

  perhaps he has found some nobler
ambition margaret suggested inno-
cently as she spread the butter very
thin on a delicate bit of toast

  nobler ambition uncle frank
shouted nobler ambition and yet
some of these women want to vote
good lord

  uncle frank experienced another
surprise when he arrived at his office
the door boy almost dumb from hero
worship told him that mr odonnell
was waiting for him the big fellow
greeted him with a wrench of the right
hand and a cordial hw are yuh
hows the health

  whats this i read about you resign-
ing the championship oneill asked

  thats right dan replied im
sick and tired of being run after by a
lot of handshakers i might get
knocked out too by the next fellow that
comes along ten years is long enough

to stay in the game here i want you
to start me in right im going into
real estate now and if youll give me
room here ive got twenty thousand to
put in for my end of it is it a go

  frank oneill was a friend of dans
besides he knew the value of odon-
nells name in achieving that publicity
which is so helpful to the dealer in real
estate before the day was over dans
new desk was standing near his own
and he was teaching the big fellow a
few things about that which is perhaps
the most puzzling business in the world
and finding him an apt pupil

  one day they lunched together a
little ale dan with the steak oneill
asked

  no thanks nothing the big man
answered

  but i thought you athletes always
take ale the host protested

  not me said dan im through
with the whole business-and that
means the booze too

  if i didnt know you for an iron-
clad old bach like myself dan id say
you were in love laughed oneill

  how do you know i aint asked
dan in his deepest rumble i am in
fact and shes the finest lady ever
lived

  he said no name and oneill asked
no questions the ex-champion was
not an easy man to question he never
mentioned the subject again but his
diligence in the new business which was
strange and irksome to him showed that
he was working under the inspiration of
an ideal he was not content to sit
back and wait for the trade to come to
him as many a man with his big repute
might have done but went out and
sought it as diligently as any hustling
youngster he asked the oneills to
the theater one evening and on the wray
home strayed from the rest margaret
with her hand resting daintily  his
arm making no protest they were
halfway across the little park near home
the povular magazine

when he suddenly stopped and faced
her

  heres your tree where i first asked
you he said nodding toward an aged
elm that spread its arms in benediction
over their heads heres your tree
and ill ask you again will you marry
me 

  mr odonnell she replied please
dont spoil our friendship by asking me
that i think you have many fine quali-
ties but im not in love with you i
cant think of marrying you

  why not he insisted and his deep
growling tones thrilled her in spite of
herself

  i have told you why she answered
i am not in love with you though i
like you in many ways-

  heavens and earth youd think
i was an oyster or an egg to be cooked
in many ways dan interrupted impa-
tiently look here i love you and
im going to marry you you can fall
in love with me afterward

  dan threw his arms around her drew
her to him and kissed her she was
very still and her lips were cold they
chilled him and he released her the
pressure of her small hands against his
broad breast drove him backward-him
whom no foe had ever been able to
press backward she uttered no re-
proach im going home now was
all she said as she began to walk away
dan was embarrassed awkward help-
less  yet he could not quit his pursuit
he drew her arm within his with an
unconscious gesture of protection-un-
conscious so far as he was concerned i
mean for she was both conscious of
it and pleased-while he groped for
words that should showt her all he felt
that should convince her and win her

  listen to me margaret he urged
im just as sure to marry you as im
sure im alive you may as well give in
but im not going to bother you by ask-
ing for your steady company and mak-
ing people talk about you im a rough

fellow but you wont mind that after a
while i dont know whether you know
it or not but the odonnells were great
friends of the oneills in ireland ages
ago and fought for them and were loyal
to them well im going to be loyal to
you and any time you give me as much
as one word ill ask you again good
night

  margaret went slowly to her room
deep in thought the fierce strength
and dominance of the man frightened
her she shivered-not altogether with-
out a compensating thrill of delight-
as she remembered how he gathered
her to him with no more effort than if
she were a doll his renunciation ap-
pealed to her appreciation of chivalry-
and yet she could not avoid the thought
that one so bold need not have been so
backward then she reflected that this
wxas unjust-to him when he was seeking
only to spare her and her resentment
against her own injustice made her
sorry for its victim

  he is a dear generous fellow she
thought and this phrase kept running
through her reflections until she fell
asleep

  dan all unconscious of how much he
had advanced his cause walked for
hours lighting a fresh cigar from the
end of each one he finished and always
asking himself why the one woman in
the world should keep on refusing him
it must be his old reputation he con-
cluded and she was too considerate to
refer to it very well then he would
build a new reputation and this he
proceeded to do by continuing to busy
himself as we have already seen toil-
ing as hard as any beginning clerk and
bringing a fine share of business to the
house his health improved too he
often walked to places where other men
would have driven he soon dropped
ten pounds of superfluous weight more
and more the false tissue of high living
tended to disappear so that at the end
of six months he was twenty-five
the best man wins

pounds lighter than when he began and
the two pink rolls had vanished from
beneath his chin and his eyes were
bright and clear

  why i believe hes handsome was
margarets startled thought when sud-
denly she came face to face with him in
the street one day yes he is hand-
some she mused as she answered his
polite greeting hw are yuh  hows
the health she had rather resented
this formula until uncle frank hap-
pened to mention at table one day that
that was his uniform salutation to
princes presidents and friends the
world over	v

  in the meantime the big fellow was
following the plan of campaign he had
announced to margaret he did not
ask her again to marry him indeed
he did not even call at her home she
often was conscious that he was staring
at her from a distance he puzzled her
if he but knew it her belief in hervin-
difference to him was under this treat-
ment rapidly wearing away but poor
honest dan unsophisticated as a boy
knew nothing of the case except that he
was sad and grief-stricken as a healthy
man can be while he kept trying to
puzzle out some reason why she re-
mained obdurate

  and so might things have gone on
to this day if the minnesota marvel had
not sprung effulgent into the firmament
that spans the ring he deserved his
name tall long-armed supple no one
could hit him and he fought like a stag
in the spring his movements were so
swift that the unpracticed eye could not
register them upon the mind what a
man  what a man  professor davis
champion of the northwest was but a
child in his hands the marvel feinted
him into knots jabbed him in the wind
and left him hanging inert on the ropes
after one minute in the third round

  eastward he came vanquishing local
prides and gathering glory and dollars
as he advanced he persuaded peter

slavin to whom dan odonnell retir-
ing had bequeathed his title to engage
in a six-round exhibition at dan me-
guiggans club in the big city arfd poor
peter was laughed and hooted out of
the ring for the marvel had simply
toyed with him prodding him viciously
and snickering as he slipped in atid out
of distance and left him staggering and
utterly bewildered at the finish the
newspapers hailed the minnesota mar-
vel as the find of the century he didnt
have to assume the title of champion-
everybody gave it to him poor peter
had to be content with a few hundreds
of dollars a week as he roamed the
country in the reflected-and very much
diluted-glory of chief sparring part-
ner

  then arose the very important ques-
tion  who was fit to cope with the
marvel  men debated it at home at
the office in field and factory in the
senate-truly-at the clubs in saloons
in eager groups after church in the
street cars-everywhere baseball was
out of season and the newspapers re-
joiced in the problem and bestowed col-
umn after column upon its discussion
and from every place of argument
there came but one reply-the only man
in the world fit to cope with the marvel
was dan odonnell the champion of
champions dan the unbeaten dan the
unbeatable

  but never a word came from dan
reporters went to interview him-and
came back with nothing but unsought
information about desirable factory
sites and villa plots and loft buildings
et cetera not one word would dan
utter fabbut fighting wily ones flaunted
the marvels achievements in his face
but the best they got from dan was a
patronizing grin and the remark he
seems to be a likely fellow

  a change came subtly into the com-
ments upon the situation men began
to quote the adage they never come
back the marvels manager as cun-


the cpopullr magazine

ning a diplomat as ever went dollar
hunting had a letter in all the papers
one monday morning declaring that
while neither he nor his champion de-
sired to drag mr odonnell from his
honorable retirement nothing would
give them greater pleasure than to take
him on any number of rounds before
the club offering the best purse still
not a word from dan from this phase
to open declarations that odonnell in
his best day would not have dared to
meet the marvel was but a short step
dan still grinned amiably the experts
on pugilism printed long articles to
prove that swift and destructive as
dan had always been he never could
have laid a glove on the marvel who
had engaged in sixty battles without re-
ceiving so much as a black eye

  need i continue the details of how
they nagged dan a continuous drop-
ping says the wise man will wear away
a stone-and dan odonnell was no
stone margaret oneill was first at
breakfast one morning and read the
glaring headlines that leaped from the
top of the two last columns of the first
page of the paper dan the unbeaten
defies the marvel

  she hurried back to her room and
did not come down again until the
others had left the table then she sat
a while trying to drink some coffee and
eat delicious toast that tasted dryer than
ashes meanwhile lost in amazement that
her knight could prove recreant it
was with a shock that she realized her
faith in him upon his word upon his
sterling character-all vanished now in
his broken promise she was glad that
she had not yielded to his pleadings
yes she was a lucky girl

  but for all the consolation she got
out of this reflection her eyes were still
so overflowing that she was a long time
in discovering a letter that lay beside
her plate the handwriting was strange
to her and she wondered whose it could

be so big and boyish and unformed
she opened the letter and read

  friend margaret  i trust you will for-
give these few lines which i hope will find
you well but you see i am in a bad position
and it-is only right to let you know this
marvel of minnesota claims no one in
america can face him and i am not going
to let him shame our people and our state

i hate to lose you but then i guess you have
no use for me anyway and anyhow this fel-
low has got to be stopped good-by and
good luck from your friend with respect

daniel odonnell

  silly margaret back to her room
and to bed for the day with a head-
ache-complicated with heartache and
tears whose traces however were suc-
cessfully hidden before she came down
to dinner uncle frank was full of the
news but she had schooled herself all
day to play the indifferent listener

  ill tell you what it is he said in-
dignantly there are mighty few men
who would make the sacrifice dan is
making

  sacrifice she exclaimed and
laughed-she flattered herself that she
achieved a mean little insinuating laugh

  sacrifice yes uncle frank re-
peated dan has a lot of trades on
hand that ought to clear him ten or
twelve thousand dollars theyre all
overboard now because he will be in
training for two months isnt that a

      o

sacrifice besides this fellow may beat
him for its four years since dan had a
real battle while this marvel is in full
practice up and coming all the time

  well i think its horrid for men to
strike each other said margaret and
besides ive heard he made a promise
he wouldnt do it any more i hope the
marvel will slap him out or knock him
down or whatever they gall it

  a poor wish from a friend-thats
all i can say was uncle franks hon-
est criticism of margarets outbreak
he might have said more if she had
not abruptly left the room her cheeks
flushed and tears--could this be pos-
the est man wins



sible with placid margaret-yes tears
flowing in a flood

  oneill tried to win back his nieces
favor next morning but she heard his
pleas coldly and persuaded him that he
had spoken very harshly though he as-
sured her nothing could have been far-
ther from his intent an air of melan-
choly settled upon her and he noticed
that whenever he said a word about
dans training or the prospects of vic-
tory she managed to change the sub-
ject instantly he did not know of
course that she bought a copy of the
evening banner every afternoon and
devoured every word written by left
swing the eminent expert concern-
ing dans fine condition and the phe-
nomenal ability of the marvel

  on the evening of the battle frank
oneill was so wrought up with en-
thusiasm for the game and partisanship
for dan that he could hardly eat his
dinner

  oneill did not see his niece when he
came home at eleven oclock and he
had started up the stairs toward his
room when he heard her call he found
her in the library her back to a read-
ing lamp and a musical journal in her
hand

  well she cried gayly arent you
going to say a word about your wonder-
full battle that you were so excited
about

  shame on such a heartless ques-
tion replied oneill who failed to
observe that her cheeks were pale and
her chin quivering

  oh come she rallied him it
wasnt really as bad as all that wasit

  listen to me said oneill this
nights battle will be talked about when
the rulers and the wars and all else of
this day are forgotten it was terrific
im sorry i was there-but i wouldnt
have missed it- for my life i was wait-
ing at the clubhouse to meet dan and
wish him luck oh if you could only
have seen him as he came driving up to

the door his eye like the eye of an
eagle and his blue chin thrust out in
the moonlight like a great rock in the
sea

   do you feel as good as you look
dan i asked him

   t do he says and i feel sorry
for this young fellow still he brought
it on himself

  i didnt see dan again till he came
into the ring oh but he was a sight
i never saw him look better maybe
he was a little thick in the waist-oh
maybe just a trifle but whod bother
about that in a grand champion like
dan you must have heard the cheer-
ing away up in orchestra hall

  the marvel crunched dans hand
and laughed at him when they were in-
troduced to each other in the middle of
the ring yes he did and hes the
only man living that ever dared to
that vexed dan and he scowled-and
what did this fellow do instead of being
frightened to death like all the others
but laugh at dan behind his hand and
point at him and had bill braley his
manager and buffalo jim grady and
all of them in his corner laughing as if
dan was a foolish clown mad say
dan was black with rage

  when the gong sounded dan was
across the ring in one jump it seemed
to me swinging left right left right
for the young fellows head but the
young fellow was a ghost ill bet you
he leaped backward six feet the first
leap dan after him like a tiger-but
wheres the tiger could catch a stag
that sees him coming full three min-
utes he chased him glaring and scowl-
ing and never laid a glove on the mar-
vel-the impudent marvel laughing all
the time

 second round the same-dan
charging and chasing that long mock-
ing devil slipping away ducking side-
stepping all at once and quick as a flash
the same in the third except that just
before the bell he crouched low and


the popular magazine

stabbed out a straight left like the lick
of a snakes tongue it caught dan on
the mouth and drove his head back

  and im not ashamed to tell you
that i looked up into the dark sky all
smooth and rich like velvet and the big
moon and golden stars shining out
against the blue blackness and i
breathed a prayer for dan no man
can best an enemy he cant reach but
who keeps reaching him there was a
little red trickle down dans chin when
he came out for the fourth but he kept
on chasing the tall young fellow the
marvel would stop running backward
now and then to drive a long straight
left into dans side he never used
his right once

   wait him out dan yells a man
near me make him come to you

   go home to your knitting you
dan roars at him still plunging after
the other my my you should have
heard the cheering

  well whats the use of talking its
all over now dan began to breathe
hard in the eighth after a drive in the
ribs that came in so hard it made his
left knee fly up lord but how that
lean shadow of a fellow did hit but
at that he was ages and ages finishing
the job i dont know but he was right
though for one swing from dan would
drop the best man living at any stage of
the game yes he was right it wasnt
till the seventeenth that dan stopped
in the middle of a plunge both arms
hanging straight down and the hands
wide open then the young fellow came
close and swung left right left right
very fast for the jaw and down went
dan

  carried away by the battle he still
saw before him oneill did not note
the quivering shoulders of his niece or
hear her low half-stifled sobbing

  but wait it wasnt all over with
dan he continued when the ten
was counted they carried him to his
corner and propped him up in his chair

say he was like a sack of meal at first
falling off every way but soon he be-
gan to rally then i saw that he was
trying to get up jim magoun brook-
lyn charley goodwin and all of them
did their best to hold him down but he
flung them off like little boys and got
up on his feet he stood there a mo-
ment waving back and forth and get-
ting his balance its queer there was
hardly a cheer for the winner and by
this time there wasnt a sound in the
arena except the crazy telegraph instru-
ments clattering the news to people far
away

  dan tottered a little caught himself
shook his head to clear it and then
walked straight ahead very slow till
he came against the ropes he ran his
left along the top rope found a post
patted it and held up his right arm
the crowd looked at that terrible right
that had laid so many men low-there
it was the glove still on the fist-and
there were a few low sounds here and
there-sympathy i suppose i was near
blind myself then dan poke

   gentlemen he said ive got noth-
ing at all to say all ive got to say is
i come into the ring once too often and
if i had to get licked im glad i was
licked by an american i remain your
warm and personal friend dan odon-
nell what-

  margaret had flown to the writing
table seized the telephone and asked
for a number which oneill recognized
as the call for dans home

  say he began youre not going
to scold him are you-

  oh uncle frank she cried how
can you then her tone suddenly
changing she inclined her head toward
the telephone is this mr odonnell
yes good do you know my voice
oh dan ive just heard all about it
and i think youre the noblest man in
the world ye-es well yes if you
must have an answer now
the scouts of science

opposite the elevators on the floor where the executive offices of the
american museum of natural history are located is a bulletin board
some forty or fifty names of persons connected with the institution are
lettered on little sliding panels of wood at the top of one column is the
word in at the top of the other out it is the custom of each person whose
name appears on the board to move his personal slide one way or the other when-
ever he comes or goes

    now and then a bronzed and bearded man will step off the elevator and find
his panel so fixed with disuse that he will have to rap it sharply in order to
move it over to the in column perhaps it has been one year or three or five
since he saw it last and registered himself out he is one of the many scouts
of science connected with the museum he may have come from some unknown
land of ice and snow within the polar circle from the smoky seas off the coast
of siberia from the island of new guinea where tropic heat savage beasts and
still more savage men have beset his path day by day or from some other for-
gotten far-off corner of the globe where his life has walked hand in hand with
death but he is glad to be back and after a little rest will be equally glad to set
forth on another quest

    these world wanderers are the real adventurers of modern times-the
drakes and frobishers of science upon them primarily rest the development
and progress of the world they are sent forth by various learned institutions
in europe and america they are the first to visit the loneliest most unknown
corners of the globe if they report that there are new races or new products of
nature to be studied there a large expedition is fitted out and sent forth

    but the scout of science almost always goes alone alone except for his
native followers-and often he is abandoned by these-he follows his adven-
turous course and when he dies under some alien sky his death passes unnoticed
by the world at large his obituary appears in some official publication with
an account of his achievements and that is his sole epitaph

    when he is at home in new york or london the scout of science is busy
writing up his notes or delivering lectures at first he enjoys the smell of the


the ovular magazine

asphalt and the roar of the city then it palls on him and he finds himself looking
over his well-worn campaigning kit cleaning up his firearms and getting ready
for the long road again the men he knows the best and the ones he chums with
are other scouts of science whom he meets on world-end steamers together
they exchange news of what their little fraternity is doing-and who is dead

    this is an uncrowded vocation the men engaged in it have to have peculiar
qualities that are hard to find in a single individual they must be scientifically
trained observers in all the fields of nature they must be fearless and resourceful
and hardy they are paid fairly well but that to them is of little moment what
they crave above all else is to discover new things to visit places where white men
have never been before and to follow the long trail until they reach the end
of all journeying

railroad finance

                      t

the average man cannot understand why a railroad should always be bor-
rowing money it sells its product-transportation-for cash  tickets
in advance and freight on delivery it takes from one to three months
to pay its bills a mercantile business run on these lines could hardly fail
to have money in the bank

     but a railroad curiously enough never gets out of debt it is built with bor-
rowed money and keeps on borrowing as long as itlives but no matter how
much it may owe it generally survives you never hear of a railroad being utterly
abandoned unless it is some short branch line that is of no use to any one

    there are many sound economic reasons however for the railroads almost
unique system of financing which is so intricate that enough books have been
written about it to fill a large library some of these works are well worth
studying for the railroad is the most scientific of all borrowers but no ordi-
nary individual should try to apply its methods of financing to his own private
affairs if he does he is sure to come to grief very quickly

    one reason why a railroad continually needs money is that it is always
wearing out it has to make constant repairs and replacements in track rolling
stock and buildings on a large scale otherwise its physique would become a
patchwork which would be in constant danger of falling apart it is not economi-
cal to buy rails or cars irregularly or in small lots at the same rate at which
the money happens to come in or can be spared the railroad has to buy not
only labor but material in large quantities in order to get the best rates and terms
also it must plan its work for years ahead five hundred miles of new rails
can be laid or ten thousand freight cars purchased at one time cheaper than
rails by the single mile or cars by the hundred money can be borrowed by the
million at low rates and work can be done cheaper on a vast scale than piecemeal
the saving is greater than the interest cost of the money

    railroads study the money markets and the markets for material with equal
care when money is plenty and cheap they buy long-time credit far in excess
of their immediate requirements when money is scarce they supply their
immediate needs by purchasing short-time credit and borrow again to pay their
notes their financial margin of safety is the normal expansion of business
most railroads have to rely on this probable increase when they mortgage their
incomes in this way for years ahead
caught in the net



    but with all its complexity railroad financing is sound in theory great
cities and even national governments proceed on the same principles that they
do not work out satisfactorily in certain instances is due to a very human weak-
ness when money can be borrowed easily railroads like individuals lose cau-
tion and acquire extravagance in such cases the railroad goes into a receivership
and rids itself of its debts through the processes of bankruptcy and reorganiza-
tion then it can resume its borrowing in which respect it differs from the
individual who has experienced the same vicissitudes

a bad defect in a good law

the recent election revealed a very serious and dangerous defect in the
initiative and referendum law as it stands in missouri and some other
states

           this law provides that any bill passed by the legislature must on
petition of ten per cent of the voters be submitted at the next general election for
ratification and if it fails to receive a majority of the votes cast on that amend-
ment the law is dead in addition the courts have held that a referendum petition
automatically suspends the operation of the law until it is ratified at the next
general election

    this opens up three opportunities by which almost any element of the com-
munity may nullify any law to which they object and all three opportunites
were used in the november election

    two years ago-the missouri legislature meets only every other year-a
bill known as the county unit bill was passed this bill was very much desired
by the country districts but was strongly opposed by st louis the legislature
also passed a home rule bill for which kansas city and st louis had been
fighting for twenty years under the present law these cities are practically under
the direct control of the governor of the state

    now immediately st louis got up a referendum petition to refer the county
unit bill to the voters and thereby suspend its operation two years in retaliation
the country districts got up a petition suspending the home rule bill

    for many years it has been almost impossible to get a majority of votes for
any constitutional amendment people who do not feel interested will not vote
on it many vote no consistently on all amendments without any regard to
their value and of course the active enemies of the measure will vote so a
majority of yeses is next to impossible and to make it deadly sure that some
amendments opposed by certain interests should be defeated an initiative petition
was circulated putting on the ballot a constitutional amendment authorizing the
legislature to issue fifty million dollars in road bonds as any tax amendment
will bring dovn a shower of noes like an opossum shaking down persimmons
that of course guaranteed every one of the fifteen proposed amendments would be
overwhelmingly defeated

    they wrere defeated and at least ten of them were good and some of the
laws were urgently needed

     and the worst of it is it has shown the enemies of any legislation a sure way
to postpone a law two years and an almost certain way to defeat it entirely
anybody with a little time and money can get ten per cent of the voters to sign


the popular magazine

a petition against any law as it now stands ten per cent of the voters can
virtually repeal any law passed by the legislature and of course the more
useful a law is the more likely it is to have active enemies

    these defects could be almost entirely overcome by reversing the manner
of voting the law should go into effect when passed by the legislature and
stand in effect until the voters repeal it instead of voting to sustain the law
make it a vote to repeal it thus the burden of securing a majority of affirmative
votes would fall on the enemies of the law instead of its friends this would still
retain the real virtue of the law-the power to repeal notoriously bad legislation
or to initiate laws strongly in demand

investments

it is harder for most persons to invest money wisely than it is to make it but
it should not be any more difficult to invest a hundred or a thousand dollars
so it will be safe and bring an adequate return than to buy a pound of good
coffee

    a good many of us who have laid by a little and are seeking to set it to
work are like a boy just out of school looking for a job we are inclined to
take the first thing that looks halfway decent or else timorous or dissatisfied
we keep on looking until we are tired out in the end we do no better than
if we had taken the first chance some of us too succumb to the temptation
of quick profits and big returns the savings banks three or four per cent a
year looks pretty small when one morning we get a circular letter-usually
beginning my dear friend-offering us confidentially of course ten or a
hundred times as much investments of this kind make a lot of work for the
post-office inspectors and the federal courts

    but the number of sensible investors is increasing they are not guided
by luck avarice or instinct they apply the same principles to buying a bond
or a few shares of stock or a mortgage that they use in purchasing anything
with whose quality they were not intimately and thoroughly acquainted they
go to an honest and established dealer in whatever they are after and trust
largely to his advice and judgment the investment bankers financial standing
and reputation are his chief assets he specializes in learning all he can about
what he sells he is not infallible but he is less likely to err than one who is
inexperienced

    before any large first-class banking house buys a block of bonds it applies
every acid test to them it employs experts and accountants of all kinds the
first question that has to be answered satisfactorily is if the security is safe and
the kind of security that the banking house can pass to its customers with its
indorsement of course there are some investment bankers that are less careful
than others just as there are degrees of thoroughness among merchants in dry
goods or groceries but it is less difficult to pick out a first-class banking firm to
deal with and be guided by its judgment than it is for one who is financially
inexperienced to select unaided a safe security
 the line of least resistance

by harmony herman

    says the poet theres never a law of god or man runs north of 
poetry but not literally true as a matter of fact there is law in alaska
and tills tale has to do with one of the officers of that law and a man who
though a good citizen tried to thwart the officer a story of dog teams
and an indignant warden and a girl gifted with imagination

the average man is a law-abiding
creature not so much because
he has any extravagant regard
for the law as such but because
he is a natural-born imitator and
instinctively follows precedent since
that troublous and mysterious thing
known as the law is after all only legal-
ized precedent it is obvious that when
a man steers clear of the dread shadow
of the penitentiary by strictly follow-
ing a course of self-conscious rectitude
he does so because he is not impelled
in an opposite direction by stronger con-
trary instincts every man takes the
line of least resistance as naturally as
water takes the steepest grade but it
must be borne in mind that the line of
least resistance for one man may be the
line of maximum resistance for another
the line of least resistance for harry
jonas was bounded on both sides by
hard work yet it once led into the twi-
light zone that fringes the outer bound-
ary of the law nevertheless i shall
always maintain that he was a good
citizen

  two or three winters ago harry
jonas and jerry thomas were prospect-
ing on five-mile creek about one hun-
dred and twenty miles from fairbanks
they took in their outfit early in the

fall by dog team by the tedious
process of burning down with wood
fires and hoisting the thawed gravel
with the back-breaking windlass they
bed-rocked a number of holes that
showed nothing better in the pan than
a few insignificant colors along in
february finding that the water had
frozen solid they started a shaft
squarely in the middle of the creek bed
at twenty feet they began to find a few
small water-worn nuggets of gold buf
the water broke in on them unexpect-
edly and they were forced to abandon
the hole another shaft was started at
once to the side of the creek with the
idea of driving under the creek on
bed rock

  by this time the month of march was
well under way and the grub was all
gone the prospectors had bagged a
couple of moose and a sheep the fall be-
fore and they still had a lot of moose
left realizing that the shaft if it were
to be sunk before the following winter
must be sunk without delay since warm
weather would turn the waters of the
creek loose on them and drown them
out they decided to take about four
hundredpounds of moose to fairbanks
and sell it for the money to buy the
needed supplies both were enthusi-


the popular magazine

astically sure that they were right on
top of the elusive pay streak harry it
was decided would make the trip to
town while jerry remained behind to
start the shaft and do what little he
could to sink it deeper 

  there had been a heavy fall of snow
that winter and the trail to fairbanks
was unbroken for the first sixty njiles
harry found it necessary to go ahead
of the dogs with snowshoes to break
dowi the snow so that they could travel
on it and thus double-tripped almost
the whole of the first sixty miles he
would go ahead of the dogs for half a
mile or so and then would return and
fetch up the load as the snow was
too dry and crystallic to pack well even
the snowshoe trail was so soft that the
dogs frequently floundered helplessly
leaving their master to pull the major
portion of the four-hundred-pound
load it was hard heartbreaking work
of the kind that has cast so marty pros-
pectors back on the community as
premature wrecks it took three days
of grueling work to cover the first
forty miles

  march in alaska is a month of high
winds and drifting snows and this
march was no exception to the rule on
the fourth day from camp the wind
commenced to blow and it rose stead-
ily in fury as the day advanced it was
one of those dreaded winds out of a
clear sky as raw and cold as the breath
of death itself it drove the pellets of
crystalline snow hissing through the
air like sand from a sand blast strik-
ing the face they stung like a charge
of salt from a muzzle-loader to face
it taxed human endurance to the ut-
most and only a man of iron muscles
and iron will could have made headway
at all the dogs cowered and whined
as dogs will but at a sharp word of
command they would spring gamely
into the harness in places where there
was no timber of any kind to break the
blast the wind stripped the snow to the

niggerheads baring the ribs of the
earth itself to the storm

  for three days the wind blew un-
abated but on the evening of the fifth
day of travel harry was cheered by
striking the well-broken trail used by
the prospectors on the left fork of the
river in traveling to and from town
the remaining sixty miles to fairbanks
was made in two days of comparatively
easy travel

  it seems that some one with an ax to
grind had been making complaints to
the powers that be- about the lax en-
forcement of the game laws it may
have been the monopolistic meat com-
pany and it may have been some med-
dlesome big-game hunter from the
states who having paid a few dollars
for a hunting license and trailed some
of alaskas big game for an enjoyable
week or so felt himself entirely com-
petent to run the country at any rate
the protest was effective the game
wardens wtere dazed by the receipt of a
dose of hot shot in the form of peremp-
tory orders to enforce the law to the
letter the old warden at fairbanks
contented himself as on similar occa-
sions in times past with putting threat-
ening notices in the papers to the ef-
fect that he was going to raise the very
dickens with all transgressors whose
acts came under his jurisdiction hav-
ing thus fulfilled his duty in the time-
honored manner he sent clippings to
headquarters to show how sincere were
his efforts to carry out his instructions
and retired complacent to his oavn par-
ticular cozy corner -in the nugget sa-
loon to await his monthly remittance-

  his peace of mind was rudely shat-
tered however by the receipt from his
superiors of the wholly gratuitous in-
formation that he was not properly ful-
filling the functions of his office this
insulting statement was rendered all the
more offensive by a further intimation
that his immediate resignation would
not be regarded as a national calamity
the line of least resistance



some one had been carrying tales in the
dark and it was generally believed that
the dusky gentleman flirting with the
woodpile was none other than charley
whiteside who was quickly appointed
to succeed the old warden

  charley was not popular he was a
comparative tenderfoot and was con-
sequently looked on with suspicion by
the old-timers the opinion that he was
an irresponsible buttinsky and trouble
maker found ample justification when
several astonished hunters were haled
before the courts their game confis-
cated and they themselves assessed
fines ranging from one to five hundred
dollars-fines which some lacking the
money were forced to serve out in jail

  thus when harry jonas blew into
town with his load of moose he found
the markets closed to him to make
matters worse some one tipped him off
to the game warden that worthy of-
ficial lost no time in pointing out to him
with well-meaning but needless em-
phasis just which foot he was standing
on one ill-advised word led to an-
other until the discussion reached that
unpleasant stage when personalities
pass current for argument the warden
threatened immediate arrest but he did
not know where the meat had been
cached pending negotiations for its sale
and without that as evidence he had no
case he determined however to spare
no efforts to complete his chain of evi-
dence

  this was shortly after the failure of
the biggest bank of the city and times
were very hard a canvass of the busi-
ness houses quickly convinced harry
that there was no chance of his getting
anything on credit with his partner
away out in the far hills and no grub
in the cabin he realized that his need
would brook no delay he determined
to sell the meat law or no law warden
or no warden

  to find a purchaser was no easy task
but one was finally located in the per-
b

son of peterson an easter creek
operator peterson agreed to pay
eighty dollars for the meat delivered
at his mine twelve miles from town
and paid a few dollars down to bind the
bargain this transaction was made
unfortunately in a saloon where the
bartender happened to be a pal of the
game warden and that gentleman was
not long in learning of the deal

  he accosted the prospector on the
street say i thought i told you not to
sell that meat

  whos been selling any meat he
was asked

  oh you neednt try to bluff re-
turned the warden i know all about
the arrangements you made with peter-
son if you dont turn over the meat
to me right away so i can destroy it
ill run you in

  this was a little too much for the
harassed prospector why you mis-
erable little bunch of cussedness you
for half a cent id break your neck for
you i know you you never were
anything but a half-starved rabbit
strangler until you lied yourself into
this job the trouble with you is youre
overcharged with self-importance and
undercharged with intelligence

  ill just take you along for luck old-
timer if thats the way you feel about
it the warden returned angrily seiz-
ing the prospector by the arm

  not on your life you will said the
latter jerking his arm away youve
got nothing on me unless you produce
the meat and thats where no petty-
larceny little swill swiper like youll
ever find it for a brief moment it
looked to the eager bystanders as if
they were to be treated to the glorious
spectacle of a physical encounter be-
tween two men to their great disap-
pointment however the prospector spat
contemptuously at the feet of the
warden turned and walked unhindered
away

  had harry been a little more diplo-


the votpulacr magazine

matic he might have been able to throw
the warden off his guard until he got
rid of the meat but as it was he roused
the latent stubborn streak in whiteside
who was now determined to humble this
independent prospector the fact that
his duty coincided so perfectly with his
desires spread a hypocritical mantle of
virtue over his splenetic ill will

  the fault of unreasoning stubborn-
ness however was not confined to the
game warden for harry jonas had his
full share having gone this far he
would see the matter through though
it landed him in the penitentiary he
determined to make a dash for it early
next morning figuring that whiteside
would not rise until rather late in the
day once away from the town with
the game he felt that there would be
little danger he left an early call at
the hotel where he was staying and that
proved his undoing the warden by
making judicious inquiries learned of
the early call and his mind leaped to
the correct conclusion that night he
set his alarm three hours ahead

  harry had his load on and the dogs
hitched at six-thirty the next morning
he planned to avoid the center of the
town by crossing the river on the ice
half a mile below the bridge but alas
for well-made plans and wire-drawn
specifications the warden had fol-
lowed him as he left the hotel hoping
to be led directly to the cache but the
dogs racing swiftly in the crisp morn-
ing air had left him behind when they
swung up a cross street reasoning
shrewdly he stationed himself where
the lower road dipped down the graded
bank to the river

  the prospector was congratulating
himself on an easy victory when on
rounding the turn into front street he
spied the warden barely a hundred yards
away and squarely in his path there
was one chance and he took it in-
stinctively

  gee roger gee he shouted to the

leader the dogs swerved sharply and
swung up front street straight for the
center of the town they passed within
a hundred feet of the warden heedless
of his shouted commands to halt

  whiteside taking lesson from the
near encounter of the day before had
thoughtfully provided himself with a
revolver he drew this now half
minded to shoot but decided against it
and gave pursuit it was an uneven
race the sleigh was heavily loaded but
it slipped easily over the hard-packed
frictionless snow at the repeated cry
of mush boys mush the three dogs
broke into a gallop that quickly carried
them away from the slow-moving war-
den harry having discarded the gee
pole as soon as he struck the good trail
was steering by the handle bars half
riding half running he was barely able
to keep up with the galloping dogs

  they passed a grocery store where
the industrious proprietor was sweeping
out for the day he glanced up curi-
ously as the racing sleigh dashed past
but he made no comment not even
when the game warden jostled him
rudely aside as he bounded into the
store and jerked the telephone from its
hook

  a sleepy patrolman nodding foolishly
in a chair in an all-night cigar store that
faced the bridge bounded startled to
his feet at the first peremptory jingle of
the telephone listened a moment and
sprang through the swinging door to
the street he didnt know just what
the trouble was but he had his orders
to stop the man and dog team racing for
the bridge

  he was heavy on his feet was the
patrolman and he covered the ground
like a tailender in a fat mens race
hey there hey there he wheezed
valiantly stop stop or ill shoot
but he received no response the dogs
at the cry of haw swerved to the
left and leaped up the approach to the
bridge the patrolman too slow by
the line of least resistance



fifty feet tugged at his revolver his
jurisdiction ended at the center of the
bridge but his orders were to stop the
man at all costs he raised his gun and
fired

  now it is a popular belief among the
uninformed that alaska is a godless
and lawless country as stated by kip-
ling in the line no law o god or man
runs north of 

  the exact contrary is the truth
alaskans are about as harmless and in-
offensive a people unless roused to the
fighting pitch by rank injustice as can
be found anywhere in the world vi-
olence of any kind is almost unknown
harry jonas realizing all this reasoned
that the bullet that whistled by his head
and plunked into the snow across the
bridge was never intended to find a hu-
man target so though it brought his
heart into his mouth he risked his life
on the chance that he had guessed cor-
rectly two more bullets hummed mer-
rily past and then he was across the
bridge and outside the city limits turn-
ing round he playfully signaled his pur-
suers thumb on nose with that time-
honored gesture so dear to the heart of
the small boy

  only a man with a commission from
the united states government could
touch him now and as there was no
marshal at easter the way stretched
clear before him a hard-packed boule-
vard of snow over which the sled
slipped almost without friction the
possibility of pursuit never entered his
head

  but not so the game warden baf-
fled in his earlier attempts he was now
all the more determined to snatch vic-
tory from the closing jaws of defeat
he sprinted for the cabin of soule the
mushing deputy who was charged
with the duty of making the long trips
into the wilderness that occasionally
fell to the lot of the marshals force
for this purpose he kept a team of nine

splendid huskies picked for speed and
endurance and trained to the minute

  roused by an urgent hammering on
the door he admitted his visitor the
warden briefly explained the reason for
his call and asked for the loan of the
dog team soule demurred to this his
dogs were his especial pride and he was
loath to trust them to another at the
urgent insistence of whiteside he con-
sented to go along himself but he took
little interest in the affair and dressed
leisurely then he breakfasted unhur-
riedly at his favorite restaurant by
the time the dogs were harnessed and
under way nearly an hour and a half
had passed

  for five miles the road led across
the flats that everywhere border the
tanana river then it swung sharply
for a mile and a half of a climb up a
hill from here it traversed the ridge
for several miles now climbing the hog-
backs now slipping into the saddles
next it dropped a half mile into easter
creek crossed the valley and followed
the left limit of the creek to near its
head

  it was a long hard pull up the first
hill and harry made the climb in a
leisurely fashion stopping to rest
when near the summit he discovered a
mile below him a dog team that was
plainly traveling in a hurry he stared
curiously for a minute and then the
truth broke upon him in one of those
clairvoyant flashes that are really un-
conscious reasoning his heart sank as
he saw how rapidly his pursuers were
eating up the scant mile that separated
them at that rate they would catch
him before he reached the creek he
would race for it of course but with
his overloaded sleigh and three medi-
ocre dogs there was plainly but one
possible ending

  as he watched waiting for his dogs
to regain their breath the sleigh below
came to a halt a man who had been
riding in the bottom climbed out evi-


the popular magazine

dently the marshal did not intend to
punish his dogs by a hard race uphill
with a man on board let the game
warden walk this evened things up
for the moment but the odds were still
much in favor of the pursuers

  harrys dogs with that canine sixth
sense that serves their kind in place of
conscious reason seemed to sense the
condition of affairs they crowded
eagerly into the harness and on level
stretches and down grade fairly made
the sled hum over the smooth rdadbed
but on the up grade the heavy load was
a deadening drag they would come to
the top of a rise with long tongues
lolling from mouths and dripping per-
spiration dog fashion then after a
brief rest they would shoot down the
other side on the dead run

  in spite of their game efforts to
harry they seemed to be merely crawl-
ing along time and again he glanced
uneasily backward fearful of finding
his pursuers close on his heels they
however were confident of success as
they had every reason to be and were
not straining themselves unnecessarily
once on the ridge they jogged along at
a steady trot to the cheerful jingling of
the multitude of bells that decorated the
harnesses of the dogs yet their even
pace won them a steady gain

  slipping around a bend they came in
sight of the straining prospector now
barely half a mile in the lead each
time harry looked back he could see
that this distance had lessened percepti-
bly anct when he reached the turn
where the road dropped into easter
creek he could plainly hear the jingle
of bells a quarter of a mile behind

  harry made the dash from the ridge
down into the creek on the dead run
heedless of the danger involved the
slightest misstep on the part of the gal-
loping dogs hindered as they were by
the harness that bound them together
and to the sled and the heavy load
would ride them down like an ocean

liner crashing into a fishing sloop time
and again the sled runners crowded
close against the wheeler but each
time he leaped clear the dogs them-
selves knew their peril but they had no
choice but to run for it even harry
himself could have stopped the sled
once it got well under way only by
throwing it over on its side that the
dare-devil sprint was made without mis-
hap was due probably to the luck that
everywhere tags recklessness

  where the road after crossing the
creek climbed to the firm ground on the
opposite side of the valley the pace was
necessarily slackened looking back-
ward harry saw that his pursuers were
making the descent in a more conserva-
tive manner he had gained consider-
ably by his exploit but he knew that he
was no better off than before it was
only a matter of time until they would
catch him for there was rro place for
him to go to escape them even if they
didnt hurry it made no difference since
the road ended a few miles above at
the head of the creek it was a veritable
blind alley

  the hopelessness of the situation had
not previously gone home but now it
was as clear as the sun on a cloudless
day during the excitement of the race
there had been scant time for discour-
agement  but now toiling up the oppo-
site slope the full magnitude of his
folly was seared on the prospectors
brain he would be arrested and the
meat would be destroyed ran his
thoughts he would be fined and would
probably have to serve out the amount
of his fine in jail he had also techni-
cally resisted arrest when he refused to
obey the patrolmans order to halt

  even if he should be so fortunate as
to escape with a small fine and should
succeed in raising the money to pay it
he wtould still be in a sorry plight he
knew that the case would be given a
great deal of notoriety by the news-
thirsty press ever on the lookout for a
the line of least resistance



 sensation probably the thrilling race
 would rank in importance for a day or
 two with the japanese war scare then

  undergoing its annual resurrection
 comment he was sure would be unfa-
 vorable to him for there is ever a thin-
 veiled enmity between those that dwell
 in a mining camp and the miners that
 make the camp possible his credit
 bad enough before would be absolutely
 worthless meanwhile there was his
 partner probably reduced to a diet of
 meat straight long before this -he had
 failed miserably and to the sense of this
 was added the humiliation of impending
 arrest

   all this and more passed through his
 mind but he kept doggedly on more
 than ever determined to see it through
 to the bitter end

   back in fairbanks the news of the
 race had spread it slipped over the
 wires to easter creek whose inhab-
 itants were instructed to keep a sharp
 lookout if they wanted to see the fun
 on claim no  below discovery bes-
 sie anderson waitress at thft mess
 house of johnson  bergson divided
 her attention between her usual duties
 and the road to fairbanks bessie wtas
 an old friend of harry jonas and some
 there were who had hinted at one time
 of an understanding between them such
 as has glorified man and maid since the
 days of adam such an opinion was
 a trifle premature however and when
 harry drifted to other parts there was
 much gossip of a quarrel that had shat-
 tered their dream of bliss

   as a matter of fact the misunder-
 standing was really a very small af-
 fair and the lack of an immediate
 reconciliation was due to a sudden
 geographical separation that prevented
 an accidental meeting two years had
 passed away and each had long ago for-
 given the other yet neither had made
 the slightest move to effect a reconcilia-
 tion thus the breach had widened

 and was in a fair way to become per-
 manent

  bessie hoped most fervently that her
former friend would not be caught
when he made his reckless dash down
the hill she watched him fearful of
disaster with her heart in her mouth
when he reached level ground in safety
her heart resumed its wonted position
and functions and her mind began to
work realizing the hopelessness of the
race she longed to save her friend from
the disgrace that was imminent a plan
attractive in its very daring flashed
fully formed into her mind

   enlisting the willing aid of the white-
aproned cook she ran a sled that had
been lying behind the cook house out to
the road tossing in some sofa cush-
ions hastily abstracted from the small
room in a wing of the mess house
known by courtesy as the parlor she
covered them with a canvas that had
been serving to protect a pile of boxed
goods from the snow

  when harry reached the place his
pursuers had crossed the creek half a
mile below but they were hidden from
view by a clump of spruce thoughtfully
placed by nature and miraculously
spared by the hand of man in a trice
the dogs were unhitched from one sled
and hitched to the other bessie and the
grinning cook slipped the loaded sled
back behind the mess house where it
was invisible from the road

  when the marshal and the warden
emerged from the timber harry was
jogging along as if nothing had hap-
pened they overtook him at easter
city iff discovery claim where there
were a group of business houses and
dwelljng houses and the inevitable
saloon harry was in the post office in
the act of taking a chew from a newly
purchased plug of tobacco when the
warden accosted him

  i want you he said roughly dis-
playing his badge of authority for the


the popular magazine

benefit of the dozen loiterers that had
collected

  that so what do you want of me
i havent done anything was the easy-
going reply

  you know what i want you for all
right sneered the warden youll
get yours for this come along mr
soule is in a hurry so we wont waste
any time

  why great scott man ive got
nothing to do with mr soule laughed
the prospector as far as im con-
cerned you can both go any time you
want to im not particularly stuck on
your comparfy anyhow

  something in his attitude made the
warden a trifle uneasy i suppose you
havent got a load of moose meat out
there on that sled hey  he scoffed

  moose meat  repeated the other in-
credulously this was the opening he
had been sparring for what are you
talking about man are you going
crazy why all in the world ive got
on that sled is my camping outfit

  his words carried conviction to the
bystanders but the warden merely led
the way to the sled well soon see
about that he said

  there had been no time to lash the
canvas and the warden threw it off with
a single angry jerk of the hand his
eyes widened and his jaw dropped in
amazement when he saw beneath the
canvas only a bunch of highly dec-
orated sofa cushions the crowd broke
into a roar of uncontrolled laughter
most of those present knew the game
warden by reputation at least and they
shared the usual contempt of the work-
ingman for the salaried appointee of a
distant government they had received
word of the race and they now gloried
in the discomfiture of the warden oh
you nick carter shouted some wag
and the rest took up the cry this was
a joke that would be told and retold for
years

  the face of the warden went white

and then the angry blood pounded back
to a fiery red he licked his lips sud-
denly gone dry and sticky but made no
sound the silence of the pair was
broken by the explosive indignation of
the marshal who just now viewed him-
self in the light of the fall guy
what kind of a-fool are you any-
how  he asked angrily then seeing
the others plight his anger gave way
to disgust youre a hot specimen of
humanity arent you youre a real
bright ginney i guess not

  he had the meat when he left town
all right whiteside muttered dully his
mind groping blindly in search of an
explanation for this startling phenom-
enon he left it somewhere on the
road between here and fairbanks he
continued thinking aloud

  well you can do as you please said
the thoroughly disgusted marshal but
im going back to town on the double-
quick if you want to come along all
right and if you dont want to come
itll be all right with me too

  illcome and ill just take our
friend along for luck turning to
jonas he continued you are under
arrest ive got plenty of evidence with-
out the meat and anyway ill pick that
up on the road in spite of the jeering
onlookers he was rapidly regaining his
air of jaunty self-confidence

  they started the prospector in the
lead whiteside scanned the roadside
carefully for signs as they went along
at johnson  bergsons he spied the
sled tracks leading to the rear of the
house and called a halt theres where
it went he confidently asserted

  harry followed behind as the warden
led the way this he thought was
worse than ever for it meant that bes-
sie anderson would be drawn into the
affair they rounded the corner be-
fore them was the sled empty and tilted
on its side

  just behind the mess house was the
screen-covered meat house whiteside
 the line of least resistance



opened the door and entered hanging
from iron hooks were several pieces of
moose and two sides of beef it was
plain that the meat had been removed
from the sled and hung with that be-
longing to johnson  bergson but it
was equally plain that the warden could
not tell which from which he rapped
imperiously on the cook-house door and
the teutonic chef trying with poor suc-
cess to repress a grin answered the
knock

  the warden nodded toward the meat
house how much of this meat out
here belongs to johnson  bergson
he asked

  vy all of id i subbose so

  the warden saw his mistake too late
had he declared positively that he could
identify the meat he was seeking he
might have succeeded in obtaining some
damaging admission from the cook but
in exposing the weakness of his hand he
had overreached himself he studied
the cook for a moment and deciding
that there was no information to be ob-
tained from that source asked for the
owners of the mine he was referred
to the boiler house where he found
johnson an elongated swede of an in-
dependent turn of mind busy super-
intending some repairs to a broken car

whiteside wasted no time on prelim-
inaries i am the game warden he
said i am running down some moose
meat that has been sold out of season
some of it has been cached in your meat

                i

house and i want you to show me just
which is yours so there will be no mis-
take

  his manner was not to the liking of
johnson who replied shortly if you
can find any meat on my place that dont
belong there take it and go but if you
merely have a vague idea there is some
there and cant identify it ill ask you
to get to thunder off of this claim and
stay off so saying he returned to his
work plainly considering the interview
at an end

  the warden took a sullen departure
but he turned jonas loose and returned
to easter city while jonas and the
marshal left at once for fairbanks

  two days later under cover of dark-
ness the meat was removed and deliv-
ered to peterson who in appreciation
of the humiliating of the unpopular
game warden voluntarily raised the
price to a hundred dollars harry jonas
was very grateful for the extra twenty
dollars for it enabled him to purchase
a ring of the proper size and design for
the third finger of bessie anderson

great britain and the united states from being drawn into a great war

happened to be in tokyo at the
time of what is called in inner
diplomatic circles the household
plot how nearly it succeeded in
embroiling the united states and japan
only five men know in detail the first
of these is sir arthur sturt the british
ambassador to the mikados court the
second is the chinese minister the
third is myself the fourth is count
okuma the astute one-legged states-
man who has been a moving power in
japanese affairs since the reform era
began-or was until the events that i
shall describe occurred the fifth is
doctor fong and where he is nobody
knows

  i was not in japan in any official
capacity i was there renewing my ac-
quaintance with old scenes and persons
when sir arthur from whom i had
parted the night before on the occa-
sion of lady sturts reception and as
i thought probably forever-since i
was planning to sail for shanghai-sent
for me by a special embassy messenger

  i knew that some matter of the
gravest import must have happened to
cause him to summon me at eight oclock
in the morning the cause was partly
revealed however when on bringing
me my breakfast my chinese boy in-
formed me that his majesty mutsuhito
emperor of japan wras dying

  i had known of the precarious con-

dition of his health and that the fatal
climax of his wasting disease might oc-
cur at almost any time still the shock
seemed to have been very sudden for
when i said good-by to sir arthur the
evening before his majesty was re-
ported to be in excellent health

  i had a ricksha called and hastily
made my way into the embassy com-
pound where the ambassadors secre-
tary was awaiting me with a very grave
expression upon his face

  you have heard the news he

asked his majesty-

  is dead i exclaimed

  he has been dead two days he an-
swered

  this news was confirmed by sir ar-
thur who looked even graver as he mo-
tioned me to a chair

  i have been told mr x he began
that you have a more intimate ac-
quaintance with the court life of japan
than any man since bertram mitford
your excellency is very kind i be-
gan but sir arthur cut me short

  this is no time for compliments
he interrupted brusquely i have just
been informed that the emperors death
has been kept secret these two days for
the gravest reasons you are i be-
lieve personally acquainted with count
okuma 

  as everybody is i answered for
count okuma stumping round on his

wooden leg-the other was destroyed
years ago by a fanatics bomb okuma
the friend of foreigners the man whose
affectation of the simple life led him to
carry home his own laundry okuma
the patron of western learning the
wiliest and most astute of the complex-
minded advisers of the late emperor
was the most accessible and friendly of
men

  i am informed beyond any possibil-
ity of doubt said the ambassador
that okuma has now in his pocket an
ultimatum to be presented to the amer-
ican minister this afternoon at the pal-
ace

  i saw at once the meaning of the
conspiracy of silence mutsuhito of
course would never have sanctioned
war with the united states and yoshi-
hito his heir and now in theory though
not in fact emperor of japan was even
more firmly pro-american the inter-
regnum thus artificially created was to
be utilized by count okuma and the
cabal which he had formed for the pur-
pose of an attack upon the philippines

  the name of his late majesty was
forged to this document which is writ-
ten on the regulation thick red state
note paper continued sir arthur
japan demands that the united states
evacuate the philippines within a week
and you see how this affects great
britain

  i certainly did as a treaty ally of
japan england would be compelled to
stand aside if she did not participate
in the attack impotent to aid america
her action would doubtless be construed
as an alliance with japan or at least a
participancy in her treachery and the
people of the united states stung to
the quick would certainly declare war
upon england with results incalculably
evil to humanity

  and with all respect to the valor of
american arms to hold the philippines
againsi japan would be as all strate-
gists are aware a military impossibility

 manila must fall long before reenforce-
 ments arrived and without a base
 without adequate transportation facil-
 ities how could the united states hope
 to throw an army of half a million men
 into the archipelago to cope success-
 fully with the war-trained veterans of
 japan

   nay assuming a base on a near-by
 island how could that country transport
 more than fifty thousand troops at a
 single voyage and how could these fifty
 thousand hold out while the transports
 went back for more  it is the old story
 of the fox the goose and the bag of
 oats

  on this account i have always
strongly urged the abandonment of the
philippines which will one day prove
a bitter disillusionment to the united
states

   now i realized the ramifications of
 the conspiracy it was for this purpose
 that the war syndicate which was
 seeking to embroil england and amer-
 ica on behalf of germany had taken up
 the latest japanese loan at four per cent
 instead of the five which the imperial
 government had had to pay for its last
 issue the scheme was as clear as day-
 light

   you understand the situation no
 doubt said sir arthur who had been

-	watching my face closely

   entirely your excellency i an-
 swered it is necessary for us to ob-
 tain that document before the count
 can present it

   yes which means before sundown
 when since mutsuhitos death can be
 concealed no longer yoshihito will be
 notified of his accession to the throne
 the document will undoubtedly be pre-
 sented to the american minister at the
 palace the count occupying the suite of
 the minister in waiting there

   it may seem strange that the heir to
 the throne could have been kept two
 days in ignorance of his fathers death
 -strange to one ignorant of japanese

i

court ceremony but not to one aware
that the emperor as a divine being may
not be touched or even seen by the
members of his own family except at
his demand

  i could picture the dead monarch be-
hind the drawn screens in the death
chamber the doctor fearfully perform-
ing the last medical rites and the im-
perial family waiting in antechambers
for their gods permission to bid him
farewell before his translation to the
celestial spheres

  mvly information continued sir ar-
thur comes from the chinese minister
who vouches for its accuracy as you
know he is a warm friend of america
and he has methods of his own for mak-
ing such discoveries the chinese spy
system is greatly in advance of the
japanese yet i am a little uneasy for
fear of some subtle trick having been
laid for me and i am anxious to ob-
tain your advice on account of your
acquaintance with the inner affairs of
japanese court life

  his excellencys reference to my at-
tache days when it was said i believe
that i was the only european acquainted
with the ramifications of political in-
trigue in what was still called the her-
mit kingdom touched me sir arthur
had a good memory when he chose to
give it play still those were the early
days of meiji as the new era is called
and things are different now

  in brief continued the ambassador
the chinese minister asks me to place
myself in the hands of doctor fong the
third court physician did you ever
hear of him

  hear of fong a shadowy figure
suddenly leaped into my mind perfectly
outlined i remembered doctor fong
perfectly

  an accomplished chinese scholar he
had been employed years before in the
medical department of the japanese le-
gation in peking what his duties had
been is immaterial but he was con-

nected-falsely i believe with the mys-
terious death of the predecessor of the
late empress dowager tsi-an the first
wife of the penultimate emperor of the
extinct dynasty

  fong had been put on trial for mur-
der had been acquitted and had later
become head of the department of trop-
ical medicine at the university of
osaka the government subsequently
removed him from his post and he had
lived a lonely and embittered life blam-
ing the cause of his downfall upon
count okuma the knowledge of this
made me believe that fong would prove
of genuine service to us

  i knew that the late emperors mys-
terious disease had been a form of beri-
beri a malignant chronic kind peculiar
to the island of hondo and i surmised
that doctor fongs knowledge of trop-
ical diseases had brought him back to
favor as one of the imperial attendants
i communicated all these facts to sir
arthur

  then will you accompany me to the
palace at once he asked me each
of the ambassadors has a suite set apart
for him there and we can interview
our man unmolested

  i assented at once and a few min-
utes later we were bowling through the
streets inone of the embassy rickshas
a run of thirty minutes brought us to
the palace grounds and shortly after-
ward we were in the ambassadors
quarters consisting of two or three spa-
cious rooms on the second floor

  although there was no outward sign
of lamentation something in the atmos-
phere of the interior showed that the
news of mutsuhitos death had already
become common property there was
gloom upon the faces of the palace at-
tendants shuffling to and fro along the
corridors in their felt slippers at the
far end of the long passage at the back
entrance to the state apartments we
saw an anxious throng assembled and
as we were about to enter the ambas-
revelations of an ambassador at large 

sadors rooms we saw the crowd sud-
denly prostrate itself as a tiny lady at-
tired in a european court dress with
low neck and sweeping train upheld by
four pages passed by

  her highness the royal concubine
otura explained the ambassador
lets get inside before we meet her
sometimes one requires tact in meeting
certain court situations dont you
know

  inside the rooms a tall man with a
clean-shaven anxious face was seated
beside the fire reading the daily herald
as we entered he sprang to his feet
and i recognized the american minister

  how do you do sir arthur he
cried heartily have you heard the
news his majesty is dying i got
the tip from my chinese boy and hur-
ried round to be in attendance

  yes it is very sad said sir ar-
thur solemnly

  his case is considered hopeless i
believe continued the american min-
ister at least i met count okuma
on my way and he looked very de-
spondent what a charming enlight-
ened man the count is he was so
friendly in spite of his preoccupation
that i was almost tempted to suggest
calling in doctor phineas of our lega-
tion who took his degree at johns hop-
kins however-would you have sug-
gested it

  it is always a little dubious making
suggestions said sir arthur thought-
fully

  but count okuma is so transpar-
ently simple-just like one of us said
the american minister i really wanted
-however ive no doubt these japa-
nese doctors are competent to handle
the situation i wont keep you sir
arthur but if i hear of any develop-
ments in the situation i shall let you
know at once

  i am infinitely obliged to you my
dear colleague replied sir arthur
shaking him warmly by the hand

  do you know he said to me when
the minister had gone that sort of man
makes the best possible ambassador
directness guilelessness are awfully
puzzling for the sophisticated japanese
mind however-here is our friend
doctor fong was just entering the
doorway and though it was years since
i had seen him i knew him immedi-
ately the yellow wrrinkled skin looked
just as much like parchment the wiry
thin mustache still drooped blackly on
either side of the sensitive mouth and
the eyes behind their  heavy convex
lenses were shrewd kindly and yet im-
penetrable

  doctor fong murmured my name as
he shook hands with me

  i see you have a long memory for
faces doctor said sir arthur

  i never forget anything replied
fong quietly

  mr x is to be trusted implicitly
said sir arthur he understands the
entire situation and thoroughly in-
dorses your ability

  i am delighted murmured fong in
his monotonous soft tone and now
we will begin by trusting one another
completely in this affair it is your ex-
cellencys desire to obtain a certain
document now in the possession of a
distinguished diplomatist

  if it can be done honestly said sir
arthur i mean he added i can-
not countenance any objectionable
methods confound it doctor fong
we have got to get possession of that
document before sundown he added
where is it

  upon the person of the distinguished
diplomatist answered the doctor
how can you get it 

  will you permit me to show your
excellency in pantomime inquired
fong

  certainly said sir arthur growing
evidently interested as he saw the doc-
tor take a small vial from his pocket
half full of a clear slightly opalescent


the popular magazine

liquid you are not planning to chloro-
form the count i hope he continued
i cannot countenance-

  chloroform the invention of a
barbarian murmured doctor fong
contemptuously we discarded chloro-
form in b c  there is no need
to use chloroform nor any opportunity
besides it always requires methodical
application and cannot be used upon a
man against his will no he picked
up a piece of note paper that lay upon
the table this represents the docu-
ment your excellency and you are now
delivering it to me hold it firmly in
your right hand so now have the
goodness to look carefully at this vial
observe the twinkling lights-

  i thought at first that doctor fong
was trying to hypnotize the ambassador
for he held the vial closely under his
face then i saw that sir arthur was
standing as rigid as a statue his eyes
fixed firmly upon the vial but there
was not the smallest expression upon
his face and he was as rigid as a cata-
leptic i knew that catalepsy cannot
be induced immediately by hypnotism
i could not detect the slightest odor
from the vial

  doctor fong opened the ambassadors
fingers and took the paper turning
toward the table he took up a pen and
wrote something upon it then he re-
placed it between sir arthurs fingers
recorked the vial and placed it in his
pocket half a minute later i saw sir
arthurs muscles lose their rigidity and
the natural expression come back to his
face

  but you have taken it away he
said

  the vial  inquired the doctor
blandy

  you asked me to look at it said
sir arthur

  no no your excellency i should
have said look at the paper replied
doctor fong

  sir arthur turned the paper up
upon the other side was written

  this is to certify that i have complete
confidence in doctor fong

  you are not conscious of the lapse
of any interval of time since i began
this experiment your excellency
fong inquired

r you have been asleep for a couple
of minutes i explained as sir arthur
looked from the paper to us in bewil-
derment and it took a couple of min-
utes more before we could get him to
understand then fong explained

  extract of venatica he explained
taking out the vial and tapping it with
his lean forefinger the formosan
head-hunters are acquainted with its
peculiar properties in china we use
something better however this en-
ables them to get heads the drug not
only produces immediate unconscious-
ness when inhaled-you were inhaling
it when you thought you were looking
at it-but there is no remembrance
after awakening of anything that has
happened since the first inhalation

  all the innate pharisaism of the eng-
lishman came to the surface as sir ar-
thur answered

  i cant countenance that method
doctor he said a little pompously and
i thought a little humiliated but if
you think you can get the document
in-s-

  i understand your excellency re-
plied doctor fong blandly the docu-
ment is the first consideration after
which we can proceed to analyze the
means we have employed by the way
his majestys end is expected at any mo-
ment now and i must return to my post
of duty you can trust me your ex-
cellency he added as he bowed him-
self through the door	

  at five oclock we were still in sir
arthurs quarters the american min-
ister had returned twice to inform us
that mutsuhito was at deaths door
revelations of an ambassaor at larqe 

the french minister had looked in to
tell sir arthur that according to a
palace rumor the emperor had died
early in the afternoon at the end of
the corridor the crowd of courtiers was
constantly prostrating itself as one or
other of the royal ladies and imperial
princes passed into the mikados - ante-
room

  it was a few minutes after five when
a distant murmur like the droning of
bees made itself audible it rose and
swelled into a mourning din the em-
peror was officially dead

  the sound of lamentations filled the
palace from our window we could
see that a vast throng had assembled in
the grounds and rippling from one to
another the sound was taken up until
it seemed as though the entire people
wailed in unison

  count okuma is ready to strike
heaven grant that fong does not fail
us said sir arthur turning to me
then doubtfully can you assure me
on your honor that i was rendered un-
conscious 

  before i could assure him a tap
sounded on the door and a page ap-
peared he announced that count
okuma requested the honor of sir ar-
thurs presence in his apartment

  we went down the corridor in the
pages wake until we came to the little
room that okuma occupied it was
filled with the ambassadors and min-
isters of the various powers

  it was furnished with that spartan
simplicity which okuma who was a
good deal of a demagogue affected
hoping thereby to set an example of
frugality to the rising generation and
ignorant like all demagogues that the
people saw through his pose there was
a low japanese couch concealed in part
by a plain screen a bronze buddha upon
a pedestal a charcoal box or hibachi a
writing table a desk heaped high with
papers and a number of chairs

  i perceived that the american min-
ister alone was absent

   count okuma was seated at his desk
facing us his wooden leg thrust out be-
fore him and an expression of remark-
able guilelessness on his smooth-shaven
face

   gentlemen said the count rising
i have the deep sorrow of announcing
to you the demise of his imperial
majesty five minutes ago

   immediately each of the representa-
tives sir arthur included produced a
written memorandum of condolence
which he handed to the count with a
bow and a few conventional words it
was an interesting comedy not the least
amusing part being okumas expression
of surprise and pleasure at these tokens
of international sympathy with japan

   as we were about to leave among the
others count okuma called to sir ar-
thur and asked him to remain behind

  one moment sir arthur he said
with a charming smile it is to be my
pleasure to address a communication to
your colleague from washington who
will be here in a moment and as our
ally it wouldbe felicitous for you to be
present

  he looked keenly into sir arthurs
face as he spoke and i saw that the
british ambassadors expression was al-
most as guileless as the counts

   we waited presently we heard foot-
steps at the farther end of the passage
the american minister was on his way
to the counts room

  okuma turning from us began to
rummage among the heap of papers
upon the desk before him which ap-
peared to consist largely of bills and
household receipts until he came upon
a red envelope of legal size unfastened
and evidently containing the ultimatum

  he took it in his hand and stood
propping himself upon his wooden leg
his whole expression that of a charming
man of the wrorld if the momentous
minute affected him there was no sign


the popular magazine

of it in his aspect and the footsteps
were drawing nearer

  suddenly the face of doctor fong
appeared at the door he bowed low
before the count for the first time i
saw the counts expression change

  did he suspect fong at that moment
and remember the mans grievance
against him it was one of those
dramatic moments when nothing is said
nothing done and yet one seems to feel
the thoughts and minds of others

  fong walked straight to the count

her imperial highness- he began

and held the vial beneath his nose

  the expression that had been on
count okumas face was still there but
it seemed to have been frozen there
and he remained in exactly the same
position as he had occupied slightly-
leaning upon his wooden leg the en-
velope between his fingers

  good lord was i like that i
heard sir arthur whisper as fong
gently opened the counts fingers and
took the envelope

  i heard the slight click as the thumb
and fingers came together again

  hastily fong slipped the inclosure
out of the envelope from the desk
he grabbed up a bill or letter which he
placed inside i did not see what he
did with the document but when he
turned back his hands were empty

  could your excellency find some pre-
text to hold the american minister at
the door for a minute fong asked

  sir arthur stepped hastily into the
doorway where the minister was just
arriving i saw fong slip the vial back
into his pocket and replace the red en-
velope between the frozen counts
fingers and then as the doctor stepped
back i saw the counts conscious re-
turn as instantly as a ripple goes across
wheat every muscle resumed its func-
tions at the same moment

  is greatly indisposed as a conse-
quence of his majestys translation
continued fong

  i greatly regret to hear it answered
the count i shall prostrate myself
before her later in the afternoon you
are attending her carefully 

  with the utmost care answered the
chinaman retiring obsequiously back-
ward

  and it was evident that count okuma
had not the slightest suspicion of what
had happened sir arthur had stepped
hastily back to his side and the amer-
ican minister was in the room 

  i have the great sorrow of announc-
ing to you sir the demise of his im-
perial majesty ten minutes ago said
count okuma to the minister

  with a few murmured words of sor-
row the american minister quickly pro-
duced a written memorandum of con-
dolence which the count placed among
the others on his desk

  your excellency he continued
there is a communication of some im-
portance which i have to make to you
on behalf of the imperial japanese gov-
ernment i do so for reasons which this
communication makes apparent in the
presence of his excellency the british
ambassador

  and he handed the minister the red
envelope

  the american minister took the en-
velope and bowing withdrew he hes-
itated at the door and seemed desirous
of addressing sir arthurbut the latter
hurried past him to his apartment and
we left together a few minutes later as
the thunder of guns announced the ac-
cession of yoshihito the new emperor
of japan

 how nearly a great war between
japan and america and another be-
tween the two english-speaking na-
tions was frustrated becomes clear
from the following letter which i re-
ceived from sir arthur in shanghai

  the american minister called on me at ten
oclock the morning of the day you left

  i never heard that the japanese were an
revelations of an ambassador at large 

absent-minded people sir arthur he said
laughing but this is too good to hold per-
mit me to show you what count okuma
handed to me last night i telephoned to ask
if a mistake had not been made but the
count had been taken ill and was in bed his
secretary told me

  and he pulled the red envelope out of his
pocket and handed me-count okumas
laundry list three pairs of silk pajamas a
dozen linen handkerchiefs and numerous

other items prove that the counts spartan
simplicity is more apparent than real no
wonder that okuma was taken ill after the
discovery

 i owe you a thousand thanks for your
assistance doctor fongs revenge had all
the chinese subtlety did it not but i often
wonder whether the laundryman received a
communication instructing him to abandon
his premises under threat of naval inter-
vention

march th it is entitled kitcheners coup

protecting the peoples money

in its determination to safeguard the money of the american people the federal
government in washington has built up the most elaborate property-protective
system in the world it consists of sentinels steel vaults electric wires gongs
mirrors and varicolored electric lights it is thief proof burglar proof mob
proof and fool proof

   the methods employed to keep the money are both ancient and modern
on the one hand there is the captain of the watch who receives reports at
regular intervals from the men who patrol the treasury building inside and out
on the other there are the heavy steel safes with walls so constructed that a
burglars electric drill penetrating anywhere into the steel will strike a wire
which will light up a bulb on the wall of the office of the captain of the watch or
in the nearest police station

    in the treasury there are fourteen vaults and safes all strung together on
an electric thread that is as sensitive as a raw nerve to the intruders touch in
the corridors in various offices and in the cellar and subcellar are fifty stations
where the watchmen on patrol and sentinel duty register their presence on their
rounds through the night they must register by electric signal to the captain
of the watch every fifteen minutes and if their signals do not come in within
five minutes of the schedule time the captain sends out another watchman to
ascertain the reason for the delay every hour a tour of inspection is made
around the outside of the building and in unsuspected places on the walls outside
are cleverly concealed buttons which the sentinels touch in order to register
airs well in the captains office

    there is good reason for all this precaution the silver dollars packed in
the huge silver vault amount usually to about one hundred million dollars the
gold coin averages one hundred million dollars and many other hundreds of
millions are there in the shape of bonds bank notes and other securities

chapter i

burke burke for gods sake
i do not know how long in the
borderland of sleep this hail had
come to me accompanied as it
was by a soft tap-tapping on the shutter
door of my stateroom i became con-
scious of it all of a sudden-sat up in
my bunk broad awake

  burke wake up and let me in oh
burke

  a mans poignant agony was in that
low cautious cry i thought i recog-
nized the voice as mathers with a
bound i was at the stateroom screen
door and had thrown it back a whiff
of fog damp and clammy whisked in
from the dark also the body of a man
-of pierce mather he stumbled over
the brass-capped baseboard and fell
against me drunkenly i heard him
sigh his dead weight was against my
shoulder i fumbled for the light
switch but his hand groped in the dark
and checked mine

  no no he croaked no light
burke the dark-the dark is better
wheres the couch 

  i took his hand to guide him to the
divan that ran the width of the deck
stateroom which i fortunately had by
myself the hand was cold and a
twitching came down from the elbow
to make all the fingers jerk and flex
though i could not see mathers face
this clawlike hand the whistling of his

breath told me that the man was in the
last extremity of fear or nervous ex-
haustion under strain i had him on
the divan in an instant could see the
vague shape of his head and shoulders
outlined against the lighter dark of my
window my brandy flask was handy
i gave him a shot

  take a bracer man whats got into
you since i left you in the smoke room
an hour ago

  mather did not answer directly but
kept mumbling under his breath
burke burke for gods sake
during a busy life with the news i had
never seeri a person more completely
prostrated mentally waking out of a
sound sleep to find in the dark a fel-
low passenger and comrade of the voy-
age thus on the verge of collapse why
it was a blood-chilling business i
shook him roughly-even slapped his
 cheeks soundly with my open palm
at this latter treatment he pulled him-
self together with a faint gasp of pro-
test and held up a checking hand

  its all right now-all right he said
in an altered and steadied voice find
a seat where i can feel you near me
-and listen

  i drew up the camp stool to a posi-
tion where sitting my pa jama-clad
knees brushed his i could not see his
features-only the blurred outline of
his head and shoulders but i could
guess what was the heavy stamp of fear
that rested on his face
the gold pince-nez



  listen burke ive been robbed

  such things happen even on pacific
mail liners i answered shortly won-
dering how the loss of a watch or even
of a considerable sum of money could
so completely subvert a mans mind

  but-but you dont know all-the
terrible feature of it he answered in
the petulance of rasped nerves  this
robbery means sure death to one man
and-and disgrace to another

  well i waited for mather to ex-
plain in his own good time

  i-im about at the end of my string
burke this things almost put me off
my dot ive simply got to get advice
and so-and so i come to you ive
come right to you-didnt know until
fifteen minutes ago that id been robbed
you-youre almost one of us in the
diplomatic service-youre a diplomat
of the news which is the next thing
youve lived in japanyou know of
course the situation between the two
countries-japan and america burke
ive simply got to tell you the whole
thing

  mather seemed ready to slip back into
his first hysteria i fumbled for his
hand in the dark found it and gripped
it to steady him the marvel that this
suave self-centered young bostonian
with his harvard veneer heightened to
a ruby gloss by several years on the
emery wheel of official washington life
could thus be stripped bare of all his
reserve and come begging for a con-
fidant was still strong with me we
had known each other just a week a
deck-chair acquaintance on the siberia
had ripened with more than usual speed
because i was an old resident of japan
and he outward bound for the islands
on his first trip was eager to know
much of the land the fact that i was
head of the central press agency in
the far east with headquarters at
tokyo gave my word on things japa-
nese authority in his eyes i suppose
all that i knew of pierce mather on
b

the night he came crying to my state-
room door was what he had told me-
that he was in the state department at
washington and was traveling to tokyo
on government business

  i need not pledge you to secrecy
burke my visitor in the dark began
in a voice again controlled you know
that i would not be coming to you in
this extremity if i did not trust you-
did not have to trust you in this terrible
situation i--

  you remember what t roosevelt
once said about reposing confidences in
newspaper men i interrupted some-
what dryly next to himself he said
hed trust-

  yes yes excuse me if i boggle

things to-night im-im- but

this is the way of it burke three
weeks ago i was detached from duty
in the state department and assigned
temporarily as secretary to the legation
at tokyo to take the place vacated by
the promotion of edgerton miles the
secretary of state took the opportunity
of my mission to send to the ambassa-
dor some confidential reports which
could not be intrusted to cable code or
the mails i know the contents of those
reports they have tremendous bear-
ing on the present relations between the
two countries-in fact they convey to
the ambassador information upon which
the immediate relations-and very seri-
ous consequences-of the two nations
hang i will have to leave you to guess
which international problem they bear
upon

  perhaps i can guess i put in
shortly

  but more than that the shadow
before me continued in a shaken voice
in those reports was mentioned the
name of a certain person-one con-
nected with the secret-service bureau
of the state department who has been
in japan for more than a year without
the knowledge of the ambassador or
any one else beside the president and
the popular magazine

the secretary of state the reports not
only reveal the identity of this agent
but convey to the ambassador the in-
formation this agent has secured which
bears on the pressing problem confront-
ing the two countries you whove
lived in japan can understand how per-
ilous is the position of this secret agent
once his identity is known to the jap-
anese government washington can-
not take official cognizance of the
agents presence in japan-could never
even protest if he should drop out of
sight tokyo does not know officially
that such a citizen of the united states
is in the empire tokyo therefore
could not know officially of his disap-
pearance do you see it burke  once
his name is known to the japanese
secret police that agents life is on a
spider web-there wouldnt be a bubble
on the surface to mark his passing

  i saw it only too well-i who was
thoroughly schooled to the ways of the
japanese police system where for-
eigners are concerned every ricksha
man every house servant is a potential
spy espionage seems to be ingrained
in the nature of the lower-caste japa-
nese well i remember the petty an-
noyances of observation to which i was
subjected when i first took up my duties
in tokyo mathers words instantly
brought to my mind comprehension of
the american agents peril a man de-
tached by very virtue of his calling
from his governments protection-one
walking blindfolded amid the pitfalls
of an oriental jungle

  so you have been robbed of those
reports i asked unnecessarily

  yes burke a shiver gripped the
limbs of my companion of the dark
some time-it must have been to-night
-the leather wallet-out of the very
pocket of my coat-the inside pocket
it is beyond explaining

  you had carried the wallet on your
person all the time aboard here
every minute--even in the pocket

of my pajamas when i slept the
wretched young man answered to-
night after you left me on deck i went
to the smoke room for an hour or so
and watched the poker game then to
my stateroom when i started to un-
dress i took the wallet from my pocket
and laid it on the bunk something-
somehow it didnt look right-looked
smaller i picked it up to examine it-
opened it nothing inside but two pa-
cific mail folders from the writing

room i-

  then it wasnt the same wallet you
started from washington with i in-
terrupted somebody worked a sub-
stitution on you

  it was not the same-not quite
mather whispered same leather-
same fold and leather tongue clasp but
a shade smaller than the one contain-
ing the confidential reports im sure
of that

  when had you last examined the
papers in the original wallet i asked
striving to find some corner to grip
in the mystery

  why-ah-night before last i usu-
ally looked over the papers every night
before i retired to be sure but last
night i think-yes im sure-i went
to bed without looking in the wallet
those three-legged races on deck you
know-they rather took it out of me
i was dog tired

  then the substitution might have
been made yesterday or to-day i sum-
marized any time in the last forty-
eight hours you have no idea when
or how the trick was done

  positively none mather groaned
hopelessly some one of the four hun-
dred odd people on this ship is a rob-
ber  somewhere on this ship is that
bundle of papers upon which a mans
life-the dignity of my country-my
own honor hang and-and they might
as well be five hundred fathoms down
for all my power to recover them
buck up man i said trying to put


the goud pince-nez



into my -voice an element of hope i did
not feel were five days out of yo-
kohama and much can be done in that
time you can be sure your reports
wont be destroyed the thief wants
them for the information they contain
but he must also save them to lay be-
fore his superiors-visible proof of
their contents of course we can guess
the nationality of the thief

  but there are thirty-odd japanese
gentlemen aboard mather protested
and we took on some forty or fifty
coolies at honolulu didnt we how
can we accuse one at random 

  well at least i put in defensively
the nature of the case permits us to
limit our suspicions to seventy or so
out of four hundred thats a start
lets build up the hypothesis something
like this the japanese government
keeps one or more secret agents at
washington-thats regular enough for
every country does it and we have ours
abroad one of these agents learns you
are going to tokyo-perhaps he even
knows definitely what he would reason-
ably suspect that the state department
takes the opportunity of your going to
send by you certain messages which it
would not care to intrust to cable or
mail of course it is his duty to ac-
company you and watch his chance to
lift that valuable information it does
not take a very sharp eye to see day
by day the shape of a wallet inside your
coat anybody he reasons who carries
a stiff and bulky wallet constantly in
his coat pocket-and even sticks to the
habit when he changes to summer whites
as you did on leaving honolulu-must
value the contents of that wallet highly
so knowing where his game lies he
has only to contrive a substitution-
either while you slept which is improb-
able  or by some sleight-of-hand work
in broad day and right under your nose
which is more likely now if you can
remember just which of the japanese
passengers you have talked with-

strolled about the deck with-weve got
a flying start on the search for the
thief

  i do not pride myself on any
peculiar analytical traits of the
sherlock holmes variety and i am
frank to admit that in building up
this all too-obvious hypothesis i
was leaving holes in it big enough to
drive a sprinkling cart through but
 my single aim was to try to lift the un-
fortunate mather out of a despond
which threatened to be a real menace
to his sanity i realized that there in
the dark of my stateroom in mid-pacific
i had been called upon to doctor a
mans soul and my dose was not homeo-
pathic he poor devil was ready
enough to snatch at it

  well ive associated with a good
many of them my companion faltered
evidently straining to focus his recol-
lection thought id like to get ac-
quainted with as many as possible be-
cause of future relations in tokyo you
know theres little doctor tokonoku
ive had a couple of games of chess in
the smoke room with him and-

  tokonokus harmless i know him
i cut in played with him myself

   --and that little chap who says hes

been studying cotton raising in texas-
little something-or-other matsu a
couple of games of shuffleboard with
him

  shuffleboard sounds harmless i
ventured

  and-by the lord burke it
couldnt be mather trembled afresh
and his lowered voice squeaked and
cracked under a sudden thrust of ex-
citement that fellow mad-mada-
toya-the silk agent from london he
was showing me some jujjitsu holds
after the games on deck yesterday after-
noon and-

  steady now mather i cautioned
tell just what he did how he did it
how many people were looking on
everything


the popular magazine

  i heard the shadowy shape before me
take a long breath

  after the finish of the three-legged
race i dropped into a chair up forward
by the saloon door and this chap mada-
toya came and sat down beside me he
congratulated me on winning one of the
prizes and our talk ran to athletics in
japan he told me about the training
the schoolboys get and how all candi-
dates for the police force are put
through a jujutsu course i asked him
some questions about how a jujutsu
wrestler could stand up before an ex-
pert boxer and he laughing offered
to demonstrate a defense againsj fists

  as a joke of course i took him up
we stood up and i squared off at
him

  wait a minute i broke in who
were in the chairs thereabouts-any
spectators 

  only old mrs jenkins as i remem-
ber she was doing some crocheting

in the chair next to mine and-

  and mrs jenkins is nearsighted
i reminded mather remember the
day she thought the alligator pear at
your plate was her grandsons rubber
ball

  madatoya crouched in front of me
his hands spread out at the level of his
knees i feinted with my left and
swung a light right cross to his face
and like aflash he was under my guard
with one elbow under the chin forcing
my head back and the other arm around
my waist with the fingers pressing
against my spine he could have
thrown me or broken my back he
held me that way a second or so as
i remember laughingly taunting me to
break the grip then he let me go
was your head thrown back so that
you could not see him during all the
time he held you i asked

  as i remember yes i thought at
the time how helpless i was

  then what

  oh he showed me one or two other

simple tricks of tripping and we went
down to the smoke room for a cocktail
i thought nothing more- of it until this
minute

  i put another question

  and that night-the night after the
jujutsu lesson-when you went to bed
you didnt examine to see if you had
your wallet

  no burke i didnt i was so dog
tired i just fell into my bunk

  for several minutes we sat there in
the dark no word between us finally
i spoke the result of my deliberations
mather on principal id say you
would be foolish to take this matter to
the captain if you had no suspicion
to work on it would be simply letting
another person into the secret of your
loss to do so but i thinlc what youve
told me about the jujutsu lesson jus-
tifies you in having a very well-founded
suspicion of this fellow madatoya and
that the captain will have excuse to ex-
ercise his authority in a search of the
mans stateroom and person at least
even if we are wrong the gravity of
the case and the strength of the evidence
will excuse the mistake

  the young secretary of legation was
on his feet instantly eager to follow
my suggestion i threw a raincoat over
my pajamas slipped my feet into straw
sandals and we went out onto the
dripping deck seven bells were just
being struck when we climbed to the
shadowy bridge the second officer
on watch there demurred at first
against rousing captain kendall but
upon my assuring him that it was a
matter of the gravest importance that
needed the captains attention and one
that couldnt wait he disappeared into
the murk toward the door of the cap-
tains cabin back of the bridge he
soon returned to tell us captain ken-
dall awaited us in his cabin and he
guided us to the door

  we found the skipper sitting on the
edge of his berth his uniform jacket
the gold pince-nez



 hastily thrown over his sleeping clothes
 he received us somewhat brusquely--
  manner we could well pardon under
 the circumstances-but when mather
 began in his nervous slightly hysteri-
 cal manner to detail the circumstances
 of the robbery captain kendalls first
 flash of irritation was quickly dissi-
 pated by acute interest the gray old
 master of the siberia leaned eagerly
 forward his hands clutching the raised
 side of his berth and the eyes under
 his heavy white brows never leaving
 mathers face when the tale wag
 finished captain kendall bent his head
 for a minute and seemed to be study-
 ing the pattern of the chinese rattan
 mules he had on his bare feet

   mr mather sir he began the
 captain of a ship at sea has wide re-
 sponsibilities and unusual police powers
 but he hesitates to use them except in
 the most extreme circumstances because
 he will be held to account for his ac-
 tions by his owners and like as not
 the government whose protection an
 arrested passenger may claim in this
 case a mistake would be peculiarly un-
 fortunate for me running as i do into
 three japanese ports these japanese are
 very touchy on points of honor more-
 over i would not care to have word
 of a scandal pass among my passengers
 i think the best way to do would be
 i to have this japanese gentleman sum-
 moned here now we can then question
 him and if necessary detain him while
 his room is being searched

   he brought a passenger list out of
 a drawer and studied it a minute then
 pressed an electric button a petty offi-
 cer appeared in the door and saluted

   banks said the captain go down
 to stateroom no  present the cap-
 tains compliments to mr madatoya
 and ask him to come to my room as
 soon as he can

   the man at the door slipped into the
 gloom and we were left in an embar-
 rassing silence i began to feel very

 poignant unrest doubts as to the sound-
 ness of my snap deduction against the
 japanese jutjutsu demonstrator pat-
 tered against my consciousness fast as
 the congealing drops of fog on the panes
 of the stateroom windows i began
 to wonder how far into the halter i
 had thrust my head out of impulsive
 sympathy for the distress of another
 man surely if this madatoya should
 prove a man of some consequence in
 japan and we should be unable to pin
 the theft on him swift vengeance would
 be taken against the representative in
 tokyo of the central press for one

  hurried footsteps sounded outside
the cabin the door was hastily jerked
open and the captains messenger
thrust a white face into the square of
radiance cut out of the night

  i think youd better come below
sir he stuttered somethins hap-
pened to the gentmun you sent me to
fetch

  whats that whats that cap-
tain kendall was already reaching for
his greatcoat mather and i leaped to
our feet the three of us burst out of
the door and were stumbling down the
ladder to the boat deck the next instant
the fog was cold and gray the deck
seemed an interminable wet alley lead-
ing to blank space the feel of vast
ocean spaces and the mysteries they
brew was in the air-charged it with a
pricking sense of the weird we hur-
ried down the grand staircase to the
saloon then followed the lead of the
bosn down a long alley of staterooms
-an alley dim and sleep heavy the
noises of sleepers sounded all about us
-stirrings mutterings the whimper of
a child the stilling coo of a mother

  beyond a linen closet and the shield
of a bulkhead three stateroom doors
opened from the passage-three state-
rooms isolated in part from the rest
by the bulkhead shield two of the
doors were hooked back so that the
unoccupied space of the staterooms


the popular magazine

showed beyond them the third was
shut and before this the bosn paused

  i had to bust it in with my shoulder
sir when the gentmun didnt answer
my knock he said and opened the
door he put his arm in and turned
the light switch

  the blaze of light showed the figure
of a japanese in a blue crape kimono
sprawled on the floor his bare legs
straddled out from under the cloud of
flying storks on the garment in an atti-
tude of a runner thunderbolted in full
flight just below one shoulder the
carved ivory handle of a japanese dag-
ger stuck up abruptly from the body

 near an outstretched hand-a hand
that seemed vainly gripping for the
thing just beyond reach-lay a black
leather wallet

  mather swooped upon it pawed
through its pockets then turned to the
captain and me a face gray green and
ghastly

  m-mine he stammered but i-
im too late empty	

chapter ii

  for more than a minute i think we
three stood there over that grotesque
thing the flying storks covered stricken
cold and dumb then-

  gentlemen this is a murder cap-
tain kendall said sententiously and at
the moment nothing redundant in his
statement appealed to us mather still
gripping the empty wallet convulsively
sank weakly to the couch and covered
his eyes the man was shaking as in
an ague for an instant i feared he was
going to scream like a woman

  anything i cn do sir the bosn
nervously inquired from the alleyway
outside the door

  go at once and wake up the sur-
geon commanded the captain bring
him here then take your station outside
the bulkhead door and let no one else
pass

  we heard the soft padding of the
bosns feet on the carpeted alleyway
then silence fell none of - us moved
or spoke there was only the sobbing
respiration of mather on the couch
perhaps five dreadful minutes passed
thus before footfalls again sounded
without and doctor- sparks the sibe-
rias surgeon crossed the baseboard of
the stateroom he was in his pajamas
and with feet slippered the sleep was
not yet out of his eyes captain ken-
dall merely pointed to the bundle of
blue and white crape on the floor as
the surgeon entered a sharp gasp
from doctor sparks and he was on his
knees beside the body his ready pro-
fessional hands at their exploring al-
most out of instinct

  with some effort he drew the short
sword or one-edged japanese dagger
out of the wound and laid it carefully
on a towel then he rolled the body
of madatoya over so that the narrow
crescent eyes stared unwinkingly at the
cluster of electrics on the ceiling per-
functorily he laid a hand over the heart
a finger on the jugular and shook his
head

  the stab from below the shoulder
reached the mans heart he said and
he was dead before he struck the floor
there wasnt any struggle as far as
i can see hello-whats this

  the surgeon suddenly reached down
the length of the murdered mans right
arm which had been folded under the
body when we discovered the tragedy
but had fallen limply to one side under
doctor sparks manipulations the
hand was all but covered by a fold of
the kimono only the tips of the fin-
gers remained visible sparks carefully
disengaged the fingers from some small
object they grasped and held it up to
the light it was a gold-mounted pince-
nez with a two-inch fragment of very
fine gold chain depending from the tiny
hole in the upper corner of the left-hand
lens the surgeon passed the glasses
the goud pince-nez



to captain kendall and began pawing
about on the floor near the body with
a satisfied grunt he held up to our view
a small gold hoop such as is worn be-
hind the ear of those affecting the pince-
nez the companion fragment of the
broken gold chain dangled from the
loop

  these were not the dead mans the
surgeon said as he pointed to the base
of madatoyas nose no pinch marks
here there would be if he was a wearer
of glasses

  doctor sparks rose took the glasses
from the captains hand and carefully
examined them under the light

  im not a sharp on optics captain
he said but i should say these lenses
were built to rectify a fairly pro-
nounced myopia the man who wore
these will miss them

  he can come to me for them cap-
tain kendall grimly remarked as he
wrapped the glasses and the ear loop in
his handkerchief and tucked the bundle
carefully into the pocket of his great-
coat as he did so i saw him cast a
sudden shrewd glance at mather who
had removed his hands from his face
and now sat staring blankly up at the
frosted incandescents with a quick
catching of the breath i noted that the
secretary of legation had on either side
of his rather sharply bridged nose an
indented mark-the mark of pince-nez
in my brief ship acquaintance with him
i had not rfoticed before that he was a
user of glasses such a minor detail of
a mans appearance naturally would not
register one time in a hundred with
the ordinary individual meeting so many
people as i do in the course of affairs
i looked at my friends waistcoat hop-
ing to see pinned there the little spring
coil many slaves of the pince-nez pre-
fer to the ear loop there was none

  of course so it came to me in a
flash this scrutiny of mine was wild
and extravagant and induced by the
clap of tragedy just broken on us by

the bewildering turn given to the affair
of the missing state papers but why
that sudden searching glance of cap-
tain kendalls captain kendall had
no bias to pull him to partisanship in
mathers favor such as i had he
merely saw facts as fate played them
on the table the facts as so far re-
vealed pointed inexorably to pierce
mather of all the four-hundred-odd
souls aboard the siberia the single one
possessing a motive compelling enough
to lead to murder was all this hys-
teria of his-the visit to my stateroom
and the subsequent repetition of his tale
to the captain-mere play acting to
cover a grisly back trail of murder and
had the cunning intelligence of a slayer
overlooked the one inevitable telltale
circumstance said to exist to confound
every taker of life-in this instance the
pince-nez of course i had known
this man but twelve days and i might
have been deceived by his personable
surface character one does not sound
the depths of a man in twelve days

  doctor i asked vaguely laying a
foundation of defense for my friend
against accusation only hinted at in the
captains sharp look how long would
you say this man has been dead 

  not more than an hour-two at
the most the surgeon answered
rigor mortis has not yet set in

  i looked at my watch the hour was
twelve-fifteen it had been justabout
an hour since i was roused from sleep
by mathers frantic summons at my
lattice doov

  i should think the scabbard of that
sword should be around somewhere i
volunteered and i moved over to the
couch where mather sat and began
pawing behind some of the dead mans
effects piled there

  the matter of searching for evi-
dence is entirely the duty of the ships
officers mr burke captain kendall
stopped me with a sharp tone of com-
mand i think you may assist mr


the tpocpulatr magazine

mather to his stateroom now surgeon
sparks and i will take charge and we
would rather act alone i must com-
mand you both that you say nothing
of what you have seen and heard here
to any of the other passengers if
we are to lay hands on the murderer
it is imperative that as little as possible
of the events of this night shall be
noised about decks now if you

please gentlemen-

  there was no gainsaying the captains
orders even though i strongly desired
to share in probing the mystery of the
japanese passengers death mather
rose mechanically at my beckon and
we went out into the alleyway together
i accompanied him to his stateroom
which opened from the starboard deck
a few doors from mine no word
passed between us until we paused at
the door of his quarters then he put
a hand falteringly on my shoulder and
spoke in a low tense voice

  burke my dear fellow tam a little
child in the dark just now and-and
horribly afraid youll stand by me-
youll help me burke i-i need a
hand-to grip

  he fumbled for my hand clasped it
convulsively then was gone i heard
his door shut and waited for a minute
before i went to my own room but
not to sleep with me in the dark was
the shape of something straddled out
under a tumbled blue and white kimono
covered with flying storks-something
whose outstretched hand groped for a
leather wallet as if for a precious thing
and in the fingers of whose other hand
was gripped a delicate gold frame and
two lenses came to me the picture
too of pierce mathers strained and
ghastly pale face the starting eyes and
between them on either side of the
sharply bridged nose deep red creases

  angrily i accused myself of being
disloyal to a friend as i tossed in my
berth reproached myself as one so old
in knowledge of the evil things of the

world that instantly i prejudged one
as guilty upon the first appearance of
evidence bearing against him but how
could cold facts be avoided was it
conceivable that there was anybody else
among the siberias passengers-or
even among the crew-who possessed a 
motive for murdering the japanese so
strong as mathers or who had any
motive whatever for doing madatoya
harm to what other man besides the
young secretary of legation was given
the knowledge that in the leather wallet
stolen from him lay secrets of tremen-
dous value in a certain quarter wbo
other than madatoya himself the
secret-service agent who had paid for
his zeal with his life could know that
this thing of great price had passed
from mather to madatoya in that in-
stant of legerdemain when the japa-
nese held the american in the jujutsu
grip on deck would any one but the
man whose loss of the wallet meant
the ruin of a career and the jeopardiz-
ing of a nations diplomatic interests
take the tremendous risk of murder-
ing for the recovery of the papers when
the limits of flight were set by the rails
of the siberia

  no the case was clear mather
missing the wallet after madatoyas
clever ruse of the day of the deck
games had suspected the thief awaited
his opportunity and then struck the
japanese to the heart in a desperate
moment of encounter but why then
his hysterical outpouring to me and
captain kendall of the robbery tale
and his naming of madatoya as the
man he suspected of the theft why the
placing of himself deliberately in the
path of a pointing finger either the
hysterical reaction of a high-strung na-
ture drawn by the unaccountable fas-
cination of blood lust to a secret gloat-
ing over the crime or supreme
criminal ingenuity daring all by delib-
erately placing hope of safety against
the weight of circumstantial evidence
the goud pince-nez



improvable some of the most notorious
murderers i reflected had almost es-
caped the consequences of their crimes
by permitting suspicion to fall upon
them unhindered-even by aiding by
their own acts the logical sequence of
damning circumstance to a certain point

  but here was  building up a gallows
to hang pierce mather on when at
the coming of day he would meet me
on deck wearing gold pince-nez-his
accustomed property then scaffold
crosstree and halter would fall to the
ground and i would be caught in my
own treasonable folly for if that bit
of gold and quartz crystal clenched in
the dead mans fingers could not be
proved to be mathers property then
mather was innocent of any guilt
plainly as if an inanimate thing could
be given a mouth and speech that pince-
nez in the murdered madatoyas hand
called i was snatched from the nose
of the slayer his eyes alone match
mine

  no sleep was mine and the dawn
came chill and dour for an hour be-
fore the breakfast gong i walked the
fog-draped decks turning over and
over for the hundredth time the baf-
fling circumstances of the nights mys-
tery it seemed as i looked out into
the impenetrable wall of the fog that
the genius of the great water wilder-
ness whose paths the siberia coursed
by sufferance had laid its mocking hand
on the ship to confound puny mortals
thereon with unfathomable craft the
flat white wall of fog was the face of
this evil wraith of the sea--blind ex-
pressionless inexorable to will and to
do

  mather was not in his seat at the
captains table captain kendall gave
me just a nod of recognition as he took
his place and he had no word for any
of his favorites at right and left he
ate his breakfast hurriedly and left
his seat before most of the passengers
had come to table i was quite as brief

about my fruit and fish anxious as i
was to learn how mather had passed
the night and what was his present
frame of mind i went from the saloon
straight to his stateroom he answered
my knock with a languid come i
found him sitting in his pajamas be-
fore a tray of food which was un-
touched  an empty whisky glass by the
side of the tray told of the mans un-
wise fortifying against a new day of
strain mathers face was drawn and
pinched like the face of a fever pa-
tient a trembling was in his limbs

  what news burke he shot at
me before i was hardly in his door
has the captain found-anything

  i shook my head

 i had hoped-hoped-- his

hands fumbled over the jacket of his
pajamas as if searching automatically
for something that should be there and
a little furrow came between his eyes
-telltale of eye strain he wore no
pince-nez i saw his hand reach for a
bit of toast on the tray-and over-
reach his eyes were serving him
badly had i dared trust myself to
put the question casually i would have
asked him what had become of his
glasses but-and here again i was act-
ing on the hypothesis that pierce
mather was guilty of murder--i could
not bring myself to voice a leading
question which would be sure index
of my suspicion

  burke he said in a dead voice
theres just one chance for me ive
figured it all out-balanced the chances
and taken account of the human equa-
tion the one who murdered madatoya
did not do it for possession of my
papers-there was something else he
expected to find in that wallet-some-
thing nobody but himself and the man
he killed knew about presumably
when he found instead of the thing
he wanted a mere official envelope
sealed with the seal of the state de-
partment and addressed to the ameri-


the popular magazine

can ambassador in tokyo theres a
chance-a good chance dont you think
burke-that he threw the packet of
papers overboard hed be furious at
missing the thing hed done murder for
-money-letters involving an affair be-
tween himself and madatoya-any one
of a score of things which might have
great value in his eyes hed be afraid
to keep the incriminating papers and
it would be quite natural for him to
pitch them over the rail in the dark

  without even reading them i put

in

 again that hard wrinkle between
mathers eyes as he leaned forward to
bring them the better to bear on my
face

  dont knock my only prop out from
under me burke he pleaded a bit
petulantly  grant that he does read
them is there any reason to suppose
that anybody on this ship besides mada-
toya would know the value of that
sealed package wouldnt the thief
and killer throw the batch over the rail
after hed read them nevertheless

  if he was a japanese-a thinking
japanese who knows the trend of the
times-im afraid not mather i an-
swered if those reports contain in-
formation so vital to the interests of
the united states as you say they do
i think the man who possesses them
now will consider it his patriotic duty
to turn them over to his government
he need not explain how they came to
be in his hands

  was all this speculation on mathers
part-this grasping for straws of hope
in a maelstrom of disaster-but part
and parcel of a grim farce of decep-
tion were the papers he had recov-
ered at the price of a dagger stroke
in a mans back in reality somewhere
safely concealed within the very walls
of the stateroom where i sat these
questions hammer-hammered at my
brain even as my sympathies went out
to the distracted fellow before me

well enough i reassured myself to
allow ones heart to be moved by suf-
fering but reason is cold and inflex-
ible-has to do with facts not furbe-
lows of emotion why was pierce
mather without his glasses that was
a question in the realm of fact that
must be answered

  listen my friend said mather
shifting on his camp chair so as to bring
his straining eyes closer to my face
i have puzzled out my position here
in the dark of the night-have tried
to build some little raft to hold me up
and keep the waters from closing over
my head here is my scheme and i
ask you to help me-i beg you like a
drowning man begs for help  we are
five days out of yokohama still those
five days are precious for we know
that during that time the papers are
never more than a few yards from us
-maybe a few feet at times in fact
we may walk right over them as we
pace the deck during those five days
-and nights-i must move heaven and
earth to recover that sealed envelope
and if i fail before we drop anchor
at yokohama-

  mather winced and in his eyes stood
tears of weakness-of mental exhaus-
tion

  if i fail in these five dayf burke
theres only one course open for me-
continue the search in japan find
a candle flame in the milky way you
might say how ill do it-where ill
begin i havent the least idea i only
know that i must

  but my dear fellow i interposed
your position as secretary of legation
you annot be sleuthing after stolen
documents in tokyo

  i have thought of that too theres
just one point in my favor in that con-
nection the legation does not know
that i have been appointed to fill the
vacancy does not know in fact that
anf one has been assigned by the de-
partment in washington the depart-
the gold pince-nez



ment has a way of boggling along and
filling positions in its own good time
without advance notification of its ac-
tions so the american ambassador at
tokyo does not know that pierce
mather is coming to join his staff and
does not know either that pierce
mather is supposed to be bringing with
him an important communication from
the secretary in the natural course
of events he would not know either fact
if i should fail to appear for two
months or more you burke will be
the only person in japan who will know
that such a man as pierce mather de-
barked from the steamship siberia be-
cause from the moment the first land-
ing boat touches the pier at yokohama
until such time as the communications
from the secretary of state to the am-
bassador are laid in his hands with
seals unbroken pierce mather will
cease to exist to all but you

  why youre mad man i could not
help exclaiming you-a stranger in
a land full of the most impossible con-
tradictions and surprises-you try sin-
gle-handed or even with my help to
find a packet small enough to be car-
ried in a wallet  absurd better go
straight to the ambassador and make a
clean report of it all no blame can
be attached to you you were not lax
in your duty besides the ambassador
must be prepared to shape his position
to meet any move the japanese gov-
ernment may make in the light of the
information it gains from the stolen
papers

  mather groaned

  when-when that information is
known to the japanese cabinet he fal-
tered there will be no position left
for the ambassador to take three
years of diplomacy will be undone-
washingtons hand will be spread on
the table and there will be nothing but
for japan to take the tricks then
that secret agent whose name is re-

vealed to the japanese government-his
life-

  a knock came at the door it was
opened at mathers bidding and a
sailor saluted

  captain kendalls compliments he
said and will mr mather kindly step
to the captains quarters on the bridge 

  mather hurriedly dressed and went
forward i passed out on deck where
the long lines of shawl-muffled passen-
gers stretched in their chairs unaware
of the coils of mystery tightening about
the ship my mind was geared as high
as the revolutions of the siberias pro-
pellers it raced unconscionably my
every impulse was to grip the hand of
that likable young fellow from wash-
ington and tell him i would see him
through his trouble at any price all my
instinct of sympathy was enlisted in
unquestioning service in his behalf and
the lure of the mystery fired all my
journalistic enthusiasm to the core if
only pierce mather would clear himself
of the black suspicion circumstances had
thrown over him then would i launch
with him on any quest this hour when
he was before the captain and under-
going the examination that odd light in
the captains eyes on the night before
had presaged-this was the hour of test
for pierce mather

chapter iii

  perhaps it was an hour-an inter-
minable hour-i paced the deck alone
waiting to know the outcome of math-
ers interview with captain kendall in
my furious mental wrestling with the
elusive mystery of the night i was
oblivious to all surroundings the chat-
tering yellow-haired flirt who plied her
campaign of conquest at shuffleboard
the buzzing knot of missionaries in the
ingle by the after ventilators those
romping youngsters of the nagasaki
consuls-they were all manikins to me
i must have jumped when a deck stew-


the popular magazine

ard touched my arm and murmured
captain kendall asks to see you in his
quarters sir i followed him up to
the bridge and was admitted to the
commodious cabin behind the chart
room

  mather sat there and doctor sparks
captain kendall paused in his pacing
the floor to nod at me and jerk his head
toward a swivel chair by the side of his
desk mather raised his face-the face
of one dead-to launch a mute appeal
with his eyes as i passed him his as-
pect was terrible utter hopelessness was
written on his linen-white countenance

  mr burke captain kendall began
brusquely please tell me everything
that transpired between mr mather and
yourself last night from the time he
came to your stateroom and roused
you

  i did as he bid carefully recalling as
nearly as possible the conversation be-
tween us as i have set it down here
mather listened with jaw tight set and
eyes straining as if to read the thoughts
lying behind my speech

  did you notice whether mr mather
wore his glasses-his pince-nez-when
he came to your stateroom to tell you he
had been robbed queried the skipper
searchingly

  i did not know mr mathfcr wore
glasses i answered until doctor
sparks called attention to the absence
of pinch marks on the dead mans nose
then i saw the red marks indicating the
pince-nez habit

  so you could not identify these
here captain kendall extended in his
palm the damning evidence of gold and
crystal the ships surgeon had found
between madatoyas fingers you
could not say whether or not this is the
property of mr mather

  i should think mr mather himself
could give the best answer to that ques-
tion i answered

  kendall scowled slightly and tight-

ened his lips under his severe close-
cropped beard

  i am asking you mr burke he
said shortly

  no i could give no opinion on that
matter

  the captain turned suddenly to
mather there was in the tone of his
voice something almost bullying

  you say mr mather that you last
had your glasses on just before you
went to bed last night and that you
didnt miss them until just before i sum-
moned you here this morning

  i may have unconsciously missed
them when we were-were down there
in the dead mans stateroom last night
mather began hesitatingly i was so
excited i did not get an impression of
their absence it was not until this
morning when i started to dress that
i could not find them i-ah-they
were not where i think i put them when
i took them off before i discovered the
robbery i looked all over my state-
room for them this morning but failed
to find them

  where did you put them when you
took them off last night kendall
queried

  on the edge of my washstand
hum and was your port open-
the port opening to the deck by the right
side of your washstand

  i cannot recollect i think it was
mather passed a trembling hand over
his eyes as if to brush away shadows
clouding his memory

  there was a light in your stateroom
then captain kendall pressed him
one standing in the dark of the deck
could see you put your pince-nez on the
edge of your washstand-if you did
yes it was lighted i had not yet
switched off the light before undress-
ing i always undress in the dark-on
shipboard at least

  and after you discovered you had
been robbed as you say-when you ran
the goud pince-nez



to mr burkes room to tell him of it
you left your light on

  yes said mather

  and your glasses still lying where
you had placed them 

i believe so yes i must have
did you lock your door behind
you captain kendall was shooting
the questions like a trained prosecutor

  yes-no  i must have left the door
wide open i was so thunderstruck you
know i acted blindly

  the skipper summed up

  then you laid your pince-nez on the
washstand within reach of the open port
in your lighted stateroom and ran out
leaving the door unlocked behind you 
that must be the way of it captain
mather answered dully

  but how do-you account for these
glasses which you say must be yours
being gripped in a murdered japanese
gentlemans fingers an hour after you
laid them down

  i have told you i cannot account for
it mather exclaimed pettishly it is
utterly beyond me

  you feel some discomfort without
your glasses mr mather the surgeon

broke in you have difficulty-

  i suffer from an astigmatism which
throws the focus of my eyes out of
whack the embassy secretary replied
at the present moment my eyes are
weak from strain

  captain kendall passed the glasses to
the you-ng man with a quick gesture of
apology

  excuse me sir for causing you
needless discomfort he said put on
your glasses and we will go down and
look at that washstand of yours there
might be finger marks which would

throw some light-

  why why these are not mine
the exclamation came sharply from
mather he sat blinking owlishly be-
hind- the lenses hung from his nose
through them his eyes took on a swol-
len fishy look we three started

  mather snatched the fragile bow from
his nose and began to titter a shrill
note of hysteria was in his laugh

  ho ho he cackled saved by a
pair of specs ho ho two bits of
glass and a dinky gold frame an alibi
the overwrought chap was rocking in
his seat tittering and mumbling like
any defective it was a jarring thing
to see

  look here the skipper had him
by the shoulder and was shaking him
smartly what do you mean didnt
you say these glasses were yours when
i showed them to you first off after you
came in here

 mather was on his feet he tried to
spread the bow of the pince-nez over
the captains nose his hands trembling
so that the broken gold chain writhed
like a live thing against the skippers
beard

  see for yourself he cried look
through them theyre ground for a
mail almost blind-strong as a telescope
refractor why man i couldnt wear
such lenses theyd eat my eyes out
captain kendall with a brusque
movement took the glasses from math-
ers shaking fingers and fitted them to
his nose he glared stupidly through
the lenses

  strong enough for a horse he mut-
tered then

  doctor sparks have you got any-
thing like a chart of eyeglass lenses-
something thatll give us a line on what
kind of eyes these are supposed to fit
the surgeon thought he had and
went to his room to get it we were
silent during his absence i confess i
could not speak so bewildered i was
by this sudden new twist to the mys-
tery out of the jumble of my thoughts
lifted one clearly exultantly come
what might in the development of this
baffling case suspicion was for all time
snatched from pierce mather the
logic of circumstance which had first
pointed to this clean personable young


the popular magazine

chap had been hateful to me i was
as sure i his innocence as if i had just
heard an expert optician declare from
the witness stand that these all-impor-
tant specs were made for a numidian
dromedary and none other

  doctor sparks returned with a heavy
book on optics in the appendix of which
was a chart of numbered lenses with
prescriptions according with his pen-
knife tip he carefully let the right-hand
lens out of its frame and examined its
beveled edge for a number on one
side of the edge very fine was
scratched or etched not numbers but
this legend von z-berlin

  must mean the surgeon hazarded
after searching in vain for more tan-
gible identification that these glasses
were specially prescribed by a special-
ist in berlin i should say-von zome-
body or other

  mather produced a cardcase and
from it took a small folded paper

  my prescription for glasses he
said extending the bit of script to cap-
tain kendall always have it with me
in case i break them

  kendall glanced at the paper and
passed it to sparks who noting the
numbers on the prescription ran a fin-
ger down the chart

 here you are he exclaimed
number d- s--simple astig-
matism mr mather thats your case
the skipper reached for the young
secretarys hand he hesitated on the
edge of speech confused

  mr mather sir i am glad per-
haps i may have appeared-

  its all right captain mather in-
terrupted returning the others grip
with a hearty clasp i am too happy
to be out of the woods to remember
anything unpleasant against you it was
natural-quite natural you should fol-
low the way signs pointed but heres a
facer who stole my glasses and
why

  thats only part of the question

answered the captain did the man
who took your glasses off your wash-
stand murder madatoya intending to
put them in the dead mans hand to in-
criminate you

  and left his own there by mistake 
i supplemented

  or had his snatched ff by the death
lunge of madatoyas hand and didnt
dare wait to make the substitution-or
forgot to do so mather suggested
hold on

  the surgeon who had been thumbing
the pages of his reference work as we
speculated broke in eagerly listen
to this  he commanded 

  the remarkable operation of removing
the lens from the eyeball in cases where that
delicate part of the visual mechanism has
been rendered useless by congenital cause
by cataract or as the result of accident has
been achieved with success only in recent
years doctor karl von zumholst of ber-
lin not only has performed this master
essai with universally favorable results but
has perfected a spectacle lens which restores
to the patient full use of his optic organs
the operation entails the removal-

  but pshaw no need of going into
those details the surgeon looked up
from his book with the kindling of en-
thusiasm in his eyes and the humorous
lines of his wide mouth here you
have von z-berlin on the bevel of
this lens and you get von zumholst of
berlin oculist and surgeon in the book
what does that convey to you

  captain kendalls weather-stained
face was breaking into an eager smile

  i dont want to whistle to false sig-
nals again he exclaimed but i should
say we want to look for a man with no
lenses in his eyes

  big contract captain doctor
sparks warned nearly three hun-
dred men on this ship counting chinos
and you cant tell by looking at a mans

eyes whether-

  we can cut it down to the men in
the saloon i put in sailors and steer-
the gojld pince-nez



age passengers are not given to gold-
rimmed pince-nez

  limit it further to the japanese in
the first cabin mather added im
convinced nobody but a japanese could
know the value of what madatoya took
from me

  i think youre right mr mather
kendall affirmed madatoya was killed
with a japanese short sword not his
own-at least the scabbard is not among
his effects

  and that narrows the search to how
many captain mather asked

  there are thirty-two japanese men
and one woman in the saloon he re-
plied madatoya was the thirty-third

chapter iv

  i can conceive what had been the
mental torture of pierce mather when
he entered captain kendalls cabin for
his examination an hour or so before
then he stood alone before the cun-
ning snare of circumstance diabolically
set against him he knew that in the eyes
of authority which at sea is vested
without appeal in the ships captain he
had been pushed under the shadow of a
homicide without a single saving gleam
in the dark now he came out into the
sunlight cleared of suspicion with his
former prosecutor as well as doctor
sparks and myself allies in the combat
with blind mystery a wedge had been
driven into that mystery by the strange
intervention of two bits of rock crys-
tal and a thin bow of gold the anonym-
ity of the thief and murderer had been
whittled down from the four hundred-
odd souls aboard the siberia to thirty-
two more than that among those
thirty-two was one who could not long
escape detection by the helplessness im-
posed upon him through the loss of his
mechanical eyes him we must inevi-
tably detect before the siberia passed
the forts at the entrance of yeddo bay
mather raised by the reaction from

his ordeal to the height of nervous ex-
altation and alertness stepped buoy-
antly out ahead of us and led the way
to his stateroom we passed down the
windward deck deserted by the chair
loungers because of the biting sting of
the wind and came to mathers state-
room without attracting the attention of
any there the young secretary dem-
onstrated how he had removed his
pince-nez and placed it on the edge of
the washstand before retiring showed
just how he stood in reference to the
frosted incandescent globe in the panel
overhead as he removed the gold loop
from behind his ear captain kendall
heard him through without comment
when he had finished he stepped
through the stateroom door and out
onto the deck

  now mathers stateroom did not open
directly on the deck but to an alley-
way which gave onto the deck a few
inches beyond his stateroom door the
port was let into the deck side of his
room a few feet above the narrow couch
screwed against the deckward wall of
the stateroom the heavy round circle
of brass-rimmed glass swung on a lat-
eral hinge

  the siberias master stepped around
the corner from the alley door to the
long bench riveted to the deck boards
with its back against the iron wall of the
deck house he stood on this and thrust
his arm through mathers open port
we who remained in the stateroom saw
his fingers easily sweep the corner of
the washstand nor were kendalls arms
unusually long it was then suffi-
ciently demonstrated that one standing
on the deck bench could have lifted
mathers pince-nez from the washstand
ledge even with no great reach of arm

  captain kendall came back to the
stateroom

  well even that  doesnt prove
much he said when mather admits
he ran out in his panic and left the door
open the person who wanted his


the popular magazine

glasses probably hardly dared reach for
them when he was in the room even
though he had the light off-might just
as well have come through the door
when mather ran to your room mr
burke

  i did not answer for something-
call it blind inspiration or a newspaper
mans intuition for turning over every
rock in the path of investigation-led
me to draw nearer the port i thought
i saw a tiny crack in the brass frame
by the hinge ran my hand over it and
brought away a single long hair it
snapped as i pulled a short filament
stayed in the crack of the lateral hinge
where it had been caught  what re-
mained between my fingers was prob-
ably sixteen or eighteen inches in length
i stretched it between thumb and fore-
finger of both hands and turned to show
the others

  exhibit b i said shortly

  relic of a previous tenant burke
mather laughed dont try to compli-
cate a mystery sufficiently abstruse al-
ready

  i hardly think so captain kendall
objected your room boy polished
your porthole brasswork yesterday or
shirked his job he was at work when
i made the inspection of the ship at
noon he wouldnt have overlooked
even a hair for ive jumped the fear of
god into those heathen recently lets
have a closer look at that hair

  i stretched it out on the white coun-
terpane of the bunk and we four bent
our heads over it the hair was black
-glossy black fibrous and more coarse
than the average womans there was
no tendency to curl or twist in it for
texture and lifelessness it might have
come from a fiddle bow

  the chinos on this ship all wear
their hair short now said kendall a
furrow of perplexity deepening between
his brows unusually coarse--might
have come from a horses tail--if we
had a horse aboard

  the absurdity of the skippers specu-
lation did not strike us we were too
alert to the new element in the mystery
this single strand of black hair had in-
jected

  a japanese woman i ventured
you know the coarseness and sleekness
of their hair-always oiling and brush-
ing it-no curl in it perhaps-

  absurd kendall spluttered only
one jap woman aboard-in the first
cabin at least little miss tokonoku
-funny little brown mouse-she sits
at the first officers table you remember
her fathers that little chap who car-
ries a chess-problem board around in his
pocket and picks at it twelve houfs a
day as well suspect the queen of eng-
land climbing-that bench outside and
slipping an arm in this porthole to
snatch a pair of glasses i think we can
disregard this hair mr burke unless
we find a woman aboard with more of
its kind on her head and a character to
fit the part of murderess better than the
little tokonoku lady

-	i have been surprised more than
once by japanese women with the faces
of carved idols i retorted a bit
warmly nettled at the captains cock-
sureness if it is true that mathers
room boy polished this porthole brass
yesterday then the presence of this hair
caught in the hinge is more than a coin-
cidence in the light of last nights hap-
penings

  have it your way mr burke cap-
tain kendall stiffly answered when
you bring me the woman whose head
lost this hair ill consider the question
of holding her for the yokohama au-
thorities

  the rumble of the luncheon gong
came down the deck just then putting a
period to further discussion the com-
mander turned with his hand on the
door

  remember gentlemen not a word
of this on deck please the less known
about this the better progress well
the goud pince-nez



make in getting to the bottom of this
unusual affair and-this with a
slight stiffening of his tone-if either
of you has any suggestion to make i
will be glad to hear it no private
sleuthing however gentlemen i need
not remind you that my position as
commander of the siberia gives me sole
jurisdiction over police matters at sea

  he left us surgeon sparks following
mather and i went down to the saloon
separately when i entered i could not
help casting a quick glance over to the
first officers table little miss toko-
noku was in her place demurely and
with hands folded awaiting the service
of the first course by the blue-frocked
chinese waiter the seat beside her
which was her fathers was swung
around he had not come down to his
meal -my place was at a table farther
on from it i could see her profile with-
out being observed by her i freely
indulged my curiosity

  it would not be exaggeration to say
that miss tokonoku possessed no more
distinction of personality than the swivel
chair she perched on-perched is the
word she was balanced on the stool like
a timorous brown wren on the verge
of flight pale brown was her skin
brown the clumsily cut waist she wore
above the sharp oval of her face lay
piled high in semi-japanese fashion the
black cables of her hair glossy black
it was coarse heavy the comb had left
lines in the shining backward sweep of
it like the grain in heavy wood as
with most japanese women who find
themselves in the unaccustomed pres-
ence of foreigners miss tokonoku-hid
behind veiled eyes the worriments of
embarrassment looked not at all at her
neighbors seemed constantly in a fever
of doubt less she blunder in her table
manners

looking at this little brown statuette
of shrinking self-effacement i could not
help laughing inwardly at the farce of
my elaborate sealing of that long black
nb

hair from the port hinge in the pocket
of my cardcase-so i had disposed of
it before leaving mathers room

  yet there was hair that duplicated
this treasured single strand exactly of
all the coffures in the saloon-brassy
blond gray chestnut and red-none
but that of the japanese woman against
which that telltale hair could lie
matched away back in the hall bed-
room of my mind a little thought per-
sisted explain that hair sticking to
mathers port hinge before you dismiss
the little tokonoku person

  my first move after luncheon was to
go to the surgeons quarters and moil
over with him the complexities of the
mystery sparks was a garrulous chap
all the love of the unrevealed in his sim-
ple soul had leaped to the spur of the
grim riddle popped at us by the sphinx
of the ocean spaces i asked to read
further the note his optical treatise had
on the eye surgery of the famous von
zumholst of berlin disappointment
there nothing about the effect on vision
of the removal of the vitreous lens from
the eye not a hint which might serve
to mark the probable disabilities of one
so operated upon and deprived of his
special glasses could such a one see at
all without his aids if he could what
would be the abnormalities of his
vision the book was mute on these
points

  restless under the fruitlessness of
our talk i left sparks in a high state
of conjecture and made a couple of
loops of the deck my eye was keen
for mather but not finding him among
the chairs i dropped into the smoke
room to see if he was there the usual
poker game was on in the center of the
room with its fringe of spectators
mather was not among them over in
a far corner i spied a wispy little figure
curled up on a couch behind a chess-
board-doctor tokonoku

  sudden impulse sent me over to him

  solitaire again doctor i called


the popular magazine

he looked up with a nervous start
wouldnt it be more interesting to beat
me as you did the other day than
dummy 

  ah yiss yiss the little doctor
bobbed his gray head and motioned me
to a seat opposite i play much the
game he added it is like the go
game yet not so interesting

  as i reached out to set the pieces in
place i glanced casually at the little doc-
tors face he wore gold-rimmed pince-
nez on a gold chain and with an ear
loop the visor of his soft traveling
cap was pulled down well over his eyes

  i gave my opponent the black men
and kept the red the table we played
on had a peg hole in each square each
piece was pegged to fit the holes-this
a precaution against the pitching of the
vessel doctor tokonoku took first
move with true chess players delib-
eration he kept his hands off his piece
until he was sure of his strategy then
moved his second was a neat gambit
play i was not anticipating the pawn
would not somehow find the peg hole
in the adjacent square i had to pick it
up where it fell and ram the peg home
the doctor whispered thanks

  play went on without a word from
either of us the japanese easily my
master made a relentless drive for my
intrenched bishops moving his forces
forward with perfect generalship i
had almost forgotten in the absorption
of the game the motive that had
launched me in it when of a sudden an
incident trivial in itself set all the
alarm nerves of my reporters instinct
thrumming

  doctor tokonoku moved one of my
red knights instead of his black one

  my first impulse was to correct his
mistake but instantly i checked it in-
stead i deliberately moved his black
knight to a protecting station the op-
posing knights were in contiguous posi-
tions and my deliberate mistake was

no more noticeable in point of relative
board positions than his

  doctor tokonoku made no correc-
tion but after due pause played again
-this time with his own piece i
thought i saw his fingers tremble as he
boggled the peg of a castle into its hole
thrilling under the triumph of a dis-
covery i was all too ready to accept
without further and unassailable proof
i made a jump to the rear with the
very knight he had shifted as his own

  in the next three plays doctor to-
konoku twice moved red pieces instead
of black the game was inextricably
tangled i had my proof

  the man was nearly blind or ab-
solutely color blind

  he knew this was so but did he
know he had blundered and did he
realize that i knew he had blundered

  yet doctor tokonoku wore glasses-
gold-rimmed pince-nez with a chain and
loop over his ear like mathers sto-
len and the one found in the murdered
madatoyas grip if he wore glasses
why was he still groping for vision like
one in the dark

chapter v

  what that bizarre game would have
come to tangled as it was by the little
doctors erratic moves i cannot guess
interruption came startlingly doctor
tokonokus hand was hovering over his
black line to make a move when with a
smothered sigh he fell forward on the
board scattering the chessmen to the
floor as he fell his pince-nez slipped
off his nose and clattered across the
board to my lap

  i think i must have exclaimed for
at once we were surrounded by men
from the poker table excitedly asking
what had happened i directed them to
help me stretch the doctor out on the
couch somebody began to fan him
with a cap somebody else ran to the
bar in one corner of the smoke room
the goud pince-nez



and returned with a-glass of brandy
the liquor revived doctor tokonoku
he opened his eyes muttering some-
thing in japanese which i could not
catch

  ah excoose he murmured when
he saw the ring of faces above him
for making trouble excoose pliss it
iss a sickness-sometimes ver sudden
she comes to me

  all right doctor youre all o k
now big henderson the mining man
boomed as he laboriously swung his cap
back and forth over the recumbent
ones face somebody get busy here
and help me carry hinl to his state-
room

  doctor tokonoku protested weakly
but henderson was one of those men
who glory in rising to an emergency
whether their remedy is right or wrong
and he would not be denied he lifted
the doctor by the shoulders another
took him by the feet and they bundled
him down the stairs to the main state-
room deck i started to follow with the
vague notion of returning to the
stricken man the pince-nez that had
fallen in my lap i was conscious as i
walked of tlie tip tip of the golden ear
loop against the back of my hand
somehow this inanimate thing seemed
to my highly sensitized mind to be sig-
naling a message each tap against my
hand of the swinging loop was a call
from an imprisoned intelligence in the
gold filament the fantastic conceit
finally conquered instead of following
to doctor tokonokus stateroom and
giving up the pince-nez i slipped them
in my pocket and went up on deck

  mather i found in desultory chat
with the wife of the nagasaki consul
i signaled an s o s call with my eyes
and he soon found excuse to join me
down by the turn in the deck forward
where the sharp wind from starboard
had made this spot untenable by the
chair warmers	

  in a breath i told mather of the

occurrence in the smoke room he fol-
lowed me with widened eyes

  it was eye strain that did it he
exclaimed excitedly excessive eye
strain brings on a vertigo that knocks
you out completely ive had it and i
know what it is-havent read a line
since my glasses disappeared for that
very reason

  but why eye strain when the man
was wearing specs i queried

  youve just told me that his glasses
didnt do him a bit of good mather
countered with eagerness in voice and
gesture- couldnt tell a red chessman
from a black one-his men from yours
why man that little japanese fellows
practically blind

  inspiration pounced down on me
then his pince-nez is a bluff i
cried those lenses dont fit his eyes
-never were meant to hes trying
to cover the loss of his proper glasses
by wearing somebodys else

  mather looked at me his face drawn
into a pucker of excitement without
a word i drew doctor tokonokus
pince-nez from my pocket and put it in
mathers hand he slipped the bow
over his nose patted it into place then
looked down the deck out to sea into
my eyes he slowly nodded his head
with an eloquence stronger than speech

  make sure i cautioned look at
the numbers on the lenses

  with the tip of his knife blade
mather deftly loosened the tiny screws
bolting the lenses to the frame and held
up the lenses edge on for me to ex-
amine there on the bevels of them i
found the prescription numbers-
d- s- i read the legends
aloud to him

  mine-mine he whispered

  well have to tell the captain about
this my companion added looks
tome as if the murderer has been un-
covered

  easy easy i cautioned this
isnt proof that doctor tokonoku killed


the popular magazine

madatoya it only tends to fix the theft
of your glasses on him besides cap-
tain kendall feels himself thoroughly
competent to do the police work on this
ship-this a savage whack at kendalls
bumptiousness on my part-and
theres no reason why we shouldnt let
him perhaps before this time to-mor-
row you and i can turn over the slayer
of madatoya to the skipper neatly
bound and tagged-and have your pre-
cious papers back as well now just
set those lenses back in place and til
take them down to doctor tokonoku

 not-

  certainly i interrupted he
mustnt for a minute suspect that his
pitiful bluff with your pince-nez is sus-
pected

  mather tightened the screws on the
lenses and i went down to doctor to-
konokus stateroom the door opened
a crack in answer to my knock and the
little mouse face of miss tokonoku ap-
peared there it was a gray yellow
and the moon eyes were narrowed to
two little white slits even through the
oriental mask of impassivity the stamp
of fear leered horribly

  your fathers glasses which he
dropped in the smoke room i ex-
plained as i slipped the pince-nez into
her hand and how is he feeling
now 

  the tiny figure at the door shrank
back and the crack between door and
jamb was narrowed as if to fend off
intrusion her mouth tried to frame
itself for words but they would not
come

  i-am-well thenk you came the
voice of doctor tokonoku from within
for the glasses many thenks

  the door closed instantly

  to me knowing something of the
japanese character that grudging crack
of the door the ghost of terror that
fought with the starched induration of
the womans face spoke volumes

  i went back to the deck there to coil

up in my chair and do some heavy
thinking what was to be the next
move that was the hard knot that
faced me in every essay at the center
of the mystery fate had played a fa-
voring trump just once when i was
allowed to uncover doctor tokonokus
subterfuge of the substitute pince-nez
but fate could scarcely be relied upon
to lead again it was up to me to take
the initiative find the murderer of
madatoya hadnt i done so it was
credible-almost a moral certainty-
that the one who would steal mathers
pince-nez with the evident intention of
leaving them as damning evidence in
the fingers of the slain man was the
same who had plunged a short sword
into the back of the secret-service
agent here was doctor tokonoku
wearing mathers specs in an attempt
to cover the loss of his own-a ruse
which might have succeeded had he not
risked safety for his chess passion his
artificial eyes were those found in the
murdered mans grip there had been
some fatal miscarriage at the moment
of the crime how then could little
tokonoku have been guilty of a blun-
der which marked him as a murderer
when he had taken such infinite precau-
tion as to provide by the stolen pince-
nez evidence of mathers guilt wasnt
this very blunder sufficient proof of the
participation of a second individual in
the murder some one say who
wasnt aware of tokonokus provision
of the stolen pince-nez or who didnt
give him time to arrange the substitu-
tion of mathers glasses for his own
after the blow had fallen

  that long black hair stuck in the
hinge of mathers port a japanese
womans hair the hair that was
matched only on the head of miss to-
konoku

  was this frail little brown wren the
second party to the assassination of
the spy was not hers the hand that
was slipped through mathers opened
the gold pince-nez



port-her arm being so short that she
had to push her head through also to
reach the washstand-and was it not
her blunder that had left her fathers
pince-nez in the grip of dead fingers

  those chilled eyes of fear i had seen
in the crack of the stateroom door
seemed to answer this question some
tremendous urge of filial duty such as
is ingrained in the japanese woman
above all women in the world had
whirled this mite of femininity into the
grim business of killing japanese
legend is replete with just such in-
stances many heroines of nippon had
hands like the lady macbeths

  granting this hypothesis where was
that packet of state-department secrets
upon which hung the safety of the
american secret-service agent in japan
and the honor of pierce mather
where but in the possession of doctor
tokonoku and his daughter why one
japanese had murdered another to gain
possession pf something profitable to
their common country-this was abso-
lutely beyond guessing

  how to get it-another crux

  did i know enough-have a big
enough grip on truth to go boldly to
doctor tokonoku and demand the res-
toration of the packet that would
be to accuse him of murder and my
chain of circumstantial evidence was
not strong enough to withstand any
sudden twist he might put upon it
where would i stand if i couldnt bluff
him into surrendering what i thought
he had-if he defied me to fasten mur-
der and theft upon him

  two curiously ground lenses in a
gold frame and a single black hair six-
teen or eighteen inches long-all my
evidence

  oh that was a wretched day of in-
decision  a dozen times i determined
to go down and face the little doctor
and as many times i was halted by the
saving grace of prudence what irked
me greatest was that i saw no way of

initiating other action my hands were
tied neither doctor tokonoku nor
his daughter was at table for the lunch-
eon and dinner call i saw trays going
to their stateroom after both meals had
been served mather who shared my
restlessness and whom i restrained
from spoiling things by going to cap-
tain kendall with the story of our sus-
picions only by constant persuasion
ranged the decks like a caged creature
he finally gained my promise that if
nothing developed before noon next day
-nothing could eventuate but another
fortuitous move by fate-i would tell
the captain what i knew about toko-
nokus eyes

  what made our futile waiting for
blind chance all the more unbearable
was the knowledge that madatoyas dis-
appearance had become common among
the japanese saloon passengers i
overheard a group back of the ventila-
tors by the smoke room discussing it in
lowered voices though their speech
was in their native tongue i under-
stood enough to discover that  to them
the death of the spy was not so great
a mystery as it appeared to me a sin-
gle word dido popped out of the
murmur of their conversation several
times eavesdropping as long as i
dared i quickly turned the corner of
the deck house wrhen the scuffling of
feet told me the conference was dis-
solving

  rack my brain as i would the word
dido conveyed nothing to me some-
where in the back pigeonholes of my-
mind lurked the aura of comprehen-
sion  i knew i had once heard the word
and understood its significance and i
suffered that exasperation which comes
to every one on occasions when the
backward trail of recollection leads to a
black rabbit hole

  night came and the desertion of the
decks about the saloon and the smoke
room the two oases of life in the desert
of the ocean dark rallied the siberias


the popular magazine

passengers in the one to listen to bad
music and chatter and in the other to
eddy around the card tables mather
whose eyes bothered him increasingly
went to bed early with a bad headache
i climbed into a cave of rugs on the
deck forward to nurse a brier and moil
over once more the endless chain of the
ships mystery

  through the lateral pipes of the rail
i could see the eerie lift of the pacific
vague white hands reaching in appeal
to the veiled genius of the water waste
in the face of this immensity of ocean
i drifted away from myself and out
onto the void beyond the ships rail

  how long i was thus detached i do
not know the thinking part of me
flew back with the swiftness of light
when miss tokonoku padding on
noiseless sandals passed me on the way
to the steps leading down to the for-
ward deck she would have passed
without recognition had it not been that
a stray beam of light from a deck state-
rooms porthole caught her fair in the
face as she slipped by my heart gave
a bound and i was burrowing out of
my rugs in an instant i gained the
side of the stairs screening my retreat
just in time to see her head disappear-
ing down the flight to the deck below
which was the domain of the steerage
passengers

  silently i crept to the head of the
companionway whose flanking sides
were canvas-covered it was dark
where i crouched but the foot of the
companionway was dimly lighted by a
flare from somewhere forward of the
hatch covers i heard the japanese
womans voice and another pitched in a
rough guttural-a mans she spoke
in the coolie class patois as a gentle-
woman addresses an inferior in japan
he answered respectfully with mono-
syllables by bringing my eye to a crack
between laced breadths of canvas i
could see them-the woman tiny as a
midget before a huge bulk of a man

whose head seemed covered by some
curiously shaped cap the fellow was
without doubt one of thesteerage jap-
anese who had boarded the boat at
honolulu

  i am sure tamatsu that fathers
eyes will be discovered she quavered
in a broken whisper do you know
worthless one what that will mean 
his death for killing a man he did not
kill

  i am not worthy to raise my eyes to
the soles of your feet the man mum-
bled it is my fault

  my hands against the canvas sides
of the companion way trembled so that
a little creaking came from the binding
cords

  my fathers message to you un-
thinking wood block is that if he is
accused you shall keep silence he can
explain much to a court in japan that
this american captain would not un-
derstand

  a noble master whom i will serve
with my life came the answer in the
thick speech of the tokyo streets

  followed something from the woman
i could not understand and the big
mans unintelligible reply then

  you have the americans papers
you got from madatoya

  yes honorable daughter of my mas-
ter

  you have them here-with you

  as you say

  then throw them in the sea came
the quiet command

  but gracious one the seal is not
broken your reverend father has not
seen them to know what they are the
mans voice was a whine

  his orders throw them in the sea
-now

  just a flash i had through the crack
in the canvas laps of the mans hand
withdrawing from the breast of his
kimono with a heavy brown packet be-
tween his fingers then i yelled and
the goud pince-nez



leaped over the rail down ten feet onto
his back

  what happened immediately there-
after i never have been able fully to re-
call i have only a dim recollection of
the sudden twist of writhing muscles
under me of an arm thick as an ana-
conda tightening about my throat-then
plunging stars and flames of aurora
borealis

  when my senses cleared i was sit-
ting on the lowest step of the compan-
ionway with sparks passing something
pungent under my nose in a circle of
coolies and sailors before me stood a
giant with arms bound behind him his
face was like a war mask of old japan
made more hideous by the coarse black
hair that streamed down all around it
even as far as his breast captain ken-
dall stood beside him in one hand a
heavy brown envelope splashed with
red sealing wax miss tokonoku was
not of the group	

  ah mr burke youre back came
the captains dry greeting faint under
the roaring in my ears i see youve
matched that hair you found on math-
ers port he jerked his finger toward
the fearsome figure of the bound man
it isnt everybody wholl tackle a jap-
anese wrestler i congratulate you

  i looked again at the hideous face
and huge shape of the prisoner then
i knew the clew of the single black hair
in the port hinge had led home it had
come from the head of the wrestler
who true to the traditions of his clan
wore his hair long after the ancient
fashion in headdressing of feudal ja-
pan none but a wrestler in nippon
allows his thatch to grow like a wom-
ans

  lock this fellow up in the brig until
we want him kendall ordered a bosn
and mr burke who was the japa-
nese woman we saw running away from
here when we answered your cry for
help 

  miss tokonoku i answered

  go fetch her to my quarters the
skipper directed one of the stewards
bring her father too

  very weak and shaky from the throt-
tling i had experienced at the hands
of the wrestler i followed kendall and
sparks to the formers cabin behind
the chart room i was tremendously
pleased with myself-why not admit
it-for having saved mathers precious
documents from the sea as well as from
the hands of the japanese also i real-
ized that the mystery of the pince-nez
was trembling on denouement mather
came in shortly and fell upon the
envelope kendall handed him with a
stifled cry of joy tears were in his
eyes when he shook my hand and
pointed to the seals on the flap of the
envelope unbroken

  the secretary of state will hear of
this old man he whispered ecstati-
cally

  then a petty officer entered the cabin
his hand under miss tokonokus arm
the woman appeared more pinched and
birdlike than ever her face was ashy
white and her eyes under narrowed
uptilting lids were set in a moveless
stare

  doctor tokonoku was not in his
stateroom sir the bosn said i
could not understand where the lady
said hed gone

  little miss tokonoku stood in the
circle of men seeing none of us i
mustered my best japanese limp and
halting at that

  miss tokonoku the captain would
like to speak to your father

  honorably pardon she answered
mechanically cleaving to her native
tongue the captain cannot see my
father he has augustly departed

  if you will tell us where we can find
him i began failing to grasp the
meaning of her words we will send

after-

  honorably pardon she repeated in
a squeaking voice the captain cannot


the popular magazine

find my father he has augustly de-
parted-there she turned and
pointed out the door to the black ocean

  i understood then and translated to
captain kendall his lips clapped tight
in surprise and into his eyes leaped
pity

  ask the lady to sit down mr
burke and tell her we are ready to
listen to explanations if she cares to
make any

  i put his words into japanese i saw
a sob rise in the womans throat but
she choked it back the japanese habit
of repression mastered though her lit-
tle body was wracked with grief

  for the sake of the law-when we
arrive at yokohama-this much she
began her eyes still looking into noth-
ingness when my father discovered
that madatoya had taken the american
gentlemans papers-to possess them he
himself had traveled all the way from
washington-he knew he must take
them from madatoya he was a patron
of tamatsu the wrestler who boarded
this ship at honolulu he told ta-
matsu his desire to get the papers

  tamatsu is faithful but he has little
intelligence he planned to kill mada-
toya he stole the glasses from the
americaft gentlemans room to put
them in the hand of madatoya when
he was dead that was very clever of
tamatsu my father knew nothing of
tamatsus plan to kill my father was
in madatoyas room tamatsu came
in behind my father and killed mada-
toya madatoya snatched the glasses
from my fathers eyes when he fell and
my father ran to his room afraid

  tamatsu saw the glasses in mada-
toyas hand they looked like the
glasses he had stolen from the amer-
ican gentleman he is a fool one
pair of glasses is like another he
thought so he left my fathers glasses
there and brought the american gentle-
mans to my father with the papers he
found in madatoyas bag we did not

dare change the glasses when my fa-
ther discovered the mistake besides
the door had locked with a spring from
the inside my father was nearly
blind but he wore the american gen-
tlemans glasses to avoid suspicion

  she finished abruptly

  why did your father order tamatsu
through you to throw the papers into
the sea i asked

  he knew his eyes had betrayed him
and he would be caught he could not
read them without his glasses i cannot
read english

  do you know why your father au-
gustly departed miss tokonoku i
asked as gently as i could he was
not the murderer

  he thought it best to do so miss
tokonoku answered

  i had been nearly a year back at my
post in tokyo before the last puzzle
of the pince-nez mystery was cleared
up to my satisfaction then through a
japanese a little bit the worse for sake
i learned of the dido clubs plot
against the government the dido club
was a group of radicals in tokyo whose
sole object was to embarrass the seiyu-
kai ministry doctor tokonoku was
the clubs chief mover the lever
which the dido club hoped to use
against the ruling power was the cali-
fornia land-law crisis

  doctor tokonoku in washington
with his daughter to spy upon the moves
of the state department anent the cali-
fornia problem learned of mathers
mission and followed him in the hope
of lifting his secret dispatches mada-
toya a regular government secret-serv-
ice agent beat tokonoku at his game

  i	have always thought it was toko-
nokus failure to accomplish his mission
that led to his august departure
rather than unexpected complicity in
the murder of madatoya the japa-
nese take their responsibilities seriously

a story of hockey as it is played in the far north

by n b beasley
author of behind the plate   somebody squealed  etc

from out of the north came ole
magee queer combination that
-ole magee oles father was
a red-haired fighting irishman
from the county armagh  oles mother
was a flaxen-haired maiden from the
northernmost fling of the lofoden
islands glance at the map and you
will see those islands nestling close to
the shore line of norway hugging the
land as a cub hugging a mother bear
to escape the blasting winds from the
arctic

  tim magee oles father was a fore-
man in lou turneys camp near beau-
cage which is in the nipissing district
when mary jensen-innocent trustful
wide and blue-eyed mary jensen-came
to cook for a horde of wild men tim
magee was hard enough but lou tur-
ney was a brute of a man and when
turney had sought to make alary his
own tim fought him beat him and left
that night taking mary with him he
emigrated to jasper bigelows camp
near nipigon-thirty miles due north
of old superior there they were mar-
ried

  as a result of that union came ole
magee

  mary magee died when ole squal-
ling and kicking came into the world
but she lived long enough to clasp the
little bundle of humanity to her breast
to press it to her face-her mouth her
eyes then it was that the flush faded
from her cheeks she sighed her
thread of life snapped and a mothers

soul passed through the gate that opens
only one way

  in the beginning oles life was a
precarious one big tim magee tried
to be kind he named the baby ole
because he thought the mother would
have liked that afterward tim was
helpless had it not been for mrs
mulvaney a small grave would have
been dug alongside a longer one but
mrs mulvaney took ole reared him
taught him his catechism joined with
tim magee in urging a hatred of the
name of turney sent him to school and
saw to it that he made his first com-
munion to father hussare

  after that mrs mulvaney had said
shurre an thats all th spalpane
can expect av a body th biy has
jarned th ways av th church its not
me fault now if he doesnt kape
straight

  past that and ole just grew

  one three five six years he worked
with his father in the woods sturdy
manhood came to be his tall he stood
exactly six feet in his stocking feet
well built he must have stripped one
hundred and ninety pounds all of it
was bone muscle and sinew like his
mother he had hair the color of rope
his eyes were blue keen and cold his
nose carried the tilt of the celt and the
twist of his mouth relieved the serious-
ness of his eyes ole magee had
muscles that rippled as if at play under
his coat

  in the twenty and two years that had


the popular magazine

elapsed since tim magee had drifted to
the shack of jasper bigelow with mary
jensen at his side the north country
had changed the camp had been
pushed steadily backward with the cut
of the timber now winter had come
it seemed only yesterday that tim
magee the foreman with ole magee
the hewer had walked together through
the quiet laads marking out the timber
line it-seemed only yesterday that tim
and ole magee had filled their lungs
with the air of the balsam the spruce
and the pine-the sweet-scented air of
the forests the winter of the north
came to them quick and almost unher-
alded a few flecks of snow were
whipped down on a bleak wind after
that was the deluge

  tim magee a rat portage newspaper
three weeks old in his horny hands was
sitting before a roaring log fire ole
magee his mind a blank to everything
else was bent close to the flame that he
might the better see how to study the
grain in the twisted wood across his
knees

   if i cut it this way i will have two
fair sticks if i cut it this way ill have
one a wolf couldnt chew in two mut-
tered ole to himself

  tim magee pushed aside his paper
and watched his son

  an phwat are yez makin there
queried tim although knowing per-
fectly well what the answer would be
my sticks

  your phwat

  my shinny sticks

  an are yez a-goin to play that
crazy game again this winter
certainly why not

  yezll get kilt at it some day me

ould man sposin yez gets into a mix-
up a scrape wit sticks a-flyin and fists
a-swingin-phwat thin me biy phwat
thin

  id take care of myself answered
ole quietly and without a show of con-
cern

  tim magee shook his head he re-
fused to meet defeat but he kept quiet
and ole continued tracing the grain in
the wood before him

  flockey as played in the north coun-
try would have been a game for primi-
tive man fourteen men seven to a
side play it they are men through
whose veins flows the reddest of blood
men who are strong men who live in
the open men who fight things of the
open men who are wild and who have
never been tamed nor are they men
who will be tamed they are men who
court possible death in the playing of a
game more scientific than our american
game of baseball more brutal than our
american game of football the game
is one of an everlasting test of muscles
the wood of sticks the steel of skates
the grit and nerve of man

  tom wilson was owner and manager
of the rat portage seven just at that
precise moment tom wilson was en-
couraging the first fits of- despair as
owner and manager of the rat portage
seven wilson was sad because tup
turney his star rover of the last years
team had deserted-had gone to port
arthurs team and turney had been
rated as the best hockey player in the
north without him rat portages
chances of repeating as a winner in the
fight for the championship were prac-
tically nil

 wilson was not a man to spare
money full of face and figure and
with pockets that were well lined with
the coin of the realm-gold that had
been wrung from the forests by an in-
dustrious father-and with a hearty dis-
tom magees boy ole



position to spend this money on any-
thing that pleased wilson was ready to
go the limit for a successor to turney

  wilson had one stubborn trait there
never was a man who threw him down
twice he would go the limit for a
friend he would do nothing if this
friend violated his confidence turney
after leaving had regretted and had
wanted to return wtilson wouldnt
listen to him or his pleas

  wilson passed out the word 

  get me a successor to turney-get
him quick

  when wilson said get him quick
he meant just that and pete dailey
his right-hand man of sport willingly
went on the search

  the north takes its hockey much
more seriously than new york or bos-
ton or chicago takes its baseball the
north-is the north hockey is as a
child born to it the atmosphere has
to be there snow ice chill winds air
that sends the red to your cheeks a
tingling to your nose and a desire yes
even an anxiety to walk fast pretty
girls in their toques and sweaters virile
men in pea-jackets-this is the atmos-
phere of the north

  when wilson said get me a suc-
cessor to turney dailey answered
with a vigorous yes though lacking
an idea and thinking within himself
that his boss had sent him on an aim-
less quest dailey had never heard of
the famous bit of sleuthing done by one
of the ancients for the golden fleece
else he might have compared himself
to that historic character as it was he
packed his change of shirt in his big
leather suit case tucked his own portly
form well within the confines of a fur
overcoat and set out on the funny lit-
tle half trot that a fat man sometimes
assumes pete headed for rat por-
tages single station and getting there
jerked a canadian pacific time-table
from a wooden rack and without going
to the trouble of unbuttoning his over-

coat flopped himself into the nearest
vacant seat and fell to poring over the
contents of the railroad directory

  dailey found a map and shoving his
stubby forefinger along the red line that
indicated the route of the railroad he
mumbled

  raleigh-hm had a hockey team
there couple of years ago busted up
dont suppose theres a man left in town
that knows what a puck looks like
this was stretching it rather far as
raleigh still possessed an amateur team
of some standing-locally

  daileys stubby forefinger pushed
ahead

  bonheur martin-hm english
river had a team there last winter
had a player named titus lets see
though the stubby finger left the
map and found a spot right against its
owners upper front teeth titus is
trying out with port arthur this year
the finger went back to the map
dexter then it skipped over port
arthur and past the dot that indicated
fort william lets see-pearl
nope theres nobody there thatd do
wolf-nipigon the finger paused
nipigon seems to me theyve got a
team of bushwhackers there guess ill
just try that spot

  decisions were made quickly with
pete dailey he stuffed the time-table
into a capacious inside pocket grabbed
up his suit case and crossed to the
ticket window

  gimme a ticket one way to nipi-
gon charlie he grunted to the man
behind the window

  better take a return pete-no one
ever buys a one-way ticket to nipigon
facetiously answered the agent

  bad very bad charlie wheezed
pete heard that one down to the
opera house night before last

  i dont care its a good one any-
way insisted the other besides its
the first chance fve had to spring it


the popular magazine

  all right all right but hurry and
give me that ticket hear that 

  pete daileys ear had caught the
hoarse hoot of canadian pacific train
no  whistling for the stop at rat
portage

  pete pushed the change across the
counter snatched up his ticket and the
leather suit case that was so much a
part of him on his travels and bustled
through the door and out onto the sta-
tion platform he stumbled up the
steps through and into the coach almost
before the wheels groaned into a full
stop

  if you ever go to nipigon you need
not be disappointed if you do not find
a full-fledged metropolitan hotel you
wont be able to wander through mar-
ble-pillared lobbies nor will you be able
to saunter into a dining room that is
only one of many where statuesque
waiters move to your slightest nod
where the silver the china and the cut-
glass ware be worth a kings ransom
or where you can order-and get-
strawberries on christmas day you
cant expect these things of nipigon
and you dont you can go to a small
stopping place and you can get good
wholesome food you will get home-
made bread and flaky biscuits you will
get fresh eggs and fresh milk and fresh
butter and sometimes you will be given
a change to fresh meat instead of
smoked ham or jerked beef the pro-
prietor will kick if you leave your win-
dow open at night but if you get a
headache from sleeping in a closed
room you will soon rid yourself of the
feeling by taking a turn about the town
in the morning

  pete dailey had never been in nipi-
gon before but as he alighted from the
train he wasnt surprised or disap-
pointed as assistant to tom wilson in
promoting the game of hockey in rat
portage he was accustomed to all man-
ner of places and he had been caught

in more unattractive communities than
this

  his first question after becoming ac-
quainted with the long-legged and loose-
jawed proprietor of nipigons single ho-
tel concerned hockey

  nope we aint got no hockey team
here answered the dignitary but-
he paused impressively-we got a
darned good shinny team

  pete laughed

  you get me-thats what i mean
he cried

  why dont you say what you mean
then coming round here with them
highflutun words hockey we calls
it shinny-and shinny it is

  all right then shinny-if you
want it rejoined pete you got any
good players around this neck of the
woods 

  i guess what dyou want to know
fer

  well you see its like this as i
told you my names dailey im from
rat portage and-- then pete
went on to explain

  his host nodded and squirting a
stream of tobacco juice into a near-by
pail he said

  theres tim magees boy hes good
an jack longridges boy hes good
an husk johnsons boy hes good
theyre all good only tim magees boy
hes captain and talk about skatin
say old nick himself couldnt beat
this boy

  when do these boys play pete
asked the question rather anxiously

  to-morrow morning i guess zeb
stewart was in here this forenoon and
he said something that sounded like as
though andy jennings bunch from the
camp over around roseport had chal-
lenged them to the first game of the
season

  just in time petey old boy just in
time sang dailey to himself for like
 all men of sport he believed in premoni-
tions-and he felt one coming now
tom magees boy ole



  the following morning pete dailey
was an interested spectator at the game
between rossport and nipigon he
mingled with the scores of lumbermen
he listened to their comments pete
dailey kept his ears wide open and his
mouth tightlyshut that he might the
better understand bits of stray conversa-
tion at one time pete had believed he
would have made a mighty good detec-
tive perhaps a rival to holmes burns
and some of those other fellows of fic-
tion and fact

  particular attention did he pay to ole
magee the name sounded good to
him and he remembered it

  the science of these woodsmen did
not appeal to pete at times he could
scarcely repress a smile at the antics of
one or two of the players but he re-
frained he knew they were in deadly
earnest that the spectators were com-
pletely wrapped up in the play of the
men before them and that any adverse
criticism by a stranger might lead to
trouble petes respect for the health
and intactness of his own body was
deep-rooted

  but he couldnt help but watch ole
magee here wras a player set apart
ole did everything any of his com-
panion could do and a lot of things
they couldnt attempt light as a pro-
fessional dancer on his feet although
always steady and sure on his skates of
steel quick of eye keen for openings
flashing twisting dodging jumping al-
ways he was in the center of a mix-up
always was he successfully getting out
of it he simply controlled the play
and when the game had ended nipigon
was a winner on an easy score of  to
 of the ten goals ole magee had
scored nine

  petes appraising eye noted that oles
shots though always played in a veriest
fraction of a second seemed the result
of quick but studied effort tricks
of hockey such as dribbling the rubber
disk in and out of the opponents legs

such as catching the puck backward and
bringing it around a danger point such
as clearing the other fellows stick or his
body if needs beat a single jump
seemed to be magees pete noted that
all of them were done with precision
and decision

  a born player commented he as he
watched ole leaving the ice skates in
one hand stick in another and accom-
panying an older man whom petes in-
sight into human nature called his
father pete sauntered after them and
followed into the single hotel he
found them together in the bar with a
crowd of other lumbermen he noted
that ole w as the only one of the gather-
ing who didnt touch the whisky and
he was pleased

  waiting until what he considered his
propitious moment pete shouldered
himself through the crowd and to where
ole was standing

  magee my names dailey im from
rat portage and i want to congratulate
you on your hoc-shinny playing
beamed pete as he held out his hand

  ole acknowledged the greeting

  can i have a word with you in pri-
vate asked dailey

  in private why these men are
all my friends returned ole

  yes were all his friends stranger
chorused the drinkers

  but this concerns you-you only-
insisted pete

  go aside wit him me biy lets hear
what hes got to say chimed in tim
magee

  the boy followed by tim and pete
shouldered his way through the crowd
and into another room

  dailey could talk business faster than
any man in the north he firmly be-
lieved in going right to the point get-
ting quick and decisive answers and
following to his own advantage any
weakness that might appear in anothers
defense

  magee im- wait a minute is


the cpocpular magazine

this your father ole nodded i
thought so you look  alike tim
magees body unconsciously straight-
ened and a flash of-pride went through
his eyes this was not lost on dailey
as i started to say im from rat
portage and im tom wilsons friend
and representative pete took it for
granted that the others knew who wil-
son was we lost tup turney-

  who bellowed tim magee

  pete was taken back but he repeated
tup turney

  whos tup turney vehemently
shouted the old man

  well ill be a-hes the best rover
in ontario hes the greatest goal shot
in the north he was the backbone of

our team last-

  i dont care a rap about that his
father-who was he 

  whats that got to do with this in-
quired pete in some amazement

nivir moind-who was he 
heavens i dont know guess hes a
timber cutter over around beaucage
tims face went a dirty red and he
would have burst out with a string of
expletives but he was checked by ole

  dailey isnt interested in that dad
wait until we hear what hes got to
say

  tim subsided

  as i was going to say repeated
pete dryly im tom wilsons repre-
sentative we lost turney from our
hockey team bort arthur coaxed him
away-then there was a moll i guess
weve got to get a man to take his place
im out to find one i watched you to-
day and i think youll fill the bill well
pay you good money to come weve
got to have you what do you say f
fortunately perhaps for ole he pos-
sessed some of the instincts of frugality
that were born within him from his
mothers side

  let me understand you he said
you want me to play on the rat por-
tage team

  exactly

  do you think im good enough
  well take the chance

  hell git a chance to match turney 
interposed tim

  he will if he plays replied pete
ole examined one point of the skate
which was slung over his shoulder
finally he asked

  what do i get out of it

  five hundred and your expenses on
the road

  ole looked at pete keenly his old
cold blue eyes detected a tinge of anxi-
ety for a reason not known to him-
self he was cautious

  you mean-five hundred a season
or a month

  a season

  ole shook his head

  not worth it he answered with
emphasis

  then followed a long argument but
it was dailey who finally surrendered
he named a sum considerably in ex-
cess of the one first suggested and his
proposal was accepted

  and with the reaching of the agree-
ment pete dailey mopped his forehead
with the back of his puffy right hand
and heaved a tremendous whew 

  but right afterward he hurried to
the railway station and dispatched a
telegram to tom wilson it read

  got the best rover west of the atlantic
name is magee get ready for him

  pete made certain that the message
got away that night-and that it went
collect

  rat portage was excited there isnt
any necessity for using the superlative
in this case as rat portage never be-
comes excited over anything but hockey
and it has to have the first game of the
season with port arthur to put it at the
pitch of interest when this happens
merchants simply close their stores fa-
thers take their wives and families
every one old decrepit middle-aged
and the young men and women youths
tom magees  ole



and maidens boys and girls buy their
way into this contest where in your
cities can you find such enthusiasm
imaging if you can new york or chi-
cago closing up shop to go to a base-
ball game

  ole magee had come to rat portage
he had made good the early practice
games only served to liven up the team
and in them ole had made he followers
of hockey forget their sighing for tup
turney the man who had deserted

  no skater coming down on the wind
was faster than he no puck handler was
trickier no man was more brilliant in
attack not many steadier in defense

  now the game with port arthur

  tim magee flanked by a score of
heavy woodsmen from the district near
nipigon came into rat portage a day
before the contest and tim magee it
was in a moment of drink who told of
the feud of more than two decades be-
fore in beaucage rat portage being
bitter against tup turner listened sym-
pathetically and then plied tim with
such information and fiction as would
work best with an inflamed brain rat
portage was anxious to have this match
resolve into a grudge fight tim heard
and was tearing mad as tearing mad as
only an irishman can get

  tin it was who fed the last dregs of
parental wrath and hatred into the ears
of ole magee

  and ole revering the memory of a
mother he never known had listened

  air that was cold lights that glared
and sputtered frigidly it seemed above
a pen banked high on every side by
rows of seats every one of which was
filled by a tense straining body this
was what burst upon ole magee as ac-
companied by half a dozen other play-
ers he skated through the gate for
the preliminary practice a wild crowd
released a wild greeting to the home
players it was a sullen crowd when

tup turney and the port arthur play-
ers flashed through another opening

  ole magee had never seen turney
and he looked with interest when the
son of a father he had been taught to
hate appeared turney having heard
of magee returned the gaze turney
was a man who might have been mod-
eled from the same pattern as ole tall
straight as any young pine in the sur-
rounding forest well proportioned
quick and certain in every movement
only turneys features were different
his face lacked the frank openness of
oles and it showed some signs of early
decay his hair was like his fathers-
short curly and black there was a
strain of the french in turney

  once he made as though to approach
ole and he did start toward him but
then changing his mind he swung off
on one foot and skated away

  the game started in a furious clash
of sticks in the center of the rink rat
portages center gained the first ad-
vantage slicing the puck and slipping
it backward through his legs to ole who
was coming up behind him getting the
rubber disk in the heel of his stick ole
darted toward port arthurs goal and
a tremendous shout went up as he
cleared the first line of defense just
for a moment rat portage forgot tup
turney and in that moment it saw the
sudden dash of its favorite checked the
puck was jerked away from magee
and turney dodging and twisting
broke through the rat portage line and
sped away

  he didnt reach the goal for ole had
swung around and striding through
with all the strength and speed of his
powerful legs he caught turney and
there followed a short sharp tussle for
possession ole won again flipping the
puck away to where another of his own
team was waiting half bent over for a
vicious dash through the territory of the
visitors

three minutes five then ten then


the popular magazine

twelve then fifteen of the twenty min-
utes to a half passed the game-it
was more than a game it was a fight be-
tween two men a mad rushing relent-
less fight between ole magee and tup
turney for supremacy on the ice the
half was nearing a close neither team
had scored the play had been evenly
divided first on port arthurs ice then
near the rat portage goal with every
man woman and child in the mob of
five thousand screaming for ole magee
and his mates to hold them not in
hockeys history in rat portage had
there been a game such as this the
minutes slipped away and a whistle
shrilled denoting the end of the half as
oie magee and tup turney slashed
away in the center of the ice

  the second half started as had the
first those two-magee and turney
-were ever in the front rat portage
had almost forgotten to watch the play
of the other men in the beginning
turney had been confident he had
smiled at oles first efforts had satis-
fied himself in thinking this newcomer
an untried upstart but as the game
lengthened turneys mind slowly but
nevertheless surely switched he be-
gan to realize that in magee he had
met an antagonist who was fully worthy
of the best hockey that was within him
and in that second half he began a driv-
ing attack that crushed rat portages
defense

  the wings wilted before his furi-
ous rushes the cover point and the
point the men right in front of the
goal tender lost heart and instead of
crashing into turney and breaking him
they only reached out sticks in a half-
hearted way turney went over and
through like a man unshod a dozen
times he shot at the rat portage goal a
dozen times he failed failed because of
the presence of magee ole was ever
on top of him was ever forcing him
to the sides of the pen was ever crowd-
ing him into the hardest of angles from

  which to shoot ole realizing that these
were the insane rushes of a terrific
force knew no man could long con-
tinue them and he bided his time
playing sure but still letting out some
of his own driving power tohold tur-
ney in check

  there came the time when turney
exhausted by his own efforts dropped
back to regain strength it was in the
closing minutes of the second half and
then it was that ole magee went
through

  snaring the puck almost in the
shadow o his own goal and zipping
around and through his own and the
port arthur players he began a rush
that rat portage still talks about with
his stick held slightly to one side and
the front of him he flew past the first
port arthur players dodged the sec-
ond and flashed on toward where tur-
ney was waiting as one of the last de-
fenders of the port arthur goal dodg-
ing was out of the question now real-
izing that his only hope lay in outguess-
ing turney ole made a sudden snap
of his stick the puck was sent spin-
ning away it crashed against the
wooden side of the pen and bounded
off at an acute angle and toward the
goal

  turney hesitated turned and sprang
for the rubber he did just what ole
had wished him

  in his indecision he lost the valuable
fraction of a second and before realiz-
izing his mistake he felt magees body
whip past and almost with the passing
magee aided by the speed of a long
rush was again upon the puck ole
ripped by the point a stick flashed the
puck a black streak in the air sang by
the goal tender and dropped into the net

  the up stretched arm of the goal um-
pire indicated to the crowd that magee
had scored

  there isnt anything to tell of the bal-
ance of the game rat portage bol-
stered in mind by an advantage put up
tom magees boy ole



a defensive game the game ended this
way

  rat portage i port arthur o

  afterward ole magee met tup tur-
ney turney it was who congratulated
ole and turney it was who told ole
that there should be no quarrel between
them

  my father is dead now but before
he died he asked me to keep faith with

a magee-wherever i met him ex-
plained tup

  and ole being happy in his own vic-
tory shook hands and did his best to
forget

  it didnt matter to him that when tim
magee found out there should be angry
words for ole reasoned

  tup turneys a hockey player after
my own heart and it isnt his fault if
his father was-a brute of the north

  the right song

by berton braley

     were sick to death of the style of song
     thats only a sort of a simpering song

a kissy song and a sissy song

or a weepy creepy whimpering song

and we long for a different brand of song
from the smiling wiling smirking song
from the shady song or the ladys song

  oh give us the thrill of a working song
the husky shout of the toilers stout

the rumbling roar of a working song

we have had enough of the type of song
thats a whining pining sniffling song

or the lovey dovey stripe of song-

  an utterly useless piffling song

so give us the lift of a lusty song
  a boisterous bubbling boiling song

or a smashing song and a dashing song

oh give us the tang of a toiling song

the chantey loud of the working crowd

the thunderous thrall of a toiling ong

b

aye sing us a joyous daring song

  not a moaning groaning fretting song
but a ringing song and a swinging song

a rigorous vigorous sweating sdng
we have had enough of the gypsy song
which is only a lazy shirking song

so toughen your throat to a rougher note
and give us the tune of a working song t
a tune of strife and the joy of life

the beat and throb of a working song

the fight goes on

it is amazing how quickly life swings
back to the normal after even so
harrowing an experience as had
come to the flying u tragedy had
hovered there a while and had turned
away with a smile and the smile was
reflected upon the faces and in the eyes
of every one upon whose souls had
fallen her shadow the kid was safe
and he was well and he had not suffered
from the experience on the contrary
he spent most of his waking hours in
recounting his adventures to an ad-
miring audience he was a real old
cow-puncher he had gone into the
wilderness and he had proven the stuff
that was in him he had made dry
camp just exactly as well as any of the
happy family could have done he
had slept out under the stars rolled in
a blanket-and do you think for one
minute that he would ever submit to
lace-trimmed nighties again  if you
do ask the little doctor what the kid
said on the first night after his return
when she essayed to robe him in spot-
less white and rock him held tight in
her starved arms

  the little doctor was learning some
things about her man-child and one of
them was this when he rode away
into the bad lands and was lost other
things were lost-and lost permanently
he was no longer her baby he had

come back to her changed so that she
studied him amazedly while she wor-
shiped he had entered boldly into the
life which men live and he would never
return to the old order of things

  she knew that it was so when the
kid insisted next day upon going home
with the bunch  with andy rather who
was just now the kids particular hero
he had to help the bunch they needed
him and andy needed him and miss
allen needed him

  aw you neednt be scared doctor
dell he told her shrewdly i aint
going to try and find them brakes any
more ill stick with the bunch cross
my heart and ill come back to-night
if youre scared thout me honest to
granma ive got to go and help the
bunch lick the stuffin outa them nesters
doctor dell

  the little doctor looked at him
strangely hugged him tight-and let
him go chip would ride up later and
he would bring the kid home safely
and-the limitations of dooryard play
no longer sufficed her fledgling had
found what his wings were for and the
nest was too little now

 well take care of him andy prom-
ised her understandingly if chip
dont come up this afternoon ill bring
him home myself dont you worry a
minute about him

  id tell a man she neednt added
the kid patronizingly

  i suppose hes a lot safer with you

boys than he is here at the ranch-un-
less one of us stood over him all the
time or we tied him up she told andy
gamely i feel like a hen trying to
raise a duck go on buck-bat give
mother a kiss first

  the kid kissed her violently and with
a haste that betrayed where his thoughts
were in spite of the fact that never be-
fore had his mother called him buck
to her it was a surrender of his baby-
hood-to him it was his due the lit-
tle doctor sighed and watched him ride
away beside andy children are such
self-centered little beasts she told j

g	ruefully i almost wish he was a
girl

  huh if he was a girl he wouldnt
get lost maybe but some fellerd take
him away from yuhjust the same the
kids all right hes just the kind youd
expect him to be and want him to be
youre tickled to death because hes
like he is dog-gone it dell that kids
got the real stuff in him hes a dead
ringer fer his dad-that ought to do
yuh

  it does the little doctor declared
but it does seem as if he might be con-
tented here with me for a little while-
after such a horrible time-

  it wasnt horrible to him yuh want
to recollect dog-gone it i wish that
blake would come back you write to
him dell and tell him how things is
stacking up he oughta be here on the
ground no tellin what them nestersll
build up next

  so the old man slipped back into the
old channels of worry and thought just
as life itself slips back into the old chan-
nels after a stressful period the lit-
tle doctor sighed again and sat down
to write the letter and to discuss with
the old man what she should say

  there was a good deal to say for
one thing more contests had been filed
and more shacks built upon claims be-
longing to the happy family she must
tell blake that also blake must help

make some arrangement whereby the
happy family could hire an outfit to
gather their stock and the alien stock
which they meant to drive back out of
the bad lands and there was irish
who had quietly taken to the hills again
as soon as the kid returned blake was
needed to look into that particular bit of
trouble and try and discover just how
serious it was the man whom irish had
floored with a chair was apparently hov-
ering close to death-and there were
those who emphasized the adverb but
could prove nothing

  and you tell im directed the old
man querulously that ill stand good
for his time while hes lookin after
things for the boys and tell im if hes
so dog-goned scared ill buy into the
game he neednt to show up here at the
ranch at all tell him to stay in dry
lake if he wants to-serve him right
to stop at that hotel fer a while but
tell him for the lords sake git a move
on the way it looks to me things is
piling up on them boys till they cant
hardly see over the top and somethings
got to be done tell im-here give
me a sheet of paper and a pencil and
ill tell him a few things myself
chances are youd smooth em out too
much gitting em on paper and the
things ive got to say to blake dont
want any smoothing

  the things he wrote painfully with
his rheumatic hand weie not smoothed
for politeness sake and it made the old
man feel better to get them-off his mind
he read the letter over three times
lingering over the most scathing sen-
tences relishfully he sent one of his
new men to town for the express pur-
pose of mailing that letter and he felt
a glow of satisfaction at actually speak-
ing his mind upon the subject for once
perhaps it was just as well he did not
know that blake was in dry lake when
the letter reached the office and that it
was forwarded to the place whence it
had started blake was already get-


the cpopulacr magazine

ting a move on and he needed no such
spur as the old mans letter

  blake had no intention of handling
the case from the flying u porch for
instance he had laid his plans quite
independently of the flying u outfit
he had no intention of letting irish be
arrested upon a trumped-up charge and
he managed to send a word of warning
to that hot-headed young man not to
put himself in the way of any groping
arm of the law it was so much simpler
than arrest and preliminary trial and
bail and all that he had sent word to
weary to come and see him before ever
he received the old mans letter and
he had placed at wearys disposal what
funds would be needed for the immedi-
ate plrns of the happy family he
had attended in person to the hauling
of the fence material to their boundary
line on the day he arrived and discov-
ered by sheer accident that the stuff
was still in the warehouse of the general
store

  after he did all that the honorable
blake received the old mans letter
read it through slowly and afterward
stroked down his vandyke beard and
laughed quietly to himself the letter
itself was both peremptory and profane
and commanded the honorable blake
to do exactly what he had already done
and what he intended to do when the
time came for the doing

lawful improvement

  florence grace hallman must not be
counted a woman without principle or
kindness of heart or those qualities
which make women beloved of men
she was a pretty nice young woman un-
less one roused her antagonism had
andy green for instance accepted in
good faith her offer of a position with
the syndicate he would have found her
generous and humorous and loyal and
kind he would probably have fallen

in love with her before the summer was
over and he would never have discov-
ered in her nature that hardness and
that spiteful scheming which came to
the surface and made the whole happy
family look upon her as an enemy

  florence grace hallman was in-
tensely human as well as intensely
loyal to her firm she had liked
andy green better than any one-her-
self included-realized it was not al-
together her vanity that was hurt when
she discovered how he had worked
against her-how little her personality
had counted with him she felt
chagrined and humiliated and as though
nothing save the complete subjugation
of andy green and the complete
thwarting of his plans could ease her
own hurt

  deep in her heart she hoped that he
would eventually want her to forgive
him his treachery she would give him
a good hard fight-she would show him
that she was mistress of the situation
she would force him to respect her as a
foe after that-andy green was hu-
man certainly she trusted to her fem-
inine intuition to say just what should
transpire after the fight trusted to her
feminine charm also to bring her what-
ever she might desire

  that was the personal side of the
situation there was also the pro-
fessional side which urged her to fight
for the interests of her firm and
since both the personal and the pro-
fessional aspects of the case pointed to
the same general goal it may be as-
sumed that florence grace was pre-
pared to make a stiff fight

  then andy green proceeded to fall in
love with that sharp-tongued rosemary
allen and rosemary allen had no bet-
ter taste than to let herself be lost and
finally found by andy and had the
nerve to show very plainly that she not
only approved of his love but returned
it after that florence grace was in
a condition to stop at nothing-short of
the last stand



murder-that would aefeat the happy
family in their latest project

  while all the bear paw country was
stirred up over the lost child florence
grace hallman said it was too bad and
had they found him yet-and went
right along planting contestants upon
the claims of the happy family she
encouraged the building of claim shacks
and urged firmness in holding pos-
session of them she visited the man
whom irish had knocked down with a
chair and she had a long talk with him
and with the-doctor who attended him
she saw to it that the contest notices
were served promptly upon the happy
family and she hurried in shipments of
stock oh she was very busy indeed
during the week that was spent in hunt-
ing the kid when he was found and
the rumor of an engagement between
rosemary allen and that treacherous
andy green reached her she was busier
still but since she changed her methods
and was careful to mask her real pur-
pose behind an air of passive resent-
ment her industry became less ap-
parent

  the happy family did not pay much
attention to florence grace hallman
and her studied opposition they were
pretty busy attending to their own af-
fairs  andy green was not only busy
but very much in love so that he almost
forgot the existence of florence grace
except on the rare occasions when he
met her riding over the prairie trails

  first of all they rounded up the stock
that had been scattered and they did not
stop when they crossed antelope coulee
with the settlers cattle they bedded
them there until after dark then they
drove them on to the valley of dry
lake crossed that valley on the main
traveled road and pushed the herd up
on lonesome prairie and out as far
upon the bench land as they had time to
drive them

 they did not make much effort
toward keeping it a secret indeed

weary told three or four of the most
indignant settlers next day where they
would find their cattle but he added
that the feed was pretty good back
there and advised them to leave the
stock out there for the present

  it isnt going to do you fellows any
good to rear up on your hind legs and
make a holler he said calmly we
havent hurt your cattle we dont want
to have trouble with anybody but
were pretty sure to have a fine large
row with our neighbors if they dont
keep on their own side the fence

  that fence was growing to be more
than a mere figure of speech the
happy family did not love the digging
of post holes and the stretching of
barbed wire on the contrary they
hated it so deeply that you could not get
a civil word out of one of them while
the work went on yet they put in long
hours at the fence building

  they had to take the work in shifts
on account of having their own cattle
to watch day and night sometimes it
happened that a man tamped posts or
helped stretch wire all day and then
stood guard two -or three hours on the
herd at night which was wearing on
the temper sometimes because they
were tired they quarreled over small
things

  new shipments of cattle too kept
coming to dry lake invariably these
would be driven out toward antelope
coulee-farther if the drivers could
manage it-and would have to be driven
back again  with what patience the
happy family could muster no one
helped them there was every attitude
among the claim dwellers from open
opposition to latent antagonism none
were quite neutral--and yet the happy
family did not bother any save these
who had filed contests to their claims
or who took active part in the cattle
driving

  the happy family were not half as
brutal as they might have been in spite


the popular magazine

of their no-trespassing signs they per-
mitted settlers to drive across their
claims with wagons and water barrels
to haul water from one man creek
when the springs and creek in antelope
coulee went dry

  they did not attempt to move the
shacks of the contestants off their
claims they grudged the time the
moving would take though they hated
the sight of them and of the owners
who bore themselves with such provo-
cative assurance but the honorable
blake had told them that moving the
shacks would accomplish no real per-
manent good within thirty days they
must appear before the register and re-
ceiver and file answer to the contest and
he assured them that mildness and for-
bearance upon their part would serve to
strengthen their case with the commis-
sioner

  it goes to prove how deeply in earnest
they were that they immediately began
to practice assiduously the virtues of
mildness and forbearance they could
he told them postpone the filing of their
answers until close to the end of the
thirty days which would serve also to
delay the date of actual trial of the con-
tests and give the happy family more
time for their work

  their plans had enlarged somewhat
they talked now of fencing the whole
tract on all four sides and of building
a dam across the mouth of a certain
coulee in the foothills which drained
several miles of rough country thereby
converting the coulee into a reservoir
that would furnish water for their
desert claims it would take work of
course but the happy family was be-
ginning to see prosperity on the trail
ahead and nothing in the shape of hard
work could stop them from coming to
handgrips with fortune

  chip helped them all he could but he
had the flying u to look after and that
without the good teamwork of the
happy family which had kept things

moving along so smoothly the team-
work now was being used in a different
game a losing game one would say at
first glance

  so far the summer had been favor-
able to dry farming the more enters
prising of the settlers had sown grain
and planted potatoes upon freshly
broken soil and these were grown
apace they did not know about those
scorching august winds that would
shrivel crops in a day they did not
realize that early frosts might kill what
the hot winds did not they became
enthusiastic over dry farming and their
resentment toward the happy family
increased as their enthusiasm waxed
strong the happy family complained
to one another that you couldnt pry a
nester loose from his claim with a crow-
bar

  in this manner did civilization march
out and take possession of the high
prairies that lay close to the flying u
they had a sunday school organized
with the meetings held in a double shack
near the trail to dry lake the happy
family riding that way sometimes
heard voices mingled in the shrill sing-
ing of some hymn where a year before
they had listened to the hunting song
of the coyote

  eighty acres to the man-with that
climate and that soil they never could
make it pay with that soil especially
since it was mostly barren the happy
family knew it and could find it in
their hearts to pity the men who were
putting in dollars and time and hard
work there but for obvious reasons
they did not put their pity into speech

  they fenced their west line in record
time there was only one gate in the
whole length of it and that was on the
trail of dry lake not content with
trusting to the warning of four strands
of barbed wire stretched so tight they
hummed to the touch they took turns
in watching it-riding fence in range
parlance-and in watching cattle
thb last stan



  to h j owens and his fellow con-
testants they paid not the slightest at-
tention because the honorable blake
had urged them personally to ignore any
and all claimants to florence grace
hallman they gave no heed believing
that she had done her worst and that
her worst was after all pretty mild
since the contests she had caused to be
filed could not possibly be approved by
the government so long as the happy
pamily continued to abide by every law
and by-law and condition and require-
ment in their present thoroughgoing
and exemplary manner

  you should have seen how mild-man-
nered and how industrious the happy
family was during those three weeks
which followed the excitement of the
kids adventuring into the wild you
would have been astonished and you
would have made the mistake of think-
ing that they had changed permanently
and might be expected now to settle
down with wives and raise families and
hay and cattle and potatoes and grow
beards perhaps and become well-to-do
ranchers

  the happy family was almost con-
vinced that they were actually leaving
excitement -behind them for good and
all they might hold back the encroach-
ing tide of immigration from the rough
land along the river-that sounded like
something exciting to be sure but they
must hold back the tide with legal pro-
ceedings and by pastoral pursuits and
tflat promised little in the way of brisk
decisive action and strong nerves and
all those qualities which set the happy
family somewhat apart from their fel-
lows

chapter xxiii

the water question and some
gossip

  miss rosemary allen rode down into
one man coulee and boldly up to the
cabin of andy green and shouted mu-
sically for him to come forth andy

made a hasty pass at his hair with a
brush jerked his tie straight and came
out eagerly there was no hesitation in
his manner he went straight to her
and reached up to pull her from the sad-
dle that he might hold her in his arms
and kiss her-after the manner of bold
young men who are very much in love
but miss rosemary allen stopped him
with a push that was not altogether
playful and scowled at him viciously

  i am in a most furious mood to-
day she said i want to scratch
somebodys eyes out i want to say
words dont come close or i might
pull your hair or something james
she called him james because that was
not his name and because she had
learned a good deal about his past mis-
deeds and liked to take a sly whack at
his notorious tendency to forget the
truth by calling him truthful james

  all right that suits me fine its
worth a lot to have you close enough
to pull hair where have you been all
this long while  being a bold young
man and very much in love he kissed
her in spite of her professed vicious-
ness

  oh ive been to town-it hasnt
been more than three days since we met
and had that terrible quarrel james
what was it about she frowned
down at him thoughtfully im still
furious about it-whatever it is do
you know mister man that i am an
outlaw among my neighbors and that
our happy little household up there on
the hill is a house divided against it-
self ive put up a green burlap cur-
tain on my southwest corner and
bought me a smelly oil stove and i
positively refuse to look at my neigh-
bors or speak to them im going to
get some lumber and board up that side
of my house these three cats-they
get together on the other side of my
curtain and say the meanest things 

  andy green had the temerity to
laugh that sounds good to me


the popular magazine

he told her unsympathetically now
maybe youll come down and keep house
for me and let that pinnacle go to thun-
der its no good anyway and i told
you so long ago that whole eighty
acres of yours wouldnt support a fam-
ily of jack rabbits a month what-

  and let those old hens say they
drove me off that kate price is the
limit the things she has said to me
you wouldnt believe and it all started
over my going with little buck a few
times to ride along your fence when
you boys were busy i considered that
i had a perfect right to ride where i
pleased of course theyre furious
anyway because i dont side against
you boys and-all that when-when
they found out about-you and me
james they said some pretty sarcastic
things but i didnt pay any attention to
that poor old freaks i expected them
to be jealous because nobody ever pays
any attention to them kate price is
the worst-shes an old maid the
others have hackhusbands and can act
superior

  well i didnt mind the things they
said then i took that for granted but
a week or so ago florence hallman
came and she did stir things up in great
style since then the girls have hardly
spoken to me except to say something
insulting and florence grace came
right out and called me a traitor that
was before little buck and i took to
riding fence as you call it for you
boys you can imagine what theyve
been saying since then

  well what do you care you dont
have to stay with them and you know
it im just waiting-

  well but im no quitter james
im going to hold down that claim now
if i have to wear a six-shooter her
eyes twinkled at the idea besides i
can stir them up now and then and get
them to say things that are useful for
instance florence hallman told kate
price about that last trainload of cattle

coming and that they were going to cut i
your fence and drive them through in j
the night-and i stirred dear little katie
up so she couldnt keep still about that
and therefore-she reached out and
gave andy greens ear a small tweak-
somebody found out about it and a
lot of somebodys happened around that
way and just quietly managed to give
folks a hint that there was fine grass
somewhere else that saved a lot of
horseflesh and words and work didnt
it

  it sure did andy smiled up at her

just the same-

  but listen here nice level-headed
katie-girl has lost her temper since then
and let out a little more that is useful
knowledge to somebody theres one
great weak point in the character of
florence hallman maybe you have no-
ticed it shes just simply got to have
some one to tell things to and she
doesnt always show the best judgment

in her choice of a confessional-

  ive noticed that before andy
green admitted and smiled rem-
iniscently she sure does talk too much
for a lady that carries so many
schemes up her sleeve

  yes-and shes been making a chum
of kate price since she discovered what
an untrustworthy creature i am i did
a little favor for irish mallory james
i overheard florence grace talking to
kate about that man who is supposed to
be at deaths door so i made a trip
to great falls if you please and i
scouted around and located the gentle-
man-well anyway i gave that nice
sleek little lawyer of yours a few facts
that will let irish come back to his

claim-

  irish has been coming back to his
claim pretty regular as it is andy in-
formed her quietly did you think he
was hiding out all this time why-
he laughed at her-you talked to him
yourself one day and thought it was
weary remember when you came
the last stand



over with the mail that was irish
helping me string wire hes been wear-
ing wearys hat and clothes and cul-
tivating a twinkle to his eyes-thats
all

  why i-well anyway that man
theyve been making a fuss over is just
as well as you are james they only
wanted to get irish in jail and make a
little trouble-pretty cheap warfare at
that if you want my opinion

  oh well-whats the odds while
theyre wasting time and energy that
way were going right along doing what
weve laid out to do say do you know
im kinda getting stuck on this ranch
proposition if i just had a house-
keeper-

  miss rosemary allen seldom let him
get beyond that point and she inter-
rupted him now by wrinkling her nose
at him in a manner that made andy
green forget altogether that he had be-
gun a sentence upon a subject forbid-
den later she went back to her wor-
ries  she was a very persistent young
woman

  i hope you boys are going to attend
to that contest business right away she
said with a pucker between her eyes
and not much twinkle in them theres
something about that which i dont
quite understand i heard florence
hallman and kate talking yesterday
about it going by default are you sure
its wise to put off filing your answers
so long when are you supposed to ap-
pear james

  me on or before the twenty-oneth
day of july my dear girl they lumped
us up and served us all on the same day
-i reckon to save shoe leather there-
fore inasmuch as said adverse parties
have got over a week left-

  you better not take a chance wait-
ing till the last day in the afternoon
she warned him vaguely maybe they
think youve forgotten the date or some-
thing-but whatever they think i be-
lieve theyre counting on your not an-

swering in time i think florence hall-
man knows they havent any real proof
against you i knozv she knows it shes
perfectly wild over the way you boys
have stuck here and worked and from
what i can gather she hasnt been able
to scrape up the weentiest bit of evi-
dence that the flying u is backing you
-and of course that is the only ground
they could contest your claims on so
if it comes to trial youll all win youre
bound to i told kate price so-and
those other old hens yesterday and
thats what we had the row over

  my moneys on you girl andy told
her grinning how are the wounded

  the wrounded oh theyve clubbed
together this morning and are washing
hankies and collars and things and talk-
ing about me and they have snouged
every speck of water from the barrel-
i paid my share for the hauling too-
and the man wont come again -till day
after to-morrow with more fifty cents
a barrel straight hes charging now
james and you boys with a great big
long creekful of it that you can get
right into and swim in ive come over
to borrow two water bags of it if you
please james i never dreamed water
was so precious florence hallman
ought to be made to live on one of these
dry claims shes fooled us into taking
i really dont know james whats go-
ing to become of some of these poor
farmers you knew didnt you that
mr murphy spent nearly twro hundred
dollars boring a well-and now its so
strong of alkali they darent use a drop
of it mr murphy is living right up to
his name and nationality since then
hes away back there beyond the sands
place you know he has to haul water
about six miles believe me james
florence hallman had better keep away
from murphy i met him as i was com-
ing out from town and he called her a
jezebel

  thats mild andy commented
dryly get down why dont you i


the popular magazine

want you to take a look at the inside of
my shack and see how bad i need a
housekeeper-since you wont take my
word for it i hope every drop of water
leaks outa these bags before you get
home i hope old mister falls down and
spills it ive a good mind not to let
you have any anyway maybe you
could be starved and tortured into com-
ing down here where you belong

  maybe i couldnt ill get me a bar-
rel of my own and hire jimpson to fill
it four times a week if you please
and ill put a lid with a padlock on it
so katie dear cant rob me in the night
-and ill use a whole quart at a time to
wrash dishes and two  quarts when i
take a bath i shall she asserted with
much emphasis live in luxury
james

  andy laughed and waved his hand
toward one man creek thats all
rights-but how would you like to have
that running past your house so you
could wake up in the night and hear it
go gurgle-gurgle wouldnt that be all
right 

  rosemary allen clasped her two
gloved hands together and drew a long
breath i should want to run out and
stop it she declared to think of
water actually running around loose in
this world and think of us up on that
dry prairie paying fifty cents a barrel
for it-and a lot slopped out of the bar-
rel on the road she glanced down
into andys love-lighted eyes and her
own softened she placed her hand on
his shoulder and shook her head at him
with a tender remonstrance

  i know boy-but it isnt in me to
give up anything i set out to do any
more than it is in you you wouldnt
like me half so well if i could just drop
that claim and think no more about it
ive got enough money to commute
when the time comes and ill feel a lot
better if i go through with it now
ive started and-james she
smiled at him wistfully even if it is

only eighty acres jt will make good
pasture and-it will help some wont
it

  after that you could not expect andy
green to do any more badgering or to
say one word to discourage the girl he
did like her better for having grit and a
mental backbone-and he found a way
of telling her so and of making the as-
surance convincing enough

  he filled her canvas water bags and
went with her to carry them and he
cheered her much with his air castles
afterward he took the team and rustled
a water barrel and hauled her a barrel
of water and gave kate price a stony-
eyed stare when she was caught watch-
ing him superciliously and in divers
ways managed to make miss rosemary
allen feel that she was fighting a good
fight and that the odds were all in her
favor and in the favor of the happy
family-and of andy green in par-
ticular she felt that the spite of her
three very near neighbors was really a
matter to laugh over and the spleen of
florence hallman a joke

  but for all that she gave andy green
one last warning when he climbed up to
the spring seat of the wagon and un-
wound the lines from the brake handle
ready to drive back to his own work
she went close to the front wheel so
that eavesdroppers could not hear and
held her front hair from blowing across
her earnest wind-tanned face while
she looked up at him

  now remember boy do go and file
your answers to those contests-all of
you she urged i dont know why
-but ive a feeling that some kind of
a scheme is being hatched to make you
trouble on that one point and if you
see buck tell him ill ride fence with
him to-morrow again if you realized
how much i like that old cow-puncher
youd be horribly jealous james

  im jealous right now without real-
izing a thing except that ive got to go
off and leave you here with a bunch
the last stand



of lemons he retorted-and he spoke
loud enough so that any eavesdroppers
might hear

chapter xxiv

the kid is used as a pawn in the
came

  in the struggle which the happy
family was making to preserve the
shrunken range of the flying u and to
hold back the sweeping tide of immigra
tion one might logically look for some
big overwhelming element to turn the
tide one way or the other with the
homeseekers syndicate backing the
natural animosity of the settlers who
had filed upon semiarid land because the
happy family had taken all of the tract
that was tillable a big open clash might
be considered inevitable

  and yet the struggle was resolving
itself into the question of whether the
contest filings should be approved by the
land office or the filings of the happy
family be allowed to stand as having
been made in good faith

  florence hallman therefore having
taken upon herself the leadership in the
contest fight must do one of two things
if she would have victory to salve the
hurt to her self-esteem and to vindicate
the firms policy in the eyes of the set-
tlers she must produce evidence of a
collusion of the flying u outfit with
the happy family in the taking of the
claims or she must connive to pre-
vent the filing of answers to the con-
test notices within the time limit fixed
by law so that the cases would go by
default that of course was the sim-
plest method-since she had not been
able to gather any evidence that would
stand in court

  there was another element in the
land struggle-the soil and climate that
would fight inexorably against the set-
tlers  but of them we have little to do
since the -happy family had nothing to

do with -them save in a purely negative
way

  a four-wire fence and a systematic
patrol along the line was having itsef-
fect upon the stock question if the
settlers drove their cattle south until
they passed the farthest corner of fly-
ing u fence they came plump against
bert rogers barbed boundary line
west of that was his fathers place
which stretched to the railroad right of
way fenced on either side with a stock-
proof barrier and hugging the missouri
all the way to the marias-where were
other settlers if they went north until
they passed the fence of the happy
family there were the meeker holdings
to bar the way to the very foot of old
centennial and as far up its sides as
cattle would go

  the happy family had planned
wisely when they took their claims in a
long chain that stretched across the
bench land north of the flying u flor-
ence grace knew this perfectly-but
what could she prove the happy
family had bought cattle of their own
and were grazing them lawfully upon
their own claims a lawyer had assured
her that there was nothing to be gained
by disputing that point they never
went near j g whitmore nor did they
make use of his wagons his teams or
his tools or his money instead they
hired what they needed openly and
from bert rogers they had bought
their cattle from the flying u and
that was the extent of their business
relations-as appeared on the surface
and since collusion had been the ground
given for the contest filings it will be
easily seen how slight hope florence
grace and her clients must have of win-
ning any contest suit still there was
that alternative-

  the happy family had been so eager
to build that fence and gather their cat-
tle and put them back on the claims and
so anxious lest in their absence the set-
tlers would slip cattle across the dead


the popular magazine

line and into the breaks that they had
postponed their trip to great falls as
long as possible the honorable blake
had tacitly advised them to do so and
the happy family never gave a thought
to their being hindered when they did
get ready to attend to it

  but-a pebble killed goliath

  h j owens whose eyes were the
wrong shade of blue sat upon a rocky
hilltop which overlooked the trail from
flying u coulee and a greater portion
of the shack-dotted beach land as well
and swept the far horizons with his field
glasses just down the eastern slope
where the jutting sandstone ledge cast
a shadow his horse stood tied to a
stunted wild-currant bush he laid the
glasses across his knees while he refilled
his pipe and tilted his hat brim to shield
his pale-blue eyes from the sun that
was sliding past midday

  h j owens looked at his watch nev-
ertheless as though the position of the
sun meant nothing to him he scowled
a little stretched a leg straight out be-
fore him to ease it of cramp and after-
ward moved farther along in the shade
the wind swept past with a t faint
whistle and laid the ripening grasses
flat where it passed a cloud shadow
moved slowly along the slope beneath
him and he watched the darkening of
the earth where it touched and the
sharp contrast of the sun-yellowed sea
of grass all around it h j owens
looked bored and sleepy yet he did
not leave the hilltop-nor did he go to
sleep

  instead he lifted the glasses turned
them toward flying u coulee a half
mile to the south of him and stared
long at the trail after a few minutes
he made a gesture to lower the glasses
and then abruptly raised them again to
his eyes and fixed them steadily upon
one spot where the trail wound up over
the crest of the bluff he looked for a

minute and laid the glasses down upon
a rock

  h j owens fumbled in the pocket
of his coat which he had folded and
laid beside him on the yellow gravel
of the hill he found something he
wanted stood up and witlf his back
against a bowlder he faced to the south-
west whence came the wind he was
careful about the direction he glanced
up at the sun squinting his pale eyes
at the glare he looked at what he held
in his hand

  a glitter of sun on glass showed
briefly h j owens laid his palm over
it waited while he could count ten and
took his palm away replaced it waited
and revealed the glass again with the
sun glare upon it full he held it so
for a fullrninute and slid the glass back
into his pocket

  he glanced down toward flying u
coulee again-toward where the trail
stretched like a brown ribbon through
the grass he seemed to be in some-
thing of a hurry now-if impatient
movement meant anything-yet he did
not leave the place at once he kept
looking off there toward the southwest
-off beyond antelope coulee and the
sparsely dotted shacks of the settlers

  a smudge of smoke rose thinly there
behind a hill unless one had been
watching the place one would scarcely
have noticed it but h j owens saw it
at once and smiled his twisted smile
and went running down the hill to
where his horse was tied he mounted
and rode down to the level skirted the
knoll and came out on the rail down
which he rode at an easy lope until he
met the kid

  the kid was going to see rosemary
allen and take a ride with her but he
pulled up with the air of condescension
which was his usual attitude toward
nesters and in response to the twisted
smile of h j owens he grinned ami-
ably

  want to go on a bear hunt-with me
the last stand



buck began h j owens with just
the right tone of comradeship to win
the undivided attention of the kid

   i was goin to ride fence with miss
allen the kid declined regretfully
there aint any bears not very close
there aint i guess you musta swal-
lered something andy told you he
looked at h j owens tolerantly

  no sir i never talked to andy
about this had he been perfectly
truthful he would have added that he
had not talked with andy about any-
thing whatever but he let it go this
is a bear den i found myself theres
two little baby cubs buck and i was
wondering if you wouldnt like to go
along and get one for a pet you could
learn it to dance and play soldier and
all kinds of stunts

  the kids eyes shone but he was
wary this man was a nester so it
would be just as well to be careful
wherebouts is it he therefore de-
manded in a tone of doubt that would
have done credit to happy jack

  oh down over there in the hills
its a secret though till we get them
out some fellows are after them for
themselves buck they want to-skin
them

  the mean devils condemned the
kid promptly id take a fall outa
them if i ketched em skinning any
baby bear cubs while i was around

  h j owens glanced behind him
with an uneasiness not altogether as-
sumed lets go down into this next
gully to talk it over buck he sug-
gested with an air of secretiveness that
fired the kids imagination they
started out to follow me and i dont
want em to see me talking to you you
know

  the kid went with him unsuspect-
ingly in all the six years of his life no
man had ever offered him injury fear
had not yet become associated with
those who spoke him fair nesters he
did not consider friends because they

were not friends with his bunch per-
sonally he did not know anything about
enemies this man was a nester-but
he called him buck and he talked very
nice and friendly and he said he knew
where there were some little baby bear
cubs the kid had never before real-
ized how much he wanted a bear cub
for a pet so do our wants grow to
meet our opportunities

  h j owens led the way into a shal-
low draw between two low hills glanc-
ing often behind him and around him
until they were shielded by the higher
ground he was careful to keep where
the grass was thickest and would hold
no hoof prints to betray them but the
kid never noticed he was thinking
how nice it would be to have a bear cub
for a pet but it was funny that the
happy family had never found him
one if there were any in the country

  he turned to put the question direct
to h j owens but - that gentlemen
forestalled him

  you wait here a minute buck while
i ride back on this hill a little ways to
see if those fellows are on our trail
he said and rode off before the kid
could ask him the question

  the kid waited obediently he saw
h j owens get off his horse and go
sneaking up to the brow of the hill and
take some field glasses out of his pocket
and look all around over the prairie
with them the sight tingled the kids
blood so that he almost forgot about the
bear cub it was almost exactly like
fighting injuns like uncle gee-gee told
about when he wasnt cross

  in a few minutes owens came back
to the kid and they went on slowly
keeping always in the low grassy places
where there would be no tracks left to
tell of their passing that way behind
them a yellow-brown cloud drifted sul-
lenly with the wind now and then a
black flake settled past them to the
ground a peculiar tangy smell was in
the air-the smell of burning grass


the populjr magazine

  h j owens related a long fullde-
tailed account of how he had been down
in the hills along the river and had
seen the old mother bear digging ants
out of a sand hill for her cubs

  i know-thats jes zactly the way
they do the kid interrupted excitedly
daddy chip seen one doing it on the
musselshell one time he told me bout
it

  h j owens glanced sidelong at the
kids flushed face smiled his twisted
smile and went on with his story he
had not bothered them he said because
he did not have any way of carrying
both cubs and he hated to kill them
he had thought of buck and how he
would like a pet cub so he had followed
the bear to her den and had come awray
to get a sack to carry them in and to
tell buck about it

  the kid never once doubted that it
was so whenever any of the happy
family found anything in the hills that
was nice they always thought of buck
and they always brought it to him
you would be amazed at the number of
rattlesnake rattles and eagle claws and
elk teeth and things like that which the
kid possessed and kept carefully stowed
away in a closet kept sacred to his uses

   course youd member i wanted a
baby bear cub for a pet he assented
gravely and with satisfaction is it a
far ways to that mother bears home

  why h j owens turned from
staring at the rolling smoke cloud and
looked at the kid curiously aint you
big enough to ride far

   course im big enough the
kids pride was touched i can ride
as far as a horse can travel i bet i
can ride farther and fastern you can
you pilgrim he eyed the other dis-
dainfully huh you cant ride
when you trot you go this way the
kid kicked silver into a trot and went
bouncing along with his elbows flap-
ping loosely in imitation of h j
owens ungraceful riding

  i dont want to go a far ways he
explained when the other was again
riding alongside  cause doctor dell
wrould cry if i didnt come back to sup-
per she cried when i was out huntin
the bunch doctor dell gets lonesome
awful easy he looked over his shoul-
der uneasily i guess i better go back
and tell her im goin to git a baby
bear cub for a pet he said and reined
silver around to act upon the impulse

  no-dont do that buck h j
owens pulled his horse in front of sil-
ver it isnt far-just a ittle ways
and it would be fun to surprise them
at the ranch gee when they saw
you ride up with a pet bear cub in your

arms- h j owens shook his head

as though he could not find words to
express the surprise of the kids family

  the kid smiled his little doctor
smile id tell a man he assented
enthusiastically i bet the countess
would holler when she seen it she
scares awful easy shes scared of a
mice even huh

  shell be scared when she sees the
bear cub h j owens declared absent-
mindedly i know you wont be
though if we hurry maybe we can
watch how he digs ants for his supper
thats lots of fun buck

  yes-i member its fun to watch
baby bear cubs dig ants the kid as-
sented earnestly and followed willingly
where h j owens led the way

  that the way was far did not im-
press itself upon the kid beguiled with
wonderful stories of how baby bear
cubs might be taught to do tricks he
listened and believed and invented
some very wonderful tricks that he
meant to teach his baby bear cub not
even when the shadows began to fill the
gullies through which they rode did the
kid awake to the fact that night was
coming close and that they were still
traveling away from home and in a
direction which was strange to him
never in his life had he been tricked by
the last stand



any one with unfriendly intent he did
not guess that he was being tricked
now so he rode happily away into the
wild places in search of a baby bear cub
for a pet

chapter xxv

little black shacks all burned
up

   it is a penitentiary offense for any
one to set fire to prairie grass or tim-
ber  and if you know the havoc which
one blazing match may work upon dry
grassland when the wind is blowing
free you will not wonder at the pen-
alty for lighting that match with delib-
erate intent to set the prairie afire

  within five minutes after h j
owens slipped the bit of mirror back
into his pocket upon flashing a signal
that the kid was riding alone upon the
trail a line of fire several rods long was
creeping up out of a grassy hollow to
the hilltop beyond whence it would go
racing away to the east and the north
growing bigger and harder to fight with
every grass tuft it fed upon

  the happy family was working that
day upon the system of irrigation by
which they meant to reclaim and make
really valuable their desert claims they
happened to be at the time when the
fire was started six or seven miles
away wrangling over the best means of
getting their main ditch around a cer-
tain coulee without building a lot of ex-
pensive flume - a surveyor would have
been a blessing at this point in the un-
dertaking but a surveyor charged good
money for his services and the happy
family were trying to be very econom-
 ical with money with time and effort
j and with words they were not so frugal

the fire had been burning for an
hour and had spread so alarmingly be-
fore the gusty breeze that it threatened
several claim shacks before they noticed
the telltale brownish tint to the sun-
light and smelled other smoke than the

smoke of the word battle then waging
fiercely among them they dropped
stakes flags and ditch level and ran
to where their horses waited sleepily the
pleasure of their masters

  they reached the level of the bench
land to see disaster sweeping down upon
them they did not stop then to won-
der how the fire had started or why it
had gained such headway they raced
their horses after sacks and after the
wagon and team and water barrels with
which to fight the flames for it was
not the claim shacks in its path which
alone were threatened the grass that
was burning meant a great deal to the
stock and therefore to the general wel-
fare of every settler upon that bench
be he native or newcomer

  florence grace hallman had upon
one of her periodical visits among her
clients warned them of the danger of
prairie fires and urged them to plow
and burn guards around all their build-
ings a few of the settlers had done
so and were comparatively safe in the
face of that leaping red line but there
were some who had delayed-and these
must fight now if they would escape

  the happy family to a man had
delayed rather they had not considered
that there was any immediate danger
from fire it was too early in the season
for the grass to be tindery dry as it
would become a month or six weeks
later they were wholly unprepared
for the catastrophe so far as any ex-
pectation of it went but for all that
they knew exactly what to do and how
to go about doing it and they did not
waste a single minute in meeting the
emergency

  while the kid was riding with h j
owens into the hills his friends the
bunch were riding furiously in the
opposite direction and that was ex-
actly what had been planned before-
hand in the minds of those who
planned there was an absolute certainty
that it would be so florence grace
	the cpovulacr magazine

hallman for instance knew just what
would furnish complete occupation for
the minds and the hands of the happy
family and of every other man in that
neighborhood that afternoon perhaps
a claim shack or two would go up in
smoke and some grass would burn but
when one has a stubborn disposition
and is fighting for prestige and re-
venge and the success of ones business
undertakings a shack or two and a few
acres of prairie grass do not count for
very much

  for the rest of that afternoon the
boys of the flying u worked side by
side with hated nesters and told the
inexperienced how best to fight the
flames for the rest of that afternoon
no one remembered the kid or won-
dered why h j owens was not there
in the grimy line of fire fighters who
slapped doggedly at the leaping flames
with sacks kept wet from the barrels of
water hauled here and there as they
were needed no one had time to call
the roll and see who was missing among
the settlers no one dreamed that this
mysterious fire that had crept up out
of a coulee and spread a black smoking
blanket over the hills where it passed
was nothing more nor less than a di-
version while a greater crime was being
committed behind their backs

  in spite of them the fire beaten out
of existence at one point gained unex-
pected fury elsewhere and raced on
in spite of them women and children
were in actual danger of being burned
to death while they rushed weeping
from flimsy shelter to find safety in the
nearest barren coulee the sick lady
whom the little doctor had been
tending was carried out on her bed and
laid upon the blackened prairie raving
in delirium from the fright she had re-
ceived the shack she had lately oc-
cupied smoked while the tarred paper
on the roof crisped and curled and
then the whole structure burst into

flame and sent blazing bits of paper
and boards to spread the fire faster

  fire guards which the inexperienced
settlers thought safe were jumped
without any perceptible check upon the
flames the wind was just right for
the fanning of the fire and it shifted
now and then erratically and sent the
yellow line leaping in new directions
florence grace hallman was in dry
lake that day and she did not hear
until after dark how completely her lit-
tle diversion had been a success how
more than half of her colony had been
left homeless and hungry upon the
charred prairie florence grace hall-
man would not have relished her sup-
per i fear had the news reached her
earlier in the evening

  at antelope coulee the happy fam-
ily and such of the settlers as they could
muster hastily for the fight made a
desperate stand against the common
enemy flying u coulee was safe
thanks to the permanent fire guards
which the old man maintained year
after year as a matter of course but
there were the claims of the happy
family and ah the grassland east of
there which might be saved

  men drove their work horses at a
gallop after plows and when they had
brought them they lashed the horses
into a trot while they plowed crooked
furrows in the sun-baked prairie sod
just over the eastern rim of antelope
coulee the happy family knelt here
and there along the fresh-turned sod
and started a line of fire that must beat
up against the wind until it met the
flames rushing before it backfiring is
always a more or less ticklish proceed-
ing and they would not trust the work
to strangers

  every man of them took a certain
stretch of furrow to watch and ran
backward and forward with blackened
frayed sacks to beat out the wayward
flames that licked treacherously through
the smallest break in the line of fresh
the last stand



soil they knew too well the danger of
those little licking flame tongues not
one was left to live and grow and race
leaping away through the grass

 they worked-heavens how they
worked-and they stopped the fire
there on the rim of antelope coulee
florence grace hallman would have
been sick with fury had she seen that
dogged line of fighters and the ragged
hem of charred black ashes smoking
against the yellow-brown of the grass
which showed how well those men
whom she hated had fought

  so the fire was stopped well outside
the fence which marked the boundary
of the happy familys claims all west
of there and far to the north the hills
and the coulees lay black as far as
one could see-which was to the rim
of the hills which bordered dry lake
valley on the east here and there a
claim shack stood forlorn amicj the
blackness here and there a heap of
embers still smoked and gnt forth an
occasional spitting of spafks when a
gust fanned the heap men women and
children stood about blankly or wan-
dered disconsolately here and there
coughing in the acrid clouds of warm
grass cinders kicked up by their own
lagging feet

 no one missed the kid no one
dreamed that he was lost again chip
was with the happy family and did
not know that the kid had left the
ranch that afternoon the little doc-
tor had taken it for granted that he had
gone with his daddy as he so fre-
quently did and with his daddy and the
whole happy family to look after him
she never once doubted that he was per-
fectly safe even among the fire fighters
she supposed he would be up on the
seat beside patsy probably proudly rid-
ing on the wagon that hauled the water
barrels

  the little doctor had troubles of her
own to occupy her mind she had rid-
den hurriedly up the hill and straight to
ib

the shack of the sick woman when
first she discovered that the prairie was
afire and she had found the sick
woman lying on a makeshift bed on the
smoking black area that was patheti-
cally safe now from fire because there
was nothing more to burn

  little black shacks all burned up
everythings black now black hills
black hollows black future black world
black hearts-everything matches-
everythings black skys black pm
black-youre black-little black shack
wont have to stand all alone any more
-little black shacks just black ashes-
little black shacks all burned up and
then the woman laughed shrilly with
that terrible meaningless laughter of
hysteria

  she was a pretty woman and young
her hair was that bright shade of red
that goes with a skin like thin rose-
tinted ivory her eyes were big and so
dark a blue that they sometimes looked
black and her mouth was sweet and had
a tired droop to match the mute pathos
of her eyes her husband was a coarse
lout of a man who seldom spoke to her
even when they were together the lit-
tle doctor had felt that all the tragedy
of womanhood and poverty and loneli-
ness was synthesized in this woman with
the unusual hair and skin and eyes and
expression she had been coming every
day to see her the woman was rather
seriously ill and needed better care
than she could get out there on the bald
prairie even with the little doctor to
watch over her if she died her face
would haunt the little doctor always
even if she did not die she would re-
main a vivid memory just now even
the little doctors mother instinct was
submerged under her professional in-
stincts and her woman sympathy she
did not stop to wonder whether she was
perfectly sure that the kid wras with
chip she took it for granted and dis-
missed the kid from her mind and
worked to save the woman


the cpcpulcr magazine

  yes the little diversion of a prairie
fire that would call all hands to the
westward so that the kid might be lured
away in another direction without the
mishap of being seen proved a startling
success as a diversion it could
scarcely be improved upon--unless
florence grace hallman had ordered a
wholesale massacre or something like
that

chapter xxvi

miss rosemary allen does a small
sum in addition

  miss rosemary allen having wielded
a wet gunny sack until her eyes were
red and smarting and her lungs choked
with cinders and her arms so tired she
could scarcely lift them was permitted
by fate to be almost the first person
who discovered that her quarter of the
four-room shack built upon the four
contiguous corners of four claims was
afire in the middle of its roof miss
rosemary allen stood still and watched
it burn and was a trifle surprised be-
cause she felt so little regret

  other shacks had caught fire and
burned hotly and she had wept with
sympathy for the owners but she did
not weep when her own shack began to
crackle and show yellow licking tongues
of flame those three old cats-i am
using her own term which was spiteful
-would probably give up now and go
back where they belonged she hoped
so and for herself-

  by gracious im glad to see that one
go anyhow andy green paused long
enough in his headlong gallop to shout
to her i was going to sneak up and
touch it off myself if it wouldnt start
any other way now you and mell get
down to cases girl and have a settle-
ment and say he had started on
but he pulled up again the little
doctors back here somewhere you
go home with her when she goes and
stay till i come and get you

  i like your nerve rosemary re-
torted ambiguously

  sure-folks generally do ill tell
her to stop for you you know shell be
glad enough to have you-and so will
the kid

 where is buck rosemary was
the first person who asked that oft-
repeated question i saw him ride up
on the bench just before the fire started
i was watching for him through the
glasses-

  dunno-havent seen him with his
mother i guess andy rode on to find
patsy and send him back down the line
with the water wagon he did not think
anything more about the kid though he
thought a good deal about miss allen

  now that her shack was burned she
would be easier to persuade into giving
up that practically worthless eighty
that was what filled the mind of andy
green to the exclusion of everything
else except the fire he was in a hurry
to deliver his message to patsy so that
he could hunt up the little doctor and
bespeak her hospitality for the girl he
meant to marry just as soon as he could
persuade her to stand with him before
a preacher

  he found the little doctor still fight-
ing a dogged battle with death for the
life of the woman who laughed wildly
because her home was a heap of smok-
ing embers the little doctor told
him to send rosemary allen on down
to the ranch or take her himself and to
tell the countess to send up her biggest
medicine case immediately she could
not leave she said for some time yet
she might have to stay all night-or she
would if there was any place to stay
she was half decided she said to have
some one take the woman in to dry
lake right away and up to the hospital
in great falls she supposed she would
have to go along would andy tell j

g	to send up some money clothes
didnt matter-she would go the way
she was there were plenty of clothes
the last stan
          



in the stores she declared and would
andy rustle a team right away so they
could start if they went at all they
ought to catch the evening train the
little doctor was making her decisions
and her plans while she talked as is the
way with those strong natures who can
act promptly and surely in the face of
an emergency

  by the time she had thought of hav-
ing a team come right away she had
decided that she would not wait for hen
medicine case or for money she could
get all the money she needed in dry
lake and she had her little emergency
case with her since she was going to
take the woman to a hospital she said
there was no great need of more than
she had with her she was a thoughtful
little doctor at the last minute she
detained andy long enough to urge him
to make miss allen feel perfectly free
to help herself to clothes or anything
she needed and to send a good-by mes-
sage to chip-in case he did not show
up before she left-and a kiss to her
man-child

  andy was lucky he met a man driv-
ing a good team and spring wagon with
a barrel of water in the back he
promptly -dismounted and helped the
man unload the water barrel where it
was and sent him bumping swiftly over
the burned sod to where the little doc-
tor waited so fate was kinder to the
little doctor than were those who
would wring anew the mother heart
of her that their own petty schemes
might succeed she went away with the
sick woman laughing crazily because all
the little black shacks were burned and
now everything was black so every-
thing matched nicely-nicely thank
you she was terribly worried over the
womans condition and she gave her-
self wholly to her professional zeal and
never dreamed that her man-child was
at that moment riding deeper and
deeper into the bad lands with a tricky

devil of a man looking for a baby bear
cub for a pet

  neither did chip dream it nor any of
the happy family nor even miss rose-
mary allen until they rode down into
flying u coulee at supper time and
were met squarely by the fact that the
kid was not there the old man threw
the bomb that exploded tragedy in the
midst of the little group he heard that
dell had gone to take a sick woman to
the hospital in great falls and would
not be back for a day or so probably

  whatd she do with the kid  he de-
manded take him with her

  chip stared blankly at him and
turned his eyes finally to andys face
andy had not mentioned the kid to
him

  he wasnt with her andy replied 
to the look she sent him a kiss and
word that he was to take care of miss
allen he must be somewhere around
here	

  well he aint t was looking fer him
myself put in the countess sharply
somebody shut the cat up in the flour
chest and i didnt study much on who
it was done it if id a got my hands
on im-

  i saw him ride up on the hill trail
just before the fire started volunteered
rosemary allen i had my opera
glasses and was looking for him be-
cause i like to meet him and hear him
talk he said yesterday that he was
coming to see me to-day and he rode
up on the hill in sight of my claim i
saw him she stopped and looked from
one to the other with her eyebrows
pinched together and her lips pursed

  listen she went on hastily may-
be it has nothing to do with buck-but
i saw something else that was very puz-
zling i was going to investigate but
the fire broke out immediately and put
everything else out of my mind a man
was up on that sharp-pointed knoll off
east of the trail where it leaves this
coulee and he had field glasses and was


the popular magazine

looking for something over this way i
thought he was watching the trail i
just caught him with the glasses by ac-
cident as i swung them over the edge
of the bench land to get the trail fo-
cused he was watching something-
because i kept turning the glasses on
him to see what he was doing

  then buck came into sight and i
started to ride out and meet him i
hate to leave the little mite riding alone
anywhere-im always afraid some-
thing may happen but before i got my
horse i took another look at this man on
the hill he had a mirror or something
bright in his hands i saw it flash just
exactly as though he was signaling to
some one-over that way she pointed
to the west he kept looking that way
and then back this way and he covered
up the piece of mirror with his hand and
then took it off and let it shine a minute
and put it in his pocket i knozu he was
making signals

  i got my horse and started to meet
little buck he was coming along the
trail and rode into a hollow out of sight
i kept looking and looking toward dry
lake-because the man looked that way
i guess and in a few minutes i saw
the smoke of the fire-

  who was that man andy took a
step toward her his eyes hard and
bright in their inflamed lids

 the man that mr owens who
jumped your south eighty

 good lord what fools he
brushed past her without a look or an-
other word so intent was he upon this
fresh disaster im going after the
boys chip you better come along
and see if you can pick up the kids trail
where he left the road its too bad
florence grace hallman aint a man
id know better what to do if she was

  oh do you think- miss rose-
mary looked at him wide-eyed

  dog-gone it if shes tried any of her
schemes with fire and-why dog-gone
it being a woman aint going to help her

none the old man also seemed to
grasp the meaning of it almost as
quickly as had andy chip you have
ole hitch up the team im going to
town myself by thunder and see if
shes going to play any of her tricks on
this outfit and git away with it burned
out half her dog-goned colony tryin to
git a whack at you boys wheres my
shoes  dog-gone it what yuh all stand-
in around with your jaws hangin down
for well see about this fire settin
and this- wheres them shoes

  the countess found his shoes and his
hat and his second-best coat and his
driving gloves which he had not worn
for more months than any one cared
to reckon miss rosemary allen did
what she could to help and wondered
at the dominant note struck by this bald
old man from the moment when he
rose stiffly from his big chair and took
the initiative so long left to others

  while the team was made ready the
old man limped here and there collect-
ing things he did not need and trying
to remember what he must have and
keeping the countess moving at a flur-
ried trot chip and andy were not yet
up the bluff when the old man climbed
painfully into the covered buggy took
the lines and the whip and cut a circle
with the wheels on the hard-packed
earth as clean and as small as chip him-
self could have done and went whirling
through the big gate and across the
creek and up the long slope beyond he
shouted to the boys and they rode
slowly until he overtook them-though
their nerves were all on edge and haste
seemed to them the most important
thing in the world but habit is strong
-it was their old man who called to
them to wait

  you boys want to git out after that
owens he shouted when he passed
them if theyve got the kid killings
too good for em the brown team
went trotting up the grade with backs
straightened to the pull of the lurching
the last stand



buggy and nostrils flaring wide with ex-
citement- the old man leaned side-
wise and called back to the two loping
after him in the obscuring dust cloud
he left behind

  ill have that woman arrested on
suspicion uh setting prairie fires he
called ill git blake after her you
git that owens if you have to haze him
to hell and back yuh dont want to
worry about the kid chip-they aint
goin to hurt him all they want is to
keep you boys huntin high and low
and combin the breaks to find im i
see their scheme all right

chapter xxvii 

the kid looks after himself and
helps the happy family

  the kid wriggled uncomfortably in
the saddle and glanced at the narrow-
browed face of h j owens who was
looking this way and that at the en-
folding hills and scowling abstractedly
the kid was only six but he was fairly
good at reading moods and glances
having lived all his life among grown-
ups

  its a pretty far ways to them baby
bear cubs he remarked plaintively i
bet youre lost old-timer its awful
easy to get lost i bet you dont know
where that mother bear lives

  shut up snarled h j owens
the kid had hit uncomfortably clofee to
the truth

  shut up your own self you darn
ole pilgrim the kid flung back in-
stantly that was the way he learned
to say rude things they were said to
him and he remembered and gave them
back in full measure

  say ill slap you if you call me that
again h j owtens because he did
not relish the task he had undertaken
and because he had lost his bearings
here in the confusion of hills and hol-
lows and deep gullies was in a very bad
humor

  you darn ole pilgrim you dassent
slap me if you do the bunchll fix you
all right i guess theyd just about kill
you daddy chip would just knock the
stufljn outa you he considered some-
thing very briefly- and then tilted his
small chin so that he looked more than
ever like the little doctor i bet you
was just a-lying all the time he ac-
cused i bet there aint any baby bear
cubs

  h j owens laughed disagreeably
but he sdid not say whether or not the
kid was right in his conjecture the
kid pinched his lips together and
winked very fast for a minute never
never in all the six years of his life had
any one played him so shabby a trick
he knew what the laugh-meant it
meant that this man had lied to him and
led him away down here in the hills
where he had promised his doctor dell
cross his heart that he would never go
again he eyed the man resentfully

  what made you lie about them baby
bear cubs he demanded i didnt
want to come such a far ways

  you keep quiet ive heard about
enough from you young man a little
more of that and youll get something
you aint looking for

  im a-going home the kid pulled 
silver half around in the grassy gulch
they were following and im going
to tell the bunch what you said i bet
the bunchll make you hard to ketch
you-you son a gun

  here you come back here h j
owens reached over and caught silvers
bridle rein you dont go home till i
let you go see youre going right
along with me if anybody should ask
you and you aint going to talk like
that either now mind he turned
his pale-blue eyes threateningly upon
the kid not another word out of you
if you dont want a good thrashing you
come along and behave yourself or ill
cut your ears off
vthe kids eyes blazed with anger


the popular magazine

he did not flinch while he glared back
at the man and he did not seem to care
just at that moment whether he lost his
ears or kept them you let go my
horse he gritted you wait the
bunchll fix you and fix you right you
wait

  h j owens hesitated tempted to lay
violent hands lipon the small rebel but
he did not he led silver a rod or two
but he found it awkward because the
way was rough and he was not much
of a horseman and in a few minutes let
the rein drop from his fingers

  you come on buck and be a good
boy-and maybe well find them cubs
yet he conciliated youd die
a-laughing at the way they set up and
scratch their ears when a big black ant
bites em buck ill show you in a
little while and theres a funny camp
down here too where we can get some
supper

  the kid made no reply but he rode
along docilely beside h j owens and
listened to the new story he told of the
bears that is he appeared to be listen-
ing  in reality he was struggling to
solve the biggest problem he had ever
known-the problem of facing danger
and of treachery and beating both
poor little tad he did not even know
the names of his troubles he only
knewthat this man had told him a lie
about those baby bear cubs and had
brought him away down here where he
had been lost and that it was getting
dark and he wanted to go home and
the man was mean and would not let
him go he did not understand why
the man should be so mean-but the
man was mean to him and he did not
intend to stand for it he wanted to
go home and when the kid really
wanted to do a certain thing he nearly
always did it

  h	j owens would not let him go
home therefore the kid meant to go
anyway only he would have to sneak
off or run off or something and hide

where the man could not find him and
then go home to his doctor dell and
daddy chip and tell them how mean
this pilgrim had been to him and he
would tell the bunch the bunch would
fix him all right the thought cheered
the kid so that he smiled and made the
man think he was listening to his darned
old bear story that was just a big lie
think he would listen to any story that
pilgrim could tell  huh

  the gulches were growing dusky
now the kid was tired and he was
hungry and could hardly keep from cry-
ing he was so miserable but he was
the son of his father-he was chips
kid it would take a great deal more
misery and unkindness to make him
cry in the presence of this pilgrim who
had been so mean to him he rode
along without saying a word h j
owens did not say anything either he
kept scanning each jagged peak and
each gloomy canon they passed and he
seemed uneasy about something the
kid knew what was the matter all
right-h j owens was lost

  they came to a wide flat-bottomed
coulee with high ragged bluffs shutting
it in upon every side the kid dimly
remembered that coulee because that
was where andy got down to tighten
the cinch on miss allens horse and
looked up at her the way daddy chip
looked at doctor dell sometimes and
made a kissy look with his lips-and
got called down for it too the kid
remembered

  he looked at the man shut his mouth
tight and wheeled silver suddenly to
the left he leaned forward as he had
always seen the happy family do when
they started a race and struck silver
smartly down the rump with the braided
romal on his bridle reins h j owens
was taken off his guard and did nothing
but stare open-mouthed until the kid
was well under way then he shouted
and galloped after him up the little flat

  he might as well have saved his
the last stand



horses wind and his own energy he
was no match for little buck bennett
who had the whole flying u outfit to
teach him how to ride and the spirit of
his daddy chip and the little doctor
combined to give him grit and initiative

h	j owens pounded along to the head
of the coulee where he had seen the kid
galloping dimly in the dusk he turned
into the canon that sloped invitingly up
from the level and went on at the top
speed of his horse-which was not fast
enough to boast about

  when he had left the coulee well be-
hind him the kid rode out from behind
a clump of bushes that was a mere
black shadow against the coulee wall
and turned back whence he had come
he giggled a little over the way he had
fooled the pilgrim and wished that the
bunch had been there to see him do it
he kept silver galloping until he had
reached the other end of the level and
then he pulled him down to a walk
and let the reins drop loosely upon sil-
vers neck that was what daddy chip
and the boys had told him he must do
next time he got lost and did not know
the way home he must just let silver
go wherever he wanted to go and not
try to guide him at all silver would go
straight home he had the word of the
whole bunch for that and he believed
it implicitly

  silver looked around inquiringly at
his small rider hesitated and then
swung back up the coulee the kid
was afraid that h j owens would
come back and see him and cut off his
ears if he went that way-but he did
not pull silver back and make him go
some other way for all that if he left
him alone silver would take him right
straight home daddy chip and the
boys said so and he would tell them
how mean that man was they would
fix him all right

  halfway up the coulee silver turned
into a narrow gulch that seemed to lead
nowhere at all except into the side of a

big black-shadowed bluff up on the
hillside a coyote began to yap with a
shrill staccato of sounds that trailed off
into a disconsolate whimper the kid
looked that way interestedly he was
not afraid of coyotes they would not
hurt any one they were more scared
than you were-the bunch had told him
so he wished he could get a sight of
him though he liked to see their ears
stick up and their noses stick out in a
sharp point and see them drop their
tails and go sliding away out of sight
when he was ten and daddy chip
gave him a gun he would shoot coyotes
and skin them his own self

  the coyote yapped shrilly again and
the kid wondered what his doctor dell
would say when he got home he was
terribly hungry and he was tired and
wanted to go to bed he wished the
bunch would happen along and fix that
man his heart swelled in his chest
wifh rage and disappointment when he
thought of those baby bear cubs that
were not anywhere at all-because the
man was just lying all the time in spite
of himself the kid cried whimperingly
to himself while he rode slowly up the
gorge which silver had chosen to fol-
low because the reins were drooping
low alongside his neck and he might go
where he pleased

  by and by the moon rose and light-
ened the hills so that they glowed softly
and the kid looking sleepily around
him saw a coyote slinking along a bar-
ren slope he was going to shout at it
and see it run but he thought of the
man who was looking for him and
glanced fearfully over his shoulder
the moon shone full in his face and
showed the tear streaks and the tired
droop to his lips

  the kid thought he must be going
wrong because at the ranch the moon
came up in another place altogether he
knew about the moon doctor dell had
explained to him how it just kept going
round and round ther world and you


the pocpullr magazine

saw it when it came up over the edge
that was how santa claus found out if
kids were good he lived in the moon
and it went round and round so he
could look down and see if you were
bad the kid rubbed the tears off his
cheeks with his palm so that santa
claus could not see that he had been
crying after that he rode bravely
with a consciously straight spine be-
cause santa claus was looking at him
all the time

  after a long while the way grew less
rough and silver trotted down the
easier slopes the kid was pretty tired
now he held on by the horn of his
saddle so silver would not jolt him so
much he was terribly hungry too
and his eyes kept going shut but santa
claus kept looking at him to see if he
were a dead-game sport so he did not
cry any more he wished he had some
grub in a sack but he thought he must
be nearly home now he had come a
terribly far ways since he ran away
from that pilgrim who was going to cut
off his ears

  the kid was so sleepy and so tired
that he almost fell out of the saddle once
when silver who had been loping easily
across a fairly level stretch of ground
slowed abruptly to negotiate a washout
crossing he had been thinking about
those baby bear cubs digging ants and
eating them he had almost seen them
doing it but he remembered now that
he was going home to tell the bunch
how the man had lied to him and tried
to make him stay down here just to be
mean the bunch would sure fix him
when they heard about it

  he was still thinking vengefully of
the punishment which the happy fam-
ily would surely mete out to h j
owens when silver lifted his head
looked off to the right and gave a shrill
whinny somebody shouted and im-
mediately a couple of horsemen emerged
from the shadow of a hill and galloped
toward him

  the kid gave a cry and then laughed
it was his daddy chip and somebody
he thought the other was andy green
he was too tired to kick silver in the
ribs and race toward them he waited
until they came up their horses pound-
ing over the uneven sod urged by the
jubilance of their riders

  chip rode up and lifted the kid bod-
ily from the saddle and held him so
tight in his arms that the kid kicked
half-heartedly with both feet to free
himself but he had a message for his
daddy chip and as soon as he could
get his breath he delivered it

  daddy chip i just want you to kill
that darn pilgrim  he commanded
there wasnt any baby bear cubs at
all he was just a-stringin me and
he was going to cut off my ears he
said it wasnt a far ways to where the
baby bear cubs lived with the old
mother bear and it was t wish youd
lick the stuffin outa him im awful
hungry daddy chip

  well be home pretty quick chip
said in a queer choked voice who
was the man buck  where is he
now

  the kid lifted his head sleepily from
his daddy chips shoulder and pointed
vaguely toward the moon hes the
man that jumped andys ranch right on
the edge of one man he explained
hes back there ridin the rim rocks
a-lookin for me id a come home be-
fore only he wouldnt let me come he
said hed cut my ears off i runned
away from him daddy chip and i
cussed him a-plenty for lying to me-
but you neednt tell doctor dell

  i wont buck chip lifted him
into a more comfortable position and
held him so while the kid slept he
talked with andy about getting the
happy family on the trail of h j
owens then he rode thankfully home
with the kid in his arms and silver fol-
lowing docilely after
the last stand



chapter xxviii

as it turned out

  they found h j owens the next
forenoon wandering hopelessly lost in
the hills since killing him was barred
they tied his arms behind him and
turned him toward the flying u he
was sullen like an animal that is
trapped and will do nothing but lie flat-
tened to the ground and glare red-eyed
at its captors for that matter the
happy family themselves were pretty
sullen they had fought fire for hours
-and that is killing work and they had
been in the saddle ever since looking
for the kid and for this man who rode
bound in their midst

  weary and irish and pink who had
run across him in a narrow canon fired
pistol-shot signals to bring the others to
the spot but when the others emerged
from various points upon the scene
there was little said

  in town the old man had been quite
as eager to come close to florence
grace hallman-but he was not so
lucky florence grace had heard the
news of the fire a good half hour before
the train left for great falls she
would have preferred a train going the
other way but she decided not to wait
she watched the sick woman put aboard
the one pullman coach and then she
herself went into the stuffy day coach
florence grace hallman was not in the
habit of rjding in day coaches in the
nighttime when there was a pullman
sleeper attached to the train she did
not stop at great falls she went on to
butte-from there i do not know where
she went certainly she never came
back

  that of course simplified matters
considerably for florence grace-and
for the happy family as well for at
the preliminary hearing of h j owens
for the high crime of kidnaping that
gentleman proceeded to unburden his
soul in a way that would have horrified

florence grace had she been there
to hear

 a man of whom you have never
heard tried to slip out of the courtroom
during the unburdening process and
was stopped by andy green who had
been keeping an eye on him for the sim-
ple reason that the fellow had been
much in the company of h j owens
during the week preceding the fire and
the luring away of the kid the sheriff
led him off somewhere-and so they
had the man who had set the prairie
afire

  as is the habit of those who gonfess
easily the crimes of others h j owens
professed himself as innocent as he
consistently could in the face of the
happy family and of the kids loud-
whispered remarks when he saw him
there he knew absolutely nothing
about the fire he said and had nothing
to do with the setting of it he was
two miles away at the time it started
and so--

  and then miss rosemary allen took
the witness stand and told about the
man on the hilltop and the bit of mirror
that had flashed sun signals toward the
west h j owens crimpled down vis-
ibly in his chair-and you know about
how easily he could hope to clear him-
self after that if you are anxious to
hear the result at the trial they gave
him ten years in deer lodge for what
he had done and the judge informed
him that he had been dealt with
leniently the other-the man whom
andy stopped at the door of the court-
room-got six years and cursed the
judge and threatened the whole flying 
u outfit when he heard the sentence

  while they were about it the happy
family went on to great falls the next
day with witnesses and the honorable
blake to see that everything was
straight and filed their answers to the
contest claims-three days before the
time limit had expired you might call
that shaving down the margin of safety


the popular magazine

too closely but they were very well sat-
isfied they did not worry much over
the outcome why should they since the
homeseekers syndicate as represented
by the absent florence grace hallman
had overreached and played the game
directly into the hands of the happy
family

  some of you will complain because
everything has not been told but if
every little thing were told in this story
there could be no more meetings be-
tween you and the happy family i
am not even going to take you to the

preacher with andy green and miss
rosemary allen take a look at them
trailing contentedly down from the
courthouse with their hats tilted at cer-
tain characteristic angles and their
voices mingled in more or less amiable
converse and their toes pointed toward
the mint there is no need for any one
to worry over that bunch you may
safely take it for granted that they
would meet future emergencies and
problems as they have always met them
in the past-standing up to trouble un-
flinchingly and standing together al-
ways

         for illuminating glimpses of the lighter side of western life we

war and the job seekers

hphomas j pence secretary of the democratic national committee and
one of the big political chiefs of this administration is pursued so constantly
by job seekers and other annoying brands of alleged politicians that he has a
secret telephone number and stays away from his office as much as possible he
had dodged one of these pests successfully for several months but finally got to
the point where he wrote the man to come from new york to washington to see
him and state his business

    the visitor fat genial and much dressed up appeared in pences office at
the appointed hour nursed a silk hat affectionately and indulged in small talk
well said pence feigning great cordiality what can i do for you

    just a trifle said the pest and added in an entertaining and confidential
way i was thinking as i came over on the train of the different tactics of the
various armies in the european war i admire the french greatly their swift-
ness their dash their irresistible fury in a charge-

    at this pence blew up just one minute he said in a loud voice that
war is a very sad thing and the saddest personal feature about it is that i cant
get on a street car or enter a public building in this town or stop on the street
corner without having somebody talk to me about war i know nothing on earth
about the details of that war i dont believe anybody in the united states does
i know very well you dont i make it a rule not to let anybody talk it to mej
and here you come all the way from new york to tell me about it have you
no mercy have you no heart now do you want to talk to me about french
infantry english cavalry german siege guns and cossack ponies-or do you
want to talk about that job you want

    the man did not get the job
the hidden clew

by george woodruff johnston

the strange case of an unhappy girl killed without intent by a person she
had never seen and for something she had never done a brief account
of a mystery that was cleared up so far as a few people were concerned
but the real facts of the case have never been made public till now

this is bessington said a stormy
voice over the telephone for
gods sake get around to the
tilloughby as quick as you can
will you  its about a girl named dud-
low

  but old man my office is full of
patients i remonstrated

  hang the patients  roared bessing-
ton and i could hear the phone rattle
as his agitated hand jammed the re-
ceiver on the hook

  i could not refuse an appeal so ur-
gent from the best of friends and
within ten minutes i had leaped out of
my machine and grabbed the janitor
of the tilloughby just as he was rac-
ing up the front steps of that seedy
apartment house at the heels of a po-
liceman an excited crowd filled the
pavement and threw out a wide-flung
fringe into the street

  say man i cried whats the
matter are all you people crazy
tell me does a girl-a miss dudlow
-live here

  he shot a glance over his shoulder
and spied my bag come along he
gasped and was off again up the stairs

  we tore through a lot of aproned
and wrappered dishevelment on the
first landing but on the second there
was no one except the janitors wife
looking as white and weepy as a candle
end i did my best but the two men
ahead beat me through the hallway of
the back flat and as i entered the room

at the end of it i found them bending
over as if about to lift a girl lying on
the floor

  hold on i called lets see
whats wrong first

  the girl lay crumpled up on her left
side but as i knelt by her she gave a
sigh like a tired child dropping off to
sleep and rolled over on her back
for an instant there was absolute still-
ness then with a shuddering breath
her body relaxed and stretched out flat
i felt her wrist-no pulse her heart
-no beat she was dead and over
her left temple was an ugly bruise and
a smear of dried blood i glanced hur-
riedly about the room a chair had
been upset a vase overturned and
water spilled and the bureau cover
trailed on the carpet amid a litter of
brushes combs and womens things
there had been a struggle-that was
evident

  officer said i youd better notify
headquarters its all over and if im
not mistaken its murder

  the janitor collapsed and sat down
with a thump on the floor the pale
sunshine of a winters morning filtered
feebly through the green window
shades while two electric bulbs glared
yellow overhead and in this sickly
light the mans face looked almost as
ghastly as the girls but she despite
all that death had done to tarnish and
distort was still a beauty and i could
not but think what a wonder of love-


the cpocpulacr magazine

liness she must have been only yes-
terday-what a radiant type of that
soft blond appealing girlhood which
so often seems foredoomed to tragedy

  the janitor had got himself together
a bit by this time and was shakily lift-
ing the window shades and switching
off the lights while from somewhere
outside the room came a feeble in-
articulate sound like the whimpering of
an animal in pain-the janitors wife
thought i and paid no further atten-
tion to the circumstance

  the girl lay as if asleep i noticed
that she wore a black silk petticoat and
a pale-blue flannel dressing sack fas-
tened at the waist by ribbons there
had been a knot of ribbon at her throat
too but this had been torn apart bring-
ing to view some superficial scratches
across her left shoulder the sack and
petticoat were both neat and clean yet
they were made of cheap stuff-even
a man could see that-and seemed to
fit in with the plain flat and simple
worn furniture but when i looked
at the feet sticking out from under her
petticoat i was astonished the slip-
pers she wore did not accord with the
rest far from it they were small
very high-heeled were delicately made
of pale-blue embroidered satin and
what was more amazing in the center
of the dainty rosette which crowned
each instep was a big turquoise

  instinctively my thoughts coursed
back to bessington where did he
come in here-a middle-aged man with
wife and children and yachts and es-
tablishments all over everywhere  why
had he sent me to the top floor of a
side-street apartment house where a
young girl lay dead with turquoises
in her slippers  i did not like the look
of things and resolved to get out of
this mess as quickly as somebody ar-
rived to take charge of the body and
the fidgety janitor and whoever was
mouthing and whining outside

  as it chanced they all came at once

-the coroner two plain-clothes men
more bluecoats and last of all bes-
sington himself-now outwardly com-
posed fine tall fresh-colored domi-
nant

  hello dick he greeted me then
turning to the rest my name is bes-
sington the janitor telephoned me
that something was wrong here and i
sent my friend doctor dannart on
ahead

  do you own the house asked the
coroner

  oh no but miss dudlow is in my
employ he answered

  was you mean said the younger
of the two detectives

  what demanded bessington strid-
ing up to the group about the dead girl
as he caught sight of her he went
pale the others watched him nar-
rowly he kept pretty cool i must
admit yet i who had been his intimate
for twenty years sensed the tug ind
quiver of strained nerves i knew now
that i had better stay for a while

  dont touch anything boys com-
manded the older detective the pho-
tograph man will be here in a jiffy
anything been meddled with he
asked turning to me

  i was about to answer when the
younger man who had wandered into
the adjoining room came back in a
hurry

  say doc it looks mighty like
theres a job in there for you said
he jerking his thumb toward the door

  this door had been partly open all
the time and suddenly it occurred to
me whence had come the peculiar whim-
pering sounds i had casually ascribed
to the janitors wife out in the hallway

  it was almost pitch dark as i entered
the chamber for its single window gave
on an air shaft and the shade was
down but when the light-was switched
on i flinched i confess it and the
others hung back at the door

  there on the bed half smothered
the hldden clew



in a welter of disheveled bedclothes
lay a woman with her head and face
enmeshed in a hopeless tangle of gray
hair her mouth was drawn to one
side her eyes were starting from their
sockets and from her throat welled an
endless succession of feeble insensate
cries that were positively gruesome
she was weakly thrashing about in the
effort to rise but it was apparent that
she was nearly all in

  gosh exclaimed the younger de-
tective the old dame must have
lamped the whole thing through the
door there say mother put us wise
will you

  i held up my hand she cant talk
man shes a paralytic i whispered
and started him toward the door
finally i got everybody out and then
fixed the old lady up and gave her a
hypodermic to quiet her this done
i went after bessington and found
him pacing the hallway

  look here said i shortly this
is a dickens of a situation i dont
want to pry into your affairs-but who
are these people anyhow

  miss dudlow was my private ste-
nographer bessington replied and
thats her mother in there she had
a stroke some time ago and say
dick ive just got to get out of this
youll stay and see it through wont
you i cant and theres no one else
he stopped and shivered and-
about the poor little girl-look after
her body please-do all you can 

  just then the coroner came out and
bessington managed to pull himself to-
gether

  im off said he i dont fancy
youll want me

  not now remarked the other
youd better give me your address
though

  bessington gazed curiously at the
man and fumbled a little getting out his
cardcase somehow i began to feel
queer and when going down to see

him into his car and to send my own
after a nurse for the old lady i ob-
served a bicycle policeman who had
been upstairs leisurely mount his wheel
and trail after him i realized for the
first time that for my friend matters
were growing serious

  when i got back to the room the
photographer had finished and they
were lifting the body of the girl onto
the bed as they did so something that
had lain hidden under her skirt came
to light it was a paper cutter-a sil-
ver-plated dagger-shaped affair with
its point broken off the blade was
about six inches long and of solid metal
and as i held the fractured end toward
me i observed that the break though
old was sharp and that its cross sec-
tion formed a perfect diamond there
was a film of dried blood extending
for a quarter of an inch or so above
the broken tip but no stains elsewhere
somebody had used this as a weapon
was it the girl or her assailant the
autopsy would determine the last i
knew and then it occurred to me
how easily the murderer could be iden-
tified if there were found upon his
body a punctured wound of diamond
shape or later on a scar in like tell-
tale form

  this didnt hurt anybody much it
didnt go deep enough remarked the
younger detective taking the paper cut-
ter from my hand

  but believe me heres something
that hurt said the other he held
up an old battered brass candlestick
with a blunt-edged square bottom filled
with lead that he had found under the
table a mere tap with it could easily
have smashed in the thin plate of the
temporal bone

  the next discovery knocked the
breath out of everybody in the litter
of combs brushes veils and what not
that had been dragged off with the bu-
reau cover was a big roll of bank bills
held together by a black velvet ribbon


the pocpuljir magazine

the amount completely staggered us-
five thousand dollars there were and
not a penny less

  whew thought i bessington
must pay his stenographers pretty
well so far as i knew he had always
been straight but these fellows had just
been told he was a friend of mine and
i wondered how long before they would
begin to ask awkward questions about
him again i felt that i had better be
going i was afraid of what might
turn up next

  mr coroner said i as soon as 
i have set the nurse to work in the
other room i must get back to my prac-
tice theres evidently nothing more
i can do here

  sure he exclaimed go ahead
scarcely had i reached the door how-
ever when a pale slim dandified young
man brushed past me and came to a
halt in the middle of the room staring
questioningly about him

  what do you want asked the
coroner eying the man indifferently

  i dont want anything-at least-i
came from the office- at this in-
stant his roving eyes encountered the
body of the girl lying on the bed and
he shuddered convulsively and sweat
broke out upon his forehead he fought
desperately for self-control crushing
his hands together and forcing the mus-
cles of his face to be still

  you come from the office what
office who are you anyway de-
manded the coroner

  im a clerk at bessingtons span-
glers my name the janitor there
knows me

  thats straight said the latter
hes often about he came in with
the girl last night

  spangler spun round and looked at
the man in consternation

  last night rapped out the coro-
ner what time last night

  six or half past i suppose it was

spangler faltered i brought miss
dudlow home from the office

  when did you leave her

  at eight

  eight what were you doing all
that time here in her room

  i had a right to be here retorted
spangler angrily we were engaged
to be married her mother knew it
it was no secret

  what do you know about this jan-
itor inquired the coroner you say
you saw them come in together

  well i dont want to queer the
guy but i heard somebody scrapping
in the entrance hall and that fetched
me to the top of the basement stairs
i went down again when i seen it was
him and jessie dudlow they was
always fussing lately

  when did spangler go away

  i dont know thats the last time
i laid eyes on either of em

  scrapping hows that spangler
asked the coroner sharply

  the young man was completely taken
aback scrapping i should not call
it scrapping stammered ie wetting his
lips we had a little disagreement-
that was all there were no hard words
between us

  the janitor sniffed scornfully

  call it by the right name-you quar-
reled you mean declared the coroner
what about out with it

  spanglers gaze wandered helplessly
about the room until it rested on the
bank notes lying on the table first he
regarded them with a puzzled frown
then his face cleared and finally there
settled upon it an expression of malevo-
lent hatred with that he ceased to
tremble peered furtively around and
made a dash for the door but the
officers were too quick for him there
was a scuffle and he was quickly over-
powered and searched

  you wont need this any more
said the older detective as he drew from
the prisoners pocket a new revolver
the hidden clew



whose cylinder showed a complete ring
of bright brass shells

ii

  i left the flat and the remainder of
the day spent itself in the hurry and
worry of a busy doctors life during
the following afternoon bessington tel-
ephoned urging me to dine with him
at eight

  besides himselfj there were at table
his wife his two young daughters and
his attorney our mutual friend john
limpet a big lumbering man with a
fat frozen face

  the affair proved to be even more
trying than i had anticipated of
course every one was aware that my
hosts relations with jessie dudlow
were under investigation and worse
that he was suspected by many of hav-
ing killed her this made mrs bes-
singtons position well-nigh intolerable
she was a dark handsome woman of
tile proud glacial type but-as family
physician and intimate friend i knew
that her pride was more in her husband
and children than in herself and that
she still loved him with all the inten-
sity of a bride and though now as
always she showed all the poise of
the woman of the great world i could
conceive-as she sat there trying to
talk but eating nothing-how woundedj
how grieved how cruelly mortified she
must be to have his name dragged
through the gutters of the city and i
pitied her

  it was an immense relief to every
one when dinner was over and we men
with mrs bessingtons permission ad-
journed to the library

  now limpet said bessington as
lie closed the door lets hear all you
have found out about the case

  well began the lawyer with a
wave of his puffy white hand the evi-
dence so far is small in amount and
wholly circumstantial of course what

miss dudlows mother may have seen
is a matter of conjecture what may
we expect from her dick he asked
turning to me

  nothing i replied save ofa neg-
ative character her mind is sound
and she can see and hear-her condi-
tion yesterday morning led to the in-
ference that she had witnessed the
tragedy in the next room but she is
a paralytic she cannot speak intelli-
gibly she cannot write in fact she
has no way of communicating informa-
tion to others it is barely possible
that later on she may be able to write
with her left or unparalyzed hand
may even regain the power of speech
but i doubt it she is too old and
the shock wras too severe in my judg-
ment she will remain as she is or grow
progressively worse

  humph grunted the lawyer
that complicates matters but let us
proceed as far as we can first then
ticking off the facts upon his fingers
we know how jessie dudlow met her
death the coroner tells me that a blow
on the head inflicted with a candlestick
found in the room broke and drove
in part of the temporal bone that
killed her there were no other in-
juries except a few scratches on the
shoulder

 how about the suspects-any
wounds on them i inquired thinking
of the paper cutter

  none declared limpet save for
a ragged cut on the janitors right hand
as to when the fatal blow was struck
he went on that might have happened
at any time between half past six when
she was last seen alive and nine oclock
the ensuing morning when the jani-
tors wife went up as usual to wait
upon the mother and found the daugh-
ter dying on the floor the struggle
was unheard because the flat beneath
is untenanted but the burning lights
drawn curtains the girls manner of
dress her bed unslept in-all point to
	the popular magazine

some hour before half past ten which
was her customary bedtime

  thats all very well exclaimed bes-
sington irritably but the one vital
question is who did the deed

  i wish i could tell you said lim-
pet but one circumstance is note-
worthy the tilloughby contains few
apartments and is without office ele-
vator or bell boys so that a stranger
might very well have entered and left
the house without being observed but
jessie must herself have admitted to
her own flat the person who killed her
and it is a reasonable assumption that
she would not have let in-particularly
at night-any one unknown to her or
who bore a threatening aspect it is
natural therefore that suspicion should
first fall upon one or more of her famil-
iars of these the janitor is easiest
disposed of he is scared has a fresh
cut on his hand could have found ex-
cuse to enter the dudlow apartment at
any time and lastly is openly accused
of the crime by his wife but she is
notorious as a rattle-brained loose-
tongued termagant jealous of every
woman in the tilloughby

  now spangler is in worse case the
victim was lastseen alive in his com-
pany he can bring no proof as to
where he was between half past six
when he arrived at the apartment house
and eleven oclock when he turned up
at his boarding place moreover he
had a strong motive

  what was it i inquired
  jealousy

  of whom bessington blurted out
there was a pause finally limpet
spoke deprecatingly if you must
have it bessington-of you

 of me why of me demanded
the latter roughly

  he says the girl was always shut
up with you in your private office
bessington laughed sneeringly
where would ne expect me to keep
my stenographer -on the roof

  limpet was nettled and his manner
changed his pale round face re-
mained as expressionless as ever but
he fixed his little eyes piercingly on
bessington and his voice grew hard

  spangler says also that he saw you
with the girl one niglit a little while
ago you were together in a large
limousine and she was superbly dressed
in clothes you paid for is that true
she was with me in my car bes-
sington responded reluctantly span-
gler may have seen us

  but was that the only time you were
together in public 

  no bessington answered with still
greater hesitation

  and in regard to the other matter
-did you not give her money 

  there was no reply to this and lim-
pet proceeded immediately

  your alibi too how about that
where were you night before last
bessington was plainly in difficulties
let me see he said slowly my
wife had gone to the opera my daugh-
ters somewhere else i sat here in the
library alone and was in bed before
they returned no i dont believe any-
body saw me until i went upstairs
that must have been about eleven

  in short you have no alibi inter-
rupted limpet

  but the motive i exclaimed
what possible motive could be attri-
buted to bessington for-

  a dozen protested limpet jeal-
ousy of spangler or another a rebuff
from the girl dread of ultimate ex-
posure and consequent trouble at home
or of a public scandal i tell you
bessington the lawyer continued more
kindly but still earnestly you are in
a comer if you were a clerk or a
janitor you would be locked up now
as spangler and the other man are as
it is a plain-clothes man was watching
this house when i came in you have
got to do a lot of explaining and you
cannot begin too soon
the hidden clew



  bessington remained for a time in
deep thought then to our astonish-
ment he rang a bell and said to the
man who answered it ask your mis-
tress if she will do me the favor to
come here for a moment

  i was profoundly sorry for mrs bes-
sington she sailed into the room with
the utmost outward serenity but when
she saw us all still there and read the
expression on our faces she faltered and
turned white jim she breathed
what is it

  paula he said gently i have a
very painful statement to make in
the end you are bound to hear the facts
from somebody it is best perhaps
that you should learn them now at first-
hand from me and with these two old
and tried friends beside you bes-
sington was finding his task trouble-
some there was a long pause between
each of his sentences and a yet longer
one ensued before he began again

  that i should have killed jessie
dudlow is of course preposterous
but that i-that i grew to love her and
took her about with me foolishly reck-
lessly-is the truth

  mrs bessington sank into a chair
and bowed her head her husband con-
tinued with still greater effort

  limpet has just told of a night
when we were seen together the cir-
cumstances were these i found her
standing in front of a theater waiting
for some one who had failed her and
i took her to her home in my car
she was always superbly beautiful that
night as limpet says she was also
superbly dressed i had never seen her
like that before i was astounded i
asked her where she had got the means
to pay for all the wonderful things she
wore i myself had given her money
fatuously generously but if all my
gifts had been added together they
would never have bought her trium-
phant jewels and that one splendid cos-
tume she told me she owed all this
b

and more to a man who had asked her
to marry him

  i shall hide nothing i shall deny
nothing bessington continued shame-
facedly i was furious at first-crazy
with jealousy i begged her to tell me
the mans name she refused-i did
not know why till later on at the
time i persisted i fumed i made my-
self utterly ridiculous but succeeded
only in frightening her and then it
slowly dawned upon me that i was
absolutely incapable of making her care
for me as i wanted to be cared for
impulsive -she might be and vain and
full of fun and of the love of adventure
but she was sweet and clean

  finally i came to my senses and re-
alized what an absurd figure i cut
and the only consolation i had was
that this poor little stenographer
prinked out in all her finery was too
kind and generous to laugh at me my
unhealthy infatuation had received its
deathblow and that ride-from the
theater to her home-which limpet has
spoken of as an incident of our rela-
tions was in reality the end of them

  i wondered if bessington was lying
if so it was magnificently done i
turned to observe the effect upon his
wife but at that moment she spoke
from behind the fan which she had
raised to screen her face

  jim said she her voice low and
unsteady when was the end

  more than two weeks ago but
he went on rapidly there is more to
tell later jessie dudlow came to me
in great distress of mind she feared
that the money which had been show-
ered upon her had been obtained dis-
honestly and in consequence purposed
breaking off her engagement on the
very morning of the day she was struck
down she pleaded with me to forgive
her for the part she had innocently
played in a great wrong that had been
done me she told me it was spangler
she had promised to marry and that as


the pocpular magazine

she had lately suspected but had only
then learned with certitude the money
which he had given her in such pro-
fusion was not an inheritance as he
had pretended but had been stolen
from me it was spangler she cried
in terror and despair and if i do
not keep his secret and run off with
him he swears he will kill me he
did it bessington concluded he
murdered her but he was too late-
his secret was out

  but why did you not speak of this
before asked limpet testily was
it quite fair to keep me your legal ad-
viser in the dark

  cant you see man exclaimed bes-
sington it was because the story not
only involved me but through me my
wife and daughters and i hoped that
the culprit might be found and justice
done without knowledge of my past
relations with jessie dudlow becoming
public but now silence is no longer
possible from what you say span-
gler has turned on me to save himself
he killed the poor girl-killed her in
cold blood-and i will send him to the
chair for it

  bessington ceased and profound still-
ness fell upon the room then he
walked to where his wife was sitting
in the shadows

  just a moment interposed lim-
pet one thing puzzles me when
jessie dudlow told you all this why
did she not return to you the five thou-
sand dollars found in her room she
must have known that this sum had
been stolen from you like the rest

  this question was never answered
for as bessington approached his wife
she sprang from her chair and without
a word rushed from the room

                    iii 

  had spangler killed the girl i won-
dered and had the fatal instinct of the
murderer dragged him back next morn-
ing to the scene of his crime or igno-

rant of her death had he then come
to slay her whom some one else had
already slain but bessingtons story
of the homicide however plausible it
might seem was-as limpet pointed
out during our walk homeward to-
gether-merely an accusation founded
upon theory and was far from con-
stituting proof of guilt as a matter
of fact though time passed and in-
quiry never slept no such proof either
against spangler or another was forth-
coming-no finger prints upon the can-
dlestick no betrayal in the contents of
the shabby room no secret divulged
by the bare hall and stairways of the
tilloughby no revealing word loosed by
any tongue no lifting of the veil at
any corner spangler was an embez-
zler-so much had been established but
nothing more therefore in spite of
my misgivings it became imperative to
examine mrs dudlow upon whose tes-
timony if such could be elicited the
whole case seemed to hang

  to me the problem was a new one
i had never encountered either in my
own experience or in the annals of
legal medicine a case in which it was
sought to obtain evidence that would
have legal value from a person in mrs
dudlows condition-one who could
neither speak nor write having no
precedent to guide me i proceeded as
follows - we met in her room the
nurse and i whom she had grown to
know and trust with the coroner as the
only stranger present limpet and the
district attorney remained in the ad-
joining chamber where they could see
without being seen

  mrs dudlow i began gently and
reassuringly i am going to ask you
a few questions if your answer is
yes raise your left hand a little way
above the bed if no let your hand
lie still do you understand me

  tremblingly she lifted her hand

  now then did you see or hear
what went on in the other room one
the hidden clew



night about ten days ago you know
the night i mean

  the patient as i feared would be
the case became violently agitated
again those awful guttural cries again
those convulsive efforts to hoist herself
in bed

  try to compose yourself i said
we are your- friends you can tell
us all that is necessary by answering
my questions in the way i have indi-
cated let us begin again did you
see or hear what occurred in the next
room on the night i speak of

  she lifted her shaking hand but still
frantically tried to talk

  i began afresh i am going tq bring
before you three persons one after the
other if any one of them was in the
adjoining room that night point him
out

  mrs dudlow looked fiercely toward
the door as at a sign from me the
janitor entered walked past her bed
and then out of the room again her
hand remained motionless

  was it this one i inquired as bes-
sington succeeded the janitor my
tongue could scarcely utter the ques-
tion despite my friends specious
story doubts tortured me but in an
instant it was over to my intense
relief the hand as before lay quiet

  how about this man i asked as
spangler entered

  the hand raised itself quickly and
then as suddenly fell the coroner
breathed a sigh of relief but i was
not satisfied the gesture had not been
as pronounced and convincing as the
others

  tell me i asked did you see jes-
sie after spangler left her and was
she well

  there followed a moment of tense
uncertainty all eyes were fixed upon
the pallid hand trembling on the bed-
clothes spangler was as pale as death
he clutched the end of the bed with a
despairing grip and when the woman

after what seemed an eternity slowly
elevated her hand and held it upright
the sudden relief was too much for
him and he fell senseless to the floor

  the coroner and i looked at each
other we were nonplused it was
none of these who then had killed
jessie dudlow

  you are sure-perfectly positive
about these men the coroner in-
quired again the poor creature vainly
tried to speak and her eyes roamed
about the room distractedly but she
lifted her hand

  mrs dudlow i pursued anxiously
for she seemed on the border of col-
lapse and total incoherencey mrs
dudlow there are only two more ques-
tions  try your best to reply to them
did you ever before see the individual
who was in the room that night

  she made no motion it was the
negative answer

  only one more i begged urgently
her eyes were closing and she was slip-
ping from me you say you saw that
person would you know him again
could you identify him 

  and then a curious thing happened
instead of replying in the prescribed
fashion she raised her hand with great
effort to her brow and drew it down-
ward over her face

  what do you make of that asked
the coroner taking me aside could
she by any chance mean a mask

  i had no opportunity to reply as at
that moment the janitors wife entered
the room bearing a tray and mrs dud-
low pointing directly at her with her
last remaining strength chattered and
screamed until my blood ran cold we
were dumfounded here then was
the answer to the riddle this jealous
quarrelsome slattern whom nobody had
thought of was the murderess

iv

  a disclosure more sudden and more
surprising could not have been imag-


the popular magazine

ined and it naturally formed the sole
topic of discussion as bessington and

i	leaving the tilloughby drove away
together in his car he had asked me
to accompany him to his house for
his wife he told me had been much
upset since his confession in the li-
brary and he was growing anxious
about her

  i found her alone in her room
flushed and restless with headache and
a rapid pounding pulse she began
to talk as i produced my clinical ther-
mometer and rather than interrupt her 
i gently drew back her nightdress to
place the instrument under her arm
to my surprise she resisted but in
an instant the thing was clear and
starting to my feet the thermometer
fell with a smash to the floor to my
unspeakable horror i saw at the for-
ward edge of the armpit flaming red
against the whiteness of the surround-
ing skin an angry unhealed wound
there was no possibility of a mistake
-it was diamond-shaped the exact
image of the cross section of the paper
cutter

  when i looked up i found mrs bes-
sington gazing at me with terrified eyes

i could not meet their agonized appeal
for once in my life i was utterly un-
manned

  you have seen you know she
whispered her voice choking with fear
and then she cried hopelessly oh
what am i to do what am i to do

i did not mean to hurt her i thought
she was stealing my husband from me
and i left the opera early and went
to her that night to beg her to give
him back i even offered her money
that she might go away and leave him
to me she was young i was getting
old i had loved him so many years
and he was the father of my children
she swore that there was nothing to
give back-that there had been noth-
ing wrong oh if i had only believed
her but i did not in my folly and

desperation i called her a bad name
and she grew furious and threw the roll
of money in my face

  and then-how did it happen we
struggled and in her extremity she
struck at me with something that hurt
me here i do not know what it was
nor do i know what i flung at her
i thought only to save my life and es-
cape and when she fell i turned and
ran-into the scorching hell i have lived
in every moment since oh that the
poor girl were alive again and i dead
in her place

  she clutched my hand and fondled
it she rose in bed and knelt to me
richard for the love of god tell no
one what youve seen the wound-
it burns like fire its killing me cut
it out and with it my side my heart
-everything but save my husband and
children from disgrace and ruin i
who have knelt to no human being kneel
to you i beg you i beseech you to
hear me and believe me

  she broke down completely and hid
her tortured face in her pillow my
heart beat as though it would burst
from my body while thoughts raced
furiously through my mind so it was
not the janitors wife but merely a
woman the poor paralytic had meant-
a woman unknown before veiled prob-
ably and unrecognizable but now
what should i do i was face to face
with a frightful responsibility

  there was that unhappy girl killed
without intent by a person she had
never seen and for something she had
never done i could not bring her
young life back it lay within my
power to avenge her death but would
justice be really served if in doing this
i brought to shame the innocent daugh-
ters of this forlorn mother herself al-
most as guiltless as they it was one
of those problems in which there is no
sense and for which there is no fair
and adequate solution i hesitated and
v the hidden clew



at this crucial moment the door opened
and bessington entered the room

  the janitors wife has been freed
he exclaimed she easily proved an
alibi limpet has just telephoned me
and then noticing his wifes distracted
and tear-stained face dick whats
the matter he implored

  my resolution was taken nothing
said i quietly and reassuringly do
not worry it is nothing that i cannot
readily set right all that paula needs
is you-and rest-and silence

  and then as he knelt beside her bed
anc she flung her arms about his neck
and kissed him tenderly forgivingly i
changed my place and stood so that she
alone could see and laid my finger on
my lips in sign that they were sealed

  was i right or wrong in what i did
who can tell but when i see as a
result of my silence a reunited and lov-
ing family when i visit the old para-
lytic bedded in comfort and tenderly
cared for when i hear that spangler

who came in the morning as he con-
fessed to kill her whom death had
already trapped-that he given another
chance at the intercession of mrs bes-
sington is proving worthy of her trust
and when especially i think of that un-
fortunate wife and mother of her
nights of vain regret and burning mar-
tyrdom of her days of unremitting toil
and of the bodily strength the loving
kindness and the millions of money
that she pours out like water in behalf
of young girls everywhere so that no
cry for help however feeble or remote
remains unanswered-when i think of
all these things then i believe i was
right and feel that jessie dudlow vain
futile little beauty pure nevertheless
and sweet who pleaded with him who
would have dishonored her to be for-
given for ignorantly using that which
had come to her dishonestly now that
she knows all things has herself for-
given the woman who in the urgency
of her own defense unwittingly took
her life

he knew where he aimed

prank p morse the theatrical man and william d campbell a business
man of washington went to benedict maryland last november to do a lot
of hunting before setting out they secured several extra guns loaded themselves
down with ammunition and looking very wise talked a great deal about the
pleasures of hunting when the hunters were dead-sure shots

    during the first morning of their sport morse who had trained for the trip
by smoking about sixty cigarettes a day and losing too much sleep was aroused
from his ambulant lethargy by the whir of wings in front of him true to his
nimrodlike instincts and anxious to get the first bird he managed to get his
forefinger into contact with the trigger of his gun thereby discharging a shell

    while he was still flinching nervously from the report of the gun campbell
came bounding wildly through the bushes he was greatly agitated 

    what the thunder are you trying to do he shouted some of that shot
went through my hat are you trying to kill me

    morse utterly unconcerned reached for a cigarette and replied in a bored
manner

    certainly not i never hit anything i shoot at
propinquity

by f a churchill jr

   that two men who are fond of each other may develop a mans size feud
for no other reason than propinquity is the theme of this story of a couple
of miners who had read all the magazines in camp from cover to cover and
found they had nothing else to do but to hate and to think of hate

smitty and steve were going to
work for the sunset copper min-
ing company incorporated at its
properties in the cascade moun-
tains having recently issued a pros-
pectus with cuts of the properties the
inevitable history of calumet  hecla
and of course the shakespeare bit
about a tide in the affairs of men
which et cetera sunsets officers
found it advisable to have at least two
miners actually at work these would
show up well in photographs for fu-
ture prospectuses and would also come
in handy to display before doubting in-
vestors

  and so steve and smitty who had
met the day before in a seattle em-
ployment bureau cultivated each other
beside a pack train which wound
through the mountains toward the mine

  it developed that both had worked
at calumet also in alaska which coin-
cidence established a footing  smitty
was spare and grizzled and towered
over rotund steve whose face was a
beardy cherubs

  reaching the sunset diggings atop
a divide near a glacier the men wasted
no time appreciating the panorama that
composed their front and back yards
with its three mineral lakes of red blue
and green its encompassing peaks and

the cascade that hung like a great white
portiere at the end of a distant gorge
instead they attended to the horses
carried supplies into stable and cabin
and inspected the tunnel and the
dump

  the living quarters proved excellent
the mine itself sketchy there were
but a few tons of ore on the dump
and in this already sprouted oats
dropped long ago well get busy to-
morrow and they returned to the cabin
for supper

  after the meal smitty had a little
trouble convincing steve that the dishes
ought to be done up promptly the
latter was all for making this a weekly
function pointing out that there was
plenty of dishes

  their talk was of mines they had
known men they had worked with
fought with hearts they had broken
a further bond of acquaintance was re-
vealed in a young lady named ger-
trude whom it appeared they had both
known in her capacity of hasher in
a seattle restaurant they commented
pleasantly on the beauty and amiability
of gertrude

  next morning the friends set to work
in the tunnel taking turns at drill and
sledge a portable forge was fitted up
dynamite was opened by and by muf-
propinquity



fled explosions in the sunset mine broke
the long silence of those mountains
rocketing from peak to peak disturb-
ing the colored glass of the lakes be-
low raw ore began to augment the
crumbling dump

  and so their work went on day by
day

  steve and smitty settled down to
comfortable routine with -alternate
turns at cooking and dishwashing
sundays when the laundry work was
done and a row of blue flannel shirts
and red underwear flapped behind the
cabin they shouldered gun and rod and
descended into the valley returning at
nightfall with trout from the river
grouse or quail from the forest there
were several old magazines in camp
and as neither was a rapid reader the
literary supply promised to hold out for
some time the men were fairly con-
tented though neither had ever worked
in such a small mine nor in such lim-
ited company before

  one evening smitty entered the cabin
and struck up steves hand as the latter
poured tobasco sauce into the soup he
was cooking go easy on that sauce
warned smitty you put too much
of it in everything you must have
learned cooking in mexico

  steve was hurt he had never found
fault with the others culinary methods
and this was the first time smitty had
reflected on his sit down im at-
tending to this job

  well kindly remember im no urn-
brey smitty meant hombre ge-
neric for mexican

  steve did not reply completing his
cooking in aggrieved silence what
ailed smitty had he a grouch if
so did he think to take it out on him
steve  better not try during the
meal he forbore to speak

  smitty missed his friends usual pro-
fane cheer and rightly attributed it to
his own ill-advised asperity humanly
enough he too became affronted and

was very formal in requesting steve to
kindly slip me that there dragons
blood or please to shoot the axle
grease steve obliged wordless and
glum

  the tension got on smittys nerves
the only sound was of steve drinking
coffee steve liked his coffee very hot
and he sipped it with noisy intakes of
breath smitty began to resent this
he felt out of sorts anyway so after
fidgeting a while he said

  steve cant you make less music
with your meals 

  the other man looked up in incredu-
lous amazement his knife halfway to
his mouth smitty actually criticizing
his table manners he replied when
he recovered with bright vivid profan-
ity not cheerful now but vicious
steve knew this because the epithets
were not directed at himself he
scorned a reply and devoted the rest
of his meal to an experiment in dis-
covering just how fastidious he could
be with his own eating and drinking
he kept his elbows in while sawing at
the horse and consumed his coffee
silently with curled finger wiping his
beard quite dry afterward

  steve realized the personal applica-
tion of his partners conduct and re-
newed his affronts to smittys new-
found sensitiveness he succeeded in
eating disgustingly drinking abysmally
smitty at length rose and stood looking
down upon him hog ugh-makes
me sick whispered smitty and strode
outside

  they spent a bad evening neither
deigning to speak next day smitty ac-
cidentally missed the drill his mate held
and grazed steves hand with the sledge
this had happened before with both
and the injured had blithely cursed the
other mans incompetency now steve
merely looked up at smitty with ugly
narrowed eyes it was worse than any-
thing he could have said

  constantly they meditated upon their


the popular magazine

difference planned cutting remarks and
forced these back into their hearts to
fester with the dearth of conversa-
tion they speedily read all the maga-
zines from cover to cover which left
them nothing to do of nights but to hate
and think of hate

  days passed and the misunderstand-
ing threatened a feud both forgot
how it started but that made no differ-
ence now each had discovered in the
other traits that sickened his very soul
steve was a coarse glutton who made
bestial noises in eating and was lazy
and selfish smitty was a miserable
hypocritical would-be aristocrat and
thought himself better than honest men

  one night when smitty contemptu-
ously pushed away his portion of the
wild-huckleberry pie steve had made
and the latter promptly ate it blood-
shed nearly ensued

  the superintendent arrived one after-
noon just in time to hear the first vio-
lent outbreak being a wise man in his
generation he granted the men a weeks
vacation and they set off in rival state
with two hundred dollars and a mans
size feud between them

  now the superintendent had rightly
figured on their getting profoundly
magnificently drunk in seattle but he
hd expected that they would do this
apart he reasoned that they would
return when the money was spent quite
as brothers the tension of monotony
relieved unluckily smitty and steve
soon after their arrival in seattle found
themselves in the same bar and before
they could separate were far too in-
toxicated to move next morning they
awoke in a back room with fearful
headaches no money-and the feud
when they returned the following day
matters were worse than ever

  it was for want of something else
to do that steve and smitty went fish-
ing next sunday luck was poor until
they reached the falls an abrupt de-
clivity of perhaps ten yards where the

 river thundered into a big deep pool
 steve approached the pool but finding
 smitty there first withdrew proudly and
 wandered on above

   a few minutes later smitty fancy-
 ing he heard a cry above the endless
 tumult looked up just in time to see
 a pair of boots appear on the brink
 right where the green water turns white
 in its first tremendous leap the sense-
 less form of steve shot out into air
 and disappeared with a puny plop in
 the whirlpool

   smittys eyes sharpened by desirous
 contemplation of the big cutthroats and
 salmon steering slowly round and round
 beneath the boiling surface percieived
 the outlines of a limp mass far down
 quickly casting off coat and boots he
 leaped feet first and caught steves
 body ten feet below then he fought
 the battle of his life a hundred wicked
 currents sought to drag him farther
 down to crack his skull against the
 rocky walls to draw him under the
 v stunning battery of the falls using
 every ounce of his strength he swam
 and struggled downstream out of the
 death-cold eddies still holding steves
 leg until they lay together in the shal-
 lows after a while he dragged steve
 out on shore

   the latter bled freely from a deep
 cut above the eye he had evidently
 slipped and been stunned on a rock just
 above the falls reviving presently he
 suffered smitty to bandage his head
 and the two went home in dour shiv-
 ering silence

   smitty rejoiced inwardly now he
 had saved steves life and hopelessly
 indebted him steve realizing this too
 was furious he owed his life to the
 man he hated all he could do was
 to keep up his end of the feud which
 he did ably awaiting a chance to turn
 the tables

   the next few weeks were a night-
 mare winter was coming on and the
 first snows had already fallen fish-
qxrqtpinquity



 ing at an end they had nothing but
 bird shot wherewith to kill the fresh
 venison that grew bold and numerous
 once smitty saw a cinnamon bear in-
 vestigating the garbage heap and went
 after him with the shotgun winning a
 furious reproof from steve for his
 vain efforts steve chose to feel that
 smitty had wasted those two shells on
 purpose to aggravate him he did not
 desist from grumbling when the super-
 intendent sent up a rifle and more am-
 munition

  one bleak clear night-it had snowed
all day and the moon revealed a host
of forested mountainsides white with
their burden sparkled coldly on the
distant cascade and the jeweled serpent
river far below-smitty presiding as
cook placed a dish of beans on the
table as piece de resistance steve eyed
it he was not overfond of beans and
he knew that smitty relished them
they had had beans every night of
smittys present tenure as cook the
tinned meats he himself loved lying
unopened on the shelves men have
died for less steve reflected after
looking at the beans viciously he picked
up the platter and smelled them in a
derogatory manner smitty saw him
do it men have died for less than
that too the chef moved toward
steve-but refrained he could not
foil his bread knifewith such blood

  it was well for steve that he sniffed
those beans he watched smitty sail-
ing into them with a cheerful silent
smile and a few hours later smitty
became terribly ill

  ironic in his solicitude steve looked
after his companion and did for him
all that could be done but smitty grew
worse his agony was hideous
writhing on his bunk the pains grew
on him so that he fell with a heavy
thud on the floor and steve had much
ado to lift him back at last between
spasms the sufferer beckoned to steve

who sat by the stove smoking with short
frequent puffs

  steve-im gonna die

  ferget it replied steve noncom-
mittally

  gonna die oh-h-h you can have
my watch an clothes-an whats cornin
to me theres no one-else oh-h-h
-to give it to-ye swine 

  well heres luck to you wherever
you land on tother side of jordan
chuckled steve rising and fastening
his mackinaw and taking from the wall
a fur and snowshoes

  where-you goin  leave me die
alone jes like you oh-h-h-ye yel-
low pack rat

  steve came to the bunk placed his
own blanket over smittys feet bathed
the cold sweating brow and sawr to
the supply of stimulant im goin for
a doctor ye peel heel bald-headed con-
ceited cockatoo

  the more-fool you youll die in
the snow sure-before you make sky-
komish oh-h-h

  smitty recovered from his latest ac-
cess wiped the blinding icy sweat out
of his eyes-but steve was gone

  hey-y-y steve come back-ye
darned fool

  steve was gone

  six hours later it had come on to
snow again smitty green and shaky
but unmistakably better dragged him-
self from the bunk managed to stuff
the stove with bark and kindled it
with infinite effort pausing sometimes
to sink over the table he mixed strong
coffee and set it to boil the room be-
came an oven torture to the still nause-
ated man but he kept up the fire and
crept to the door where he lay cooled
by the draft underneath

  he had almost dozed off in his weak-
ness when the door crashed open in
his face amid a whirl of wind and
snow a strange conglomerate mass
tumbled in


the popular magazine

  smitty picked himself up the heap
fell against the table it was two men
steve and the skykomish doctor

  both were so utterly exhausted that
minutes passed before they moved
when steve finally beheld smitty mov-
ing feebly about the cabin preparing
coffee he rose trembling no longer
with cold but with fury ye black
hypocrite you played sick a-purpose
to fool me he seized the shotgun

  smitty grasped a knife and would
have thrown himself under the muzzle
had not the doctor interfered

  youre crazy steve  said the medi-
ator cant you see the man can
scarcely walk

  a truce was patched up somehow

  the mining settlement known ats sky-
komish boasts but two first-class bars
when in town for a sociable time
smitty spent his money in one steve
in the other they returned to the
mine one night carrying revolvers slung
about their hips on cartridge belts and
made a business henceforth of turning
when addressed with one hand on the
weapon

  smitty brought home another pur-
chase it was a box of ladies pink
stationery with pen ink and stamps
when he first revealed it with elabo-
rate carelessness steve forgot his dig-
nity and craned over to see it the fry-
ing pan in his hand pouring a splutter-
ing stream over the stove

  but smitty paid no heed he placed
a sheet of the gaudy paper before him
inked the pen and set to work often
pausing to renew a tooth grip on his
tongue and revolve the pen above a
word the letter was finished and ad-
dressed in a couple of hours and smitty
left it lying on the table steve glanced
at the superscription

     miss gertrude bilker

knipes cafe seattle

  reappearing the other made a great
show of snatching the letter away and

cramming it inhis pocket he watched
steve the rest of the evening and cer-
tain signs he noted seemed to please
him more potent than ptomaines the
poison that is green began to ferment
in steves blood

  but not until after a second visit to
skykomish did the latter feel all the
pangs smitty intended for him seated
by the stove smitty produced a blue
envelope unfolded a letter and read
it he smiled self-consciously lastly
feigning embarrassment he replaced the
letter-and glared round on steve

  but the other man though racked
with jealousy was equal to the occa-
sion he unwrapped a parcel contain-
ing white stationery and taking it to
a corner busied himself with an epistle
which consumed three hours he left
it in view and went out and smitty
saw that it likewise was addressed to
miss gertrude bilker of knipes cafe

  when next they visited skykomish a
letter awaited neither doubtless miss
gertrude feared she was being trifled
with at any rate her silence failed
to improve the situation at the sunset

  the snows began to melt in early
spring and freshets long pent in the
mountains swelled the river in the val-
ley to a force which the men heard
plainly booming along carrying rocks
and trees in its wild course

  one glorious march morning smitty
and steve in ugly mood went out to
saw wood for the stove it was a task
they hated this wood getting it chained
them together with the rhythmic unison
of the two-handed tool snoring through
the dead cedar they beheld neither
the freshness of clean-washed heaven
above them nor the grandeur of the
tremendous mountains about them

  working a while on the first cut in
silence broken only by the saws ring-
ing groan-quit loafin on me swine
snapped smitty

  steves answer may not be set down

  smitty chose  to be affronted
propinquity



  take that back quick or youll
eat it

  steves hand sought the gun at his
hip and smitty sprang for a tree
scarcely had he reached it before
whack a bullet crashed into the
bark

  steve was behind a tree now too
and for an hour they crouched there
each taking his chances for a quick shot
the bullets screamed off into the woods
their passage marked by a chain of fall-
ing leaves and pine needles or smashed
into the bark neither was hit-yet
but they grew bolder and bolder with
the passage of time

  steve glanced once at the saw lying
aslant across the log at an angle to
both aiming carefully he fired min-
gled with the report of his gun was a
sound like a gong as the bullet re-
bounded from the saw and hissed past
smitty the latter caught the idea and
soon both found it expedient to move
part way around their trees until the
probability of some ones being hit be-
came strong suddenly smitty thought
he heard voices in the trail below he
looked down

  the superintendent was coming up
the trail with several others among
whom were women on pack horses he
hesitated a second-

  ay-y-y steve the bosss cornin
with a bunch of women we gotta
quit this first tossing his gun before
him he stepped out into the open
steve appeared too and they regarded
each other foolishly

  smitty ran to the cabin returned with
an empty tin and shot a couple of holes
through it when the superintendent
came up to them he found the two
miners apparently keen in amicable
rivalry of marksmanship

  pretty poor shooting he com-
mented only two bulls-eyes for all
the shots wre heard he regarded
them sharply

  ive a bit of bad news for you boys

he went on funds are running low
so well have to shut down for a few
weeks but i want your addresses sos
i can let you know when we start again
like to keep you with us

  one month later having issued a
prospectus more gorgeous than any that
had gone before illustrated with divers
views of smitty and steve working
in the tunnel saddling pack horses at
meals in other innocent pursuits and
having thereby sold several hundred
more shares of sunset stock the super-
intendent sought a seattle tavern be-
loved of mining men

  smitty and steve were inside sure
enough a foot of each caressed the
brass railing and they clasped one an-
others shoulders with mutual affection
and need of support a group of bar-
room loafers hung about

  them wras the happy days ay
steve 

  youve said it ye bald-headed old
coot them sure was 

  him and me we worked together
eight months in the sunset mine we
did smitty explained impressively to
the loungers

  better pal i never had set em
up you 

  steve ay steve dont you wish
them days was back

  betcha happy days heres happy
days everybody

  the superintendent stepped up
howdy boys want to go back to the
sunset to-night

  smitty looked at steve sobered by
the press of destiny steve looked at
smitty and the warmth died out of the
eyes of both the stillness was only
broken by the clattering of emptied
glasses on the bar

  uneasily they regarded the superin-
tendent

   nope replied smitty at last

  steve shook his head embarrassed
an economy campaign

by h l rennick

   efficiency and economy can be combined but when you try to combine
them by the aid of a professional economy expert there is apt to be trouble
here is a story of an economy doctor whose coming was synonomous with
the coming of trouble on the central division of the l b  j

a railroad president said
geraghty superintendent of
the central division of the l

         b  j is a jinx sent by the
fat men of wall street to keep us poor
devils from growing as fat as they are
youre right frank agreed mor-
gan the trainmaster just listen to
this 

                new york june th
the board of directors of the l b  j
this afternoon elected robert m lawson
former general manager of the m  r
president of the l b  j to succeed john
r taylor resigned it was reported that
bondholders of the l b  j had urged a
change because of a delay in interest pay-
ments lawson gained a reputation for effi-
ciency on the m  r as general manager
and changed the road from a losing propo-
sition to a good investment

  let me see that paper morgan
geraghty said when the trainmaster had
finished reading the news dispatch is
there a picture of lawson in it

  sure said morgan theres a pic-
ture and it looks just like it

  like what 

  an efficiency sharp

  good night yelled geraghty

  you neednt worry frank youve
got your place cinched said morgan

 every man on the road from
geraghty down to the kid timekeepers
for the construction gangs knew before

the day was over that the l b  j
had a new president

  before a month was over the l b
 j knew its board of directors had
picked the most economical economy
sharp they could buy it was re-
trenchment here cut down operating
expenses there and even the orders
which once came out on bond paper
were now mimeographed on cheap
flimsy

  then came the big event of the new
administration the president having
settled to his satisfaction all minor de-
tails which could be transacted in a
twenty-story office building decided he
would make his first tour of inspection

  jefferson of the eastern division
got him first what lawson did to jef-
ferson was plenty he swung the ax
right and left lopping off clerks cut-
ting down requisitions forsupplies and
crippling the division shop force beyond
repair finally jefferson lost his own
scalp and another expert with instruc-
tions to see how much he could save
was made the old man of the east-
ern division

  before he lost his head jefferson
passed the word on to macandrew of
the fosston branch and this canny
scotchman preserved his own scalp by
cutting down expenses on the day be-
an economy campaign



fore the president reached his division
headquarters macandrew did a bit of
ax swinging himself and when he re-
ceived lawson there was not a super-
fluous man in sight

 mr macandrew lawson said
im glad to find that your division in
the main seems to be handled both
economically and efficiently you may
hear from me further

  all the time macandrew was sweat-
ing for fear that a smash-up would crip-
ple him from fairbury where his divi-
sion joined the main clear into division
headquarters and back again

 macandrew passed the word to
geraghty he wrote

  frank man this lawson party is too
stingy to throw a tie spike at a bull that
would be chasing him hed want to save
the spike get ready for him fire every
man youve got if necessary but show him
economy and hes yours

  geraghty was to get him next clin-
ton his division point was one hundred
and forty miles from fairbury where
his jurisdiction began on the east
geraghty pondered all night and kept
morgan with him until midnight before
he found the idea that pleased him

  jim he finally said well show
him

  and show him they did there were
some protests speedily checked by
geraghty but the orders went out and
were given in a manner that left no
room for doubting that the superin-
tendent meant just what he said or-
der no  troubled every man on the
division until a few of them realized
what it meant then all who under-
stood chuckled and the word was
passed that geraghty had something up
his sleeve for the new boss no 
went thusly

  effective to-day the central division of
the l b  j will have in mind above every-
thing else the gomfort of the general public
who are its patrons with this idea in view
regular trains will be given precedence over
all specials no special is to be moved over

this division without the special approval
of the superintendent whenever possible
a special will be combined with a regular
train going in the same general direction
this combination will be effected always at
the earliest possible moment

  when lawsons special reached fair-
bury it was midnight a layover of an
hour was scheduled in the yards the
engine crew from macandrews divi-
sion reported in and went to bed the
hours passed and still the two coaches
which made up the presidents special
remained in the yards at seven oclock
when lawson awoke he glanced out of
a window

  must be in clinton already he said
to the negro porter

  no sah wes still in fairbury

  wheres jefferson lawson de-
manded

  right here sir said the secretary

  find out whats the matter

  yes were to go west as part of no
 which will leave fairbury at eight
oclock

  why didnt they route us straight
through 

  superintendents orders

  send this message to superintendent
geraghty

  why was special held up at fairbury an-
swer quick	lawson

  no  had reached lewistown twenty
miles from fairbury before geraghtys
answer was brought to lawson by the
conductor the railroad presidents
brow was knitted as he read this dis-
patch 

  i ordered your special sent on with no
 to save the l b  j  the cost of
operating it as a separate train from fair-
bury to clinton	geraghty

  the train was on time to the minute
when it pulled into the shops at clinton
lawsons two cars were uncoupled and
a few minutes later geraghty stepped
out of his office and up to the observa-
tion platform on the rear coach he
shook hands with lawson


the popular magazine

  well go through the offices first
said lawson

  geraghty piloted him through there
was no unnecessary noise no idle
clerks the trainmaster was preaching
economy in the use of fuel to a fireman
who had just been placed on the extra
board the chief dispatcher explained
that he had reduced thenumber of mes-
sages per day by eighteen per cent and
had been able to save the railroad the
mileage cost of one wire the length of
the entire division the claim depart-
ment which geraghty had tipped off
was in the act of settling a possible ten-
thousand-dollar damage suit for thirty-
five dollars and a ten-cent cigar there
was every evidence of economy and ef-
ficiency was apparent

  understand mr lawson ger-
aghty said t am an economist i do
believe however that the theory can
be carried to a point where efficiency
becomes impossible notwithstanding i
will endeavor to carry out your policies
to the letter

  frankly mr geraghty said law-
son i am much pleased with your
spirit

  it had been a more or less trying or-
deal for geraghty while lawson went
through the offices suggesting a reduc-
tion here a retrenchment there and
geraghty was relieved when the next
morning he had lawsons coaches
again coupled to no  and started on-
ward to markhams western division

  two box cars in some mysterious
manner were derailed and swung across
the main track ten miles out of clinton
when lawson protested at the delay in
clearing the tracks geraghty sent him
this

  lawson aboard no  our division has
had so few wrecks that i have let out all but
one wrecking crew and have sent the cranes
to macaiidrews division keeping only one
for the central the one crew is cleaning
up a slight wreck near lewistown cant get
to no s position for three hours by let-

ting out other crews will save company
 a year

  lawson swore but sent no more mes-
sages it was six hours before no 
finally got started west again at seven
oclock the president who had finished
his dinner askei the secretary to join
him while he dictated several letters
he asked the porter to turn on the
lights the electric bulbs did not flash
the secretary called the conductor

   is the lighting system out of order
no sir said the conductor there
can be no lights until sunset

  why its dark now the secretary
protested

  mr geraghtys orders to save ex-
penses were that the engineer should
not start the dynamo until sunset
which in this place comes at seven-
twenty-nine oclock to-day

   i cant see the sense of the order
said lawson

  mr geraghty explained said the
conductor that he realized there was
little expense in the lighting itself but
that he had figured wear and tear on
the dynamo cost of bulbs et cetera cost
the company one dollar and sixty-eight
cents a year for each car and said he
wished to save that sum he told us
it was the little things that counted
nature came to geraghtys aid just
before no  reached the end of his di-
vision it had been raining for two
hours and during the last twenty miles
of the run a gale had been blowing with
the strength of a tornado and was
growing worse every minute archer-
ville operator gave engineer bill adams
a warning to watch out for a washout
at funks bridge eight miles west

  through the blinding rain the train
forced its way the electric headlight
failed to brighten the track for any
great distance ahead its gleam how-
ever was bright enough to give adams
warning in time the bridge was gone
there was no chance for an accident
there so far as no  was now con-
an economy campaign



cerned but it appeared the only alterna-
tive to waiting until the engineers could
build a new bridge was to back into
archerville adams reversed the lever
four miles back a huge tree had been
hurled across the track by the mighty
force of the wind the way was
blocked in front by the collapsed bridge
and by the tree behind the gale had
been at its fiercest after no  had
safely passed the spot where the tree
now blocked it

  fortunately there was a small sta-
tion sharpsdale three miles east of the
bridge the train was sent ahead and
brought to a stop at sharpsdale the
conductor set forth to arouse the sta-
tion agent for it was only a day office a
flag stop after an exasperating delay
the agent was aroused and reached the
depot to wire division headquarters that
the bridge was out no  the night
mail for the east was due at the bridge
within twenty minutes but could be
caught at peru seven miles west of the
bridge the agent thought

  a series of staccato ticks from the in-
strument brought the sharpsdale agent
to his feet he shouted

  shes gone by peru got by just a
second before the operator there heard
the warning ought to be at the bridge
in ten minutes

  president lawson though an econ-
omy sharp had a high regard for hu-
man life and was an executive of no
mean ability  in a second he had or-
dered the engineer to leave all but one
coach at sharpsdale speed on to the
bridge and warn no  before it went
through into the stream no  broke
all records for running through a storm
the three miles to the bridge crept be-
neath the drive wheels in something un-
der four minutes no  had not reached
the bridge when the westbound engine
halted within a hundred feet of the
stream adams roberts his fireman
and lawson ran ahead and hastily
shoved the pegs of two red signal fuses

into the ground on the bank of the
stream which even when swollen by
the flood was only a hundred feet
across the lights were planted and
lighted just as no s headlights was
seen dimly through the rain it was
stopped in time shouting across the
stream adams explained the situation
to no s engineer

  geraghty back in his home at clin-
ton was aroused from sleep by the
ringing of his telephone bell quickly
the dispatcher explained over the
phone the tie-up and the narrow escape
from a disaster in his energy to reach
the scene of action the dispatchers
office geraghty forgot for a minute
that he had undertaken to teach law-
son a lesson in economy a few mo-
ments later however he had recalled
his inspection trip and was determined
to carry out his farce

  dont hurry too much he told rey-
nolds the- night dispatcher weve got
to show lawson that our one wrecking
crew-and he chuckled as he said it-
cannot cover the entire division in a
few minutes

  reynolds turned to an operator who
was calling for him then while ger-
aghty was coolly giving orders to the
shops to get out the wrecker and notify
the engineering department the night
dispatcher interrupted him

  is lawson aboard no 

  hes at the bridge said geraghty
this message for him is important
it just came in over our loop from w
u downtown

  reynolds handed the flimsy to the
superintendent and geraghty whose
heart was as big as his brain was deter-
mined lost all desire to heckle the presi-
dent when he read

  lawson president l b  j en route on
central division your wife is critically ill
asking for you	doctor acton

  geraghty thought of his own wife
  the l b  j that night got the


the popular magazine

most thrilling exhibition of quick action
it had seen since no i with the coast
mail had been wrecked on the night it
was racing for a government contract

  seventy-nine minutes from the time
geraghty saw the telegram a wrecking
train with a gang of forty men culled
from the shops roundhouse and yards
was thirty miles out of clinton and
speeding for the scene of the tie-up
sixty minutes later the train had
stopped at the first obstruction and the
big tree which had blocked no  was
turning and groaning above the levers
of a dozen huskies seven minutes and
the wrecker pulled up a few yards be-
hind no 

  geraghty rushed into lawsons car
the president had come back from the
bridge he had not received his dis-
patch for the sharpsdale agent had re-
ported wires down a few minutes after
his first message to clinton got
through

  im ready to hand in my resigna-
tion right now said geraghty but i
want to tell you just one or two things
this ecpnomy stuff of mine has been a
bluff ive been trying to kid you the
first delay to no  was my fault but
this one isnt and im not going to let
any economy sharp keep me from
making good when theres a tie-up like
this besides ive got bad news for
you

  geraghty told lawson of the tele-
gram

  my wife moaned lawson then
to geraghty

  get me into clinton before six
oclock he pleaded i must catch the
morning train for chicago on the p 
b my wife is staying in chicago with
her mother

  ill get you there said geraghty

  the engine which brought down the
wrecker was uncoupled in an instant
had switched itself clear a minute later
and with the private cars on behind
was speeding back toward clinton

geraghty was in the cab with marlowe
the engineer

  marlowe he said its one hundred
and thirty-eight miles back to clinton
youve got just three hours and two
minutes to do it in therell be one
stop weve got to get a message
through from some place ordering the
tracks cleared it means this old rattle-
trap of yours will have to do seventy
miles on the straightaways and sixty on
the curves can she do it

  no  isnt a rattletrap you son
of a gun marlowe retorted get in
this cab and ill show you

  geraghtys rules were shattered on
this run the coal that marlowes fire-
man hurled into the fire box would have
given an economy expert heart disease
the regular trains which geraghty had
declared should have all precedence over
specials were shunted on sidetracks
here and there as the engine with the
two cars sped on marlowe never would
tell how fast  did make it that night
but lawson was landed in clinton ten
minutes before the p  b left for
chicago

  and the best part of the story after
all is that lawsons wife didnt die it
looked pretty bad for her and-well it
was a baby but they pulled her-and
him-through she said afterward she
never would have lived if lawson
hadnt been at her bedside when the
struggle came

  superintendent geraghty waiting to
be relieved from his job got his af-
fairs in order and was ready to turn
over the central division to any one
whom lawson might pick

  three days after the washout when
the line was clear again for the en-
gineering department had thrown a tem-
porary bridge across in record time
geraghty opened a telegram and read

  geraghty superintendent central divi-
sion geraghty lawson aged two days
weight ten pounds sends his compliments
dont overdo economy	lawson
ciy

 lmost every one has some pos-
session-a book a picture or what
not-that when new was highly treas-
ured but was afterward set aside on
some high shelf and if not forgotten
at least neglected it pays now and
then to reach up take down and dust
off these long-unheeded treasures we
tired of their contemplation once per-
haps but now going back a second
time we may find new things about
them to love and admire and sounder
deeper reasons to be glad of them we
have our national possessions as well
as personal which we would do well
to take down and dust off occasionally
one of the most durable genuine and
satisfactory of these is the portrait
george washington left behind him in
the things he did and the events that
came to pass because of him

a a

this portrait needs dusting and
 cleaning very badly indeed so
many false biographers have piled their
rubbish on it so many faint water-
color artists have tried to alter the
hearty and rugged lines according to
their own saccharine ideas shake off
the rhetorical rubbish wash away the
water-color smugness and we find
there something infinitely human lik-
able and understandable washington
was no faultless prig the cherry tree
and the little hatchet existed only in
the imagination of parson weems his
father indulged in no more artificial
declamations nor embraces than did
yours he came of gentlemen but his
gentlemen were a full-blooded two-
fisted outdoor lot

 a

ashington came honestly by
a good hot temper a love for
horses and outdoors a dislike for pre-
tense and nonsense of all sorts and a
big muscular body he was by no

means highly educated in the conven-
tional sense but he had a sound taste
for both books and men and like lin-
coln is an example of the fact that
there are some people whom no circum-
stances can make narrow ignorant or
provincial by inheritance he was two
things  an impetuous fighting man with
a temper who liked rather than dreaded
danger and an honest man by instinct
who hated shams and pretense and
sought always after realities grafted
on these qualities he had something
which he must have earned for himself-
a self-control and steadiness of purpose
won only by the bitterest struggles with
a fiery and passionate nature this was
no greek god serene upon a pedestal
simpering at the weaknesses of mankind
if the face in the portrait seems calm
it is not the serenity of the cold-blooded
snob who never had real feelings but
of a human passionate being who has
struggled long with himself and won
the victory tears in his eyes there
had been plenty discouragements and
doubts to wring his heart but always he
showed that one unfailing mark of a
noble nature the steady effort and re-
solve to rule himself and follow the
best and highest rather than the easiest

 a

 s a soldier in the service of the
colonies washington was success-
ful but not always no man was ever
less conceited than he but at the same
time he had a sound sense of his own
worth and enough temper to assert it
forcibly what became in later life a
steady and deliberate valor was in his
younger days of a more desperate and
reckless sort he met with defeats and
disappointments and lived in the mean-
time an outdoor frontier life when
he retired from his military command
he had a reputation in the colony of
virginia-a very small place-but no-
a chat with you-continued

where else he was known as a reck-
less hardy fighter with a will of his
own till the greater war broke out
he spent his days fox hunting and run-
ning his estate and would have remained
there till his death had not events called
him he became the general of the
continental armies because he wras
clearly the best man for the job not
becattse he sought it he fought
through eight long years in wrant and
penury at times struggling not alone
against the enemy but against a weak
and critical congress that failed to give
him men and supplies the campaign
he fought against the british can only
he compared with the campaign fought
by fabius maximus against hannibal
it was masterly in its plan in its pro-
vision for every detail in the tremen-
dous self-control shown by the general
in delaying a decisive stroke till the
time was right such delay in the face
of hunger criticism and discouragement
means a sort of bravery far higher and
rarer than the reckless daring of the
young virginian who fought against the
indians such a steady diplomacy and
command of temper as washington
showed now in handling congress and
his other generals is something far be-
yond the hot-headed george washing-
ton of years before for a long time
washingtons skill as a tactician has
been underestimated but to-day his cam-
paigns are regarded as models he was
not a showy man he was never daring
for the sake of daring but he was
neither slow nor lacking in subtlety and
he could strike and strike hard at the
right moment

	

no man of genius is like another
they are all sui generis sports of
nature never to be repeated all abso-
lutely original washington was a man
of genius just as shakespeare was or
burns or lincoln but of his own indi-
vidual sort he was bv no means an
ambitious man he did want people to
treat him with the respect he thought

his due but never in his whole career
did he show the faintest desire for fame
or inclination to play to the galleries
he was not out for money he was
well off when the war started served
eight terrible years took no pay and
furnished over fifty thousand dollars to
the government out of his own pocket
the consuming desire of his nature was
to do well what he had to do and make
it a success he was a good mixer but
lie always spoke his mind bluntly and
sometimes sarcastically he had a sort
of gray granite optimism in his nature
he saw all the difficulties more plainly
than any man of his day but he had
the heart to face them and the sturdy
will to conquer them

 a

hat washington did to found a
national spirit and to start the
united states on its imperial path has
been told enough in history what he
was as a man interests us more a
big strong rugged figure of a man
sensible and kind stanch and sound a
good fighter undismayed when beaten
and steady and modest in victory a
man who could love and hate and who
hated crooks and cowards above all
things a man of plain speech who
despised what we call hot air and
which in another form was just as
plentiful then as it is now a man digni-
fied and democratic at once fond of
horses and cards and society who
talked enough when he had anything to
say but never talked abcut himself or
his own feelings he had his faults
but he was strong enough to conquer
them he had his pride but it was in
honest work well done and not in him-
self surely in a day of transition
when our melting pot of a world seethes
with so many selfish unsatisfied spirits
and so many strange ideals we can spare
a thought for a simple virginia gentle-
man who could found a republic with-
out being puffed up over it and whose
grasp of the old eternal verities was so
strong and sure

popular readers attention

in the past some of our friends have written us that they
wished our magazine were not so tightly bound that it
would stay open and flat in the hand to meet their
wish we are having the problem worked out by experts
but in the interval those readers who complain to us of the
binding may be glad to follow the example of an ingenious
gentleman in canada who writes

                              toronto december  

    to the popular magazine

          gentlemen-i should like to add my name to your list
      of enthusiastic readers i havent missed a number for six
      years i am always looking for the next i wouldnt
      give one popular for any three other fiction magazines

      being a great smoker i use the following idea as soon as
      i get my magazine i take it to a shoemaker and get
      him to punch two holes with an eyelet punch about an
      inch from the back edge of the magazine then i hie
      me to the nearest printer and get him to guillotine the
      back off just enough to clear the gummed edge i keep
      two metal rings about one and a half or two inches in
      diameter as used in loose-leaf ledgers and these i insert
      in the holes and-there you are every page you turn
      over is flat no swearing when your magazine closes
      up on you and your other hand is free i might add

      be sure and draw out the wire before taking the maga-
      zine to the printer or else you will have trouble this
      idea is not patented and those readers who try this
      will find the popular tastes twice as good wishing
      the popular continued success i am

                                       yours truly
