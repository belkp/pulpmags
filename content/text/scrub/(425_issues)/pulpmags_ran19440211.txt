love stories of the real west misdeal by elsa barker second february number behold he sees what no human eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time he might have stepped from the frame of a rem brandt painting this bewigged figure of a man so
patiently making lenses and squinting through them

  night after night like a child with a new toy
antony van leeuwenhoek seventeenth century dutch
shopkeeper hurried home to place anything and every
thing under his microscope the brain of a fly rain
water a hair pepper a cows eye scrapings from
his teeth

  then one day behold he sees what no human
eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time fantastic
little animals thousands of them to a pin-point
dart and squirm as he gazes

  not for an instant did he suspect any of them as
foes of mankind as possible destroyers of health and
life but the enemy had at last been sighted man
had taken his first faltering step in the war on germs

  nearly two hundred years were to pass before the
second step a giant stride was taken by pasteur he
devoted his life to seeking out the microbes which he
believed to be the cause of disease in turn his work
inspired lister to use carbolic acid in combating the

almost inevitable gangrene which then followed surgery

   soon listers fame as the father of antiseptic sur
gery spread across the adantic no wonder that when
a new noncaustic nonpoisonous antiseptic and
germicide was discovered in st louis its sponsors
named it listerine in his honor

   todaythe shining bottle and amber color of listerine
antiseptic are as familiar to millions of people as the
face of a long trusted friend in more than sixty years
of service in the fight on infection it has day after
day proved deadly to germs but harmless to tissue
   well meriting its almost universal citation as the
safe antiseptic and germicide

by elsa barker

was he really irresponsible this seemingly carefree young cowboy with the
gambling instinct lucy felt she had to know before she could dare to let
her heart be won in this strange new and exciting western country

could have flatly refused to do the work
assigned to him instead he had tried to be
fair-minded about it

  in a way he could understand how ford
harrell the foreman felt about him ford
had worked for lucky jim for thirty years
for the past twenty he had been foreman
of the lucky diamond but ever since walt
and his mother had come back to the ranch
to live after the death of walts father two
years before he had been scared stiff that
he was going to be put out to grass and the
young heir to the ranch given the job he
loved

  walt shoved his hat back wiped drip-
ping sweat from his forehead and took a
generous swig of water from the canteen on
his saddle

 he squinted approvingly down the
straight line of new cedar posts he had set
there was a certain satisfaction in doing
a good days work even when he knew hed
never get any credit for it

he paced off the distance for the next
post lined it up with his eye and jammed
the post-hole digger into the ground for a
generous bite of earth

from around the curve of the little rocky
rise on his right came the sound of horses
hoofs and the metallic rasp of buggy wheels
scraping on rock

the buggy was a brand-new spic and
span affair its red wheels still shiny from

chapter i

o	most folks it would
have seemed funny that a
man like walt carmack
should be digging post-holes
any time much less out in
the blistering heat of a mid-
was the grandson of old
jim sanderson who owned the
lucky diamond ranch and he and his
semi-invalid mother were the only relatives
the old man had left the lucky diamond
was a fair-sized outfit with work to keep
from eight to ten punchers busy most of
the time

  walt didnt mind digging post-holes but
he was getting tired of being shoved off onto
every dirty menial task there was to do
on the ranch he could have done some-
thing about it if he had been cut from a
different piece of goods he could have
gone squawking to his grandfather or he

factory paint and drawn by a quick step-
ping high-headed black horse riding
alongside at a slow jogging trot was the
lucky diamond foreman on the high-
hipped bony gray that was his favorite
mount

  the thick-shouldered man on the buggy
seat was as immaculate his english riding
boots as shiny as if he too had just been
turned out of a factory gene chipman the
banker from cosecha was in a way a man
of mystery even the folks who lived in
cosecha and thought it the finest town in
the world were aware that it was odd a
man of chipmans wealth and sophistica-
tion should settle down and open a bank in
this sleepy little town thirty miles from a
railroad

  he had been there three years now and
because he never talked about his past there
had been many wild rumors about him but
after the first year the gossip had mostly
been kindly for the banker had a way with
him even when he went about the un-
pleasant business of foreclosing mortgages
and calling in loans he seemed anxious to
make it as painless as possible

  they pulled up alongside the fence and
walt saw ford harrells practiced eye
squint down the line of new posts when
he turned back to the cowboy there was
grudging approval in his hard eyes

  chipman grinned at the cowboy

  ford certainly doesnt know much about
diplomacy does he doesnt he know he
ought to butter up the old mans grandson 
why dont you find this boy a nice soft job
closer to home ford

  he sounded as if he meant it as a joke
but it was the wrong thing to say ford
harrells stocky body stiffened his voice
had the rasp of pent-up irritation in it

  as long as im ramroddin this ranch
therell be no soft jobs for anyone walt
can take my orders or one of usll get off
the ranch

  it was the same challenge walt carmack
had had flung at him nearly every day for
two years he was tired of it but in a way
he was on the spot he knew how much
lucky jim thought of his foreman he knew
how faithfully ford harrell had served
lucky jim for years and he didnt like the
idea of busting up a friendship like that

anyhow he didnt figure he was much of
a man if he couldnt stand a little heckling
for the peace of mind of his frail mother
and old grandfather

  he looked ford harrell in the eye and
grinned a little you aint heard me com-
plainin have you he asked easily

  harrells answer to that was a grunt
mr chipman wanted to drive up the mesa
road an i thought maybe you could tell him
whether its passable since the may rains
walt eyed the slim-legged horse the
bright new buggy wheels its mighty
rough and steep

  passable

  maybe if you dont mind takin the
chance of breakin a wheel-an your horse
aint spooky

  maybe i better give up the idea i wish
i could ride horseback i hurt my back
when i was a kid and i have to be mighty
careful chipman smiled apologetically
im going to have to close a loan to old
man eastman hes got a little piece of
land up beyond cerro pelon thought id
take a look at it and if it appealed to me
id take it and call the deal square

  walt looked at him curiously in his
experience bankers didnt usually discuss
the details of their business with casual
acquaintances

  youve been buying up quite a few
pieces around here lately aint you he
asked idly what you want it for  goin
into the ranchin business

  chipman laughed and shrugged no
damned if i know what i want it for i
just like the feeling of being a land owner
i guess anyhow lands about as solid a
thing as a man can put his money into these
days

  ford harrell gave him an amused slight-
ly sour look well in case you do go into
the cow raisin business maybe youd like
to come along with me an walt an learn
how to pull porcupine quills out of a bulls
nose

  chipman laughed again sure i al-
ways did like to watch a rodeo

  harrell turned to walt its that new
bull of lucky jims hes just around the
hill well round up a little bunch of cattle
and shove them with him down to the cor-
ral at the ojo feliz
misdeal



  why bother to run him in a corral  we
can handle him where he is that gray of
yoursu hold an elephant an my bay aint
no featherweight

  the foremans heavy gray brows met in
a scowl no he disagreed-from habit
well-

  walt brought a coin from his pocket
id sure like to get the rest of them posts
set an its a long way over to the corral
he said amiably ill flip you for it heads
we rope him where he is tails we take him
to the corral

  the banker chuckled be a sport ford
why gosh man if you can handle a rope
anything like walt here you wont have
any trouble

  when it was put like that there wasnt
much the foreman could do but give in
he was proud of his roping skill and resent-
ed the implication that any squirt not more
than ten years out of knee pants could out-
class him

  walt tossed the coin both men bent
over it

  looks like i win walt said picking
up the nickel and pocketing it

  ford harrell nodded he looked out of
temper but he didnt try to welch on his
bargain

  the bull was a big one and the quills had
been in his nose long enough to put him in
an ugly mood he came around the hill
bellowing death and destruction at anything
that might be in his way pawing the ground
every few steps

  ill take his head ford harrell said
quietly

  walt nodded whatever else his faults
harrell was not a man to shirk his share of
a dangerous job he was the kind of a
hand walt liked to work wii

  the bull made no effort to get out of the
way twelve feet away harrells loop
snaked out and landed neatly over the big
horns like the smart cowpony he was
harrells gray tightened the rope the bull
stood stock still for a moment then with an
angry rumble deep in his throat he lowered
his great head and came straight for the
gray

  instantly walt dabbed a loop on one hind
foot both horses working like a team
jumped to tighten the ropes and nearly a

ton of bull meat flopped to the ground
bellowing impotent rage   

  grinning a little because to him work like
this was always fun walt carmack swung
down from his saddle an extra lass rope
over his arm with one hand on the tight
rope he ran toward the helpless bull half-
way there he heard the sudden spine-chill-
ing whirr of a rattler one jump carried
him a good six feet forward and in the
same second he felt the rope in his hand
go slack as his horse spooked at the deadly
noise

  ford harrell likewise off his horse saw
what had happened and turned for his horse
skittiriiy the gray shied sidewise now the
bull  ts on his feet he kicked twice and
the loosened rope slipped off his hoof he
stood still for a moment swinging his head
from the gray to the bay and back again as
if trying to make up his mind which enemy
to tackle first

  just as harrells boot reached for the
stirrup the bull charged the gray reared
and backed away and the foreman stum-
bled and fell to the ground one of the
horses flashing front hoofs struck him as
the animal lunged sharply backward trying
to remain true to his training and keep the
rope taut

  harrell groaned and lay still walt cast a
quick desperate look about him the bull
was a valuable animal and he didnt want
to kill him unless necessary if he wasnt
already fatally injured harrell was com-
paratively safe as long as he lay flat on the
ground the bay was edging away with the
high-headed wise look of a horse that
doesnt aim to be caught if he can help it
walt swore at him made a grab at the trail-
ing rope and misssed

  then as the bull made another charge at
the now panic-stricken gray walt sprinted
after him twirling the extra lariat he
jerked the loop over a hind foot again and
dug in his boot heels his weight slowed
the bull some but didnt anywhere near
stop him walt was yanked roughly for-
ward desperate- he caught the rope
around his bent left elbow for a more secure
grip and yanked out his sixgun with his
right

  the rope twisted tight and there was a
bruising pain in his left arm as he squeezed


elsa barker

the trigger as the rope jerked him down
his forehead hit a rock and the world went
black

  ford harrell groaned and sat up slowly
gene chipman jumped down out of the
buggy and ran to his side

  hurt bad ford

  the old cowmans lips were twisted back
from his teeth with the effort not to groan
again he shook his head dazedly

  i reckon not he managed to say slow-
ly feels like my ribs wheres walt

  lying over there looks like he might
be dead

  we better see

  he rolled to his knees then with the
bankers help got painfully to his feet

  together they turned the cowboy over
on his back there was an ugly bleeding
bruise on his forehead and one arm was
twisted at a grotesque angle away from his
body ford harrell stooped to lay an ear
against his chest

  hearts still beating good thing we
got a buggy here it aint very easy on a
hurt man to pack him in on a horse he
rubbed his hand slowly over his own fore-
head as if still dazed from pain you reck-
on you can catch my gray for me gene

  the banker gave him a funny look he
pulled a pint flask of whiskey from his
hip pocket

  take a swig of this he said quietly
then turn around and look

  harrell looked before he took the drink
twenty feet away lay the huge motionless
hulk of the shot bull still quivering with
fright a horn rake dripping blood from his
shoulder the gray still held the rope to the
bulls head taut

  pride came into ford harrells gray
eyes

  damn good horse he said and tipped
the bottle to his lips

  walt carmack was a big man six foot
one in his stocking feet big-boned and
heavy-muscled lifting his inert weight
into the buggy was no easy chore with
ford harrell panting with pain at every
movement but finally it was done chip-
man looked at the foremans gray drawn
face

  you ride m the buggy he offered
and ill bring the gray

  ford harrell shook his head slowly

  lucky jim would think i was gettin
old and soft he said trying to joke ive
ridden a horse when i was hurt a heap
worsen this

  chipman brought a coin out of his shirt
pocket

  look he said softly his black eyes
sober i dont like to tell tales out of school
-but-i found this in the grass over there
where walt fell maybe you ought to see
it

  harrell took the coin and turned it over
in his hand it was like an ordinary nickel
except there was an indian head on both
sides slowly the old foremans gnarled
knuckles clenched tight around it and for
a moment as he looked up at the uncon-
scious cowboy in the buggy his eyes were
murderous but when he turned again to
the banker he was the cold-eyed hard-
tongued foreman who kept punchers on the
lucky diamond strictly in line

  thanks gene ill settle with walt for
this later you forget it

chapter ii

            u c y mcadams
stood by the front win-
dow in foreman har-
rells little stone cot-
tage and watched a
couple of buggies and
a surrey roll up and unload a bevy of party-
dressed men and women in front of the big
main house across the yard a half-dozen
saddled horses were already tied to the
hitch-rail in front their riders heel-squat-
ted chatting in a circle lights began to
blink on all over the big house and lucy
could hear the occasional scrape of a violin
string as a fiddler tuned up

  nothing that the woman in the employ-
ment agency in indianapolis had said and
certainly nothing she had ever read about
the west had prepared lucy for the lucky
diamond ranch

  a door opened behind her and with a
swish of long silken skirts another girl came
into the room millie harrell was a tall
fair-haired girl big-boned and a little angu-
lar but still good looking in spite of the
wind-roughened brown of her face and
misdeal



arms she was only eighteen but the re-
sponsibility of keeping house for her father
and looking after a younger brother and
sister made her seem older she smiled at
lucy and when she spoke her voice was
low and musical

  youre prompt miss mcadams may-
be you can teach me and the kids how you
do it we nearly drive dad crazy always
being late

  lucy smoothed the skirt of her plain
black dress apologetically

  im sorry i didnt bring anything more
partyish with me i wasnt expecting any-
thing like this

  why you look awful pretty millie
said reassuringly anyhow nobody ever
worries about clothes at one of lucky jims
parties everybodys invited-and every-
body comes like as not therell be a dozen
little homesteader girls over there with
gingham dresses on but theyll all liave a
good time

  she broke a bright red blossom from a
potted geranium in the window here
stick this over your ear itll look pretty
against that black hair of yours if youre
ready well go over now there might be
something i could do to help mrs car-
mack these parties are always a big job
for her she has a house full of mexican
girls to help then she always winds up
doing everything herself and making herself
sick susie will be here to see that dad
washes his ears and gets into a clean shirt
without more than two or three buttons
missing

  she linked her arm through the older
girls and still chatting easily led the way
out onto the porch and across the yard
the heel-squatting punchers stood up when
they saw the two girls coming and lucy
saw their eager glance turned on her millie
waved at them cheerfully

 you boys can meet miss mcadams
later were busy now

  the cowboys all of them young some
of them looking to be still in their teens
smiled shyly and with a sudden rush of
friendly feeling lucy smiled back

  she hadnt expected to like the west
coming here to tutor the two younger har-
rell children through the summer to make
up for the school term they had missed due

to a bout with scarlet fever was a kind of
self-imposed exile from the kind of life and
the kind of people she liked as soon as she
dared she would go back to it but millie
harrell was as nice as any girl she had
known back home and already the unaffect-
ed friendliness of these people was melting
a little of the hard core around her heart

  millie was still talking as they went up
the wide stone steps of the big house

  youll like lucky jim miss mcadams
hes a square-shooter if there ever was one
even if he never had much time to really
get acquainted with folks until the last few
years now dad says hes having the fun
he never had when he was younger he
started from scratch-an orphan without a
penny to his name-and from the stories
they tell about him i guess he had to fight
every step for what hes got now in those
days there were indians outlaws rustlers
as well as crooked politicians thank good-
ness those days are over with now there
hasnt been a speck of trouble on this range
for five years lucky jim he just fiddles
around and has a good time while dad runs
everything smooth as clock work

  she reached out a hand for the door-
knob but it swung open from the inside
before she touched it two tall young cow-
boys stood in the doorway they were both
good looking with the slim-hipped wide-
shouldered build lucy had noticed seemed
to be fairly common among cowboys

  millie harrell gave a soft little exclama-
tion under her breath

  walt carmack i supposed youd still
be in the hospital

  the taller of the two a black-haired blue-
eyed young giant grinned down at her his
left arm was in a sling and there was the
red angry-looking scar of a recently healed
wound across his forehead

  im not as fragile as i look he said

  the other cowboy tapped the tall girl
lightly on the shoulder youre forgettin
your manners millie why do you reckon
we busted over here to open the door for
you

  the girl gave a half exasperated little
laugh

  miss mcadams i sure hate to begin
your troubles this quick because i know
youre liable to have these two devils under-


elsa barker

foot all summer her voice was still cheer-
ful and easy but to lucy it seemed that
some of the warm rich quality was lacking
now miss mcadams-walt carmack
lucky jims grandson-and billy gamel
lucy looked up smiling into a pair of
twinkling blue eyes then into a bright
brown pair she felt her pulse quicken a
little maybe this idea of tutoring on a
ranch wasnt going to be such a bad one
after all

  millie harrell laid a hand on the tall
cowboys shoulder walt do me a favor
will you

  sure millie

  keep out of dads wray tonight hes
still ringy about those two ribs you got
busted for him

  heck whats two busted ribs to get
roily about billy gamel asked cheerfully
they tell me ol man adam lost a couple
one time-and look what it got him
broken ribs a broken arm and a
cracked head lucy said what do you
call not a speck of trouble

  not real trouble the other girl assured
her i hope

  red-headed billy gamel chuckled ford
harrell an op walt here they got into an
argument about the best way to pull por-
cupine quills out of a bulls nose miss
mcadams

  seeing the look of pretty disdain that
came over lucy mcadams face millie
harrell hastened to explain

  oh they didnt fight about it it was
the bull that knocked them around and
lamed a good horse for a couple of months
dad knew how strong and mean tempered
that bull was he knew they ought to drive
him in to the corral to handle him walt
was in a hurry and he wanted to try it out
on the range they flipped a coin to settle
the argument-and walt won

  billy gamel chuckled he always wins
the lucky son-of-a-gun

  millie made a soft exasperated sounding
little exclamation half under her breath
she opened the hand bag she carried over
her arm reached in it then handed a coin
to billy gamel

  this fell out of walts pocket during
that bull ruckus dad found it think
about it billy the next time walt wants

to flip a coin for something she said quiet-
ly dad didnt mind having his ribs busted
if it was part of the days work but he hates
to be cheated

  the twinkle was entirely gone from walt
carmacks eyes now im sorry about
fords ribs millie but that accident or
worse could have happened in a corral the
same as on the range

  millie harrell shrugged her disbelief
billy gamel turned the coin she had given
him over in his hand it was a nickel but
with an indian head on both sides he sud-
denly chuckled reached out and slapped
the taller cowboy between the shoulders so
vigorously that walt carmack flinched
away from him

  why you old son-of-a-gun so thats
how come you got to go ridin with millie
that sunday i spent all mornin groomin
an shoein her horse

  walt grinned and turned to lucy the
musicll be startin in a minute miss mc-
adams may i have the first dance

  billy nudged him with his shoulder
lets flip for it he suggested shamelessly

  even millie harrell laughed a little walt
shook his head

  draw straws

  walt hesitated then nodded grinning
ive got some matches wait till i fix
em

  lucy mcadams watched them half
amused half angered at their bland ignoring
of her right to choose her own partner she
was still feeling that way about it when five
minutes later she danced away to the lilting
strains of pretty baby she looked up at
walt carmack

  you cheated him too she said accus-
ingly i saw you the long one you were
holding between your thumb and finger was
broken in the middle either way hed
draw the short straw 

  walt looked completely unrepentant
why didnt you tell billy he asked
mildly

  lucy stopped dancing abruptly her face
flushed angrily why you big- she
stopped floundered helplessly for a mo-
ment then started over youre a big
conceited bag of wind youre a cheat-
and-and youre impudent if you think
i-
misdeal



walt carmack

  walt put his arm around her firmly and
forced her unwilling feet to follow as he
started dancing again

  im sorry he said and sounded as if
he really meant it i didnt aim to sound
thataway besides he didnt want to dance
with you he wanted to dance with millie
why didnt he ask her then lucy
couldnt help asking tartly

  walt chuckled millie treats him kinda
rough sometimes i reckon maybe he had
some idea of tryin the jealousy cure
oh lucy said she wasnt a flirt but
she felt a little piqued she gave him a
deliberately demure look from under long
black lashes i suppose youre dancing
with me for the same reason

  the mischief was suddenly gone from
walt carmacks blue eyes what do you
think he asked softly as his arm tight-
ened around her

  my turn cowboy said a cheerful
voice as a hand slapped walt smartly on
the shoulder

  walt scowled billy gamel laughed
slipped his arm around lucys waist and
they danced away

  walt sauntered over to the open door
rolled himself a smoke and lighted it the
music stopped and when it started again he
didnt join the stag rush to the corner where
the little school teacher was standing

  instead he hunted up millie harrell and
danced once with her then once with each
danceable woman in the room that duty

done he went back and took up his stance
by the door again

  smoke from his cigarette spiraled over
his head and drifted slowly out into the still
night air he leaned back against the door-
frame while his eyes followed lucy mc-
adams around the room she was doing all
right all the cowboys who werent too
bashful were tagging her every ten steps
girls of any sort were scarce in the cow
country and ones like lucy mcadams as
rare as straight-legged cowboys

  but she didnt seem to be enjoying her
popularity as much as most girls would
have if shed loosen up a bit get rid of
that stiff half frozen style of smiling and
talking she would be a mighty pretty girl
her black eyes had the soft velvety look
of big black pansies and her hair was a
dark fluffy cloud around her piquant face
she was small and slender and the way
that plain black dress set off her cute little
figure was an eyeful

  now she was dancing with gene chip-
man the banker from cosecha smiling po-
litely at something he was telling her but
looking as if she really didnt give a darn
about anything he said but chipman who
had the reputation of being something of a
lady killer seemed to be liking the girls
indifference

  out by the front step a bunch of young
bloods who had stepped outside for a
breath of fresh air finished a good story
and with a whoop of laughter turned and
trooped back into the house

  one who seemed to be trailing in the rear
of the group rather than being a part of it
jostled roughly into walt staggered a little
and the heel of his shoe came down hard
on the cowboys toe

  it hurt and walt grunted the mans
smooth-fitting dark suit pale skin and slick
hair labeled him as probably a town prod-
uct walt who thought he knew every man
woman and child within a twenty-mile radi-
us could not remember ever having seen
him before while these parties of lucky
jims were open to anyone who wanted to
come it was not often that a complete
stranger tried to horn in

  he put a hand on the mans shoulder to
steady him brother if you dont dance
any better than you walk youre not goin


elsa barker

to be popular with the gals tonight he said

  the stranger turned a glassy eye on him
and walt caught a strong whiff of liquor
with a strength that seemed puny to the big
cowboy he struck at the lean-muscled arm

  ill do my own worrying about that
he assured walt in a voice that was thick
and slurring the girls always go for me
all right

  walt grinned a little probably the man
ought to be put outside again to air off a
little but he hated to start a brawl at his
grandfathers party he tightened his fin-
gers on the strangers shoulder and gave it
a little shake

  behave yourself bud ill have an eye
on you

  this time the man seemed not to have
heard the music had stopped and the
dancers were slowly leaving the floor the
stranger looked the room over for a minute
then started across the floor straight as a
homing pigeon toward lucy mcadams and
the banker

  the girls cool reserved face came sud-
denly alive from halfway across the big
living room walt couldnt accurately judge
all the changes of expression that chased
each other across her face but he could see
that she recognized the stranger and that
she was not any too pleased to see him

  the man was talking now and smiling
the girl shook her head he laid a hand
familiarly on her arm and she drew back
sharply

  walt started across the room the music
started up again but now everybody seemed
to be looking at the three people still in the
middle of the floor and not many started to
dance

walt put his hand on the girls arm
wasnt this our dance miss mcadams

  she looked up at him her face red with
embarrassment not dead-pan any longer
thanking him mutely for his help

  i-why-yes i guess it was  could
we-

  now look here lucy the man broke
in his voice rising even above the music
if youre trying to ditch me after me fol-
lowing you for a thousand miles just for the
chance to talk to you again youre crazy
you act like you wtas ashamed of me

the girls face got even redder but her

shoulders straightened and her chin lifted

  i am ashamed of you she said sharply
coming in here drunk-without even an
invitation ill bet-and making a scene this
way she looked up at walt this is
clark bowles-mr carmack-mr chip-
man he comes from the same town in in-
diana that i do and-and hes all right when
he isnt drunk

  the banker bowed politely a peculiar lit-
tle smile on his face lucy looked up at
walt again

  couldnt we-

  sure walt answered her out of the
corner of his eye he saw billy gamel speak
to the head fiddler with scarcely a break
they swung into the opening bars of red
river valley millie harrell moved over
beside them and began singing softly at
first then as heads turned to watch her
voice rose clear and sure and of such a
simple sweetness that a breathless hush fell
over the room tired worried frowns were
magically smoothed from womens fore-
heads as they listened a child over at the
other end of the room suddenly stopped
fretting even the drunk man standing be-
tween gene chipman and walt carmack
straightened his shoulders and a little smile
smoothed away the sulky droop to his
mouth making him look almost boyish and
nice

  walt nodded to the big banker they
each looped an arm through the strangers
and quietly led him off the floor after a
moment lucy mcadams followed as she
reached the door millie stopped singing
for a moment the breathless hush over the
room held then a wave of delighted ap-
plause seemed to rock the walls of the big
old house

chapter iii

he dance had been in mid-
june and it was now late
july so far it had been a
hot dry summer with scant
rain even in the hills grass
was short and cattle were
beginning to show gaunt flanks only the
hardy native cornfields seemed to thrive

  but in other ways it had been a pleasant
summer for one thing ford harrell had
misdeal



been called to santa fe for several weeks
as representative for the county to attend
a special session of the state legislature
called by the governor to attend to a score
of legislative chores it had neglected to fin-
ish in the regular january session among
these was an emergency authorization for
the sale of certain public school lands whose
revenue from leases seemed to be less than
could be secured by selling the lands and
investing the money in certain high interest
bonds now available

  during harrells absence some of the
ranch management had naturally gravitated
into walt carmacks hands and it hadnt
helped the foremans temper any on those
sundays when he came home to find that
things on the ranch rocked along on a pretty
even keel without him

  after a persistent year-long courtship
billy gamel had begun to make some prog-
ress with millie harrell but in these few
weeks walt carmack made none whatever
that he could see with lucy mcadams
which hadnt bothered walt much so far
lucy was a pretty girl-fun to dance with
ride with and tease-but that queer cold
self-restraint that she kept her heart locked
up in held him at arms length and until
he found out whether there was really a
warm lovable girl inside that shell he
aimed to stay that way if he had been
really serious he would have had plenty of
competition to worry about particularly
gene chipman who had the time and money
and charm to sweep most any girl off her
feet and gene seemed bent on doing just
that

  for a while young clark bowles had
hung around the ranch a lot apparently
inclined to shiftlessness when he was sober
he was a good-natured kid with a certain
breezy charm that made him popular in the
bunkhouse but ford harrell and walt
carmack for once seeing eye to eye had
perceived how uncomfortable his continued
presence made lucy mcadams so when
the regular chief clerk of the legislature got
sick they managed to get old lucky jim
sanderson and gene chipman to pull a few
political wires that landed the temporary
job for the kid

- now the temporary truce over ford
harrell had come home from santa fe for

the week-end tired and irritable he had
gone into a froth of rage on learning that
a bad wire cut on one of his favorite saddle
horses had somehow gone unnoticed and
undoctored long enough for the wound to
become infected and that the horse had had
to be shot

  the full weight of his wrath had fallen
unjustly on walt carmacks head and he
had wound up by sending billy and walt
off to a boars nest camp on a distant cor-
ner of the range for a whole month of fenc-
ing and windmill work

  billy gamel was taking out his bad tem-
per swearing at the balky pack mule he was
leading

  a whole damn month he grumbled at
walt carmacks broad shoulders ahead of
him on the trail a month stuck way back
here with the hoot owls diggin post-holes
polin up corrals an fixin windmills if i
was ol luckys grandson damn if i
wouldnt try to do a little better by my
friends course i know you just love to
dig post-holes

  walt slid sideways in the saddle and
grinned back at the disgruntled red head

  afraid maybe millie will of forgot you
in a month

  i know damn well she will billy said
sourly an shell have plenty of help
doin it now you aint got nothin to worry
about you dont care if the pretty school-
marm does marry gene chipman one of
these days

  walts grin went a little wry

  i cant do myself any more harm by
leavin than i already done by hangin
around he admitted dryly she thinks
im light-minded-an she sure dont like
my bettin damn if i understand women
he went on savagely you an i been work-
in harder than any other four men on the
ranch-an genes been spending half his
time lately sittin around listenin to her play
the piano-an yet she holds him up to me
as a model of industry and propriety
they had reached the crest of a wide
flat-topped mesa billy spurred his horse
and yanked on the pack mules rope the
two men rode side by side for a few minutes
without speaking each nursing his own
private sour thoughts

  then walt pulled a deck of cards from


elsa barker

his shirt pocket and began shuffling them

  i offered gene last night to cut for
high to see who got to sit by her on the
piano bench an turn her music he
stopped grinned and spread the cards out
fanwise in his hand they were all the
seven of spades he closed the deck turned
it end for end and spread it open again
now they were all the king of hearts

  sometimes i wonder if that girls old
man wasnt a gambler she caught on right
away and boy did she eat me out he
chuckled anyhow she dont give me
that cool dead pan look no more i bet
i make her madder than anybody else
alive

  billy looked enviously at the cards

  i want to borrow that deck when we
get back he said grinning millie aint
near so quick to catch on-an i can
think of lots of ways itll come in handy

  walt suddenly pulled his horse up
leaned over and laid a hand on the rein
of the other cowboys pony

  billy he said quietly look up there
by that big rock butte see that horse an
a little farther to the right the man with
what looks like a surveyors tripod  what
the devil do you suppose he thinks hes
doin there aint supposed to be nobody
up here but us that gray looks a heap
like the one ford always rides

   taint ford billy said positively
he was goin back to santa fe this after-
noon

  as if in answer to walts question a rifle
cracked suddenly the pack mule which
had edged up close to scratch his nose
against the tail of walts bay suddenly
squealed reared high in the air and fell
heavily to the ground

  walt and billy didnt have to talk it
over to decide what to do the man was
far out of sixgun range a second shot
cut into the ground inches in front of walts
horse whoever it was shooting that rifle
meant business and in another second if
he was any shot at all he would have the
proper range straight ahead of them an-
other upthrust ledge offered the quickest
cover

  at the sharp dig of spurs the cow-
ponies jumped into a run they were al-
most at right angles to the man with the

rifle and as they shuttled behind the occa-
sional round-topped junipers that dotted
the mesa they made a hard target to hit

  the bullets still came at intervals as if
the man were taking careful and deliberate
aim

  one whizzed through the crown of
walts hat so low that it scraped his scalp
and nearly knocked him out of the saddle
the next one was lower it ripped across
the top of the saddle cantle but the next
instant they were safe behind a thick curve
of rock

  walt took off his hat and looked at the
bullet hole through it his head still felt
dazed and crazy gingerly he put a hand
up and touched the place that stung on
his head his finger came away stained
with blood

  gittin shot at always did rile mej
his lips were thin over his strong teeth
he swore thoroughly and completely

  billy gamels face was a little white
but still he found a grin first time i
ever seen a mans hair parted crossways
walt

  im lucky to be still worry in about
how its parted

  what you spose was ailin that booger
he was too far away to see who we were
maybe he thought he was shootin at
somebody else

  this is lucky diamond range no-
bodys got no business shootin at nobody
up here

  a reckless light began to dance in billy
gamels brown eyes he straightened in
the saddle and gathered up his reins shall
we go git him

  walt hesitated his eyes narrowed as
he tried to remember just how the land
lay up here he shook his head

  wed have to cross a wide open strip
to get at him hes got a rifle an our six-
guns would be out of range

  he stepped out of the saddle and tied his
horse to a nearby juniper billy gamel
followed suit

  so far as i know walt said theres
only two ways down off this mesa the
way we came up an another trail about a
half-mile yonder to the right it goes
down off the northeast comer of the mesa
you cant miss it if you-	
misdeal



   cant miss it look here walt i
aint earin about how to get down off this
mesa right now im goin to find out why
that guy opened up on us

  wait a minute walt laid a hand on
his arm you find that trail like i said
theres a few trees there an some big
rocks thatll give you plenty of cover get-
tin there but from where he is hell be
ridin in the open a good quarter before
he gets to you so you can wait an pick
your own range

  nice an soft for me huh said billy
sounding disappointed an what you
goin to do

  go back around an block the trail we
come up of course

  you think maybe hes forgotten how to
shoot since a few minutes ago

  i can drop off the edge of the rim-
rock right close here theres a shelf ledge
about ten twenty feet down i can work
my way around on that

  how you know he aint skeedaddled
while we stood here gabbin

  maybe he has but i dont think so
he dont know just where we are now-
he dont know we aint got rifles with us
-an hed have to cross into the open to
get to either trail he may wait until night
to try to get away but he wont wait longer
because there aint no water up here on
top

  want to draw straws to see which one
takes which trail

  walt shook his head

  this is serious not play-actin be-
sides whats the use i always win
okay billy shrugged and walt was
a little surprised that he had given in to
take the comparatively safe job with so
little argument

  billy strolled over to the edge of the
mesa and walt followed for the first ten
feet the break was sheer then the wall of
the mesa sloped off a little still too steep
for a man or horse to climb but there were
occasional breaks and benches where
clumps of stunted pinon and juniper grew
billy peered over the edge

 think you might try goin down
here he asked and suddenly before walt
could move to stop him he jumped he
landed on his feet fell rolled a foot

or two and stopped against a pinon

  walt swore partly at the other cow-
boy but mostly at himself for not realiz-
ing that was exactly the sort of thing billy
gamel would do billy sat up dusted the
gravel off his hands and laughed at walts
furious face

  you idiot you didnt think you could

lucy mcadams

work your way around here with a bullet
through your head an one arm still in
splints did you

  of course i could-an dammit i will
ill toss a rope down to you an haul you
back up

  like fun you cant get me back up
there until im ready to go this is my
turn to go huntin while you play kitty at
the gopher hole

  billy put out a tentative foot and dug
his heel in to test how solid the sloping
ground was it held he stood up put
both hands against the wall and started
inching his way sideways kicking his heels
hard into the soddy clay with every step to
make solid footing walt swore at him
again but billy kept going

  well be careful then-you damn fool
he growled

  billy freed one hand from the wall long
enough to hold it up over his shoulder and
wag a couple of fingers in farewell

  walt turned back away from the rim
tom now with indecision about what to
do his original plan was still a good one


elsa barker

but he hated the part of sitting and wait-
ing while someone else ran all the risks
billy was brave to the point of foolhardi-
ness sometimes and while he wouldnt have
minded making that dimb himself it turned
him sick to his stomach to think of the
gay young redhead perhaps falling and
rolling to his death

  also there were places where the slop-
ing ledge came close to the top where
billy would have to duck and crawl to
keep from being seen by the man on the
mesa would billy have sense enough to
resist the temptation to peek over the top
to reassure himself the man was still there
-and thus give his hand away

  disgusted with himself worried and
impatient walt untied his horse and swung
into the saddle again that second trail
down going as it did along the back of the
mesa was out of sight of the man on the
rock ledge

  that added to the cowboys self-disgust
his was thenice safe easy part to play
this second trail was seldom used and
known only to a few people there was
scant chance that the man would try to
get away from this side

  near the head of this little used trail
walt retied his horse to one side out of
sight in a clump of trees and took his
stance behind a big rock

  he settled himself as comfortably as he
could rolled himself a smoke and lighted
it it was nearly four now he might have
to wait here hours before anything hap-
pened what in heck had made him ever
think up such a cockeyed plan anyhow
why hadnt they just rushed the guy like
billy had wanted to

  while his watch slowly ticked off half
an hour he twisted sweated and batted at
the big blue-green flies that smelling blood
buzzed around his head and settled on his
hands and face when he was still for half
a second with his mind he was trying to
follow billys progress guess when he
would be safely around to the head of the
trail if he didnt hear any shots for an-
other fifteen or twenty minutes surely the
kid ought to be safe

  and then suddenly he heard them-two
of them rifle shots-and no answering
spitfire from a sixgun

  walt ran for his horse and hit the sad-
dle to hell with playing safe any longer 
those shots could mean only one thing-
that billy had somehow exposed himself

  he raced across the open and rounded
the curve of rock where he and billy had
argued over their plans just in time to
see the rump of a gray horse disappearing
in the edge of the pifions on the other side
of the mesa he dug his spurs into his
own tall bay and leaned low in the sad-
dle-then suddenly reined the horse sharply
to the right over toward the rimrock edge

  the man on the gray was getting away
but he would have to let him go if he
felt safe enough to make such an open
break it must mean he knew he had hit
billy

  only a few hundred yards from the
mouth of the trail but lying huddled against
a juniper twenty feet below the rim he
saw the cowboy

  with hands that were quick and steady in
spite of the sick shaky feeling down in-
side him walt tied one end of a lariat
securely to his saddle horn then went over
the edge hand over hand down the rope

  billys heart still seemed to be beating
but faintly and jerkily with every heart-
beat the blood was oozing in spurts from
a round hole just under his collar bone
on the left side walt went even sicker
when he saw that hole and he knew then
that billys chances of survival were scant
he took off his shirt tore out the sleeves
and wadded them tight against the wound
then folded the rest of the shirt and but-
toned it around the boy to hold the wadding
in place

  he remembered with dismay that it was
over ten miles back to the ranch billy
hurt as badly as he was certainly couldnt
stand to be packed in jackknife style across
a saddle he shouldnt even be moved
but neither could he be left here where
there was scarcely room to stand without
sliding downhill and where if he awakened
and tossed about with the strength of delir-
ium he might go rolling off the ledge to
certain death

  walt slipped one end of the rope around
billys shoulders brought it up under his
armpits and tied it under his chin with
something like a hangmans noose then be
misdeal



carefully climbed up the rope himself

  his horse spooked a little when his head
appeared suddenly over the rimrock but
when walt spoke to him he quieted then
he pulled the wounded cowboy up over
the edge it was slow hard work for
billy gamel was a big man and walts
left arm while it had begun to heal and
he could use his fingers had no strength
in it

  he made a bed of sorts for the cowboy
where the spotty shadow of a juniper would
shade his face for the rest of the after-
noon and forced a few drops of whiskey
between his set lips he put the canteen of
water close by his side where if billy woke
up and wanted it he would be able to
reach it then he swung into the saddle
again

chapter iv

  - he tall bays sides were
   sweat-caked and his knees
  shook from weariness when

  k msbkjir walt stopped him at the
  ranch house just over an

  a cowhand who had riden in from work
a few minutes early was mending a sad-
dle in front of the gear shed as quickly
as he could walt explained what had hap-
pened and sent him back to the foot of
the mesa with a wagon blankets and
stretcher

  then he went in the house and called
the doctor in cosecha dr watson was a
brisk businesslike man who didnt ask
many questions and walt felt a certain
tense relief that he didnt have to explain
the whole grim accident over again

  walts mother had come into the room
while he was telephoning she heard a
little and guessed at more when she saw
her sons haggard face bloodshot eyes and
the dried blood caked in his hair mrs
carmack was a small frail-looking wom-
an with big blue eyes and a quick nervous
way of moving and speaking her own del-
icate health and her husbands recent
death had made her over-solicitous toward
walt she looked at him now with wor-
ried eyes

  do you intend to go out with dr wat-

son she asked watching him anxiously
  the cowboy nodded

  sit down and rest a minute itll take
him a half-hour at least to get out here
ill go fix you a cool drink

  when she came back with the drink
walt took it then gulped it down absent-
mindedly and resumed his restless pacing
of the room presently he dropped wearily
in a chair leaned his head back and rubbed
his knuckles over his tired and suddenly
foggy eyes from across the room his
mother watched him narrowly without
speaking

  walt heard the wheels of the doctors
buggy when they scraped against the hitch-
rack as he pulled his team of lively bays to
a stop the cowboy roused and got up
he staggered a little when he walked but
he made it through the door all right out
on the porch he suddenly swayed and
dropped down in the wide porch swing

  the little doctor hopped nimbly out of
his buggy walt hurt too he asked

  he was shot-but not bad i think i
can take care of him he was dead set on
going back with you and he was all in so
i gave him some of my sleeping tablets
i couldnt see any sense in him punishing
himself any more

  the doctor shook his head at her
walts a big boy now dammit why
dont you let him look after himself
then as her big eyes filled with sensi-
tive tears he patted her shoulder briefly
im sorry nellie i didnt aim to hurt
your feelings anybody here who can drive
out with me i may want to ride back
in the wagon with billy an id like some-
one to drive my team

  mrs carmack hesitated

  fathers not here none of the boys
are in from work yet and millies in town
i think-but lucy mcadams is home id
hate to send some young girls out on a
trip like that but lucy seems level-headed
the doctor nodded thanks nellie
put that boy to bed and when i get back
ill have a look at him

  it was morning when walt carmack
awoke the shades on his bedroom win-
dows had been drawn to keep out the sun-
light his mother was sitting quietly by
his bed watching him qutside there

seemed to be only an unearthly silence

  walt still had the sick hard feeling in
the pit of his stomach that had been with
him the day before but it took him a couple
of minutes to remember why he felt so
bad then he sat up

  did they get billy mom

  his mother reached over and laid a
gentle hand on his billys dead she
said quietly he died last night on the
way home dr watson was with him and
he said there was nothing anyone could have
done-even from the first only a man
as strong and clean as billy could have
lasted as long as he did

  walt swallowed he ran a dry tongue
over suddenly drier lips but he couldnt
speak

  mrs carmack got up and went to the
door ill be in the kitchen walt she
said quietly

  walt lay still for a few minutes then
because the ache all inside of him seemed
suddenly too much to bear he got up and
put on his clothes and went outside the
wide yards of the big house the stone
foremans cottage and the bunkhouse were
all quiet and empty the whole place
seemed to him to have a funereal air

  but the sun was shining as brightly as
if yesterday a gay young redhead had not
been murdered in cold blood

  walt had known grief before-when his
father died but somehow that had been
a little different his father had been old
and sick for a long time they had known
he was going to die but now for the
first time in all his twenty-five years walt
had seen sudden death come to one who
was as young and full of life and laughter
as himself one who had been as close as
an own brother

  soon he would begin to think again about
the identity of the man on the gray horse
-he would begin to plan how to track
down the killer-but now there was only
this shocking sense of loss

  he saw lucy mcadams over on the
porch of the foremans cottage she had
a book in her lap but she didnt seem to
be reading she was sitting quietly with
her eyes raised to the distant blue outline
of the mountains

  obeying an irresistible impulse walt

carmacks feet carried him across the yard
toward her he had a sudden hope that
talking with her might somehow ease the
intolerable ache in his heart

  the girl saw him coming stood up sud-
denly took one step toward the door then
sank back in her chair again she waited
for him quietly with her hands clenched
tight around the book in her lap

  they told you-about billy

  i drove out with dr watson last
night

  walt sat down on the edge of the porch
i cant get over feelin it was my fault
there was two jobs to do i oughtnt to
have let him tackle the dangerous one

  the girl looked at him with a kind of
unwilling pity in her dark eyes then she
said quietly evenly

  billy sat up and spoke just before he
died he said walt-you hold the
straws then he sort of laughed-way
down in his throat-and died

  the girls voice died away into a whisper
wralt raised his head and even through his
foggy mind it seemed that she was looking
at him strangely accusingly

  walt she begged and her voice broke
now you didnt-you didnt draw straws
with him up there you didnt cheat him
and send him around the dangerous way
did you

  walt carmack looked at the girl in-
credulously he stood up you believe
that he asked

  what-what else could i believe
why i reckon you couldnt believe
anything else he said still in that gentle
patient voice

  he turned and left her walking now
with his shoulders a little straighter his
steps a little stiffer like a man determined
not to be beaten down by whatever blows
fate seemed resolved to hand him

  behind him on the porch lucy mc-
adams eyes suddenly and unexplainably
filled with tears she felt their warm
trickle down her cheeks and reached up a
fierce hand to wipe them off

  oh why did i say that she asked
herself half sobbing even if i thought
it even if i was sure of it why did i
have to say it

  millie harrell came to the screen door
misdeal



her eyes were red with weeping her face
white and haggard she looked at the cow-
boys tall lean back poor walt he
and billy were like brothers

  lucys face twisted as from an actual
physical pain millie why do i always
say and do the wrong thing

  the other girl came out and sat down
beside her we all do sometimes she
said steadily ive been thinking all
morning-maybe i ought to have married
billy when he asked me but i-i wasnt
good enough

  you not ood enough what non-
sense

   millie twisted impatiently

  you dont understand i mean-i
didnt love him enough and billy de-
served the best oh id probably have
married him some day if hed kept asking
me-because hed have let me stay on
here and look after susie and bob and
dad but that would have been just sec-
ond best what i really want to do is go
to denver and study music maybe my
voice isnt much good but ill never be
happy until i find out

  lucy laid her hand comfortingly over
the other girls brown work roughened
one

  susie will be old enough to take your
place here some day then you can go
millie shook her head

  no it was a crazy idea anyhow i
should have married billy susies only
twelve by the time shes old enough itll
be too late singers have too much to learn
to start at twenty-four or five

tt was nearly eleven oclock lights
were out in the foremans cottage and
the bunkhouse only one glowed in the
big house that one was in lucky jims
study

  walt unsaddled his sweat-caked and
weary horse and turned him in the corral
then went up to the house and pushed
open the door of the study

  old lucky jim was at his desk pour-
ing over a thick sheaf of bills and reports
he shoved them aside when walt en-
tered he was a thin old man almost as
tall as walt with a thin high-beaked nose
sharp steely blue eyes and a gentle mouth

that he tried to disguise under a sparse
white mustache

  any luck he asked his grandson
walt shook his head and threw his hat
down on the desk

  i went all over that whole damned
mesa with a fine-toothed comb but i
couldnt find a thing

  lucky jim picked up a paperweight and
fiddled with it for a moment finally he
said slowly almost reluctantly

gene chipman

  i aint been blind to whats been goin
on here under my nose ive seen how
fords been ridin you i know how he
feels about you you got any idea it was
him

  walt hesitated

  i dont know he said honestly he
sent us out on work that didnt really
need doin he knew which trail wed take
an he left the house here about two hours
before we did ridin that gray horse of
his that would have given him about
four hours extra before the santa fe train
out of oxville i wasnt able to find any-
body in either cosecha or oxville that saw
him that afternoon id sure like to know
where he spent that extra time but i
cant get over the idea that that hombre
up on the mesa wasn layin for us-that
we took him by surprise an he shot to
keep us from cornin close enough to rec-
ognize him

  the old man took off his glasses wiped


elsa barker

them carefully then stuck them back on
his nose

  i hope so he said fords been with
me a long time hes been a good man
an i would have sworn he was my good
friend too

  that mesa is on one of the state school
sections aint it

  lucky jim nodded

  i been wonderin if that bill thats be-
fore the legislature now had anything to
do with it

  i dont quite see how

  neither do i walt admitted wryly
its just a crazy idea did you find out
anything about whos pushin that bill
lucky jim shook his head not ex-
actly senator timmons from one of the
southern counties drew up the bill theres
a lot of potentially good farming land down
there that they can sell for a good price
while theyre only getting about ten cents
an acre on their yearly lease to stockmen
timmons said he understood there was
some of that kind of land on my range an
he thought the schools ought to have the
money so he included sections   
and  in my two townships but he
couldnt remember just where he had got-
ten the idea

  it was the same way with a lot of the
legislators i talked to they was in favor
of passin the bill as timmons introduced
it-but i couldnt trace the damn talk
down to who started it fords goin to
do what he can to get our two townships
knocked out of the bill if i have to buy that
land i will-although itd sure cramp my
style for a few years an it wouldnt do
the schools any good im payin them
more rent now than theyd get interest on
bonds

  just then the telephone rang shrilly

  ill answer it lucky jim said quick-
ly thatll be ford he was goin to
call me tonight an tell me what happened
to the bill

  the telephone was one of the wall crank
kind and he had to get up and cross the
room to answer it

  hello he said raising his voice the
way country folks usually do into a tele-
phone hello-ford yes-this is lucky
jim he listened a moment and grad-

ually a satisfied smile broke over his face
good work ford good night

he hung up a broad smile on his face
both houses passed it-after striking
out our townships the governors satis-
fied hell sign it as it is he told me
yesterday he would

  he yawned and stretched like a content-
ed happy cat

  guess i better be gettin to bed i got to
get up early in the mornin im startin
for mexico tomorrow

  walt grinned

  mexico momll sure raise ned about
the way youre tearin around like a young
blood these days

  the old man grinned back at him he
crossed the room and laid an affectionate
hand on his grandsons shoulder

  i wanted to send you walt i figgered
you might like to get away for a while
but gene wouldnt hear to it i reckon
hes been listenin to some of fords talk
about you bein a hell-raisin young good-
for-nothin however id have thought
hed like to get you out of the way so hed
have a clearer field with that little mc-
adams girl

  walts smile faded ive got a job to
do here he said ignoring that last crack
but whats gene got to do with it

  the old man scratched his head
reckon i never told you i borrowed
some money from the bank last year spec-
ulatin on a few more cattle i put em
on grass in mexico an from all reports
i been gettin theyre doin fine but genes
been gettin worried about them said hed
go himself an look em over if i couldnt get
away course i couldnt let him do that
gene may be a helluva smart banker but
he dont hardly know one end of a cow
from the other

  walt couldnt have told why he didnt
like the idea of his grandfather leaving just
then he had a vague hunch that the
events of the past two weeks were all tied
up together somehow-billys murder the
proposed sale of lucky diamond school
sections that had been almost but not quite
ordered by the legislature and now his
grandfathers sudden trip to mexico but it
was just a feeling he had no real reason
for connecting them and he knew it
misdeal



  old lucky saw his troubled look and
misunderstood it he thumped his shoul-
der again

  you get along with ford somehow un-
til i get back ill whittle on him then an
ill make him see reason or ill knock his
stubborn block off

  walt shook his head and smiled dont
worry about ford i can take anything he
can dish out

chapter v

ail for the lucky
diamond was deliv-
ered in one little tin
mail box about a mile
from the house the
mail carrier had a
long daily circuit to make and he came
early

  because millie harrell was the quick
capable sort of girl who never seemed to
need or even want another woman in the
kitchen lucy mcadams had gotten into
the habit of walking down to the mailbox
before breakfast by so doing she had
made a firm friend of old lucky jim he
liked his daily paper with his breakfast
for years he had walked down to the
mailbox himself but now that he was old-
er he found he didnt often have the en-
ergy although he kept about the hands
working for him he was the kind of a
man who wouldnt think of sending one of
them to do what he considered a trivial
personal errand

  this morning lucy had gotten up a lit-
tle earlier than usual lucky jim was leav-
ing today for mexico but probably he
would still have time to read the paper
with his breakfast

  outside the air was clear and sweet and
still a big white rooster stuck his bright
red comb out of the hen house door and
greeted first the sunrise then her the
big bay the girl had often seen walt
carmack ride shoved his satiny nose over
the corral fence and nickered softly this
reminder of walt carmack took away some
of the brightness of the morning for her
but she stepped out briskly determined
not to think any more about him cer-
tainly she wasnt going to let the memory

of the hurt she had inflicted spoil the
whole summer on the ranch for her

  she honestly hadnt suspected until the
day billy was killed that she was any-
thing more to walt carmack than just
another girl to tease but what she had
seen in his eyes for a moment on the
porch that day had frightened her the
way she had hurt inside afterward had
frightened her too she had come within
an inch of packing up and going back
home the next day but somehow she
hadnt

  and of course that would have been
foolish walt carmack wasnt like clark
bowles walt had kept his distance since
then when he had to talk to her he was
carefully polite he didnt tease her any
more if he had ever loved her she had
certainly killed that love and as for her-
self-maybe she had been just on the
verge of falling a little bit in love with
him but that was over now too it was
really easy to keep from falling in love if a
girl would just use her head

  but thinking about it arguing it all
over with herself wasnt making her feel
any better now she stepped along a lit-
tle brisker threw back her head and drew
in deep breaths of the crisp air sometimes
that helped

  a half-mile away she saw the mail car-
rier in his droop-sided rickety buggy pull
up to the mailbox he had the packet of
mail for the lucky diamond all ready and
the next minute his long-necked dun jiggle-
jogged on down the road

  a moment later-and lucy never could
figure out why she hadnt seen him before
because he must have been in plain sight
all the time-a horseback figure loped out
of the partial shadow of a couple of big
cottonwoods in the draw below the mail-
box he was riding a fast big black and
except that he wore an extraordinarily
large black stetson he looked at that dis-
tance like any of the lucky diamond
punchers

  for the moment she saw nothing par-
ticularly unusual about his actions then
she saw the red bandanna over his face
and remembered the mysterious rider who
had killed billy gamel she stopped dead
in her tracks her knees started shaking


elsa barker

and she wanted to run but she hated still
worse to turn her back and there was no-
where to hide

  the rider opened the mailbox appar-
ently sorting over the mail for a certain
piece she saw him select something tuck
it in his coat pocket then he lifted the
black into a fast lope that took him quickly
over the first little hill to the east

  if he had seen lucy at all he had given
no sign of it it had been too far away
for her to recognize him although she
thought she would have known most any
of the regular lucky diamond riders
even with a mask on

  she saw at once when she looked
through the mail that lucky jims morn-
ing paper was missing but a newspaper
seemed a queer thing to steal

  she left the mail at the big house and
went on over to the stone  cottage her
mind going like a coffee grinder she
knew she should tell someone what she
had just seen maybe it had some reason-
able explanation maybe it wasnt impor-
tant at all but she would have to tell some-
one but whom certainly not frail old
lucky jim just ready to start on his trip
to mexico that really left only walt
carmack and ford harrell-or possibly
millie

  but telling millie woud be just the same
as telling ford for of course the ranch
girl would go straight to her father about
it lucy liked and respected ford har-
rell but he had an irritating way of smil-
ing at things she said as if he thought she
were even younger than twelve-year-old
susie

  she hated the thought of seeking walt
carmack out yet he at least might listen
to her

  but when she went back to the big house
after breakfast mrs carmack told her
walt had already left for the day she
didnt know where he had gone probably
to cosecha but possibly as far as the coun-
ty seat at oxville

  lucky jim busy with last-minute prep-
arations for his trip to mexico didnt men-
tion having missed his newspaper and
lucy decided not to bother him by men-
tioning it

  she began to feel a little like a kitten

chasing its tail but once her mind was
made up she could be a determined per-
son it was a saturday and she was free
for the day so she saddled the gentle pinto
ford harrell had assigned her and rode
into cosecha

  she stopped first at the drugstore which
was the only place in the sleepy little town
that had a newsstand she ran her eye
quickly over the rack then spoke to the
soda jerker behind the fountain

  didnt the santa fe new mexicans
come in this morning

  yes maam they did but theyre sold
out one man bought em all about an
hour ago

  lucy tried not to look as startled as she
felt one man bought the whole bunch
for goodness sake who was he

  it was that greenhorn that used to
run around with some of the lucky dia-
mond punchers think he later got a job
as clerk of the legislature

  lucy stood perfectly still for a moment
then she took a long breath well
thanks she said in a small voice

  when she went outside again her heart
was pounding hard with anxiety what in
the world was clark bowles mixed up in
now the man she had seen this morn-
ing at the mailbox was a larger heavier-
shouldered man than clark she was sure
of that if sfie found walt carmack now
how much should she tell him and what
could be so terrifically secret in a public
newspaper 

  she stopped at the two general mer-
chandise stores but neither of them took
the santa fe daily then she thought of
the bank

  it had been open only a few minutes and
gene chipman had not yet come in he
had a big desk at right angles to the tellers
cages and his secretary was sorting the
mornings mail there now

  lucy spotted the paper she wanted
among the heap of other dailies she picked
it up

  miss bradley i wonder if i could bor-
row this ours didnt come this morn-
ing

  the secretary hesitated only for a sec-
ond she knew how much time gene chip-
man had been spending out at the lucky
misdeal



diamond the past few weeks and she
knew this slim dark-eyed girl was the
reason

  of course miss mcadams she said
cordially she motioned to the remaining
heap of papers mr chipman takes sev-
eral others he never reads them all

  lucy tucked the paper under her arm
and hurried out she wished suddenly
that she had thought to bring something
to carry it in now that she had it she
was a little afraid then she told herself
she was being silly clark bowles wouldnt
be mixed up in anything dangerous there
was no reason either for her to tie the
stolen newspaper up with billy gamels
death she was just spooky and nervous
that was all but she wished she could find
walt carmack in a hurry

  she stood for a moment in front of the
bank undecided where to go next cosecha
wasnt very big if walt was in town this
morning she certainly ought to find him
before long there was one saloon a res-
taurant a rooming house and the railroad
station besides the places she had already
been

  a big man in a well fitting dark suit
turned out of the saloon two doors down
the street saw her and came toward her
with a wide welcoming smile on his face

  lucy this is my lucky day were
you looking for me

  quite irrationally gene chipmans ar-
dent manner irritated the girl he was
everything she most admired in a man-
or so she had told herself repeatedly he
was very good looking steady and de-
pendable he had nice manners and he
owned a bank he never teased her and
he seemed to weigh each word she uttered
as if it were solid gold he was she now
decided a little too perfect and woman-
like she wanted to whittle him down

  her answering smile was cool i was
looking for walt carmack she said

  gene chipman wasnt visibly deflated
i havent seen him he said with that
ardent eager look still in his dark eyes
you werent looking for him in the bank
were you

  lucy brought the paper she had been
holding half behind her around in front
i stopped in to borrow this miss brad-

ley said you wouldnt mind loaning it
for just a moment it seemed to the girl
that there was a startled annoyed look in
his eyes but this morning lucy was in
the mood to be suspicious of everyone

  anything special you wanted to read
in it he asked casually

  lucy looked him in the eye i dont
know yet she said coolly

  he frowned but a moment later the
fatuous look came back to his eyes why
not stay in town a while and have lunch
with me ill drive you out in the buggy
this afternoon

  lucy shook her head eager to get away
from him thanks gene some other
day maybe i must find walt if i can and
then go home

  when she inquired further in cosecha
she learned that walt wasnt in town and
as far as anyone knew he hadnt been for
a couple of days so disappointed and
nervous she had nothing to do but ride
home again

chapter vi

he spent the rest of the day
pacing the house and yards
but at ten that night when she
finally went to bed walt still
had not returned

  she lay awake for a long
time her eyes fixed through her bedroom
window on the dark silent shadow of the
big house when along towards midnight
a light blinked on in one of the upstairs
bedrooms a little smile touched the corner
of her lips and her tense body relaxed
under the covers she watched the shadow
of a tall mans figure move about the room
for a minute or two but she had dropped
into a deep dreamless sleep before the
light went off

  she knew as soon as she awoke the next
morning that someone had been in her
room apparently looking for something
things werent disarranged much but
neither were they exactly as she had left
them

  lucy suddenly forgot all her fear and
nervousness of the day before and began
to get mad she jumped out of bed and
threw on the first clothes she could reach


elsa barker

  walt carmack was home this morning
and opened the door to her knock his
eyes were red-rimmed and tired-looking as
if he hadnt slept much

  walt can i talk to you a minute-
somewhere where we wont be overheard

  surprise showed in his eyes he mo-
tioned to the small room at one end of the
long living room here in lucky jims
office he said

  she didnt take the chair he pulled out
for her but paced restlessly around the
room for a moment her big dark eyes
burning with some strong emotion her
slim figure tense and wire taut

  wthats the matter lucy

  even in the state she was in lucys
heart gave an involuntary little leap at the
concern in his voice quickly she told him
all that had happened the day before

  walt listened the way she wanted him
to listen-not as if he thought she were a
schoolgirl spooked at her own shadow but
quietly without interrupting as if he be-
lieved her-

  and someone was in my room last
night while i was asleep she finished

  the cowboy put out a liand and touched
her shoulder he didnt bother you
lucy

  she shook her head i didnt even
wake up i guess i was pretty tired he
was looking for that newspaper

  did he find it

  a faint smile curved up the edges of
the girls lips

  he found a three-day-old one id left
lying on the table the other one id hid-
den under the mattress i dont know why
i did it i wasnt really expecting anyone
to try and steal it she drew the news-
paper from under her light leather jacket
i hope you can make more out of it than
i could i read every inch of it yesterday
but i couldnt find a thing to make such a
fuss about

  theres something in it all right walt
said and his confidence warmed the girl

  im in this too now youll let me
know what you find out wont you she
asked with an eagerness that surprised her-
self

  lucy mcadams couldnt quite under-
stand what was happening to her cer-

tainly she had never expected to get in-
volved in murder and intrigue or to be
shaken to the depths of her soul and lose
her appetite because of the hurt she had
seen in a tall cowboys eyes

  but walt carmack didnt seem to see
anything unusual about her interest a
smile warmed his tired eyes

  im as puzzled as you are but youve
earned the right to know whatever i find
out he paused as if hesitating to bring
the personal element into this talk finally
he said a little awkwardly thanks
lucy-for bringing this to me-instead of
someone else

  millie had breakfast on the table when
lucy got back to the little house she
toyed with a cup of coffee and a piece of
toast trying to make herself eat because
millie was watching her narrowly all the
while her insides were churning with im-
patience how long would it take walt
to read that newspaper how long would
it be before he would get around to tell-
ing her what he found of course if it
was important she couldnt expect him to
come busting right over to tell her first
and with their relations still on the strained
polite basis she could hardly go tagging
after him again to ask him

  it was important and walt did come
busting right over-but not to see her he
came walking into the kitchen while they
were still at breakfast he held the
crumpled newspaper in his hand and his
eyes fixed on ford harrell bleak with
anger

  ford i- he began and then stopped
seeming to be aware of the presence of the
women and children for the first time

  millie wras a quick-witted girl she stood
up susie you and lucy and bob go
in the front room for a few minutes youre
all through breakfast

  you too millie ford harrell said
quietly

  she shook her head from the looks
of things you two are going to need a
referee

  lucy adams turned at the door closed
it and came back to the table millie start-
ed to protest her staying then closed her
lips without speaking neither man looked
at her walts explosive anger seemed to
misdeal



have calmed a little but his face grew hard

  ford youve played lots of dirty mean
tricks in the last two years but i never
figgered you was an out an out liar and
crook

ford harrells florid face went redder
his thick neck seemed to swell with anger

  we better go outside he said theres
no use messin up a clean kitchen

  millie laid a hand on his arm it stopped
his path to the door but none of the rigid-
ity went out of the set of his shoulders

  most men tell a lie every now and
then walt the girl put in mildly whats
this one of dads thats got you so het up
he lied to lucky jim about that school
land bill they didnt take townships 
and  out of it

  thats a damned
lie ford harrell
said violently i
made the motion to
strike out them my-
self and there
werent a dozen votes
against it

  the very violence
of his denial was
somehow convincing

walt carmack
flipped the newspa-
per open on the table

  read that he
said pointing with
his forefinger its a notice of public sale
of certain school lands in the state-includ-
ing the school sections lucky jim leases
itll take eight sections of land right out
of the middle of our range-and the only
two good permanent springs on the whole
place	

  ford harrell read the long notice unbe-
lievingly then through once again

  well ill be damned he said slowly
and scratched his head thats what it
says all right but i know that bill was
passed with these townships  and  cut
out i know it i tell you im no fool-
an im no liar either

  the man was either a good actor or
he was telling the truth the anger slowly
faded out of walt carmacks eyes

its probably a newspaper misprint
millie harrell said sensibly whoever

fixed up that copy and sent it to the paper
must have somehow got ahold of the orig-
inal bill instead of the one that was
passed

  its no misprint walt said grimly
somebody went to too much trouble to
keep us from seein this notice for it to
be that kind of a misdeal

  ford harrell scratched his head again
i cant figger itout he said

  walt looked at the chunky foreman i
think i can he said slowly ford if
youre tellin it straight-an i can check
up on that later an find out if you aint-
that bill must have been doctored by some-
body after it was passed-but before it
was signed by the speaker of the house
the president of the
senate and the gov-
ernor you passed it
on the last day long
with several others
-an probably none
of them took time to
read each bill
through before he
signed

 ford harrell
shrugged

  well i cant see
as much harms
done if thats the
case all theyll have
to do is check over
the minutes of the legislature or ask any-
body who was there

  walt gave him a straight hard look
remember that story lucky jim likes
to tell about the clerk of the legislature
who made a little mistake in a bill some
years ago so that it read a measure to
regulate the butchering of dogs-instead
of hogs the supreme court held then
that nobody had authority to go behind the
signed and engrossed bill to correct it
ford harrell looked fussed and as de-
fensive as if he had been accused again
he rammed his hands fiercely down in his
pockets yeah i remember it

  walt looked at lucy lucy just how
well do you know clark bowles 

  the girls face was white and guilty
looking i-why i-ive known him all
my life he lived next door we were

in the first march

raised together but clark wouldnt do
anything like that he doesnt know one
township or one section from another
hed have no reason to

  not if there was a nice chunk of money
in it for him

  the girl caught her breath sharply re-
membering the things she knew about
clark bowles

  maybe he would she said unhappily
i-i guess i dont know what clark
would or wouldnt do

  walt carmacks eyes were hard now in
them the look slib had seen once before
you dont trust your friends much do
you lucy he asked almost gently

  walt please dont she begged and
was surprised to see his eyes soften as he
looked at her

  millie moved over and laid a comforting
arm around her shoulders well for
goodness sake walt she said irritably
arent you raising a big fuss about some-
thing thats really none of your business
suppose the milk is spilled and that lands
up for sale ive heard lucky jim say hed
buy it if he had to so what

  lucky jims in mexico five hundred
miles away by now walt reminded her
grimly an somebody took good care
that he didnt see this paper yesterday
momin-or that i didnt sec it while there
was still a chance of callin him back

  i think youre nuts ford harrell told
him bluntly lucky jims going to be
back in a week or ten days that land
cant be sold until its been advertised in
the paper for considerably longer than
that

  i hope youre just dumb ford walt
said and his voice was edged with a dis-
like and distrust he made no attempt to
conceal i hope thats the reason you keep
try in to make me think everythings go-
ing to be fine and dandy-because i aint
convinced

  ford harrells bushy brows met over his
nose in a frown he colored at the bite
in the cowboys voice

  what you mean 

  i mean walt said speaking slowly
and picking his words carefully some-
bodys trying to grab him a swatch of
lucky diamond land he shot billy gamel

when we caught him surveying on the
mesa to keep us from recognizing him an
tipping his hand he bribed clark bowles
to change a bill the legislature had passed
now if lucky dont get back in time he
can bid in that land for whatever price
he wants to pay it aint likely therell be
anyone else want it located as it all is
clear inside our pastures

  i dont think hell stop at kidnappin
or- he hesitated and his voice went a
little husky-even another murder to
keep lucky jim away he turned sud-
denly on the stocky foreman ford god
help you if youre not on the level ill
twist your neck off an feed you to the
buzzards if you try any monkey business
while im tryin to run this killer to earth-
an get my grandfather back here

  ford harrell was a quick-tempered
man and jealous of his authority he
couldnt take that the way it was intended-
he couldnt swallow his pride and remem-
ber the worry and grief that colored the
cowboys actions and words these days

  you an who else he asked mocking-
ly before you take me on you better
find you a friend to flip coins with an get
to do your dirty work

 lucy mcadams and millie harrell
gasped audibly walt carmacks face
turned white his right fist swung sud-
denly upward ford harrell didnt have
time to dodge and he took the blow straight
on his square stubborn chin it rocked him
back on his heels

  walt carmack turned toward the door
his hand on the knob he turned and looked
at lucy you know where i can find
clark bowles

  the girl looked at him with wide un-
happy eyes she shook her head i-i
havent seen him but once since he went
to santa fe but i heard he was in cosecha
yesterday morning

chapter vii

u c y mcadams
woke up with a start
fear gave her a sud-

der her breastbone
she lay still for a mo-
ment listening every muscle rigid then
misdeal



finally screwed up enough courage to sit
up in bed the noise that had awakened
her had seemed to come from the window
the room was light with moonlight but
she could see nothing except the familiar
shadows of the rooms furniture

  slowly she eased back against her pil-
low and after staring wide-eyed at the
square outline of the window her muscles
relaxed and her heart stopped pounding so
hard

  ordinarily she wras a sound sleeper but
lately she had been jumpy and restless
everyone on the ranch was jumpy walt
carmack had been gone for three weeks
and no one not even his mother had heard
from his since hed left neither had they
heard from his grandfather

  finally the girl sighed turned over on
her side and closed her eyes a moment
later a shadow that had been crouching
behind the big arm chair moved stealthily
across the room

  the floor creaked once before he reached
the bed and the girls eyes flew open again
the next instant a hand clamped roughly
down over her mouth another hand
pressed tight against her shoulder

  the girls slim body arched like the
body of a fighting cat she struck with
all her strength at the hands that held her
the man leaned closer and spoke softly
in her ear

  its clark

  the girl stopped struggling

  lord lucy youre hard to wake up
i tossed chunks of dobe at your window
for an hour i thought id wake everyone
on the place but you if i take my hand
away you promise not to yell

  she nodded youve got no business
in here she said indignantly when she
could speak why didnt you speak to me
from the window i was awake i dont
see-

  the hand came down over her mouth
again dont talk so damn loud he
growled in her ear i didnt speak when
you sat up because i knew youd yell

  the hand over her mouth wasnt quite
so tight this time she jerked her head
away

  clark bowles you stop that or i will
yell now what do you want

  i want to talk to you get something
on and come outside

  lucy hesitated only a moment all
right

  she slipped on a kimono and shoes and
climbed out the window after him she
looked uneasily around knowing that in
the bright moonlight they might be seen
from a dozen different windows on the
place

  clark where have you been every-
bodys been looking for you

  clark bowles laughed shortly dont be
an idiot lucy ive been hiding what
you suppose i hung around half the night
for waiting till everyone was in bed be-
fore i wroke you up

  the girls heart sank the things they
were saying about him were true then
for a moment she was torn with indecision
pulled by a sense of loyalty to the new
friends she had made here as well as affec-
tion for this weak-willed man she had
known since she was a tiny girl

ford harrell

  he pulled uneasily at her arm lets
walk down the road a piece this damn
place is all eyes and ears

  lucy looked up at the protecting shadow
of the big house at the blank black square
that was walt carmacks bedroom window
but walt wasnt here now she couldnt
ask him what to do out in the corral a
horse stomped his foot then except for
the raucous croaking of a lonesome old


elsa barker

frog out by the horse trough everything
on the big ranch was still lucy shivered
only partly with the chill of night remem-
bering everything that had happened here
in the past few months

  only as far as the horse trough she
objected no one can hear us from
there

  but they can see us my gosh lucy
with that white nightgown sticking out
from under your kimono you might as
well get out here and play a drum
lucy shrugged i dont care who sees
us she told him coolly im not trying to
hide anything

  to her surprise he gave in okay
honey he said softly as they walked along
whatever you say goes with me from
now on im a reformed character i
havent taken a drink since the night i got
here i havent bet a penny on anything
in over two months and ill keep it up
if youll come away with me marry me to-
morrow ive got money in the bank now
lucy stopped in her tracks wthere
did you get it

  he couldnt quite look at her he patted
her shoulder why i saved the most
of my pay in santa fe you dont need to
worry lucy i give you my word of hon-
or i havent been gambling again

  its true then the girl said quietly
you took money for changing the official
copy of a bill the legislature passed these
folks here were good to you clark they
got you a good job they gave you a chance
-and you sold them out

  he caught her by the shoulders lucy
how can you think a thing like that of
me

  but his words rang hollow and he seemed
to know it i cant believe anything else
can i she asked quietly and remembered
with a sharp little pang when she had said
those same words to another man

  clark bowles took a long breath no
i guess you cant because its true i did
take a bribe but lucy  wasnt quite as
low as you think me i didnt know that
bill had anything to do with the lucky
diamond and i wanted the money for
you i thought maybe if i had a thousand
dollars again that youd go back home
with me

  i never told you i wanted money did

i

  he sensed the iron in her will and the
contempt in her voice broke him com-
pletely

  lucy im scared now he sounded
like the little boy she had played cops and
robbers with when she was seven i-
i was a fool a man can always see that
after its too late he gave me the money-
and he was my good friend until after i
changed the wording in that law for him
now hes afraid maybe ill get drunk some
day and tell on him hes cruel hes
ruthless-and im in his way now and
its just as bad here on the lucky dia-
mond walt carmack would kill me on
sight for what i did

  lucy put her hand on his arm walts
not like that besides hes away now you
dont need to be afraid of him

  he only shook his head and she recog-
nized the familiar signs of a stubborness
that wouldnt yield to reason

  who were you talking about a minute
ago clark who bribed you to change
that bill

  he shivered and looked uneasily over
his shoulder i couldnt tell you that
lucy hed kill you too

  dont be silly nobody could hear us
out here

  but he only shook his head in that stub-
born frightened way

  ive got to go away lets go to-
night lucy we could be married in trin-
idad in the morning then as he saw
her start to shake her head if youll
come with me as soon as were out of the
state ill write a letter-to walt carmack
or old lucky jim or anybody else you
want ill tell them everything

  she looked at him pitying him for the
frightened state he was in pitying him
for his weakness feeling a strong pull to-
ward him because he needed her

  i dont love you any more clark she
said as gently as she could thats all
over-for good

  not for good he protested fervently
he reached for her again but she stepped
back and he let his hands fall to his sides
ill make you love me again lucy ill
do everything you say ill never look at
misdeal



a whiskey bottle or a deck of cards again
ive learned my lesson im ready to-
what he was ready to do lucy mcadams
never learned for the next instant there
was the sharp crack of a shot from some-
where in the dark mass of low buildings
that made up the barns bunkhouse and
gear shed lucy screamed

  clark bowles gave a strangled little cry
and whirled around on one heel there
was surprise in his face for a moment
then as he turned his head toward her
even in the moonlight lucy could see the
terror grow in his eyes

  i-im shot lucy he gasped i-
another bullet whistled past their heads
so close that lucy thought she felt hot
awind fan her cheek clark bowles start-
ed running queerly awkwardly bent over
like an old man one hand pressed against
his side

  lucy was still terrified but suddenly her
own fear didnt seem important she ran
up alongside and slipped an arm through
his

  lean on me she said breathlessly
wheres your horse

  she heard a door slam in the big house
and a second later sounds in the bunk-
house and she tried to hurry their pace
a little

  clark bowles spoke through clenched
teeth my horse is right ahead behind
those cottonwoods

  he sagged heavily against the girl but
somehow she kept him on his feet and
running there were no more shots from
behind and she guessed that the commotion
in the bunkhouse had frightened off the
would-be killer

  clarks little mexican pony snorted wind-
ily as they approached him suddenly out of
the darkness but he stood still while lucy
helped the wounded man into the saddle

  she heard boot heels thumping the
ground from the direction of the big house
and her hands were shaking with the urgent
need for haste as she handed the reins to
the man in the saddle but she held onto
the bridle a moment longer

  clark tell me where youll be ive
got to see you again

  he was leaning low over the saddle horn
and for what seemed minutes he didnt

answer the footsteps from the house were
coming closer she struck his knee fiercely
with her fist

  clark answer me hurry

  he raised his head and looked at her
dazedly i-ive been hiding-its an old
adobe house-down close to the river-
about five miles-southwest

  ill bring you food and medicine now
hang on i

  she hit the horse smartly on the rump
with the palm of her hand he whirled
and shuttled off through the cottonwoods
that rimmed the north yard

  lucy ran back toward the house it had
suddenly occurred to her that one of these
men racing toward her might easily be the
would-be killer she had no real coherent
thought of what she was doing she only
knew that she must somehow protect clark
bowles and keep them from following him
tonight their own footsteps were making
so much noise it wasnt likely they would
hear the sound of his running horse and
with the long row of double cottonwoods
between them and the man ahorseback she
didnt think they could see him

  she ran almost straight into the arms of
the tall man in the lead before she saw that
it was walt carmack she stopped abrupt-
ly her mind spinning dizzily

  walt i didnt know you were back
then suddenly the reaction to the hor-
ror of seeing a man shot got to her her
knees went weak and shaky and to her own
dismay she felt tears streaking down her
cheeks a big sob came from her throat

  walt carmack put his arm around her
and let her cry against his shoulder vague-
ly she was aware of the murmur of other
mens voices around and after a moment
she raised her head

  what happened lucy walt asked
his voice sharply urgent

   her knees still felt as if they were made
of jelly but her mind was working again
another stifled sob choked her and she
wiped her eyes on her handkerchief fight-
ing for an extra moment of time to decide
what to tell him

   she couldnt tell him where clark bowles
hiding place was with all these other men
listening besides it wouldnt do any good
to send walt after him clark was afraid


elsa barker

of the tall cowboy and hed never tell him
anything she knew suddenly that the task
of finding who was behind all the trouble
on the lucky diamond had fallen on her
own slender shoulders

  she looked up at walt

  i was restless and couldnt sleep so i
got up and came for a walk somebody shot
at me i thought i saw a man on a gray
horse out by the corrals i think he went
that way she pointed vaguely then real-
ized too late that her story had been a little
too glib too made up walt carmack was
looking at her queerly he turned to the
other men

  slim you and spike get horses and ride
the east road-fast rusty and jug take the
southeast ill take this one lucys heart
gave a sudden frightened thump when he
motioned to the road that led past the dou-
ble line of cottonwoods then with relief
she remembered that by the time walt had
a horse saddled clark would have a good
headstart and even with moonlight it was
impossible to see very far

  millie harrells slim shivering figure ap-
peared in the darkness behind them she
had thrown a light wrap over her night-
gown but the chill night air was cutting
around the edges

  for goodness sake w-w-whats g-g-go-
ing on out here she chattered

  walt turned to her millie wheres
ford

  she gave him a blank look why i dont
know he went to t-t-town this afternoon
s-s-said he might not be back till late and
i g-g-guess he isnt or hed be out here too

  the other hands had started for the cor-
rals walt paused a moment longer

  millie you take lucy in the house and
keep her there till i get hack you better
lock the doors there seems to be a prowl-
er around tonight

chapter viii

ucy was docile
enough about the stay-
ing indoors until she
was sure the men were
out of the yards then
she went to work on
millie millie loved excitement herself and

she was dead set against taking any mans
orders unless she had to the only trouble
was that millie wanted to go along

  lucy adopted her most schoolteacherish
authoritative manner

  look millie clark knows something
ive got to find out and he wont tell any-
body but me he wouldnt even tell me if
there was anyone else along

   to her surprise the tall girl gave in grace-
fully okay honey its your show i
wont spoil it for you but you better take
my gun-and for goodness sake be careful
if anvthing happens to you waitll take my
headoff

  not more than half an hour after the men
had gone the little foremans cottage was
dark again millie was back in bed and
lucy with a bundle of food medicine and
bandages tied on behind was in the saddle
heading out the southwest road she had
only the vaguest idea of how to find the
adobe house clark had told her about mil-
lie could have doubtless given her accurate
directions but much as she loved the ranch
girl she couldnt quite trust her with such
an important secret millie was friendly
and talkative she was perfectly capable of
spilling the beans to exactly the wrong per-
son

  lucy followed the road for about a mile
until she remembered that walt carmack
had come this way a little while earlier
anyhow the road wouldnt take her all the
way to the abandoned adobe shack where
clark was hiding so she cut across the
open toward the river if she followed the
river downstream sooner or later she would
come to the cabin

  it sounded simple but she found that
there were little mexican farms scattered
along the river with many fences and
barbed-wire gates a half-dozen times
warned by the barking of dogs that some
place was inhabited she had to make a wide
detour several times she thought she heard
hoofbeats behind her but when she stopped
to listen she could hear nothing but the
heavy breathing of her own horse here
with cornfields patching the river bottoms
big old cottonwoods shading the farm yards
and lucky diamond herefords grazing on
the open range outside the fences she
couldnt tell whether any of the shadowy
misdeal



figures in the distance might be a man on
horseback or not

  it frightened her and almost made her
turn back to think that she might be leading
the killer straight to clark bowles but
clark was wounded badly she thought
hed need food and medicine and somebody
to look after him and if he should die off
here by himself nobody might ever know
who had killed billy gamel who had bribed
clark to change the school lands bill or
who had fired the shot at him out of the
darkness tonight

  she glanced worriedly at the moon in
another hour it would be dawn and then it
would be still another hour until daylight
she kicked her horse into a lope she could
never find the right place without moon-
light and she didnt want to give clark
away by stopping at any of these other
houses to ask

  then suddenly as she rounded a little
knoll she saw the flat-topped adobe hut
nestled in a little hollow closer to the river
than any of the other farm houses had been
as she crossed the yard and her horses
hoofs kicked up bits of driftwood and flood-
water rubble she knew why the house had
been abandoned

  a saddled horse left in the yard with his
reins dragging nickered to her anxiously

  she sat for a moment looking about her
warily before she dismounted at the top
of the gradual rise of the river bank beyond
the house she could see the faint shadows of
several wthite-faced cattle they seemed to
be grazing undisturbed otherwise there
was no movement anywhere

  she slipped off her horse by the front
door it was open but for a moment her
eyes accustomed to the moonlight outside
could see nothing but blackness through the
doorway

  clark she called softly

  there was no answer only a rustling
sound that might have been a rat or the
stirring of a body

  she thought again then for a moment
that she heard the distant sound of horses
steps approaching but when she turned her
head and listened she decided it was only
the heavy pounding of her own heart

  she flicked on her flashlight splayed a
stream of light through the doorway then

circled it around the room she held it a
moment on the tumbled heap of clothes
blankets and com shucks that had been
serving as a bed saw that he was not there
then brought the light on around

  he was lying on the bare floor close to
the wall just to the side of the door not
a yard from where the girl stood appar-
ently he had fallen there and been too weak
or too sick to crawl over to the bed

  his eyes were open following the light
with a wild frightened sick look in them

lucky jim

he suddenly flung an arm up over his eyes
and groaned oh god  dont-

  clark the girl said softly dont be
afraid its lucy

  he slid the arm warily half off his eyes
as if he couldnt believe her lucy
yes ive brought you some food and
medicine ill stay with you and take care
of you until youre able to ride again

  i didnt think youd come i didnt think
you cared enough-any more she knelt
beside him and he reached out and caught
her hand i was laying here thinking i
was going to die and i was lonesome-
and afraid pm glad you came lucy

  at the lost forlorn tone in his voice lucy
wanted to put her head down and cry cry
for the far-away days when this boy had
been all the world to her now she had
grown up and away from him and he was
still a wilful little boy sick and lost and
afraid

  she rubbed cool fingers gently over his


elsa barker

forehead dont be afraid she said again
youre not alone any more

   then as she said that she heard her horse
nicker softly through the open doorway
she saw him put up his head and look at the
rise behind the house

  her heart turned cold within her while
her fingers continued their soothing motion
on his hot head so she had led the killer
to him after all

  clark had heard the horse too he tried
to raise his head to look through the door
someone coming lucy

  with a pang of pity and maybe a little
of shame she heard the terror in his voice
she patted his shoulder reassuringly

  maybe she said sturdily but dont
worry i have a gun its dark in here and
light outside i wont let them hurt you
she heard the sound of stealthy footsteps
on the rocky rubble outside and reached for
her gun it took her a long moment to get
it out of the holster for she was both un-
accustomed to and deathly afraid of it she
crawled over to the side of the door on
her hands and knees and waited

  it never occurred to her at that moment
to marvel that the girl crouching here in the
dark of an old abandoned hut waiting to
kill if need be an unknown enemy was the
same girl as the cool and superior lucy mc-
adams who had come west three months
ago hating all violence and rough living

   she heard coarse gravel grind together as
the man at the other corner of the house
shifted his weight from one foot to the oth-
er her gun was up now the hammer back
her finger steady on the trigger

   ive got you covered she said calmly
of course she hadnt but in the stories shed
read thats what they always said come
out from behind the corner of the house or
ill let you have it

  the noise that she heard then sounded
suspiciously like a chuckle

  lucy it was walt carmacks voice
clark bowles gave a little smothered cry
of fear and tried to struggle to his feet only
to sprawl headlong on the floor again lucy
let her gun arm drop as the cowboy came
around the corner of the house

  oh walt her cry was both a pro-
test and an accusation why did you fol-
low me here

  is it clark bowles in here with you
she hesitated then knew it was useless
to lie yes hes bad hurt walt

  ill get our saddle blankets and string
them over the windows then well have
a light an look at him

  at his matter-of-fact voice some of the
strain eased out of the girls taut muscles
now that he was here there was relief and
a feeling of security in his solid presence

  by the aid of her flashlight lucy found
a couple of candle remnants and lighted
them clark bowles seemed to have fainted

  they plumped up his corn shuck bed
straightened the only blanket on it then
walt carried the wounded man over and
laid him on it lucy watched while the
cowboy cut off the blood-soaked shirt and
examined the wound

  how bad is it she asked anxiously
walt carmack looked at her and shook
his-head it looks ugly to me he said
but i dont know much about such things
well do what we can for him tonight in
the morning you can go for doc watson
and a buckboard ill stay here with him
you mean youre really going to turn
him in then

  walt looked at her in astonishment
why of course he said then as he
saw stubbornness grow in her eyes he
added more persuasively dont you see
that its the only thing to do lucy hurt
like he is we cant keep him hidden here
long hes got neighbors within a mile on
two sides its a wonder they havent seen
him and told about it before this weve
got to get him to tell us whos after him
then well take him to the hospital and keep
him under guard until this is settled its
the only thing i can do

  the girl looked down at the unconscious
man he was breathing with a harsh rasp-
ing sound in his throat and when she
touched his forehead it felt hot and feverish

  taking him to town probably meant a
prison sentence for him he deserved it of
course but she kept remembering how when
he was a kid hed always wanted to play
the cop-the tough hard-boiled cop who
always got his man and now the tables
were turned

  she met walt carmacks eyes youre
right of course
misdeal



  the cowboy reached a hand to her across
the body of the wounded man

  i told you once that you werent very
loyal to your friends id like to take that
back

  lucy felt hot tears spring to her eyes
you-you love him dont you walt
asked her gently

  she raised her eyes to meet his in a
way-i guess ill always love him she
said slowly

  what way lucy walt insisted gent-
ly the girl flushed and tried to draw her
hand away but his fingers tightened and
held it

  we were going to be married

  were not are lucy

  she shook her head

  i knew he was drinking and gambling
a lot but i thought maybe hed change after
we were married then my father gave us
a thousand dollars to buy furniture clark
got into a poker game one night and lost
it all somehow that was the last straw
i didnt want to marry a man id always
have to be ashamed of-to make excuses
for i broke the engagement and came
west you know the rest

  no wonder you didnt like my foolin
an bettin an teasin walt carmack said
softly ive been a heel lucy shall we
start over and be friends

  she nodded id like that

  when the cowboy got up to start a fire
in the rusty old iron stove in one cprner
of the room she asked him youve been
to mexico walt

  yes

  did you find your grandfather

  he shook his head

  he never got to the ranch down there
at all he disappeared off the train some-
where between juarez and guzman i
couldnt find a trace of him but i some-
how dont believe hes dead i decided id
try working from this end a w-hile clark
can tell me whos back of all this-if we
can get him conscious for a few minutes
you know eight sections of the ranch
are being sold at public auction next satur-
day

  he nodded

  ive been keepin track of the time all
right but that didnt seem as important

as findin lucky jim besides there aint
nothin i can do about that or if there is
i aint thought of it yet ive got no way
of gettin at any of my grandfathers money
my mother and i between us could raise
maybe a couple thousand dollars-which
wouldnt be anywhere near enough who-
ever wants that land bad enough to kill for
it will be biddin high

  as they talked neither of them had no-
ticed that a corner of one of the saddle blan-
kets had slipped off the window walt set
a bucket of river water on the rickety stove
to heat while lucy laid out the medicine
kit she had brought with her

  there was one great triangular chunk
broken out of the window-pane lucy
turned just in time to see the ugly snout
of a sixgun poked through it and behind it
pressed close to the window the masked
face of a man

  she dropped to her hands and knees and
yelled at the cowboy walt look out
the window

  the sixgun spoke and walt carmack
whirled his own pistol clearing leather as
he turned

  but already the face at the window was
gone the cowboy took one look at the
man on the bed and knew when he saw
the round red splotch on his temple that
there was nothing anybody could ever do
now for clark bowles

  he looked at the girl you afraid to
stay here by yourself

  she was but she was too proud to admit
it she swallowed once

  no i-i have my gun

  good girl blow out the light and guard
the door like you did before i came i wont
be gone but a few minutes if i dont get on
his trail theres no danger

  outside a big yellow ball of a moon
seemed to be resting ort the western horizon
in a few minutes it would be gone but
there was still light enough to see the rump
of a tall grayish horse going up the rise
back of the house

  walt swung into the saddle and gave his
bay the spurs the bay was one of the
strongest and fastest in the lucky diamond
string but the horse ahead was fast too
for what seemed to walt long minutes he
kept the distance between them even the


elsa barker

cowboy threw a glance over his shoulder at
the moon it was halfway down now

  the man on the gray was far enough
ahead that he could easily give walt the
slip once it was dark if walt were going
to catch him he would have to do it quick

  walt dug his spurs in a little deeper
leaned low in the saddle and brought the
end of his lariat down sharply over the
horses rump the bay seemed to have been
saving an extra little spurt of speed he
stretched his neck and gave it now

  for another moment the distance between
the horses seemed to hold then gradually
it lessened -the man ahead tossed a quick
shot behind from under his arm walt kept
on coming

  but now the light was beginning to dim
walt estimated the distance between the
two horses and judged that he was within
sixgun range suddenly he yanked the bay
to a sliding stop jumped from the saddle
took a second for a careful aim and pulled
the trigger

  the gray stumbled went down on one
knee the rider catapulted over his neck
to manage somehow to light squatting on
his feet

  the gray horse was back on his feet the
next instant walt held his next shot wait-
ing for the man to show behind the snort-
ing lunging horse instead of trying to
remount the cowboy saw that the man was
headed on a dead run for a cornpatch not
more than a dozen steps to his right

  walt fired again and saw the man duck
lower as he ran the cowboy swore and
pulled his sight down a fraction but this
time when he pulled the trigger it was only
at a dim swaying motion within the black
leafy shadow of a patch of head-high mexi-
can corn

  a bullet suddenly whistled past walts
ear instinctively he dodged then dived for
the field himself another bullet blood-
branded the skin of his left arm then by
stooping a little he was within the rustling
black shelter himself

  the long green ribbons of sharp-edged
corn leaves cut at his face like whips as he
ran but he was scarcely aware of the sting
another bullet cut a cornstalk above his
head and he stopped abruptly

  he took a long breath and listened

ahead and off to the right he heard the man
crashing through the corn walt fired at
the sound the noise stopped-so abruptly
that for a long tense moment he wondereji
if he had been lucky enough to score a hit
he took a cartridge out of his belt and
tossed it a dozen feet to the right instantly
a shot answered the rustling thud it made

  checkmate he thought he eased
back on his heels and settled down to a
long wait he swore and then grinned to
himself in the darkness it wouldnt be
long until dawn and when it was light
enough to see through the corn this business
would be finished-one way or the other

  but presently a breeze rustled through
the corn loud enough to drown out any
noise of movement walt dropped to all
fours and started crawling slowly between
two rows then suddenly somewhere too
near for comfort there rose the heart-chill-
ing whir-r-r of a rattler with the instinc-
tive reaction of a man bom and raised in
rattlesnake country walt carmack made
a wide high jump to one side

   instantly from out of the blackness ahead
of him a sixgun blazed a sudden searing
pain tore through the cowboys leg as the
force of the bullet spun him to the ground
a cornstalk somehow jarred his  out of
his hand as he fell in the few precious sec-
onds he spent feeling frantically for it he
heard the man crashing off through the
corn away from him when he found the
gun again it was too late to shoot and he
knew it

   he lay still for a moment silently curs-
ing his own bad luck and the pain in his
knee then he remembered lucy mcadams
crouching alone and frightened in a dark
abandoned cabin with a dead man for com-
pany the cabin was close enough so that
she would undoubtedly have heard the shots
and be frantic with fear and worry he
must somehow manage to get back to her

   he tried to get to his feet but the knee
gave way with him and he fell again in-
voluntarily and because he thought he was
alone where no one could hear he groaned
with the sheer agonizing pain of it

   a soft voice called to him from the edge
of the corn behind him wralt

   he sat up disbelieving his ears lucy
my gosh girl what are you doing here 
misdeal



  following you of course

   he heard her sob a little then as she came
running through the corn toward him and
the note of exquisite relief in her voice was
music to his ears

chapter ix

alt carmack
looked sourly at the leg
stretched out in front
of him on the hassock
and swathed in layer
upon layer of bandage
gauze and splints then at the pair of crutch-
es propped by the side of his chair

  tonight he was not feeling very well
pleased with himself he had done the best
he could and been outwitted at every turn
day after tomorrow ejght separate sections
nearly all of them right in the heart of
lucky diamond range would be sold at
public auction it would ruin the ranch
but there was nothing he could do to stop
the sale the law was clear enough on that
score

  he hadnt money enough himself to buy
them in for lucky jim-if indeed his grand-
father was still alive he didnt even have
anything he could offer as security to bor-
row the money

  and while he might be morally certain
that the man who would be bidding on that
land saturday morning was the same man
who had killed billy gamel and first bribed
and then killed clark bowles he couldnt
actually produce any convincing proof of
that either certainly not the kind of proof
that talks to a jury

  his mother stopped by the open door-
way ford wants to talk to you a minute
son

  the stocky foreman came into the room
walt turned his head and motioned to a
chair near the fireplace

  sit down ford

  the foreman looked at the cowboy with
eyes as full of cold dislike as ever he sat
down uncomfortably on the edge of a
straight chair if i was sure lucky jim
was dead an this ranch was yours i
wouldnt give a damn what happens to it
he began bluntly

  walt grunted did you come over here
to tell me that he asked

  not exactly i just wanted to set you
straight to begin with-thats all he sat
back a little firmer in his chair but i
aint sure lucky jims dead an hes been
a mighty good friend to me ive got a little
money saved-not a lot just a few thousand
dollars enough to bid in that piece of land
that holds the ojo feliz spring hes always
set so much store by maybe if that dont
come too high another section too an
slim reynolds has got some money saved
he figgers on bidding on the clearwater
springs piece if lucky jim comes back
he can have it for just what we pay for it

  walt was looking at him steadily an
if lucky dont come back he asked

  ford harrell met his eyes unflinchingly

  if lucky dont come back i know im
out on my ear anyhow i figger ojo feliz
will make just as good a place to start up
a little spread of my own as any place i
aint heard slim express himself on that
score

  walt studied the man who had never
made any bones about hating his guts his
mind was going in circles again since the
very first his suspicions had seesawed back
and forth between two men ford harrell
had been absent from the ranch last night
when clark bowles was shot there were
still those four unexplained hours between
the time he should have arrived in oxville
and the time his train left for santa fe the
afternoon billy gamel was shot

  now ford harrell was planning to buy
the ojo feliz land slim reynolds the
clearwater springs area for the first time
walt began to see that the auction might
not even tell him anything perhaps there
would be a half-dozen different bidders for
a half-dozen different sections was it one
particular section the killer wanted  and if
so why could there be oil or valuable
minerals on one of these plots of land  or
was the killer planning to bid in the whole
works hoping to cut up the lucky diamond
range so that old lucky jim would eventu-
ally be forced to sell him all of it

  he stood up on his good leg and tucked
his crutches under his arms

  thanks for telling me ford he said
with an effort keeping his voice cool will
you have one of the boys saddle a horse for
me youve given me an idea anyhow 


elsa barker

  in the saddle almost constantly the next
twenty-four hours walt carmack was re-
paid for the almost constant pain in his
wounded leg by learning as he had never
fully realized it before the value of friend-
ship and the importance in the range coun-
try of a reputation for honesty and fair
dealing

  stopping alike at humble homestead
shacks and big ranch spreads he found
them all ready to lend the last cent of their
savings to help old lucky jim sanderson
out of a jam-from the jxor nester on the
rio fritos who took a dollar and twenty
cents out of an old baking powder can and
offered it to him to old johann christersen
who had the reputation of being so tight he
squeaked when he walked but who never
batted an eyelash at pledging ten thousand
dollars to save the lucky diamond ranch
of his neighbor

  walt wrote them all down in a little black
notebook and by the time he turned into his
own front yard a little after midnight fri-
day he had something over fifty thousand
dollars pledged with the chance of another
fifteen or twenty thousand coming from the
letters he had written to ranchers who lived
too far away to reach in one days horse-
back circuit it should be enough at least
it was he thought more than the land was
actually worth-and probably all lucky
jim could afford to pay

  late as it was there was still a light in
ford harrells cottage the piano was go-
ing and he stopped a minute to listen to
millie harrells sweet true soprano out
by the bunkhouse a dog barked insistently
until walt was close enough to speak to
him

  he unsaddled his horse and as he turned
him into the corral he heard the kitchen
door of the cottage open and then close a
girl in a white dress came hurrying across
the yard toward him

  walt it was lucy mcadams voice
soft yet with a strong undercurrent of ex-
citement in it

  what is it lucy

  conje in the house with me ive some-
thing to show you

  with any other girl he might have been
a little impatient he was tired and the

broken bone in his leg ached abominably
from the punishment of long hours in the
saddle but he had realized for some time
now that when this girl wanted anything
of him she would get it one way or another
he followed her obediently

  at the kitchen door she stopped for a
moment

  youve got your gun loaded he
nodded and she added i made ford and
millie stay up i hoped youd be home be-
fore long

  more mystified than ever walt followed
her across the kitchen millie harrell wras
singing again now but she stopped when
the living-room door opened and she heard
the click of walts crutches in the doorway

  the broad-shouldered man sitting beside
her on the piano bench turned his head
then with a slowly whitening face he
stood up walt carmack swore half under
his breath in sudden surprise then very de-
liberately stood his right crutch against the
wall so that his right arm hung handy to
his gun

  for a long moment he and gene chip-
man stared at each other across the width
of the room and for once the handsome
bankers poise wras considerably shaken

  ford and millie harrell looked from one
to the other in blank astonishment

  it looks like you and me have been run-
nin through the same cornpatch gene
walt said quietly i sorta suspected you
all the time but that talk of yours about not
ever bein able to ride a horse had me
fooled

  gene chipman swallowed once then
shrugged i havent any idea what youre
talking about he said coolly i havent
been on a horse in twenty years

  walts smile was grim he touched his
own face that was crisscrossed with a score
of thin skin-deep scratches on gene chip-
mans cheeks and forehead the pattern was
different but it looked as if the same instru-
ment had carved a spider-web of clean fine
cuts

  i got these scratches runnin through
green corn the other night walt explained
patiently more for ford harrells benefit
than any other reason i was chasin a
murderer but he got away-then  
misdeal



clark bowles

  he heard ford and millie gasp but he
kept his eyes on the banker by now chip-
man had himself in hand again he smiled
and shrugged with bland self-assurance

   i still havent any idea what youre talk-
ing about but if you mean how did i get
my face scratched i was foolish enough to
rescue a stray cat from a dog she cut me
up a little doing it

   well by god ford harrell said slow-
ly you was foolish wasnt you

  chipman looked at him two spots of
angry color appeared suddenly in his cheeks
and his eyes narrowed

  its walts word against mine har-
rell   he said sharply

  not quite lucy mcadams put in
sweetly i had on a hat and i didnt run
fast and i kept my head down so the corn
didnt whip my face-but look here she
loosened her high peter pan collar and
turned her head from side to side showing
a few of the scratches on either side of her
neck you didnt know i was there did
you gene so you see it isnt just your
word against walts

  the banker looked slowly around the
room he saw condemnation and loathing
in every face and he would have been a
fool not to know the jig was up

  he made a sudden grab for millie har-
rell who was still standing close to him with
the obvious intention of using her body as
a shield to make his getaway but the ranch
girl was strong and agile as a cat she spun

away out of reach before his fingers had
hardly touched her and then suddenly
shoved the piano bench straight at his knees

  chipman stumbled and half fell the next
instant the ominous buzz of a rattlesnake
filled the room both girls yelled and
jumped for the nearest chair ford harrell
made a grotesque leap sideways

  walt carmack was the only one who
didnt seem to be startled his gun cleared
its holster with one lightning swift move-
ment that was in itself like the deadly strike
of a rattler he pulled the trigger and the
pearl-handled  jumped sideways out of
gene chipmans hand to fall clattering

  the banker grunted with pain as he
grasped at his half paralyzed wrist a small
object dropped from his other hand to the
floor walt picked it up it was a little tin
buzzer not unlike one of those noise-maker
gadgets at a carnival the noise it made
even in walts unpracticed fingers was as-
tonishingly like the warning buzz of a dia-
mondback

  you fooled me twice with this tiling an
purt near got me killed he said calmly
you didnt think it would work again
did you

  ford harrell stopped looking for snakes
and a half sheepish expression came over
his face

  chipman looked at walt still surprising-
ly self-contained i should have taken
time to go back and kill you last night when
i had the chance he said thoughtfully

  walt could agree that at least from the
bankers point of view that statement was
probably correct then remembering billy
gamel and clark bowles he clenched his
fists at his sides to think that it was all over
so easily and quickly

  i wish youd get up on your feet an
fight ive got a busted knee and you a
broken wrist-i hope it ought to be fairly
even

  cut it out walt ford harrell broke
in quietly youve had your fun and done
a damn good job of it too he turned to
chipman youre a hooked rooster any-
how gene so you just as well tell us how
you had lucky jim done away with in
mexico if he aint alive by god ijl-

  hes alive chipman said that much
quickly then hesitated as if trying to decide


elsa barker

whether to play his exclusive knowledge
of lucky jim sandersons whereabouts as
a last trump card in his own defense then
to everybodys surprise he chucked it

  lucky jim is a guest of some friends
of mine in chihuahua youll find the ad-
dress in my notebook on my desk at home
i could have easily had him killed but-
well dammit i always sort of liked the old
cuss he could have saved us all a lot of
bother though if hed sold me the lucky
diamond when i made him an offer

  ford harrell made a sudden gagging
sound as if he were sick at his stomach
millie run get me that rope hangin just
outside the kitchen door ive had about all
of this i can stand

  when they had chipman securely trussed
up and waiting for the sheriff to come after
him walt turned to ford harrell

  ford before we wind up this evenins
business theres one thing id like to ask
you where in the devil have you been on
these long trips away from the ranch
for the first time since he had known
him walt saw ford harrell acutely em-
barrassed he turned red and looked un-
comfortably at his daughter

  you should have asked me walt
millie said serenely its a woman isnt
it dad  a pretty red-headed widow named
mela andrews who lives in oxville
harrell sputtered then began to get mad
at his own embarrassment

  you been spyin on me millie any-
how i wasnt goin to marry her now so
you got no call to get mad about it
phooey said millie inelegantly i
didnt think those pink letters youve been
getting lately were bills for whiskey id
have headed it off all right if i hadnt found
out how nice she is she paused a mo-
ment and a smile came into her eyes i
might let you marry her dad-if youll let
me go to denver and study music

  a nice red-headed wife might sweeten
up the disposition of even an ol cocklebur
like you ford walt said dryly

  ford harrell looked at him and walt
surprised a twinkle in his usually cold eyes

  why he thought to himself the
old boogers human after all maybe if i
live to be a hundred i might get so i sorta
like him

tt was late in the afternoon a week later
when a buckboard drove up into the front
yard a silvery-haired old man thin and
weak from a months captivity in mexico
stepped shakily to the ground

  walt carmack went with him up the
front steps where mrs carmacks capable
hands took charge the cowboy looked over
toward the foremans cottage lucy mc-
adams came out on the porch and waved

  it was like throwing down a bag of oats
in front of a hungry cowpony obeying his
heart walt carmacks feet carried him
across the yard toward her-fast

  hello lucy

  hello walt

  after a moment she came over and sat
down beside him walt i-i think weve
still got a lot to say to each other a lot
of tilings to straighten out

  he smiled down at her weve got a
lifetime to do it in he said

  she drew back a little before the look in
his eyes no some of its got to be said
now ive got to tell you how sorry i am
-for something i said to you once
sorry you said it or sorry you be-
lieved it

  the teasing look was back in his eyes
  both she said steadily sorry that

i	ever for one moment believed such a thing
of you and sorrier that i said it
suddenly his arms were around her
honey he said softly in her ear you
told me that a dozen times already the
morning you brought the newspaper to me
-instead of ford harrell or somebody else
-every time you turned to me for help
and you even hinted you liked me a little
when you followed me through a hail of
bullets into a cornpatch

  lucy gave a long sigh of pure happiness
a little she protested in mock indigna-
tion walt-what ore you doing

  fixin to draw straws he teased
short straw rates a kiss long straw
you go in the house

  lucy mcadams had no intention of going
into the house her fingers trembled a
little reaching for one of the broken match
sticks he held out to her his other arm al-
ready around her but not for fear she
would draw the long straw walt she re-
membered knew how to fix them
 a day of reckoning

                by dorothy l bonar

       when a man loves a woman as tracy loved ruth should he keep on
       believing in her no matter how black the evidence of her deception

t was early morning the
hour at which they usually
had breakfast familiar with
their habits tracy holt dis-
mounted a good distance be-
low the ranchyard leaving
his pack and saddle horse concealed in
the willows bordering a noisy creek he
worked his way to a position directly op-
posite the house

  inside the small yard flowers nodded
colorful heads crisp white curtains flut-
tered at an opened window but there was

no one about tracy stood a moment
rock-grey eyes absorbing the scene a tall
superbly shouldered man in his late twen-
ties powdered from sombrero to boot with
the dust of a long trail

  satisfied at length he crossed the inter-
vening space in a dozen strides there
was a six-shooter in his hand when he
veranda he entered
halted just inside the

 stepped upon the
 without knocking
 door

 a fragrance of

boiled coffee lingered

still in the kitchen but on the table dishes




dorothy l bonar

for two had been scraped and neatly
stacked he had miscalculated hal davies
had already eaten and gone ruth was
here alone busy in the next room warned
by the sound of his entrance she would
appear in a moment   

  she did she stopped short at sight of
him her eyes going wide she took a step
in his direction caught herself and shrank
against the side of the door-jamb every
line of her slender figure rigid beneath a
blue calico gown

  tracy she whispered

  the low music of her voice sent a quiv-
er through the frame of the man menac-
ing her the barrel of the gun gripped in
a lean brown hand sagged slightly

  he had been a fool to imagine he could
ever harm this girl tracy holt reflected
with sudden bitterness facing her now
he found it hard to believe that she had
jilted him run away with the man who
would soon have been his partner and
taken along the entire proceeds of the sale
of his lazy h herd he could not deal
with her as he meant to deal with davies
for she possessed still the charm that had
enslaved him

  brown hair fluffed about her head in
shining waves her nose was adorably
short her eyes the deep blue of a moun-
tain lake they met his without evasion
despite the fear holding them wide

  sight of her served only to drive home
once more his sense of unbearable loss to
fan to a new heat his hatred of the man
responsible for it

  where is he he demanded harshly

  the girl straightened her shoulders
theres no reason for you to fight with
hal she said quietly if youve got to
take your spite out on someone let it be
me it was my idea to run away with the
money not his

  tracy was staggered whatever he had
prepared himself for during the weeks it
had taken to track down these runaways
it was certainly nothing so brazen as this
as he struggled to throw off shock ruth
spoke again pleadingly

  cant you be generous tracy i know
it must have been a terrible blow but if
youd stop to think-

  id forget you were a woman and kill

you too interrupted tracy in a gust of
passion with an effort he recovered self-
control repeated evenly where is he
silence stretched between them for one
long moment then i wont tell you
answered the girl you-

  a step on the veranda silenced her lips
tracy started whirled but the girl had
held his attention a moment too long be-
fore he could so much as snap a shot in
the direction of the newcomer a report
rang out lead bored hotly through his
upper right arm his gun clattered to the
floor and his hand dropped with it fingers
abruptly red and dripping

  move back ordered hal davies he
picked up tracys gun after the latter had
obeyed slowly his retreat into the room
marked by a trail of dark shiny drops

  with a little sob ruth tore her eyes
from them flew to meet her rescuer he
put a comforting arm about her shoulders
but his brown gaze held that of the other
man

  i came out of the barn just in time
to see you go into the house he ex-
plained thought it looked like you
unexpectedly he added im sorry i had
to wing you tracy but you looked plumb
dangerous and i couldnt take a chance
he was about tracys own age and of
an equal height he wore a white stet-
son shoved back on curly hair and there
was no suggestion whatever of guilt in his
look

  it was like a slap in the face to tracy
this fact that although ruth had acknowl-
edged their transgression both should con-
tinue to face him proud and unrepentant
he said tightly

  you wont talk your way out of this
davies better finish me now while youve
got the chance youll never get another
a look that was almost repugnance
flitted over the redheads face whats
the use of going on like that tracy he
demanded conciliatingly this thing can
be patched up now that youre here cant
it

  derision twisted tracys mouth i knew
youd try to squirm out of it as soon as i
caught up with you answered he bit-
ingly well squirm and be damned
theres a day of reckoning coming to you
a day of reckoning



two as sure as i walk out of here youre
going to get it

  steadily the blood had continued to run
down his arm unless it were checked
soon he would find himself growing weak
realizing this tracy turned away ignored
the gun leveled at him and stalked toward
the door

  but tracy protested davies only to
be interrupted by the girl

  let him go hal she directed her
voice cold with contempt its not in him
to be reasonable or generous its not me
he cares about anyway or the money its
the fact that somebody dared to cross him
dared to go against the will of the great
spane

  tracy halted on the threshold as though
a bullet from hals gun had indeed pen-
erated his back for a moment he stood
there balls of muscle quivering in each
cheek with the setting of his jaw then he
looked around at the man

  so you told her that after all did you
he said slowly with terrible import an-
other thing to remember

  davies made no answer without an-
other glance at the girl standing in the
circle of davies arm tracy turned away
the strides that took him back to his
horses were steady even though they left
behind a trail of drops that glistened in
the sun

pane down the corridor of
memory the name echoed as
tracy moved along a brush-
choked draw on his wray to the
big horn river it had start-
ed as a lark ten years ago a
wild adventure for a pair of eighteen-year-
old kids footloose and toying with liquor
scarcely realizing how it had come about
he and bob crane had found themselves
riding with a band of outlaws two jobs
and disgusted with the bloodshed in
which neither would take part tracy had
brought dissension into the gang by label-
ing such unnecessary so well had he ar-
gued that although half the company had
chosen to remain with the old leader law-
ton the other half had clamored for a new
one

  out of this was bom the outlaw spane

deadly in gunplay still he had gone on to
prove his point through cleverness and
careful planning his jobs became conspicu-
ous for their absence of killings yet so
consistently did he make monkeys of law-
men that two swore publicly to get him or
run him out of their jurisdictions

  in the face of such a challenge tracy
found it impossible to quit the game de-
spite his friends continual pleading that
they do so then had come the inevitable
wind-up mysteriously plans had leaked
out they had ridden one night into a trap
out of which only he and bob the latter
desperately wounded had escaped

  holed up in hills alive with posses
tracy had fought vainly for his friends
life dying bobs last wish had been for
the outlaw spane to die with him his
argument was sound

  its only stubbornness and pride-
makin you keep on hed panted theyll
raise hell i your life-some day your
face aint known-but to one or two go
somewhere else-go straight promise
pard

  bowed down with grief and remorse
tracy had given his word and kept it
spane had simply disappeared through
five lonely years tracy holt had labored
to build up his flying h not even the
appearance of his rival outlaw leader
lawton buying up a neighboring spread
had daunted him lawton had approached
him once with a proposition that revealed
he had not wholly reformed tracy had
declined it and there matters rested when
ruth and hal davies entered his life

  they were seeking a ranch in which to
invest a legacy and the flying h had
taken their fancy unwilling though tracy
was to relinquish his holdings he had been
glad to consider selling a half-interest aft-
er one look into ruths blue eyes brother
and sister they called themselves but
hals folks had merely raised ruth and
they were no blood relation brother and
sister

  tracy laughed harshly as he emerged
from the draw and found flowing water
before him at this point the river was
wide a calm surface hiding the true swift-
ness of its current tracy dropped halter
rope and bridle reins in order that both


dorothy l bonar

animals might drink dismounted to squat
at the waters edge

  the bleeding of his wound had almost
stopped a bit dizzy he bathed his face
and drank deeply before examining his
hurt it was a clean hole through muscle
and flesh so that he lost no time bandag-
ing it with pieces of an extra shirt and
fashioning a sling

  as he was about to mount the absence
of a weight at his right hip forced itself
into his attention his hesitation was brief
again he went to his warbag this time
producing a pair of six-shooters

  of dark blue steel loaded and in per-
fect condition they were beautiful weap-
ons in the butt of each shone the letter
s inlaid with pearl spanes guns the
only material evidence linking him to his
past he had kept them because they were
a gift from the friend he had lost other
than himself only hal davies knew of
them knew because he in his stupidity
had told his every secret to ruths brother
feeling that only through making a clean
breast of things could he make himself
worthy of ruths love

  hal had assured him it would make no
difference to ruth but declared she would
probably be happier to know nothing about
it he had advised tracy to hold his tongue
on the matter of lawton however he had
looked thoughtful

  maybe itd be a good idea to start out
together in a new location he said slow-
ly youre selling off your herd of mixed
stock why not sell the ranch too al-
together it should bring close to what ive
got with  we could get the good
stock you want even some blooded horses
nobody could possibly know you up in
wyoming and theres a place up there
that ruth and i almost bought

  but loath to be driven tracy had re-
torted flatly nothing doing lawton
cant hurt me to hell with him

  and though davies had tried again and
again to re-open the subject he had re-
fused to listen blithely continuing to whip
flying h affairs into shape for on the
day that the partnership papers were
signed ruth was to become mrs holt

  hed sold his cattle because there was
no bank in cholla hed fetched the cash

home pridefully and fatuously revealing
its hiding place to his bride-to-be before
riding back to town to purchase the sort
of outfit he figured a man should be mar-
ried in hed returned that night to a
house denuded of ruths bright presence
all the davies belongings and the money

  no one had seen them go except law-
ton who had come along and found tracy
outside his gate feverishly trying to pick
up the tracks of the pretty buckskin pony
that had been his first present to ruth

  missin somethin inquired lawton
with a smirk

  he was a big man thick-bodied thick-
featured with green eyes that squinted
habitually beneath a low forehead draped
with a matt of kinky yellow hair

  when tracy made no reply he added
they left his momin had their luggage
loaded on a pack horse i seen em when
they cut across my pasture headin for
ramirez likely they caught that after-
noon train for parts unknown

  for minutes he took in tracys white
silence then remarked with spiteful en-
joyment it took a woman to outsmart
the great spane didnt it guffawing
hugely he rode on

  in that moment tracy realized that
lawton still held a grudge against him
for that long ago splitting up of his gang
but it wasnt important he was too
crushed by the fact that ruth was gone
that through his love for her he had been
robbed and betrayed his life desolated

  standing now with one of spanes guns
gripped in his left hand the pain of this
new wound had nothing to do with the
whiteness that appeared about tracys
mouth ruth had made it plain that she
considered him an outlaw that was why
she had faced him so boldly scornfully
as though it should be no crime to rob a
man who once had robbed others that
his flying h was wholly the result of
honest enterprise and a dash of luck would
make no difference

  tracys smile was mirthless as awk-
wardly he wrapped the cartridge belt about
his waist buckled it awkwardly too he
settled the holsters and managed to fasten
down their tips then he caught up the lead
rope of his pack horse mounted and point-
a day of reckoning



ed his black toward the rambling bulk of
the mountains in the west

ll morning he traveled
steadily about noon he
came to a canyon filled
with the gurgle of a
small stream here there
was grass in abundance
for the horses tracy dismounted stripped
saddle gear from his black and hobbled
him his packs he slid to the ground
turning the bay loose

   slong fella he muttered slapping a
sweaty flank maybe well meet again
maybe not

  he had no plan save to wait for his
arm to heal although his left-hand draw
was swift it had not the accuracy of his
right-and accuracy was the one thing he
meant to command the next time he faced
hal davies

   for days tracy loafed fretting at the
delay tormented by brooding thoughts
though he favored his arm it showed no
signs of healing rather it seemed to grow
worse morosely tracy began to wonder
if hate could distil poison in a mans sys-
tem then derided himself for the fantastic
thought

  the spare garments out of which he
was fashioning bandages were perhaps less
clean than they looked maybe the bullet
had embedded a thread from his shirt deep
in the wound itself

   at any rate despite using his entire
supply of salt in hot packs the fifth day
found his arm badly swollen the wound
angrily inflamed he was feverish the
pain had developed into a pounding that
brought on queer light-headed spells it
was borne upon tracy that he would have
to seek a doctor if ever he expected to
make good his promise of a day of reckon-
ing for ruth and hal davies

   slowly doggedly he got his outfit on
the black pulled himself aboard he soon
found that a road gait jarred his head un-
bearably and pulled down to a slow walk
even so he rode mostly with chin on
chest drifting into states of semi-conscious-
ness from which he would rouse with a
start

  he failed to notice when his mount

   strayed off from the direction into which
he had headed it eventually its shrill
whiny aroused him from stupor with a
jerk he straightened passing hot hands
over blurry eyes

  around him was piled a rough land-
scape studded with greasewood and low
mounds of salt sage a stock trail wound
about the base of a hill overlooking a dry
wash here his black stood ears pointed
straight ahead

  even as tracy took this in the animal
sounded another warning of a presence
ahead on the trail the instinct of the
hunted long dormant sprang to life with-
in tracy banishing the mental fog that
had bound him dropping knotted reins
about the saddle horn he drew his left
gun and urged the black on half a dozen
steps and he halted again facing a rider
who blocked the way-a big burly-chested
man leaning forward tensely in his saddle

  spane ejaculated the latter in pro-
found amaze a spasmodic jerk of hand
lifted higher the bore of a sixgun

  tracy paid it no heed howdy law-
ton he drawled

  behind the renegade ranchman were two
others as hard of face and wary-eyed as
he the first led by halter ropes two of
the finest specimens of horseflesh tracy had
ever seen-sleek clean-limbed thorough-
breds that shouted of the race track he
had no chance to see more for shedding
surprise lawton swung his horse to the
side screening his second follower from
view

  youd best turn tail he said mean-
ingly head back the way you come and
forget you seen us

  the peremptory speech did little to-
wards mollifying tracys black mood he
said deliberately i dont turn tail for any
son of a skunk get out of my way

  lawton seemed to stop breathing tracy
saw the squinting eyes slide to his injury
then down to the gun in his left hand he
guessed the feverish calculations running
through the outlaws mind lawton was
realizing that whatever the outcome of a
fight at this time he for one would never
live to see it

  dont you like- began tracy softly
then halted as the nervous shifting of law-


dorothy l bonar

  tons horse afforded him an unexpected
glimpse of the third outlaw and the animal
he in turn led

  it was no thoroughbred it was simply
a pretty buckskin pony and astride it
hands lashed to the saddle horn sat a
small disheveled figure her face was
pale above a gag her eyes pleaded with
hope in their blue depths

  ruth davies of a sudden tracy under-
stood lawtons consternation at meeting
him why he had tried to turn him back
despite all this girl had done to him
despite the fact that she had forfeited even
his slightest loyalty or consideration law-
ton had expected him to bridle in her de-
fense it was what ruth herself was pray-
ing for right now

  in tracys fever-twisted brain these
facts became all at once excruciatingly
funny he would have flung back his head
and howled with mirth had he not felt so
stiff and tight inside instead he heard
himself saying hal davies horses eh
yeah lawton relaxed slightly
thisll about break him too hes been
figurin on cleanin up big when the track
season opens next month

  tracy thrilled with savage satisfaction
he forgot that he himself had an honest
claim upon these horses that through them
he might recover a part of the money stolen
from him more than ever in his present
condition the thought of vengeance ob-
sessed him and he was interested solely
in this added bitter blow against his enemy

  horses like them will be -rd to move
safe out of the country he asserted how
you aim to do it

  one of lawtons followers shifted un-
easily cleared his throat as though in pro-
test against an answer but his leader
through a greater knowledge and under-
standing of the man in his way saw a way
out

  weve a freight car waitin at the wade
water tower he explained fully aware
that the name would mean little to a strang-
er in the country as was tracy theres
a train goes through tonight ive got
friends-connections-so the crews bought
off to stop and pick us up comes day-
light well be clear out of the state
against his will tracy heard himself

  inquire and the lady what happens to
her

  the outlaw shrugged dont tell me
he said mockingly that youre still fool
enough to give a damn

  ruth made a violent motion struggling
to be free of her gag above it her eyes
were enormous ablaze with desperate
pleading

  stung thought he was by lawtons words
and tone her look cut tracy to the heart
he had believed to be squeezed dry of feel-
ing the realization that she had still the
power to move him to hurt filled him
with a new swift rage in black perversity
he spoke through his teeth

  who said i did

  with a jerk of reins he backed his
mount clearing the trail lawton sheathed
his gun there was a smug lift to the cor-
ners of lawtons mouth as he rode by
one after the other his henchmen fol-
lowed turned sideways in their saddles
uncomprehending uneasy

  the last thing tracy saw was ruths
white face her incredulous stricken eyes

e could not shed
their memory though
he immediately set
about putting distance
between himself and
this spot merciful
stupor did not close down upon him again
it was as though he had been given a pow-
erful stimulant torn between an anguished
desire to go back and rescue the girl and a
stubborn refusal to surrender to this weak-
ness tracy rode with no sense of direc-
tion hard as a man pursued by a wraith

  with surprise he found himself eventu-
ally at the river not far from the draw
down which he had traveled from the
davies ranch five days ago the sun was
gone the western sky already dull the
voice of the stream was a low troubled
murmur from the branches of a tree a
mourning dove uttered its indescribably
sad lament

  it brought home to tracy the desolation
of his life its futility of a sudden his im-
pulse was to find his enemy now and have
done with it he had gone so far as to
rein towards the draw when he became
a day of reckoning



aware of a horse coming down it-fast

  tracy knew with fateful conviction just
who that rider would be even before the
rider burst into the open and pulled up
his lathered mount with a startled exclama-
tion

  wheres- ruth demanded davies
then his voice was as wild as his look
ive just come from town so i know she
hasnt gone for the sheriff if youd made
off with her and the horses 

  i havent tracy assured him but i
know who has and i dont give a damn
you wont either in a minute reach
and well get it over with

  but davies made no move to accept the
challenge he stared at tracy while on
his face kindled a look of revulsion and
disbelief id never of believed stubborn
bull-headed pride could bring anyone so
low he said chokingly my god tracy
if you loved ruth even a little couldnt
you see her side of it couldnt you un-
derstand she was fightin for a lifetime of
happiness with you not just a few weeks
or months

  tracy could only stare dumbly hal
made a gesture of frustration

  she tried to explain in her letter
didnt you understand we took your
money and sank it with mine in this place
up here so youd be forced to follow us and
stay as tracy continued to stare he
went on patiently it was because of law-
ton he tried to tell me a lot of stuff about
your past one day when he found out i
knew and didnt care he got ugly i knew
hed wait until you were married to ruth
-had everything to lose-then hed either
expose you or try blackmail i was afraid
youd kill him and outlaw yourself all over
again

  you wouldnt listen to me i told ruth
in desperation she was afraid you
wouldnt listen to her either youre ter-
rible set in your ways tracy so she
thought of running away to force your
hand she wrote that she knew youd be
mad and hurt but that shed spend the rest
of her life making it up to you

  tracy said heavily i never got a let-
ter

  you must have she left it on the
shelf above the fire-place  his voice

trailed off as though a possibility had
startled him

  tracy shook his head there was no
letter he reiterated lawton come along
told about seeing you leave   
laughed 

  lawton whispered hal settling back
in his saddle he saw us go rode to the
flying h to find out why you were gone
so he snooped inside and took the letter
thats it he hated you tracy said that
long ago youd busted up the sweetest set-
up hed ever had he said hed almost got
even once-that one of your men talked
when drunk and he passed what hed heard
to the sheriff hal shook his head dazedly

  tracy thought he would never breathe
again as the full import of the others
words droned through him lawton
he whispered and i met him a while
ago-might have saved ruth-but let hini
go because 

  because all this time youve thought
that ruth and i    hals voice too
trailed off for the first time he seemed
to take in tracys thin cheeks the ravages
of fever and suffering upon his face you
poor damn fool he whispered huskily

  but tracy did not hear he was re-
calling ruths white face and stricken
eyes remembering with slow-gathering hor-
ror that he had wilfully left her in the
power of the man who had conspired
against them both

  there was no doubting hals story it
all fitted together-their lack of guilt and
scorn of his vengeance-seeking how law-
ton had known where to find them known
they would have stock that would make a
trip to steal it worth while even now
lawton was well on his way with all three
of his prizes-with ruth sweet and lovely
believing herself wantonly betrayed and
cast aside by the man to whom she had
given only love and fidelity

  had tracy been made of weaker stuff
he would have cried aloud as it was he
said merely the wade water tower
theyve a car there thatll be picked up by
a train sometime tonight

  wade hal straightened with a jerk
swung his horses head to the north al-
most as abruptly he halted again youd
better hit for town send out the sheriff


dorothy l bonar

and a posse he advised hurriedly kindly
wades up in the mountains above wind
river pass ill have to cut across some
pretty rough country to get there in time
youre in no shape for a ride like that
i wish i was as sure of saving ruth
as i am of being at your heels when you
get there said tracy grimly

  hal gave him a straight look then
struck spurs home sending his mount
thundering on its way so hard a pace did
he set that they were high in the foothills
by the time darkness had settled upon
them in earnest yet not once did tracy
lag behind

  the memory of ruths look of his own
unforgivable transgression was as a lash
driving him truly a day of reckoning
had come but for tracy holt not the two
to whom he had promised it-reckoning at
last for the stubbornness and black pride
against which bob crane had warned him
so long ago

igher and higher
they climbed and it
seemed that hours
passed a fear that
hal had lost his way
began to harass tracy
he was on the point of calling out when
his guide reined up on an open promontory

  itll be close announced hal thats
the train down there

  guided by his pointing hand tracy
picked out a tiny light in the black depths
below his heart gave a leap as his com-
panion reined to the side sent his horse
sliding down a steep declivity in a mo-
ment they came upon a pair of iron rails
gleaming dully in moonlight

  they left their horses in a patch of tim-
ber ten minutes later they were looking
upon the squat dark shape of the water
tower on a siding beyond stood a box-
car emitting a feeble glow of lantern light
a low roar growing out of the night
warned of a locomotive laboring up the
steep grade through the pass

  as tracy turned over in his mind the
best method of attack the engines whistle
cut the air-one long blast followed by two
short ones plainly it was a signal for at
once a mans figure filled the open door of

the boxcar tracys blood burned with
recognition of lawton the whistle was re-
peated the outlaw dropped to the ground
calling out

  here she comes boys

  as both his henchmen followed him out-
side tracy said to hal well have to be
quick the train crews on their side
three quick strides put space betjrveen
them then his gun was in his hand law-
ton he called out sharply

  the outlaw leader gave a violent jerk
the next instant he was whirling hand a
blur of motion it clawed only air how-
ever for tracys bullet caught him in the
chest and slammed him sideways fall-
ing he jarred one companion from his
tracks so that hals shot did nothing but
bare an outlaws head

  tracy heard the others muttered ex-
clamation impetuously hal davies start-
ed forward as lawtons followers made for
the end of the boxcar returning fire as they
ran tracy sent one plunging forward on
his face hal come back he shouted
sprinting in pursuit

  whether or not hal would have heeded
the command was never to be known for
in that moment hal and the remaining
enemy fired at each other simultaneously
the outlaw folded up and fell slowly but
hal made an abrupt lunge as though hurl-
ing himself bodily at his objective hit the
ground with a force that rolled him over
and lay still

  frantic tracy bent over him for
ruths brother to be killed would be the
final calamity the last unforgivable mark in
the black score against him but hal was
breathing evenly bleeding at one shoul-
der

  so violent was tracys relief that reac-
tion brought all the weakness of his own
condition swooping down upon him he
staggered to the boxcar door made it in-
side because something like a roar-the
approaching locomotive-seemed to be
driving him onward

  somehow he found ruth amidst moun-
tains of baled hay set her free he re-
membered whinnies and the stomping of
hoofs a struggle with a loading platform
then something was creeping up on them
with snorts and pants sending ahead a
a day of reckoning



blinding flood of light in it he could make
out hal lolling on the bare back of a horse
supported by a disheveled girl who con-
trolled the second excited thoroughbred
only with difficulty

  he became aware that she was lean-
ing toward him shouting theres no time
for you to reach your horse up behind
me tracy hurry

  but one of the figures on the ground
had moved started to crawl toward a gun
plainly visible in the headlight of the ap-
proaching train get goin tracy yelled
and with a slap of hand sent her mount on
its way

  afterwards he looked at that empty
hand bewilderedly unable to remember
where or why he had laid down his gun
to untie ruth the right holster was
empty but he did recall having given that
weapon to her his only hope then was
to kick the gun on the ground out of law-
tons reach

  he fell doing it when he struggled up
lawton was running drunkenly towards
the track the train was almost upon them
if lawton made it across he would be
cut off by the string of cars-safe

  tracy was proud to be able to think so
clearly he wished he could run that well
yet he was fleeter than he realized for he
did overtake his enemy as his hand fell
upon him he tripped over the first rail
together they went down in the center of
the track

  lawton lay still but tracy was not un-
conscious of the monster bearing down
upon them he was trying to crawl to

safety and finding it almost impossible to
move when hands seized him tracy
tracy cried a voice he was aware of
being tugged at and yanked then all sen-
sation faded

  when he opened his eyes it was day-
light a smell of wood smoke hung in
the air and he was in a forest clearing
his attempt to move brought ruth to his
side her face was smudged and tear-
stained but she attempted to speak mat-
ter-of-factly

  well wait here for the sheriff tracy
hals gone after him he was only
scratched and stunned but lawtons dead
-like the other two we got him off the
track with you but hed hit his head on
a rail he- tears began to slide down her
cheeks- he told me about taking the let-
ter taunted me with what you believed
about hal and me

  im sorry whispered tracy miser-
ably

  she smiled through her tears you
neednt be the train went on and well
never be able to prove anything on its
crew but thats past and done too all
that matters is for hal to get here with a
wagon so we can take you home

  home tracys head was whirling
again and it wasnt entirely because of his
physical state you mean-you and hal
-are takin me back he faltered incred-
ulously

  ruth shook her head were asking you
to take us back she leaned low to kiss
dry feverish  lips adding contritely
werent we the ones who ran away

they had hoped these two that their love would bridge the gap between
their families but it looked as if theyd brought on a range war instead

ouncing up from the
sheer rock walls the
suns glare made ranee
almost invisible as he
crept down the open
slope darting from rock
to rock taking whatever cover he could
find from the ambush guns at the foot of
the draw his slight black-clad figure
seemed more shadow than flesh to julies
eyes she couldnt make herself feel that
any of this was real the men around her
made no sound their watching was as in-
tense as her own

  high overhead a black bird wheeled
against the skys molten shimmer the
only sound was the scrabble and scrape of
ranees boots skidding and slipping over
the stone-rubbled ground

    time had ceased to exist time was
  only ranee macailister dowrn there inch-
  ing along with death ahead of him and
  death behind time was ranee pocketed
  by guns

    up here the angry men with rifles
  watching waiting down there other men
  with rifles watching waiting too but
  ranee had no gun

    ranee was a spy and a murderer she
  believed that didnt she then what did
  it matter what happened to him nothing
  at all really except that in those aching
  dragging seconds julie knew again and
  more strongly than ever that she loved
  him

    he had nearly reached the bottom now
the dynamite sticks slung along his back
thats far enough ranee a voice called

double trouble



sharply from below you better rest
where you are

  ranee just kept going you could al-
most see his body tense against the im-
pact of the bullets that would surely come

  beside julie brade barnett stirred
slightly his eyes were jetty bright against
the sweat-streaked tan of his face i told
you it was a trick he muttered angrily
hes still their breed they arent going
to shoot hell get clean away

  julie watched brades rifle barrel lift
well if they dont shoot him i will
brade said flatly as soon as he gets out
from behind that ledge brades finger
tightened slowly on the trigger his hand
was as steady as stone   

tt was hard to say exactly when it be-
gan perhaps it was already in the
cards when jeremiah jarrett first came to
this mesa with his son jere and his daugh-
ter jane who was julies mother in those
days his mind had been bright with visions
of the vast cattle empire he was going to
build from that first straggly herd of texas
longhorns he couldnt fail there was
magic to that letter j and unquenchable
luck the jj would spread and spread
until it took everything between the cana-
dian river and carabozo creek all his
children would bear that doubled j and
their children and hed been foolishly
pleased when julies mother had married
frank johnson she would be a jj too
like her cousins the twins jesse and jonas

  but before the jj could do much spread-
ing the macallisters-the colonel and his
brother aran and their children-had come
to homestead the tract below high mesa
fencing the jj off forever blocking its
growth

  thered been more to the trouble than
just the usual cowman-granger bitterness
it went back to the patrician roots of the
macallisters in tennessee to the humble
shanty-origins of jeremiah jarrett in ken-
tucky pride had fought against envy re-
sentment had simmered up in little ways-
mean spiteful tricks to be laughed at in
secret but it had never come to this be-
fore never this killing this guns-drawn
wrar

  perhaps that had started on the rain-

soaked night when julie had come home
after five years spent with her fathers sis-
ter on an oklahoma farm julie had al-
most forgotten what life along freshwa-
ter creek could be like

  and shed forgotten too how any rainy-
season cloudburst could turn the narrow
road that served the mesa into a ribbon
of gummy mud finding no cousin to meet
her at the stage station and sure she could
beat the threatening storm shed started
out in the livery stable rig the rain caught
her almost squarely halfway between the
ranch and town and just by the turn-in
to the macallister place the rig careened
into a rain-scooped rut and overturned
snapping an axle and pitching julie out
into the ooze before she could get to her
feet the frightened horse had kicked loose
from the traces and gone galloping back
the way he had come

  knowing it would be foolish to try to
plow through the storm on foot julie made
her way to the macallister house to wait
until the rain stopped

  just as she was mounting the steps to
the broad pillared veranda of the big white
house she heard light quick footsteps be-
hind her as she turned lightning flared
whitely revealing them to each other

  julie ranee said softly julie john-
son he sounded glad to see her and
from somewhere out of the years behind
her a singing came to her heart even
that brief flash of lightning had shown
her that ranee grown up was still ranee

  yes she said its me ranee ive
come home to stay

  he drew her up on the veranda his
hand lightly resting on her arm and they
stood that way facing each other word-
lessly remembering

  the last time shed seen him hed been
fifteen and if ever a half-grown girl two
years younger than that could be in love
julie had been in love with ranee shed
tagged around after him ever since she
could remember and the tension between
the two families had made everything seem
like a game of hide-and-seek that they
shared they even found a secret place to
meet-over in the brasada between the
north slope of the mesa and macallisters
fields they chose it because no one else


richard worthington

ever had any reason for going there and
because the red clay soil that bottomed it
wasnt to be found anywhere else for miles
around and made it seem unique and spe-
cial set apart just for them

  thered been awful ructions when the
colonel had found them there one day
and hed packed ranee summarily off to
military school in alamo for a year be-
fore ranee could return grampa jarrett
not to be outdone by any macaliister had
sent julie to companion her aunt on the
lonely farm

  now the aunt was dead and julie had
come home ranee was taller a little but
his eyes still had that clear steadiness and
his smile was still as warm and sunny as
she remembered it and standing there
facing him julies heart knew surely and
strongly that nothing in her had changed
either she loved ranee still she would
always love him it was nothing you could
question or puzzle over it simply was

  rain gusted in under the portico ranee
stirred and his laughter seemed forced and
nervous youll drown out here he said
then he hesitated i guess you better
come inside he sounded a little dubious
and julie sensed his mood instantly the
way shed always been able to

  she put her hand swiftly on his sleeve
ranee she began our families-theyre
not still acting-foolish

  he didnt really answer her just
shrugged and twisted the door-knob best
come in julie he said and something
deep in her chest went cold and stiff she
followed him inside

hey were all there gath-
ered about the big living
room as stiffly ranged as
figures at a funeral their
faces turned toward her as
she entered a tense hos-
flickered around the room
the colonel and aran were playing at
chess ranees two sisters were sewing by
the big center table their husbands and
aran macallisters son tim were slapping
cards into a hat for a moment everybody
seemed to freeze then the colonel mut-
tered something and the two women flut-
tered

  tim macaliister rawboned and with
eyes that never seemed quite to look at
you was the only one who really spoke to
her at all well its julie all right he
said with a grin purtier than two pic-
tures the colonel frowned and ranee
did too

  then ranee led julie over to the fire
and told them about her mishap im-
im grateful for your shelter julie said
frozen into stiffness herself she stood
with her back to the grate and glanced
around the room everything seemed
dimmed impoverished the insufficient fire
didnt begin to cut the chill in the air the
low-turned lamps didnt dispel the thick
shadows of the rooms dim corners the
dresses of the two women were outmoded
and oft-mended whatever else had hap-
pened in the five years julie had been
away the macallisters hadnt prospered
she wondered how things had fared up on
the mesa

  she had never felt less welcome any-
where in her life and ranees efforts to
make conversation made it all seem worse
julie was relieved when after two sharp
thumps on the panel the door pushed open
and brade barnett came towering into the
room

  his eyes found julie instantly and he
held out both hands to her his powerful
bigness the deep rich bronze of his face
made the finer-moulded macallisters seem
like waxen miniatures he dwarfed them
completely blotting them out all but
ranee

  i saw the rig in the road brade said
i guessed youd be here he glared
briefly around at the now openly hostile
faces i guess youd better come along
in the wagon with me

  julie glanced around the room her eyes
resting briefly on ranees face thanks
for your hospitality she said primly
ranee i- then she fell silent the
next move had to be his

  julie were- he began raggedly
then finished in a burst of defiance i
have to see you julie

  julies smile was confident of course
ranee any time you like

  not on the mesa macaliister brade
said sharply his face darkening you
double trouble



wont be welcome and he pushed julie
through the door before she had a chance
to protest

  he didnt speak again until they were
turning into the main road julie beside him
bundled under the tarpaulin i didnt
mean to sound off so sharp julie he said
but them macallisters are worse now
than theyve ever been had a couple of
crop failures makes em mean they blame
everything that happens on us they been
shooting our steers-claimed our cattle had
busted down the fences trouble is theyre
too stingy to keep the wire mended weve
had some trouble with tainted water holes
too and it sure aint us poisoning our own
cattle

  julies heart sank but theyre neigh-
bors brade there must be some way we
can get on

  not with them brade said flatly
tim macallister and i used to be pals
but since things have got so bad we dont
see each other any more so if you and
ranee got any ideas about starting up again
best forget em

  thats something for ranee and me to
say julie said firmly but doubts were
stirring in her heart

  reckon grampa jarrett might have a
word of his owrn to speak too brade said
flicking the reins sharply against the dash-
board

  brade was funny he wasnt really a
jarrett at all his brother phil had mar-
ried julies cousin justine and brade had
come up to the mesa too but in some ways
he was more jarrett than any of the others
he was the strongest too grampa recog-
nized that and by hard work and sound
sense brade had won his place in the dy-
nasty he was named in grampas will right
along with the others

  heres julie home brade said when
they reached the ranch house found her
down at the macallisters thought id bet-
ter bring her home right away

  the family clamored around her grampa
kissed her cheek and embraced her briefly
justine hugged her and the twins jess and
jonas alike as the two halves of a split pea
grinned their welcome jess even noticed
the brooch she was wearing had lost two
stones but then jess never missed a thing

and that was how you could tell him from

his duller-eyed twin jonas

  but even in their friendly pleasure at her
return she realized how completely she had
stepped into another world somehow
texas fast-growing as it was hadnt yet
reached up into this corner this was
freshwater creek and the burning hills
she had stepped into some forgotten frag-
ment of time that was almost feudal

  and she was suddenly frightened   
the rain on the night of her homecoming
was the last of the wet spell the next
morning was bright and fiercely hot the
wind seemed to shrivel the ground before
many days had gone by the smaller water
holes were dry and the cattle had to be
driven from the north pasture down to
freshwater creek bellowing their thirst

  gonna be worse even than last year
grampa jarrett glumly predicted sure is
lucky for us the cricks running good and
clear if we couldnt get a good fat herd to
market this year thingsd be mighty bad
for the double j

  after that first spell of fear and strange-
ness julie settled easily enough into the
jarrett ways she helped justine wnth the
chores in the mornings or rode with brade
or jess to look at the cattle but in the
afternoons she eluded them and galloped
the little brockled mare down to the red-
clay bottomland of the brasada if ranee
had meant what he said about seeing her
he would remember the brasada

  on the fifth day he came

  he slid from his horse and ran to her
their meeting needed no speech she went
into his arms as if theyd been made slender
and strong to hold only her his fingers
touched the sunny gold of her hair his lips
brushed her mouth

you never kissed me before ranee
she said a kind of blue wonder in her eyes

  i always wanted to he told her i
wanted to the other night a frown
crossed his face like a cloud sliding over
the sun the sureness left his voice julie
this is right isnt it this is the wray we
were meant to be isnt it we got to make
it right somehow julie

  we will ranee she assured him we
will

he smiled at her youre so small he


richard worthington

said gathering her close again so fearful
small

  ranee was no giant himself she thought
and in some ways he seemed younger even
than she but there was strength enough
in his arms to crush her tight against his
chest and sweetness enough on his mouth
to make her feel giddily drunk when he
kissed her	

  we got to think about it some julie
he said about the way our folks keep
after each other all the time his brow
clouded over again and she knew what
was troubling him being a macallister
was always had been ranees religion it
was part of his bone and his blood even
his love for her couldnt shake it out of him
completely

  but the smell of the gum trees even on
the dusty wind was sweet and sassy the
sun was bright and warm and julie felt
strong and confident we cant let it be
bigger than we are ranee we count for
something too weve got to beat it some
way

  there were times though when ranee
didnt seem minded to beat it when all he
expected of julie was her complete surren-
der and it was all very well to feel so
strong and sure when ranee had his arms
around her but she couldnt always be in
his arms and when she wasnt she couldnt
ignore the hateful thing between their fam-
ilies that seemed bent on overpowering them
and on destroying everything that she and
ranee shared between them

he blasting heat day by
day sucked the life from the
ground turned the cotton-
wood leaves to paper dry-
ness dried the patience and
kindness from mens tem-
pers julie felt the tension in the air

  things got worse instead of better jess
jarrett and tim macallister had a brawl
on calibers main street there were brok-
en macallister fences things were making
for a head julie could feel it in her bones
and the dread inside of her grew and grew
not even the swift broken meetings with
ranee in the brasada could hold it in check
for ranee and she were as apt to quarrel
now as kiss and the quarrel was always

the same and julie grew more afraid

  then one day the sharp-eyed jess who
never missed anything saw julie and ranee
together and told brade about it brade
was furious julie had never seen the con-
trolled strength of him slip so nearly out of
harness he caught her by the arms and
shook her he stormed at her his eyes
fierce and ink-black in their anger

  stop it brade she cried shaking her-
self free you have no right this has
nothing to do with you

  it has he raged im as much a
jarrett as any of you and some day you
and i are-well were going to be the
jarretts around here this will be ours
julie and nobody elses

  his words made no sense but julie didnt
question them then brade was merely
ranting in anger and then his tone changed
quickly softened almost to a whisper and
he put his- arm around her

  i love you julie dont you know that
ive loved you ever since i can remember
and sometimes i go nearly loco with want-
ing you nobodys going to take you from
me hear nobody and specially not a
macallister not that ranee-

  she pushed him firmly away from her
i didnt know you felt like this brade
and im sorry truly but a person cant
take from you something that never was
yours

  ill make you love me julie

  no brade not ever

  so now she had brade to worry about
too to worry about and fear a little if
she hadnt had brade on her mind so much
she never would have let that quarrel with
ranee run on bitter and unchecked the
way she did

  but suddenly they were saying mean
things to each other things neither of them
meant then julie gripped his arm and
said hush ranee we mustnt quarrel
like this please

  it was too late though the stiffness in
ranee wouldnt melt the temper shed
known and feared in him ever since she
could remember flared up and stared at
her naked out of his narrowed eyes

  theres no use to quarrel he told her
savagely you stop being stubborn
but ive told you ranee i want our
double trouble



marriage to be-well a sort of seal between
our families a mark of peace i cant just
marry you and stop being what i am i
cant desert them like that

  no matter what you are he insisted
once you marry me youll be a macaliis-
ter and no other thing so are you going
to marry me right now-my way-or arent
you

  helplessly she shook her head she knew
she was right i cant ranee we have
to wait

  she could feel him trembling against her
that all youve a mind to say

  tears stung her eyes hot and helpless
and salty i dont want it to be ranee

  is it

  she loosened his hold while things
are like this it has to be she waited a
minute for him to speak then she mounted
the brockled mare and flicked the reins

  when she looked back from the rise of
the mesa he was still standing where she
had left him the set of his body taut with
rage his eyes staring stonily after her

  she hadnt gone more than half a mile
when she heard the high whine of the rifle
she stopped the horse and sat trembling
then she wheeled the mare around and
galloped back to the brasada

  even from a distance she could tell it
wasnt ranee lying there stretched out on
the hard red clay it was jess the back
of his shirt was wet with blood when she
touched it it was awful seeing him like
that so lifeless and still and yet somehow
she could feel no surprise something deep
in her had expected this or something
equally evil

  and in that moment her whole body
seemed to freeze her movements as she
got back on the mare to ride to the house
for help were stiff and jerky like a puppets
she couldnt even cry it was as if all the
life in her had died out completely

  she tried not to think of ranee and the
flaming ugly mood she had left him in she
tried not to remember that jess had seen
them once that he might have quarreled
with ranee after she had left more than
anything else she would not permit her
mind to dwell on the rifle bullet that had
entered jesss body from the back

  she had almost reached the place where

shed heard the shot when she met brade
barnett his white horse was coming
toward her at a gallop red dust streaking
the sweat foam on his flanks

  i passed ranee on the road back from
town he said he was going like blazes
whats the matter julie

  back there-jess- was all she could
manage to say

  jess didnt live very long after they got
him back to the house he didnt even get
to say who had shot him but the jarretts
in their silent stricken angry grief didnt
need to hear the name of macaliister spok-
en they scarcely looked up when jesss
twin jonas his face all ugly and twisted
the cords swelling out on his neck began
to curse in a low ugly monotone

  them macallisters this is the first
killing between us but it aint going to be
the last

  hush up jonas grampa said sharply
we dont know nothin yet jonass big
face crumpled then and he began to cry
it was a terrible thing to see

mong the cottonwoods
the next day they quietly
buried jess and although
jonas and phil barnett
brades brother wanted
them to ride down and
macallisters right away
grampa jarrett held them back theres
law here he said stonily well wait and
see what the law does and he sent brade
in to the sheriff

  it was the next day that ranee came
up to the mesa julie was out by the barn
when suddenly ranee his face white and
more troubled than shed ever seen it
loomed up beside her

  at the sight of him she gasped ranee
-you must be crazy-coming here go
away quickly

  he gripped her by the arm you gotta
listen julie i-i quit my folks what they
did last night was something so dirty-
mean i couldnt stand for it family or no
i came up here to warn you people you
told me what that herd meant to you and-
she shook herself free i dont know
what youre talking about but my cousin
jess is dead ranee did you- she


richard worthington

choked on the question and ranee seemed
not to hear her

  i know im awful sorry julie the
bigness of having cut himself off from his
family seemed to be all that he could take
in julie listen

  she made herself say it then slowly and
with a terrible distinctness did you kill
him ranee

  his eyes turned hard and clear i heard
he was shot in the back julie he said
softly as if that was his only answer

  ranee i-i have to hear you say it
right out dont you see how it must look 
her voice rose shakily i left you there
-where he was found you were angry
you-

  a shadow moved across the ground be-
tween them and she was staring up into
brades face so it was ranee he said
quietly vindictively he swept julie aside
and caught ranees shoulder his fist balled
into a knot and julie flung herself across
his arm shed seen brade split a board
with a blow of that fist

  then somehow the others were there
all of them things were moving with the
swift unreality of a nightmare and brade
in that flat angry tone was accusing ranee
of killing jess i heard julie say it

  no-n you didnt i never- her
dazed protest was lost in the angry shout
that went up jonas lunged forward his
fingers hooked out to grab ranees throat

  it dont take much rope to hang a back-
shooter he said bitterly whatre we
waitin for

  hold on grampa jarrett commanded
hell keep right now we got somethin to
worry about more important even than jess
phil and mes just been down to the crick
its gone bone-dry if we dont get that
herd watered somehow were goin to lose
every last head

  ranee shook himself free of jonas hands
that crick never ran dry he said my
-my people blocked it up turned it out of
the channel thats what i came up here
to tell you i dont fight with dumb crit-
ters his mouth squared and i dont
shoot a man in the back

  looks like you came a little late
grampa jarrett said stiffly

  i didnt know about it until just now

but i know where the block is and how
you can get at it to blast it loose

  hes lying brade said julie musta
told him how much that herd counted to us
that it was sell it or quit and thats why
they done it only reason he came up here
likely was to find out anythin else he could
that might do us a hurt

  ranee lunged forward his fists swinging
but jonas and phil shoved him back you
better show us quick grampa said i
dont know as ive mind to hold the boys
back much longer

  ill show you ranee said wearily
you can slide down that gully there by
the south corner of the mesa its right at
the bottom they got the stream blocked off
when they got there and moved to the
mesa rim a shot spat out from below
theyre waitin for us brade shouted
and warned the others back the whole
thing was just a trick to get us inside their
rifle sights

  peering cautiously over the edge they
could see where a fall of boulders damned
the creek sending its waters to spill out
over the rocky ground shutting it off from
the lowlands where the herd was pastured
on the mesas lowest slope they could see
it but with macallister guns trained on
every inch of that all-but-naked incline they
couldnt hope to reach it

  get your dynamite ranee said sweat
shining on his set face if youre scared
to go down ill do it mebbe thatll prove
i dont want any part of this his eyes
rested for a minute on julies face mebbe
if they put a bullet in me youll know im
not lying about this or anything else

a nd so hed gone with a defiant shout
l- to his kin below and a brief last look
at julie gone down there between the two
groups of guns

  brades threat still hung in julies ears
the sun shone redly against julies half-
closed eyelids its redness made her think
oddly of the brasada floor where jess had
lain red dust   

  her mind fumbled groped for something
and then with a quick little intake of breath
she found it she remembered the red dust
she had seen on brades horse the day jess
had died brade hadnt been to town hed
double trouble



been on the brasada too he must have
been there wasnt any other red clay for
miles around

  swifter than light her mind flashed back
over brades words and actions brades
threats about ranee the fierce ambition
that rankled in him to be more jarrett than
the rest to be the head of the family some
day with julie by his side the burning
unchecked power shed felt in him

  she couldnt add it all up yet but in those
swift split seconds her mind and body
tensed to a decision even as brade pulled
trigger she thrust herself sharply against
him spoiling his aim his bullet went wild
and ranee flattened swiftly against the
rocks below from the macallister ambush
as if in answer to brades shot came two
others one spanged against the rock where
ranee was crouching the second fired by
col macallister at close range sent tim
macallister sprawling out on the gully
floor julied seen it with her own eyes
and yet she couldnt believe it then the
colonel stooped swiftly and dragged tim
back wounded in one arm nobody else
moved a muscle

  the colonel shot tim julie said won-
deringly but why

  thats what we better find out gram-
pa jarrett said no wait brade

  and then the colonel a handkerchief
flickering white in his fingers came climbing
up the slope i reckon you and i had bet-
ter have a talk he said to grampa when he
reached the top and somebodyd better
take brades gun he turned to brade
directly i couldnt let tim shoot ranee
brade not even if tim was taking orders
from you

  somehow in the hushed bitter weari-
ness of the colonels voice the nightmare
was ended it released julie and the others
she ran down the slope to ranees side

  brade couldnt talk but tim was scared
and he told them how it was he and brade
hadnt stopped seeing each other except
openly all the things that had gone wrong
between the two families tim or brade had
contrived the cut wires the poisoned
water holes

  brade wanted to start the fightin up
again tim said he never said exactly
why but i had to help him-he had a big

iou of mine i couldnt pay threatened
to put me in jail he even gave me the
idea for blockin this stream and for lettin
ranee find out about it he figgered it out
we could catch ranee between the guns and
kill him without it lookin like a murder
he sure hated ranee because o julie i
guess but i never meant to kill ranee
just put a bullet in him somewheres to
satisfy brade

  i can see why braded want to kill me
ranee said later when he and julie had
ridden almost by instinct out to the bra-
sada but why jess-and what was the
point to starting our folks fighting again
you couldnt fool jess about what was
going on julie said he knew every-
thing he must have found out about
brade and tim maybe he saw them meet
i think brade forced jess out to the brasada
at the point of the gun and shot him before
jess could tell anybody about it jess would
have given brade a chance to explain be-
fore he told anybody else that honesty
cost him his life

  and about the feuding-unless you
knew what brade was really like it would
sound crazy but brade wanted to be the
head of the family when grampa died he
and i were going to rule the jarretts to-
gether he thought jesse and jonas stood
in his way if he could get the jarretts and
the macalisters really in a range war he
could come out on top

  but how about justines husband phil
-thats brades own brother he couldnt
have meant to kill him too

  julie sighed phils weak he wouldnt
have made a fuss about letting brade run
things besides justines always wanted to
get away i think brade could have bought
them out    and whatever trouble there
was between the families made everything
just that much more impossible for us
he came awful close to getting what he
was after ranee said his arm tightening
around julies waist

  so close it frightens me ranee

  but he didnt julie and thats what
matters so now all youve got to do is
say youll marry me- he smiled-my
way

  your way ranee or any way at all
and she turned her face up for him to kiss
the man who
couldnt miss

by paul evan lehman

it was an uncanny shill with which hed been born and there came a time
when kent bradford would have given the whole world to be without it

i

u nhappy ivarriar

yd harpers still in town
the man said it from the cor-
ner of his mouth and in a voice
intended only for the cowboy
who stood at the hitching-rail
kent bradford made no re-
ply but almost imperceptibly his features
froze inwardly he went cold and sick not
with fear-but with repugnance

  for a moment longer he stood there
bracing himself for what must come then
stepped reluctantly to the plank sidewalk
and started along the street men nodded
soberly to him as he passed only their eyes
showing the avid interest they felt one of
them warned him in a whisper inside the
ace high cowboy

again bradford gave no sign that he had

heard he continued on his way his tread
catlike the granite cast of his face lending
him an appearance of age far beyond his
years he wondered vaguely if billy the
kid had felt as he did when billy fell
under the bullet of pat garrett he had
killed a white man for every year of his life

  there were few people on the street but
bradford could feel their eyes stabbing at
him from beyond doors and windows near
the ace high he cut into the street and
crossed it diagonally to a store pie sat


 down on the low step and mechanically
 rolled a cigarette the saloon was directly
 opposite and from within it came a voice
 the words indistinguishable that would
 be harper making his brags a light foot-
 step sounded behind kent but he did not
 turn then he caught sight of a riding
 skirt and a pair of small boots and got to
 his feet howdy ellen he said and
 touched his hat

   she turned to look up at him and he saw
 that her face wras pale so youre stalking
 another victim she said

   victim

   kent you cant fool me everybodys
 talking about how you and syd harper
 quarreled last night and how you ordered
 him out of town and now youve come in
 to enforce your order you with your
 uncanny skill

   he regarded her stonily you dont
 understand ellen

   i understand all thats necessary she
 answered in her sharp school-teacher man-
 ner youre going to wound him just as
 youve wounded half a dozen others before
 him youre going to break his arm or his
 leg or his ribs-maim him for life perhaps
 just because of some little differences some
 fancied slight- she broke off and he
 saw that her lashes were wet if you do
 ill never speak to you again  i wont teach
 here another year ill find another school
 if you harm syd harper ill leave elk-
 horn

   she turned quickly and went down the
 street and kent bradford stood looking
 after her until she had turned the corner
 for a few seconds her ultimatum had jarred
 him out of his hardness the pain he felt
 at her words showed in his eyes the




paul evan lehman

muscles of his face she didnt understand
women never did to back out now would
be to concede syd harper a moral victory
others would gain courage from this sign
of weakness and they would dog him and
make him swallow insults until in despera-
tion he must shoot again and again and
in the end he would have to kill

  a moment of hot resentment filled him
why had nature given him this strange
gift which was his he had shot accurately
ever since he could remember shooting at
all from his earliest days some sort of
gun had been his plaything he had cut
his teeth on a wooden one carved by his
father had owned a twenty-two when other
boys toted cap pistols and a peacemaker
colt when he was still so small that he
sagged under the weight of it and had to
hold it with both hands to shoot his brain
had become a calculating machine which
computed angles and deflection and wind-
age and velocity all in one instantaneous
involuntary operation he had been marked
as the man who couldnt miss

  he sank back on the step again now he
could realize that the ending had been
inevitable his unusual ability at target
shooting had stirred the competitive spirit
of others even as a boy he had contested
with men who had used the sixgun all their
lives as his reputation spread men went
out of their way to test their skill against
his invariably he won the reluctance
to admit anothers superiority is a human
trait for every champion there are a
thousand less competent who firmly believe
themselves better and are never satisfied
until the issue has been joined and even
after defeat they want to try again

  beaten at target shooting there were
those who said just wait until the boy
goes up against the real thing shooting
at a man is a heap different from shooting
at bottles or tin cans when you have to
shoot or be shot-thats the test

  so at last came the time when kent
bradford had to shoot for his life in that
day an encounter with sixguns was not
difficult to bring about a studied insult
a blow an offensive action and the oppor-
tunity was there kent was eighteen when
his first gunfight was forced on him confi-
dent of his ability young and filled with

the love of life he had not tried to kill
his opponent merely drilling a neat hole
in the fellows shoulder almost before that
surprised person had yanked his gun

  other gunfights followed and in all of
them young bradford had stuck to a de-
termination not to kill this very deter-
mination brought on more contestants who
might have hesitated had they known that
they must pay for failure with their lives
and kent found himself forced to shoot
faster and closer now he must shoot it
out with syd harper the handsome
smooth-tongued gambler who had come to
elkhorn a few weeks before

  kent became aware of movement in the
saloon across the street he had heard
syd harpers voice  one last round
boys without its significance registering
now came the soft tread of feet and the
vague features of a man peering over the
half-doors

  an icy chill swept over kent bradford
followed almost immediately by a comforta-
ble glowing warmness his face assumed
its hard lines again but the rest of him re-
mained relaxed easy he didnt feel for
his gun he didnt need to he knew that
gun as he knew his right hand it was al-
ways there and ready he didnt even get
up

  the doors parted and harper stepped
out he was crouched and his fingers were
hooked above the butt of his gun his keen
black eyes bored across the street at the
figure lounging on the store steps he took
three quick strides and as the swinging
doors rocked lazily behind him came to a
stop at the end of the hitching-rack

  bradfords face did not change expres-
sion he was resting with his left elbow
on the step above that on which he sat his
right side turned slightly towards harper
his gun was belted tight about him butt
forward on the left side he used a cross-
body draw and his right arm was entirely
free

  harper went into action with a sudden-
ness calculated to disconcert his opponent
there was a blur of movement so smooth
as almost to defy detection the fingers
closed on the butt of the low-hung gun and
drew it in one motion

  there was an explosion but it wasnt
the man who couldnt miss



syds gun even before the seven-and-one-
half-inch barrel had cleared leather kent
drew and fired it is doubtful if any of those
who watched so avidly even saw the draw
one instant he was lounging there on the
steps with his right hand empty the next
he still lounged but flame was leaping from
his extended arm

  the bullet hit the iron barrel of harpers
colt and tore it from his grasp as though
it had been struck with a sledge so aston-
ishing was it that syd just stood there and
stared and as he stared the gun on the
far side of the street slipped smoothly into
its holster and kent bradfords words
reached him

  i said to get out of town harper
reckon now you know i meant it

  syd mouth open raised his right hand
and gazed at it as though he found it im-
possible to believe that it was empty then
the red of mortification rose in his cheeks
and the look of astonishment gave way to
one of rage and frustration he straight-
ened looked long and hard at the lounging
figure on the store steps then turned as
though to go back into the saloon

  but he didnt concealed by his body
his right hand dived beneath his coat and
came out with the short-barreled gun he
carried in a shoulder holster he spun on
one heel checked the motion fired quickly
at bradford and this time kent really
had to shoot the movement had caught
him off his guard but so rapid was it that
it also spoiled syds aim the bullet
plunked into the step at bradfords side and
the next instant the peacemaker was out
and another streak of fire darted at syd
like the tongue of a snake

  the man staggered with the impact of the
lead recovered his balance stood swaying
for three seconds-back forth back forth
back forth he tried to raise the der-
ringer but couldnt quite do it he collapsed
suddenly and completely like a wet rag

  kent sighed and got to his feet his
glance went to the corner around which
ellen had vanished she was standing
there watching and he knew he would
carry the picture of her face to his grave
then she was gone and he walked wearily
as if each step was an effort across the
street towards his horse

ii

flight

fair-haired boy of
twenty crossed in front of
him on the run damn
you bradford he cried
as he passed he was el-
lens brother ronald

  kent gave no sign that he had heard but
his face was bleak as he swung into the
saddle ronnie had liked him once but
syd harper had turned the boy against
him and ronnies friendship for syd had
undoubtedly influenced ellen

  he flashed a quick look towards the sa-
loon as he pivoted his horse ronnie was
on his knees beside the stricken harper
and was working over him kent heard
him say couple of you boys give me a
hand well take him over to my house

  as kent turned back his eyes met those
of ellen she didnt say a word but in her
hot glance he read scorn and disappoint-
ment and dislike at the moment he felt
sure she hated him he groaned inwrardly
and spurred his horse to a lope again he
had tried to miss a vital spot but his shot
had been hurried and there was ever pres-
ent the haunting fear that the bullet had
struck an inch or so wide of where he had
intended it to strike the sweat stood out
on his forehead god knew he wanted no
mans life

  he reached his fathers ranch at noon
and mechanically took his place at the table
john bradford knew he had ordered har-
per out of town but they had kept word
of the quarrel from kents mother when
they left the table and went outside the
elder bradford said harper leave

  no

  you have to-

  wounded him

  john bradford sighed his relief he had
been responsible in a large measure for his
sons skill and at first had taken huge pride
in it but as this uncanny ability grew
pride was replaced by awe and then dis-
may he had no wish to see his son trans-
formed into a killer and most certainly did
not want him injured

  sooner or later youre goin to have to


paul evan lehman

shoot for keeps he said flatly you know
that

  not if i can help it then passion-
ately why dont the fools let me alone
cant they understand they havent a
chance there was no boastfulness about
it he stated it as a plain fact

  only thing they realize is that you al-
ways shoot to wound menll take all sorts
of chances to prove theyre better than you
as long as they know theyre goin to come
through alive the thing that worries me
is that one of these days theyre goin to
gang up on you and youll have to kill
somebody or get killed yourself and
theres only one way out of it he went
on vehemently get out of elkhorn and
go where nobody knows you keep out
of quarrels if you make an enemy go
somewhere else let the fools think what
they will youll know youre the better
man thats sufficient

kent spoke slowly you mean that
yes john bradford made a passion-
ate gesture i know it sounds haywire
cornin from me but its the only way
if you were in my place would you
go

  john bradford opened his mouth closed
it again no he said finally i would-
nt have the courage to go i hoped that
you had if not-well i know sheriff cun-
ningham right well i believe i can get him
to take you on as a deputy then at least
youll be shootin on the side of the law
and men wont be so anxious to cross you
kent shook his head i dont want the
death of any man hanging over me ill
never deliberately shoot to kill

  there it ended for the time being kent
inquired regularly about syd harper and
learned that while his bullet had struck
where he had aimed infection had set in
and the man was in grave danger he was
at the blake home and ellen was nursing
him for a week kent was in torment
then came word that harper was improv-
ing and kents spirits rose

  he stuck close to the ranch and made
no effort to see ellen it would be useless
ellen had come from the east with her
brother and had secured a position teach-
ing in elkhorns school she had been
reared in an entirely different environment

and time alone could demonstrate to her
that to survive in the west a man must be
his own law to a great extent only the
stoutness of his heart and strict adherence
to the code would suffice honesty indus-
try and courage were essential but above
all stood the ability to hold whatever pres-
tige and property he had earned

  the words of his father remained with
kent and the more he pondered them the
stronger their significance became he had
never thought it courageous to flee now
he saw that with all the odds in his favor
a gunfight assumed the level of a boxing
bout between an unbeatable champion and
a novice there could be no glory in win-
ning no honor and so one day a month
after the shooting he rode to elkhorn to
find ellen and tell her of his decision to
leave and to beg for a word which would
let him hope that some day when he had
established himself he might dare send
for her

  he stopped at a store to make a pur-
chase and the proprietor offered a bit of
news reckon were goin to loose our
school maam ronnie just bought three
tickets for the mornin stage theyre leav-
in with syd harper too bad ellen was
sure a good teacher my kids are crazy
about her

  kent left the store in a daze she had
told him she w-ould leave if he fought with
harper but he had hoped that the threat
would be forgotten when the thing blew
over as he stood there absently shaping
a cigarette he saw her cross the street
and enter the house where she and ronnie
lived he dropped the cigarette and strode
after her

  ronnie opened the door to his knock and
stood there regarding him coldly id like
to speak to ellen for a moment said kent
bradford

  shes not in

  yes she is ronnie

  not to you she isnt you got a lot of
gall bradford calling after what she told
you

  kent felt anger rising in him but he
answered calmly enough ronnie youre
a man you ought to understand i could
have killed harper but i didnt i only
shot the gun out of his hand then he
the man who couldnt miss



pulled a derringer on me what was i
supposed to do then

  wasnt your fault you didnt kill him
sneered ronnie you cant tell me that a
man shooting for his life would try to hit
the other fellows gun you read about
that kind of marksmanship but you never
see it personally i think your skill has
been overrated youve just been plain
lucky

  kent simply stared at him this was
the raw inexperienced youth talking-a
youth secure in the knowledge that no harm
could come to him while his sister w-as with-
in earshot

  ronnie grew uneasy under the steady
scrutiny what are you looking at

  a rare specimen of the jackass that
walks on his hind legs answered kent
quietly ronnie youre safe enough from
me but if you ever come face to face with
a real killer dont taunt him about his
skill

  he turned and walked swiftly away

  early the next morning he rode again
to town the stage was outside the sta-
tion kent dismounted near it and stood
at a corner of the building his face hard
and inscrutable presently ellen and ron-
nie and syd harper came up ronnie car-
rying the baggage ellen walking besides
syd who was pale of face and evidently
still weak

  kent watched them steadily and the
girl catching his gaze flushed and turned
her head she helped syd into the coach
and stepped in after him taking a place on
the far side ronnie tossed the baggage
to the top of the coach gave kent a scowl-
ing glance and followed the stage was off
in a cloud of dust without even a backward
glance from any of the three

  kent remained there for some minutes
still poker-faced and cold until the tumult
within him broke its bonds and all the
anguish and despair bespoke itself in a
harsh hell leaving his horse he went
to the nearest saloon and bought a quart of
whiskey and spent the rest of the morning
in a silent and thorough debauch men
came into the place took one look at his
scowling face and hastily left again the
bartender didnt have to tell them that
kent bradford was in a dangerous mood

  at noon kent staggered to his horse
lifted himself into the saddle and rode far
out into the hills in a little glade where
he and ellen had spent many a happy mo-
ment he dropped the reins slid to the
ground and fell on his face in the cool
grass

  it was dusk when he got up cold sober
but sick of heart his jaw was set deter-
minedly and his eyes blazed with purpose
he rode to the ranch packed some treas-
ured possessions and went to bed in the
morning he sought out his father

  im goin to do what you advised
he said quietly im goin away to some
place where nobody knows me im goin
to dodge trouble ill shoot if i have to
but ill keep on shootin to miss

  the two men looked at each other long
and hard youll need money said the
elder bradford

  kent shook his head ive enough
dont worry im not goin wrong but
im goin to find some place where i dont
need eyes in the back of my head

  their hands met in a long grip youll
write to your mother

  kent nodded and turned away hazing
the pack horse before him he rode from
the ranch

ill

the bald-headed man

e followed the
stage road north to
junction city and there
made inquiries regard-
ing the three travelers
but junction city was a
large place on the butterfield stage route
with several lines radiating from it and he
received conflicting information one agent
thought the party had gone west another
had the impression that they had gone east
kent gave up the vague idea of pursuit with
a feeling that was akin to despair hope
dies hard even though his common sense
told him it would do him no good to find
ellen he wanted to see her again to tell
her of his new resolve and his determina-
tion to go through with it regardless of
her feelings toward him


paul evan lehman

  he headed westward for a short distance
then cut north into new mexico there
he got a job on a ranch near a little town
called sabado and mixing an expert knowl-
edge of cattle with a deal of hard work
soon established himself in the confidence
of the owner

  his rapid advancement invoked some
jealousy on the part of his fellow cowboys
but in keeping with his resolve kent did
not permit this to ruffle him his failure
to resent covert insults invited plainer ones
and at times the fight to keep his temper
was a hard one particularly was this so in
the case of the foreman a big hard capable
man named wentworth who recognized in
kents ability a threat to his own job he
rode bradford unmercifully and assigned
to him all the disagreeable tasks which had
to be done kents slightest mistakes were
brought to the attention of the boss and
when wentworth ran out of complaints he
invented them

  the crisis came at last as kent knew
it must sooner or later a piece of quick-
sand had been fenced off and it was kents
duty to see that this wire remained in good
repair one noon he returned from sabado
with a wagonload of supplies to find the
boss wrathfully waiting for him during
the night a section of the fence had been
trampled down and two of the outfits
prize bulls had become mired a rider had
found them that morning and had man-
aged to drag one out but the other was so
firmly mired that it had had to be destroyed

  kent listened tight-lipped while the old
man bawled him out for not taking better
care of the fence then got his horse and
rode to the place new wire had been
strung but he saw that the break had oc-
curred at a point which he had inspected
the evening before and had found in good
condition he returned to the home ranch
and went to the scrap pile where he found
the wire which had been replaced it had
been cut with pliers not broken angry
to the core he strode into the mess shack
and directly to wentworth

  reckon you know that wire was cut
he said tightly

  youre crazy wentworth told him

  if you inspected it when the line rider
told you it was down youd have seen it

was cut if you didnt youre a hell of a
foreman

  wentworth pushed back his chair and
got to his feet you tellin me i dont
know my business

  your business is to get rid of me
kent told him quietly and id say you
know that too danged well wentworth
im sayin you cut that wire yourself

  why you damned meddlin pilgrim
exploded wentworth and swung a fist
which if it had landed must have knocked
kent through the wall

  it didnt land kent anticipating it
sidestepped and threw a right of his own
which caught the foreman squarely on the
chin and knocked him over his chair as
he went down his hand found the gun
which had been hanging in its belt on the
back of the chair

  dont try it warned kent sharply
but wentworth was beyond reasoning not
only had he been exposed before the crew
but also he had been humiliated by a man
who heretofore had been the object of their
scorn to give him his due he had no
intention of shooting kent a shot close
to the latters head should be sufficient to
cow that brash young man but kent did
not know this and as wentworth jerked
up the gun his own right hand crossed his
body in that magically swift draw which
these men had never seen before

  some of them declared afterwards that
they didnt see it even then one moment
kent stood erect and poised his hands at
his sides and the next a gun was spitting
flame and lead wentworth dropped his
gun with an involuntary cry of surprise
and pain and reached over to grip his dan-
gling mutilated wrist with his free hand
and before he had completed the action
kents gun was back in its holster

  wentworth he said coldly youre a
fool i dont want your job and never did
as for the rest of you- he turned to sur-
vey them- youre almost as foolish as he
is you might have known that when a
fellow swallows the stuff youve been hand-
in out its because hes got a good reason
for it now if any of you feel like takin
this up where wentworth left off-with
fists or guns or tiddleywinks-ill be
around this place for ten more minutes
the man who couldnt miss



  then he turned and walked out of the
mess shack

  packing his possessions was a matter of
a few minutes and at the end of the time
specified he started away from the ranch
driving the packhorse before him and with
out even telling the boss good-bye as he
was passing the mess shack a man came out
and intercepted him kent eyed him nar-
rowly but the fellow had no appearance of
belligerency about him and when he halted
by kents horse there was only friendliness
and respect in his eyes

  jest wanted to tell you he said that
im plumb ashamed of myself i shore had
you sized up wrong bradford you feel
like shakin hands

  kent shook his hand and rode on the
incident increased his bitterness at having
to leave a place which he had come to like
but he realized that the showdown had been
inevitable he wondered if it would be the
same the next time he stopped and re-
newed his resolve to keep away from gun-
play except as a last resort but no more
insult would he take turning the other
cheek he had learned merely made the
other fellow bolder

  he rode leisurely northwestward pick-
ing up supplies at the occasional towns
through which he passed there were
ranches where he might have secured em-
ployment for roundup time wras coming
on but he pushed on with the idea of con-
tinuing to california he was destined to
get no farther than the foothills of nevada

  riding through these in the cool of an
evening he came to a path branching off
from the wrell worn pack trail he was fol-
lowing modoc was the next town and
he had planned to continue riding until he
reached it but now he drew rein and con-
sidered he would reach modoc after night-
fall and accommodations might not be easy
to secure perhaps it would be better to
camp out this night the woods into which
the little path disappeared looked inviting
and he finally turned into the path he had
not gone a mile when he suddenly emerged
on a barren slope pitted with disused min-
ing shafts and containing a few deserted
buildings the place was drab and unin-
viting and kent made a wry grimace as
he surrendered hope of finding a cool and

comfortable camping site however when
he dismounted and looked about he discov-
ered that what had once been the mess
shack was sound and clean with a good
cook stove in working order and a bunk
behind a partition and he decided to spend
the night here

   he packed his gear to the little room be-
hind the partition led the horses to a draw
where he found water and grass then re-
turned to the shack cooked and ate a good
supper and turned in he fell asleep al-
most at once

  he awoke to the soft plop of hoofs out-
side the shack and lay there listening the
horse stopped at the door and he heard the
creak of saddle leather as the rider dis-
mounted then the door opened and some-
body entered a moment later dim light
showed through the doorway at the foot
of the bunk and kent knew the newcomer
had lighted a lantern

  kents first thought was that somebody
had been using the place as living quarters
but then he remembered that there w-ere
no supplies of food and bedding in the shack
as would have been the case in that event
so instead of announcing his presence he
remained quiet the man on the other side
of the partition walked slowly up and down
the floor stopping occasionally at the out-
side doorway and presently kent heard
another horse approach and halt at the
shack the lowered voice of its rider came
as he was dismounting

  think its safe to burn that lantern

  safe enough nobody ever comes here
anyhow weve got to use it come along
and ill show you that place i told you
about its made to order but you couldnt
find it unless you knew where it is leave
your horse here

  they moved away from the shack and
kent got up and stole to the outer doorway
he could see the lantern bobbing along
some fifty feet to his right after a while
it disappeared beyond a building and he
went back to his bunk he did not know
how long they would be gone and moving
all his gear would take time the fact that
they had left their horses saddled would
indicate that their visit would not be a long
one and if he kept quiet they were not
likely to detect his presence one of them


paul evan lehman

he decided had found a vein of gold or
silver that had been overlooked and was
showing it to the other this would ex-
plain their secrecy

  after a while they returned and halted
outside the doorway to talk kent could
not hear what they said and presently one
of them mounted and rode away the
other came into the shack and kent stole to
the doorway and chanced a glance into the
other room the man had raised the globe
of the lantern and was about to blow out
the flame he held his hat in the hand
which had raised the globe and kent saw
a smooth-shaven face and a head as devoid
of hair as were his cheeks the flame
leaped and died and in the ensuing dark-
ness kent heard him hang the lantern on
a nail and leave the building again came
the soft beat of hoofs and then silence
kent went back to bed and this time slept
through until daylight

  it was mid-morning when he rode into
the mining town of modoc it appeared to
be a thriving community of considerable
size with several stores a stage station
and a new brick bank he drew rein at a
hitching-rail outside one of the stores and
swung to the ground pausing there to roll
and light a cigarette it was his intention
to replenish his supplies and push on west-
ward he blew out the match broke it
and dropped it into the dust and flashed
a casual glance across his saddle at the
store and as he did so two persons came
out of the building and at sight of them
his heart missed a beat and for a moment
his brain went numb

  one of them was syd harper the other
was ellen blake

iv

deep water

ents first reaction
was shock-shock so
strong as to obliterate
surprise at seeing her
here in the few
months since last he
had looked into her face ellen had aged
ten years her eyes held a haunted wor-
ried expression and there were shadows

under them the brow which he remem-
bered as soft and smooth now showed tiny
lines of anxiety there was a downward
droop at the corners of the mouth which
in the past had smiled so readily her
whole attitude suggested worry anxiety
fear

  they had not noticed him and as they
descended to the sidewalk he bent his head
and busied himself with a latigo strap
from the far side of the hitching-rail came
her voice lowered but intense you can
do something about it he spends his time
in your palace hell listen to you
harper answered smoothly my dear
girl youre mistaken ronnies young and
headstrong hell listen to nobody if you
cant do anything with him i certainly
cant

  you can refuse to serve him drinks
refuse to let him gamble

  on what grounds ronnies free white
and old enough to look out for himself
also he holds a position of some promi-
nence-teller in the bank i cant interfere
with his freedom without a good excuse
its just that you wont help me
there was despair in ellens voice

  i would if i could

  for a moment there was silence then
kent heard the click of her heels on the
plank sidewalk he ventured a glance over
his horses back syd harper was looking
after her a half-smile on his lips then
he turned for the first time aware of a pres-
ence near him but kent bent his head
again and all that harper saw was the
broad-brimmed hat of a man engaged with
his rig he went on down the street and
now it was kent who did the gazing

  the old inscrutable poker expression had
returned to bradfords face ellen was
suffering and because he loved her so well
he suffered with her ducking under the
rail he started after her saw her turn into
a cottage followed swiftly and rapped on
the door she answrered at once and for
several seconds stood there staring at him
and his heart leaped at the light which
flamed in her eyes even though it was
quickly hidden

  you followed me she accused sharply
only to this cabin not to modoc i
never dreamed you were here
the man who couldnt miss



  the ring of truth was in his voice and
after a moment she said come in and
led the way to a little parlor and motioned
to a chair you mean that you just hap-
pened to come to modoc

  yes but im glad for youre in trou-
ble

  what do you mean

  he made a quick gesture i saw it at
once your face-your manner ellen
what is it

  she turned her head and he knew she
was struggling with her emotion

  its ronnie isnt it and syd harper
she faced him then her eyes flashing
kent sometimes ive wished that-that
youd-

  killed him

  no oh no i shouldnt have said
that

  ellen listen back there in elkhorn
i saw what was happening a tenderfoot
kid like ronnies got no right to play with
a professional gambler like syd harper
syd was robbin him blind and when i
tried to reason with him he got mad at me
he just wouldnt listen

  there was comprehension in her eyes
now and so she said tightly you or-
dered syd out of town

  yes when he refused to go- kent
made a despairing gesture but thats
over now when he came so near to dying
i made up my mind to quit gunfighting i
told myself id swallow insults or resent
them with my fists i came to elkhorn that
day to tell you so-and had to stand there
and watch you ride away on the stage it
was hard but i made up my mind to stick
to my resolution i knew id have to go
somewhere where i wasnt known and i
followed you as far as junction city i
lost you there

  i got a job in new mexico and was
gettin along fine until i tangled with the
foreman of the outfit i started out with
my fists but had to finish with a gun so
i left there and started west for california
i rode into modoc just in time to see you
come out of the store and i followed you
here because i felt you needed me

  her eyes warmed that was sweet of
you kent i-i think i understand a little
better now in the three months since we

left elkhorn ive watched ronnie start
downhill without being able to do a thing
about it ive wished sometimes that i was
a man and had some of that uncanny skill
f yours

  the boys been gamblin with syd

  she nodded and drinking too you
see im being quite frank with you and
kent its a crime ronnies a good boy
and syd got him a job right away with the
bank its a fine position and a responsi-
ble one for the bank handles thousands of
dollars buying gold and silver and ship-
ping it to the mint but if ronnie doesnt
straighten out hell lose his job no bank
is going to keep a man who gambles and
drinks

  kent got up i reckon a heart-to-heart
talk with syd harper might do some
good

  no she got up too and came over
to where he stood kent you mustnt
this isnt elkhorn this is syds town he
owns the silver palace and several stores
and pays the marshal out of his own pocket
you mustnt antagonize him promise me
you wont

  he looked down into her anxious eyes
and sighed you win ellen just like
you always do i wont cross him-until
i get the goods on him then nothin will
stop me not even you ellen

  he left them carrying with him the
memory of her warm handclasp things
were bad ronnie was teller in the bank
and was gambling more money that he
could afford to lose it wasnt merely his
job that was at stake but his honesty and
integrity and the pride of his sister get-
ting ronnie the job would make it appear
as though syd harper were interested in
the boys welfare but kent knew that was-
nt so or syd would refuse to put him in
the way of temptation what then was
harpers object

  kent went into the bank and to the tell-
ers window ronnie was checking a de-
posit slip and did not glance up at once
he too had aged there was a harassed
air about him that showed even above his
preoccupation with his task growing signs
of dissipation were there too

  hello ronnie said kent quietly

  if he had fired a gun he could not have


paul evan lehman

startled the boy more ronnies head
jerked up and there was stark fear in his
eyes you he cried

  uh-huh small world isnt it id
like change for this twenty he pushed
a goldpiece under the grille

  ronnie fumbled with the change what
are you doing in modoc

  just happened in on my way to cali-
fornia hows tricks

  fine just fine you-youre not stay-
ing

  long enough to rest up my horses
still think you can play poker

  ronnie flushed im lucky once in a
while

  good thing fellow in your positions
got to watch his step me now if i han-
dled all this dinero im afraid id begin
to think in five or six figures instead of
one or two    well ill be seein you
he turned away and felt the boys gaze on
him clear to the door

  outside the bank he shook his head it
zuas bad-even worse than he had thought
ronnie was in up to his neck already

  he spent the day roaming about the
town mixing with the men in stores and
saloons saying little and listening much
he got the impression that ronnie was
liked and trusted although there were a
few shaded remarks which gave him to
understand that some folk thought the boy
was skating on thin ice that evening he
went to harpers silver palace it was a
handsome layout with a fifty-foot bar a
full quota of girls and all the games of
chance from faro and poker to blackjack
and roulette in a little office off one end
of the bar he saw syd harper seated at a
desk working over some papers occa-
sionally he came to the doorway and looked
out over the crowd he did not see kent
presently ronnie came in and bradford
quickly lowered his head on his arms as
though asleep he saw the boy glance
quickly about him then go into svds office
and close the door behind him   

hello ronnie greeted harper
whats on your mind

ronnie spoke through tight lips do
you know that kent bradfords in town
harpers eyes flickered no i didnt

know whats he here for anyway

  said he was on his way to california
asked me if i still thought i could play
poker and said something about a person
who handled lots of money getting the
habit of thinking in figures of five and six
instead of one or two syd do you think
he    suspects

  why should he he doesnt know
whats been going on

  just the same im worried the first
of tiie month is coming and im afraid
theyll be checking up ive got to cover
that thousand i took until i can return it
a changed entry in the right place will
do the trick

  ronnie made a fierce gesture but i
dont know a thing about bookkeeping
id make a botch of it syd youve got to
do it for me

  youre asking a lot kid youd have to
let me in some night- he shook his head
frowning its too risky

but it isnt i go over occasionally at
night to work i have a key you could
come with me and nobodyd ever know it
then theres the books went on syd
they dont leave them lying around
theyre in the small safe ive watched
them open it day after day and ive memo-
rized the combination ill get the books
harper appeared to weigh the matter
for a moment or two then shrugged

  all right ill do it for you ronnie
tomorrow night be okay

  yes the sooner the better

  keno now how about a little game
suits me if only i could get lucky i
might win that thousand back from you
then i could put it back and we wouldnt
have to doctor the books how about a shot
from that special bottle of yours

v

in the dead of night

ent watched the of-
fice uneasiness strong
within him syd har-
per was working on
the boy getting him
deeper in the mire of
debt forcing him closer to the inevitable
the man who couldnt miss



  the door opened and harper appeared
beyond him kent could see ronnie seated
at a table nervously shuffling a deck of
cards harper glanced towards a gaming
table and nodded and in response to the
signal a man got up and went into the of-
fice with him he was the bald-headed man
kent had seen in the cook shack of the
deserted mine

  he got up and went to the bar and as
the attendant pushed a bottle towards him
made a casual remark looks like a little
game goin on in the office any chance
of a stranger siftin in

  not a chance in the world cowboy
private party

  seems like i know the fellow who went
in last who is he

  baldy benson prospector great fel-
low baldy used to be an actor but uncle
toms cabin folded up on him last time
they played modoc and he had to go to
work

  the hours passed long after midnight
the office door opened and the three came
out syd harpers face was placid baldy
benson wore a satisfied grin and ronnie
was tight-lipped and silent they stopped
at the bar for a final drink and as ronnie
turned towards the door syd gave him an
encouraging slap on the shoulder then
syd turned and for the first time saw kent
for a long moment the men exchanged
hard stares then harper walked over to
where kent stood and spoke to him in a
low voice

  you ordered me out of your town and
made it stick now im ordering you out
of mine and ill make that stick too
you come gunnin for me and ill kill
you said kent and meant it

  harper shrugged and walked away and
kent went to the hotel and to bed he got
up early had breakfast and went for a
stroll about town it was unlikely that syd
harper was abroad this time of the morn-
ing but if he was kent wanted him to
know that he was inviting a showdown
failing to find harper he entered the sil-
ver palace there w-ere few men about
and kent saw through the open doorway
that syd was not in the office he ordered
a cigar and was lighting it when a big man
came in stood for a moment looking

around then walked up to kent and ad-
dressed him 

  your name bradford then as kent
answered in the affirmative he flipped back
his coat and displayed a marshals badge
ive heard about you gunslinger aint
you

   i can shoot a little if i have to

  well you wont have to if you move
fast enough we dont cater to killers here
in modoc you be out of town by noon
he spoke loud enough so that those in the
room could hear

  ive never killed a man in my life
said kent but im willing to try it if im
prodded youll have to trot out a better
reason than that to run me out of town

  you got till noon said the marshal
and turned away

  kent puffed slowly on the cigar so that
was the way of it syd harper not having
the guts to go up against him again had
set his marshal on him kent felt disap-
pointed cheated harper had slipped away
from him again the old feeling of revul-
sion seized him and it occurred to him that
he had not felt that way a moment before
when he was searching for harper it was
quite evident that his conscience would
stand the killing of that sidewinder

  he tilted a chair against the wall and
sat down the marshal bought a drink for
some friends then went out as he passed
bradford he said you better get goin
noon aint far off

  when kent finally went out he knew
by the tension in the air that word of the
marshals ultimatum had spread men
slanted furtive glances at him and he felt
the stab of their stares after he had passed
the old sickness was on him again and it
was an effort to walk without slouching
as he approached ellens cottage he saw
the window curtain flutter and a moment
later she came hurrying out her face was
even more troubled than it had been

  kent she said youre at it again
you told me youd-

  i know he said wearily syd ordered
me out of town and i welcomed the chance
to settle things with him but he sent this
marshal of his against me instead of cornin
himself i cant go now you know whv
ellen


paul evan lehman

  never mind that go away dont
come back please kent

  he regarded her steadily i cant ive
got to finish the thing this time the
thought of it sickens me but ive got to
go on with it

  she turned despairingly ancl went back
into the house and he continued on his
way at the end of the street he entered
a little saloon and sat there until five min-
utes of twelve men came in drank and
went out again without saying a word
when he got up to go the place was de-
serted except for the bartender

  once on the street the sickness van-
ished and that warm comfortable glow stole
over him he felt relaxed rested he
looked down the street it was deserted
but he knew that men watched from be-
hind door and window then he saw a
man come out of the palace and glance
about him and even at the distance he
recognized the marshal he started towards
him

  the marshal saw him coming but made
no move for a full minute kent saw him
glance in his direction several times then
shift his gaze to a spot diagonally across
the street finally he began moving towards
kent he walked slowly as though gauging
the distance between them and once more
glanced across the street

  kent read the look aright and felt anger
stir within him this was to be another
crooked deal his eyes without seeming
to do so picked out the spot at which the
marshal had glanced and saw the dark-
ened doorway and the vague shape three or
four feet beyond it his mind stirred ac-
tively this was a new angle which would
make the first move

  the distance between them closed to
fifty feet and kent was nearly opposite the
dark doorway the marshal spoke loudly
i gave you fair warnin bradford you
asked for it draw your iron feller

  kent knew then the marshal was to
hold his attention   

  never had his draw been so swift never
his subsequent action so deft and sure
that mathematical mind of his had calcu-
lated everything as his gun leaped out
his left foot struck the ground and he
pivoted an exact eighty degrees and fired

and echoing the shot came another from
the doorway the lead gouging dirt from
the middle of the road stumbling from
the opening came a man to fall to his knees
on the sidewalk the gun in his hand only
half raised

  even before he emerged kent pivoted
again his arm sweeping around with his
turning body again the gun roared and
the marshal his colt half out of its holster
gave a choking gasp and dropped the
weapon then sank to the ground as his
shattered leg gave beneath him

  a quick leap took kent to the front of
a building where he crouched waiting
for a few seconds there was no movement
then a man came out of a store both hands
raised and hurried to the side of the man
on the opposite walk others came out all
with their hands in plain sight the mar-
shal lay on his back groaning and as
though he had anticipated an emergency
the towns doctor came running black bag
in hand

  kent bolstered his gun and walked up
to the stricken marshal a man was cut-
ting away the leg of his trousers

  you better tell syd harper to do his
own chores after this he told the man
outside of your playin tool for him i got
nothin against you let this thing end
right here

  he went to the hotel for dinner noticing
on the way a change in the attitude of the
men he met they nodded or spoke to him
now not trying to hide the respect they
felt at heart no man relishes a raw deal
and that this had been one was plain to all
who had witnessed the encounter

  although kent went out of his way to
look for him he did not find syd harper
until that night when he visited the palace
syd was seated in his office as was his
custom and kent rounded the bar and
spoke through the doorway the next
time you try somethin like that harper
im servin notice that ill hunt you down
and finish what i started at elkhorn thats
flat and final

  he went to a corner and found a chair
determined to put an end to ronnies
gambling if he had to do it by force but
the hours slipped by without the boy put-
ting in appearance and shortly after mid-
the man who couldnt miss



night kent left the palace syd harper
he took pains to notice was still in his
office

  a strange uneasiness prodding him
kent walked down to the blake cottage
there was a light in the front room and
on an impulse he passed through the gate-
way and moved silently to a window ron-
nie was not in the room ellen sat alone
reading the worry in her face showing
plainly under the yellow lamplight as he
watched her glance left the book and went
to the clock on the mantel and he could
almost hear her sigh

  he swore under his breath and turned
away intending to search the other gam-
bling houses for the absent ronnie then
there came a sullen boom which froze him
in his tracks ears straining every nerve
taut

  it wasnt a loud explosion insistent
would describe it better it made itself
felt in the slight tremor of the earth be-
neath him in the rattle of the window
the vibration of the air and in an instant
he knew what it wras

  he ran out through the gate and down
the street towards the bank two blocks
away high heels were not made for
sprinting and it seemed an age before he
reached the brick building it was dark and
silent although people were beginning to
stir in the nearby houses and he could hear
the thump of boots along the street there
was an acrid odor present which he knew
was caused by burned explosive

  he turned into the passageway between
bank and adjoining building and sped to
the alley even as he reached it there came
a flurry of hoofs and two horsemen crouch-
ing over the necks of their mounts flashed
by his colt flashed out and leveled and
he checked the release of the hammer just
in time the one at whom he instinctively
aimed might be ronnie

  his horse was in front of the silver
palace and he started for it shouting
answers to the excited questions which were
flung at him as men began to arrive in
the act of vaulting into the saddle he
stopped and dropped the reins he just
had to be sure running into the palace
he sent a quick glance into the little office
syd was behind his desk a cigar in his

mouth working with some books still
letting others do his dirty work thought
kent bitterly ronnie and another no
doubt the bald-headed man

  he rode swiftly along the street the
door of ellens cottage was open and she
stood framed in the light from within he
rode his horse into the yard and up to
the steps ronnie in he asked

  no kent he isnt whats happened

 thought i heard-

  you did the bank two men

  oh no there was utter despair in
her voice and she leaned against the door-
frame for support

  they headed east im going after
them if ronnie is one of them ill do all
i can to help him he wheeled his horse
but she halted him

  im going with you she was standing
erect now

  no ellen you-

  saddle my horse for me i wont be
more than a minute

  he made no further protest perhaps it
was better that she see the thing through
to the finish three minutes later they
rode together into the night

a bullet strikes

ent set a fast pace
following the road
which  e d eastward
from modoc behind
them they left confu-
sion with men run-
ning in search of horses and shouting ques-
tions a few had already taken up the pur-
suit and kent followed close behind them
the meaning of that meeting at the de-
serted mine two days before suddenly clear
to him

  for the first few miles the country wa
open and since it was moonlight it was
safe to assume that the bandits had kept
to the main road but when they began
climbing into the hills patches of timber
were encountered at each of these a cou-
ple of the pursuers dropped out to conduct
a search thus permitting the main body to
continue without loss of valuable time at


paul evan lehman

last they reached the trees through which
ran the path to the mine

  ill take this one kent called out
and motioned to ellen to rein into the nar-
row trail he followed closely and the
others spurred on once among the trees
he took the lead walking his horse and
as the hoofbeats died in the distance she
spoke

  were not searching very carefully
why do you stick to the trail

  because its goin to take us straight to
them he told her and went on to ac-
quaint her with the details of the meeting
at the old mine i thought then theyd
found a vein of gold or silver which they
aimed to work but now ive a hunch that
one of them wanted to show the other a
safe place to hide the money from the bank
one of them i saw he was the man they
call baldy benson i dont know who the
other was

  when was this asked ellen tensely
  night before last tuesday

  he heard her sigh of relief then it
wasnt ronnie tuesday was the only
night this week he stayed home

  they continued at a walk the sound of
their horses hoof falls barely audible has
ronnie ever gone to the bank after hours
he asked

  several times especially near the first
of the month she went on swiftly hope-
fully maybe he was working there to-
night and was surprised by the robbers
before he could give the alarm

  he agreed with her promptly because
he knew how much she wanted this reas-
surance it could be i never thought of
that angle reckon i should have looked
inside the bank but i was so sure syd
harper was in on the robbery that i went
straight to the palace to see if he was still
there 

  was he

  yes-worse luck right at his desk
in the office where hed been the whole
evenin

  if he was at the palace he couldnt have
had anything to do with the robbery

  if he was in patagonia id still believe
he was behind it said kent flatly but
lies too smart a gambler to play against
the percentage and hes got too much at

stake in modoc to risk gettin caught in
somethin like this maybe he wasnt in
the actual robbery but id bet my lxt-
tom dollar that he engineered the whole
scheme  now wed better tie here and
injun up to the mine on foot you can
stay with the horses

  ive got to know the truth im going
with you

  he faced her in the gloom you know
what youre apt to find theres a chance
a big chance that ronnies in on it

  i know but id die-just waiting
here

  he turned at once and led the way along
the path and presently they glimpsed the
gray barrenness of rock and the ghostly
outline of buildings in the moonlight and
halted at the very edge of the trees

  they could see one end of the mess shack
and the side which contained the door the
end wall showed plainly but most of the
side was in deep shadow kent peering
through the darkness made out two vague
shapes which he decided were horses

  look whispered ellen and gripped
him by an arm

  he turned his head slightly towards the
left a man had come from the building
where the lantern had disappeared two
nights before and was half walking half
running toward the mess shack he ap-
peared no more than a shadow his features
entirely indistinguishable

  wait here ordered kent quietly and
started towards the fellow his colt slipped
smoothly into his hand the hammer clicked
beneath his thumb but even as he respond-
ed to the habit of years he was telling him-
self tliat he must not shoot that man might
be ronnie

  his spur scraped rock and the other
heard as kent knew he must sooner or
later the shadow stopped abruptly stood
rigid for a moment then a stab of flame
cut the darkness and kent heard the twang
of a bullet a little exclamation reached
him from behind and he turned his head
to see ellen following at his heels lie
down he ordered sharply and broke into
a run

  once more the fellow fired and once
more he missed then he resumed his run-
ning towards the shack and kent assuming
the man who couldnt miss



that he would certainly mount one of the
horses prepared to drop the animal in its
tracks to his surprise the man ducked
into the mess shack

  kent sped onward expecting to see
another flash and perhaps feel the impact
of the bullet yet lor some reason the fel-
low did not fire and kent brought up out-
side the doorway and pressed close to the
log wall there was a movement behind
him and he felt ellens warm breath on his
neck he extended his left arm as a signal
that she was not to pass him

  from within the shack came the mur-
mur of voices low-pitched intense not
a word could he distinguish but the low
tones suggested an argument of some kind
he spoke in a whisper to ellen stay
outside whatever you do i mustnt be
distracted worry in about you do as i
tell you understand

  yes

  here are some matches theres a
lantern inside-i hope back away and
circle around to the other side of the door
where theres no chance of your bein hit
when i pass the lantern out to you light it
and look for a pole put the lantern on the
end of it and push it through the door set
it on the floor but dont show even a fin-
ger inside the shack got it

  yes

  he heard her move away and presently
caught sight of her small form making the
circle in one swift movement he was
through the doorway hiddeii by the dark-
ness he knelt and removed his spurs put-
ting them into a pocket the voices behind
the partition had ceased and it became
too quiet

  he got up and silently moved across the
floor to where he had seen the bald-headed
man hang the lantern his groping fingers
found it lifted it from the nail like a
shadow he stole back to the wall near the
doorway through the entrance he could
just make out ellens form an arm extend-
ed as far as she dared

  he passed the lantern to her and as he
withdrew his arm there came a spurt of
flame from the partition door and lead
scorched his sleeve quickly he leaped to
his right crouched with gun leveled again
came that lance of flame and a slug smacked

into the logs where a moment before he had
been standing

  with iron determination he withheld his
fire depressing the muzzle of the colt
towards die floor no matter what hap-
pened he dared not answer that shot the
reputation he had established throughout
a lifetime held him in the grip of fear he
had never missed perhaps he couldnt miss
and the man might be ronnie blake

  slowly he retreated to the corner of the
room opposite that in which was the parti-
tion door knowing that the other could not
possibly see him and for some tense sec-
onds there was absolute silence then he
saw the light of the lantern come bobbing
towards the shack it stopped a yard or
so outside the door then passed smoothly
through the doorway  the end of the
pole before the men behind the partition
could act ellen deftly placed it on the floor
where if they wished to shoot it out they
must expose themselves to kents fire the
pole was withdrawn and the yellow rays
spread over the floor in a dying circle the
outside rim of which just reached the par-
tition doorway

  kent spoke sharply you fellows cant
get away those shots are goin to draw
the posse and the quicker you surrender
the better come out backwards and with
your hands in the air

  more whispers from behind the partition
one voice hoarse and excited almost to
the point of hysteria the other even and
sharp and with the hint of threat in it
then with dramatic suddenness a man
stepped through the doorway

  the weak lantern rays reached only to
his feet and kent could not see the upper
part of his body but he could sense des-
peration in the mans movements feel the
burning intensity of the gaze that sought
to penetrate the dense darkness which hid
him

  the fellows gun blazed and lead thud-
ded into the wall to one side of kent
another shot sang over his head a third
dug into the floor at his feet he fought
savagely to keep his colt pointing at the
floor the man was moving steadily for-
ward shooting at every stride it didnt
seem possible that he could miss at such
short range and as he advanced the ian-


paul evan lehman

tern light traveled slowly up his body if
only kent could see his face

  bradford crouched like a cornered puma
his gun still determinedly depressed watch-
ing waiting again the others colt blazed
and kent gasped as the bullet burned his
neck the sweat came out on his face he
had to shoot had to shoot or be shot
just one more step and he would know

  the fellow stopped abruptly the line of
light chest high his hand held the gun
rigidly at the level of his waist and he was
peering over the lantern at the shadowy
shape in the corner of the room kent saw
the muzzle of the weapon move slightly and
knew with the instinct of the marksman
fhat the next shot would not miss with
a groan he snapped up his colt the ham-
mer tense under his thumb it would be
close he must shoot to kill he let the
hammer slip and as he did so the other sud-
denly stooped and the light fell full on his
face

  it was ronnie

  only nerves completely synchronized
with a quick-thinking brain could have done
what kent did then the hammer had
been released in perhaps a tenth of a sec-
ond it would send lethal lead into the body
of the boy but in that tenth of a second
a message was flashed to the muscles of
hand and wrist and was obeyed the gun
jerked sidewise roared throatily and kent
heard the bullet tear through the partition

  it was then that ronnies nerve broke
or perhaps it was then that he really
found it he straightened and the gun at
his side dropped downward until it pointed
at the floor kill me he cried kill
me and get it over with

  but even before ellen could utter her
anguished ronnie they heard a thud
behind the partition ronnie jerked about
as though motivated by a spring and kent
straightened to stare past him on the floor
just within the circle of light a hand ex-
tended beyond the doorway its fingers grip-
ping a sixgun as they watched the fingers
twitched spasmodically then slowly re-
laxed and the colt dropped loosely from
them

  ronnie stared a moment then turned his
face to look at kent and in the boys eyes
kent cobid read astonishment awe and-

yes-unutterable relief thank god he
breathed then bowed his head and sank to
the floor sobbing

  ellen flashed through the doorway and
dropped to her knees beside him hugging
him to her talking and crying but kent
strode straight to the partition seized the
lax hand and dragged the inert body into
the lighted room with a quick flip he
rolled the man on his back the eyes rolled
upward and the jaw sagged gruesomely
but there could be no mistake

  good lord he swore softly syd
harper

in the clear

ent turned and
strode to where ron-
nie still knelt and
shook the boy by
the shoulder ronnie
youve got to snap
out of it a whole bunch of menll be here
soon and weve got to know where we
stand i want the whole story and i want
it straight

  ronnie looked up at him his face drawn
the horror still in his eyes

  i cant not now

  youve got to give it to us straight
and from the beginnin never mind ellen
what she must be thinkin cant be any
worse than the truth

  ronnie bowed his head fought for a
moment with his emotion then spoke

  it started at elkhorn with syd id
never gambled before and the fever got me
i won at first then lost the first thing
i knew i owed syd more than i could pay
he told me about this job and urged me
to come to modoc with him ellen didnt
want to change schools but when you shot
syd she agreed to go with me

  we came here and syd got me the job
at the bank i made good money and began
playing again i lost and lost it seemed
that i just couldnt win syd told me that
i could borrow a little from the bank that
i was bound to win sooner or later i-
he stopped his cheeks hurning with
shame
the man who couldnt miss	

  go on said kent grimly you stole
from the bank

  ronnie wet his lips yes a thousand
dollars but i swear i intended to return
it as soon as i won but i couldnt win
the best i could do was break even the
first of the month was coming and i knew
thered be a checkup i told syd about it
begged him to lend me the money to repay
the bank he told me that all i had to do
was change an entry in the books i dont
know anything about bookkeeping and at
last i-i asked him to do it for me he
paused for a moment his face contorted
with agony god what a fool i was
we all are at times go on

  tonight i went over to the bank and
when syd came to the back door i let him
in he had a satchel with him but i didnt
pay any attention to it at the time the
books were in a small safe and i knew the
combination i was on my knees working
on it when i looked up and saw syd stand-
ing there with a gun pointed at me he
told me he was going to rob the bank and
that i was to be blamed for it he was
fold and hard and i knew he wasnt joking
he made me lie on the floor while he took
tools from the satchel and started working
on the big safe when he had planted the
charge he made me light the fuse the
doors were blown open and i had to help
him stuff the money into the satchel by
that time i was in so deep i had to go on
with it

  but it wasnt you dear cried ellen
he made you do it

  yes  he had horses outside all
saddled he put a rope around my waist
and dragged me after him i had no gun
we came here and he tied me up back
there behind the partition and gagged me
then he took the satchel and went outside
and after a while i heard shooting and
knew wed been discovered i-i nearly
died right there

  ellen now sat beside him holding one
of his hands tightly clasped between hers
kent had squatted on his heels and was
busy with a cigarette rornie went on
he came back in and took off the ropes
and told me that we were in it together
and that wed have to get out of it together
when that lantern was shoved into the

room i knew it was the end then kent
ordered us to conic out

  syd pushed a gun into my hand and
said wed make a break for it and that i
was to lead the way i was to come out
shooting and if i didnt kill you he would
and me too the boy closed his eyes and
shuddered i know now he wanted me to
be killed he knew kent never missed
he would have killed you himself in
the end said kent harshly i see through
it now the whole damned clever scheme
but go on

  you know the rest i-i came out
kent t swear i didnt try to shoot you
i couldnt see you plainly and i tried to
shoot every place but at you and when
you shot and missed me i knew youd
missed on purpose i had my gun squarely
on you but i just couldnt fire i yelled
to syd to go ahead and kill me and then i
heard him fall the bullet that missed me
had gone through the partition and killed
him when i realized that i knew that
god had directed your bullet and i felt as
though the world had been lifted off my
shoulders ill take my medicine ill go
to jail and-

  quiet theyre cornin pull yourself
together and leave everything to me in
the silence which followed they heard the
thud of hoofbeats outside the shack kent
got up

  dont say a word just leave it to me
understand

  ronnie nodded dumbly and kent walked
over to the lighted doorway

  horses came clattering up and men slid
from saddle to ground whats goin on
here demanded one of them whats
the shootin about

  youre too late for the party boys
kent told them ellen and ronnie blake
are in here with me also one perfectly
dead bank robber

  whats that you got one where is
he they pushed by kent and into the
room there to gaze at the stricken bandit
in amazement

  syd harper cried their spokesman
now that cant be dang it all we left
syd behind in the palace didnt we
boys

  well there he is said kent


paul evan lehman

  but-but- good gosh man it got me
beat wheres the other one

  there was only one thief to begin with
there were two i seen em headin
out of modoc myself

  there were two riders but only one
robber you see ronnie went over to the
bank after supper to work syd came to
the back door and ronnie not suspecting
a thing let him in syd pulled a gun on
him and made him lie down on the floor
while he blew the safe then he made
ronnie go with him aimin to pin the rob-
bery on him syd you see was supposed
to be at the palace

  he was i tell you we seen him there
i thought i did too but i didnt the
man we saw was baldy benson he used
to be an actor you know all he had to
do was put on a black wig and mustache
touch up his face a bit and get into a suit
of syds clothes then he could sit there
at the desk and look busy and no matter
what happened sydd have fifty witnesses
who could take oath that he was at the pal-
ace the whole evenin

  well ill be

  kent told them what had happened at
the shack and there was a moment of aston-
ished silence then one of them said you
aim at an innocent man miss him and your
bullet goes through a partition and kills a
guilty one and you say thats all there
was to it hells bells bradford ive heard
you spoke of as a man who couldnt miss
and now i believe it but wheres that
money hid

  syd came out of the buildin about fifty
yards from here i reckon if you look hard
enough youll find the hidin place maybe
a trap door over an old shaft

  lets have that lantern and well look
for it right now and then well mosey
back to modoc and settle with mr baldy
benson

  baldy bensonv said kent quietly is
probably far away by now and still makin
plenty tracks

  the man took the lantern went over and
examined the dead harper then shook his
head and turned to kent bradford ive
seen you handle your hardware im sayin
right now that the job of modocs marshal
is yours for the askin

  he cant take it

  it was ellen who spoke she was stand-
ing now her head held high and soft lights
playing in her eyes hes going back to
texas to a town named elkhorn where
lies going to be very busy running his
fathers ranch and im going back there
too and take my old job of teaching if
theyll have me

  ellen said kent softly

  she returned his warm gaze steadily a
bit of color rising in her cheeks and
ronnie she went on is going to stay
here in modoc and keep his job at the
bank arent you ronnie

  the boy looked up jaws set eyes shin-
ing you just bet i am

  the man sighed your two goin leaves

by lulita
crawford pritchett

 there was one thing puck liked more
than to eat it teas to get a cowboy and a
girl sewed up in a wonderful romance

ike flannerty
wizened cook at
towners sawmill
swore at the potatoes
that were sending up
clouds of fragrant
steam from the kettle he swore at the
beans then he opened the big oven and
swore melodiously at two huge huckleberry
pies as he lifted them onto a board shelf
to cool swearing came natural to mike
it was a sign of his good humor

  two shadows that had been lurking near
the doorway suddenly materialized into a
tousle-topped freckled-faced girl of about
fourteen and an impish looking elk both
were sniffing hungrily the girl was puck
randall tomboy daughter of old rip the
cowman and the critter was her pet joker
puck was relieved to find mike cheerful
she considered it safe to put in an appear-
ance and hoped he had forgotten the un-
fortunate episode of their last meeting

  but the minute mike clapped eyes on
the two dusty tramps his whiskers bristled
and he bellowed so its you dad blarst
you git afore i tan your slippery hides
mike must have been more attached to
that sourdough jar than puck had realized
on their visit a week ago joker hadnt
meant to get his head stuck in the jar and
smash it against a tree hed only wanted
to sample the sour dough and he hadnt
meant to bust mikes best dishes he
couldnt help it if they came crashing about
his ears when he nibbled the oilcloth along
the kitchen shelf


lulita crawford pritchett

  mike threw the broom at his visitors
followed by the mop and a shower of stove
wood joker skipped out of the way with
a flirt of his impudent tail puck poked
her head around the corner of the house
and bargained no pie no newspaper
and theres printed letters from the soldier
boys

  mikes wrinkled potato of a face sharp-
ened eagerly puck knew she had him
mike felt a fierce and fatherly interest in
every kettle creek puncher who had hung
up his spurs and gone to war he would
have mortgaged his hope of heaven to have
been there with them ungraciously he
conceded the pie but ill do the cuttin
he warned settling himself on his bench
in the shade when ive found out if long-
horn jones has shot down any more jerrys
and if tex and pieface and shorty has got
them measly slant-eyed coyotes on the run
and mind-no monkey shines

  puck had no slightest intention of get-
ting into trouble today every time she
sneezed or took a deep breath she hurt
darn the bronc that had pitched her into
the fence and busted her rib all summer
shed been doing a mans work riding
fence running the sweep rake branding
calves and when rip was not around
breaking horses she hadnt been doing
so bad either till shed forked that wall-eyed
pinto rip had taped her up scolded her
with a twinkle in his eye and ordered her
to ride herd on the cook shack till she
mended

  if there was anything puck hated to do
it was housework so today feeling the
need of comfort and company she had de-
cided to visit tug howarth forest ranger
one thing about tug he couldnt cook
therefore shed managed to be at towners
sawmill at noon she could think of noth-
ing more comforting than one of mikes
huckleberry pies but for company big six-
foot sandy-haired tug howarth couldnt
be beat besides she had important matters
to talk over with him

  she fidgeted while mikes crooked finger
traveled slowly down the columns of print
joker and she were both dribbling at the
mouth with the tantalizing steam from the
pies she kept a weather eye on the door
so the elk couldnt do any damage tt never

occurred to her to watch the window her
mind was busy with tug

  months ago with the very first volun-
teers tug had gone to war but after a
while theyd sent him home silent ashamed
-and sick sciatica had come back on him
and doubled him up in those damp low
climates that spring blizzard years ago
was to blame tug had worked too hard
in the snow and ice trying to save some
calves and doc had cussed him proper
puck could barely remember but ever
since hed been strong and tough as an
ox-till the army sent him home

  and now after a few weeks in the moun 
tains he was disgustingly healthy again
and itched to get into the fight but the
military wouldnt let him and tug felt dis-
graced and worthless he took the hardest
job he could find-guarding thousands of
acres of timber which uncle sam was going
to use for shipbuilding and he fought fires
chopped brush and brooded-and grew
thinner and thinner

  puck worried about him he oughtnt
to stay by himself so much he ought to
have a wife to cheer him and look after
him puck meant to advise him this very
day all the way up the road shed been
cudgeling her brain to find some girl nice
enough for him then just before she
turned off at the sawmill a rattletrap truck
passed her driven by old man mitchell
of the blue jay mine that made her think
of old mans mitchells step-daughter
docie

  puck drew rein so sharply that joker
who had been tagging too close to prunes
the horse bumped himself and in a temper
turned and lashed out with his small hoofs
puck gave herself a mental kick for hitch-
ing tugs and docies names together she
didnt want tug mixed up with that blue
jay outfit

  there was something screwy about those
folks last spring the old man and a fellow-
named coke blevins had bought up the
claim over in that brush hollow a mile or
so north and it was rumored they were get-
ting good stuff out of the tunnel but they
didnt want anything to do with other
people and had big signs keep out all
over their place old-timers loafing around
pop haggertys store lowed thered never
duck soup



been a snifter of any mineral in that blue
jay tunnel but coke blevins smiled down
his thin nose at them and showed them the
ore right there in his pocket

  you just wasnt smart enough to know
molybdenum when you seen it he said
dark and gaunt he was with quick black
eyes and anyone could see he was the
brains and boss of that outfit he was buy-
ing up the water rights in the canyon below
which proved he really had something and
folks began to nod their heads and say
hed struck a stray vein like the big gold
horn mine down at red dirt that was a
beehive of activity these days producing
strategic minerals

  docie cooked for the two men pop
haggerty said docie was cokes girl and
he was so jealous of her he wouldnt even
let her come to town well he could keep
her as far as puck was concerned-no mat-
ter if she was pretty with soft dark curls
at the nape of her neck soft brown eyes
to match and dimples that chased them-
selves in and out of her cheeks she wasnt
good enough for tug

  puck had just reached this conclusion
for the second time when crash clatter a
noise from the kitchen reared her and mike
to their feet through the door their hor-
rified eyes saw a sticky mess of pastry up-
side down upon the floor jokers neck
had been long enough to reach the shelf
wedged by his middle in the window he
was trying to kick his way to the ground
he succeeded muzzle dripping with red
juice and flakes of piecrust on his ears
just as mike flannerty let out an irish
warwhoop and grabbed for his shotgun

  puck had sense enough to jump 
prunes and whale him into action mike
wouldnt care whose hide he peppered
spat went the shot among the trees with
a flirt of his white rump the elk disappeared
over the hill when puck caught up with
him he was licking his lips with satisfied
grunts

  doggone you she panted holding her
cracked rib and wishing she had mikes
tongue for cussing now look what youve
done wherell we get our dinner

  jokers rascally eyes glittered he
thought he was smart even had a notion
of going back if he did hed be elk stew

after all she didnt want him shot she
tied her lariat to him and taking a twist
around the saddle horn hauled him stiff-
legged up the road which was hard on her
lariat shed got to get her a new one
some of the strands on this were busting
you better walk while you can she ad-
vised gloomily after you eat tugs cook-
in you may not be able to

here was nothing to do
but go on to the rangers
camp for nobody else lived
up on the mountain-except
that blue jay bunch the
road circled into wyoming
before it passed another habitation pucks
eyes narrowed why not eat at the blue
jay docie mitchell had brought a swell
chocolate cake to the community picnic last
spring before coke had made her stay
home pucks empty stomach set up a
clamor pop haggerty claimed hed been
shot at when he passed their place one day
looking for a lost horse of course pop
was sour on them because they did all their
trading at red dirt instead of at his store
dunno what they want of so much grub
nohow he grumbled theyre alius a-peg-
gin over to red dirt rip randall had
said folks has got a right to trade where
they please and also to pertect their prop-
erty-specially in wartimes and he had
ordered puck to stay away from the blue
jay

  but he wouldnt want her to starve to
death

  half a mile up the road she turned into
the brushy hollow where the blue jay cabin
stood boldly she opened the barbed wire
gate and started in shucks those signs
werent meant for a friendly caller shed
bet docied be glad to see   

  zing a bullet uncomfortably close
whined past her ear

  puck got out of there mighty sudden
from the safety of the ridge she looked
back no life nor movement was visible
around the squatty brown shack in the
gully she was more scared than she cared
to let on even to joker and she was good
and glad to reach tugs camp a shoft time
later his lookout station was right on top
of the peak but he had a little tent down


lulita crawford pritchett

in a grassy glade where he lived and he
was starting to build a cabin

  howdy kid big sandy-haired tug
was glad to see her she decided to say
nothing about being shot at he might
forbid her coming up on the mountain
 light and have some soup he invited

  thats what puck had been afraid of
tugs soups were-well no wonder he
was growing gaunter day by day but a
person as near to starving as puck couldnt
be choosey she sniffed at the bowl he
filled for her say tug what kind of soup
is this

  rock soup kid first you boil some
nice round rocks and then you add what-
ever you got-a few spuds or some onions
or carrots

  tastes more like youd boiled a rubber
boot said puck honestly

  it does have sort of a far-away flavor
agreed tug with a wry grin try a bis-
cuit

  puck took one of the dingy grayish
dough balls and tried to pinch it talk
about rock soup shed have to have a
gizzard to eat that when tug had his
back turned she tossed it to joker who
rolled it around in his mouth a while then
left it in a bunch of grass

  have another biscuit kid urged the
hospitable tug gosh theres plenty of
em

  puck squirmed she didnt want to hurt
tugs feelings so she took the biscuit put
it on a boulder and socked it with a stone
if she could get it down by pieces   
aint you got any canned goods she
inquired

  tug gnawing at his bread like a squirrel
chiseling into a pine cone shook his head
i had some he said but lightning
struck the station one day and punctured
every can thats why im campin down
here s funny

  puck could see nothing funny about it
tug was starving to death  his pants hung
on him and his eyes looked hollow and
bloodshot they roved restlessly over the
dark acres of timber entrusted to his care

  countrys dry as a chip he muttered
be a bad time for a fire

  puck too stared upon the forest better
to keep her mind off what was in her mouth

if she could a heap depended on tug
there were a thousand war needs for the
lumber he was guarding spose he got
sick

  tug she said abruptly you got t
find you a wife

 huh

  someone who can cook theres a lot
o nice girls that teacher at mud flats
or the sawyers daughter or-

  tugs ears turned an angry red not
me

  puck eyed him severely dont be a
ninny this marryin business is simple
one party furnishes what the other party
needs lord knows you need a cook and
ill betcha theres some girl that just needs
a big hunk o beef like you to look after
her

  thats where youre dead wrong
growled tug she aint got no use for me
a-tall

  then youve already picked out a girl

  tug hurled the rest of his biscuit at a
stump i got to get to work

  who is she tug

  but he was striding for the lookout sta-
tion and didnt seem to hear her puck
scrambled after him eaten with curiosity
how do you know she doesnt like you
who is she tug maybe i could-

  the ranger crossing a muddy place by
the spring carefully stepped over a loose
slab of spruce bark in the trail puck kicked
it out of the way then she stared the
bark had covered a small footprint with
a miniature half-moon of a heel-a womans
track and there was only one female in
kettle creek who didnt know better than
to wear high-heeled slippers in the moun-
tains

  docie mitchell she gasped

  tug jerked around a hang-dog look on
him as if hed been caught stealing chickens

  what was docie doing here blurted
puck

  tug wiped his sweaty face thats kind
of a purty little track he said lamely
feller gits lonesome seein nothin but
bear tracks and fox tracks and coyote
tracks sheepishly yet with a stubborn
set to his jaw he hunted up the bark and
replaced it

  not till then did puck begin to tumble
duck soup



 tug had put that bark there in the first
 place hed been meeting docie secretly
 no telling how long and if he was such
 an idiot about her track what must he be
 about her pucks freckles fairly leaped
 shed been pretty dumb not to notice that
 before now looking back upon the kettle
 creek barbecue last spring she could see
 plain as day   

ocie mitchell had
come to the barbecue
alone a shy kitten of a
girl wearing a cheap silk
boughten dress and
small scuffed slippers
that had been white once her eyes looked
timidly at the buxom ranch wives and red-
cheeked ranch girls and dropped in confu-
sion before the frank admiring gaze of lithe
brown range riders

  lonesome she is pore mite maw
haggerty declared a-wantin to make
friends even if her menfolks is mighty
pe-culiar and stiff-necked and maw took
the stranger under her motherly wing and
introduced her around

   tug had never made up to girls much
but now puck remembered that hed been
mighty attentive to the soft-eyed visitor
puck had kept track of docie because docie
had a basket with a chocolate cake and that
was the swellest looking cake at the picnic

 	if puck had thought about tug at all shed
 figured his interested centered on that cake
 too now she knew different all day
 docie had laughed and chatted her way
 right into the hearts of kettle creek folks
 coke blevins and old man mitchell on
 their way from red dirt with a canvas-
 covered load of provisions looked surprised
 to see her there and she looked suddenly
 frightened

  ready to come home now docie
cokes slanty black eyes held a piggish
gleam puck wondered howcome he wasnt
in the army he looked strong and healthy
enough

   better git in girl old man mitchell
 fidgeted

   docie did tug leaned his elbow on the
 truck door ill be stoppin by he said
 been aimin to

   yes do said docie faintly

  but coke grated were tumble busy
docie aint got time fer company

  now on the mountain puck got her
second wind she had to admit shed
thought docie was just swell at the bar-
becue but birds of a feather flocked to-
gether and that blue jay outfit was a
strange mean bunch though no one could
actually prove anything against them puck
remembering the whistle of that bullet past
her head bet they were crooks and docie
was a good-for-nothing little fraud tug
as gullible as a two-year-old was still calf
eyed time he got over that

  i reckon she shot at you when yor
went to see her guessed puck

  nope tugs jaw muscles showed
white id a knowed how to take shootin
she-she laughed at me

  what for

  for askin her to marry me

  oh lord groaned puck you sure
jumped in with both feet

  tug twisted the tip off a spruce branch
i had it cornin id oughta waited longer
but i had a kind o feelin the girl was in
trouble and i could help her she made
it plain she loved coke blevins

  was coke there

  turned out he was in the next room
listenin he give me the horse laugh too
if she loves him what was she doin
up here

  come one evenin to apologize for liurt-
in my feelins and out of kindness brought
a pie i throwed away the pie

  poor tug it was all or nothing with
him why couldnt he have been attracted
by some sensible ranch girl instead of that
two-faced docie mitchell he still loved
her-even her silly little footprint in the
mud-and puck knew him well enough to
be sure hed never look at another woman

  here was trouble worse and worse tug
might be able to worry along on an empty
stomach for a while but with a busted heart
to boot he wouldnt be any account what-
ever if he fell down on his job and fire got
in the forest and the united states couldnt
build enough ships-whew puck didnt
know what to do

  if the girl had been anyone but docic
mitchell shed have gone straight and told
her what a fool she was for turning tug


lulita crawford pritchett

down but she didnt want docie to marry
tug near to tears she looked at tug and
he was so hollow-cheeked and woebegone
that she braced herself somebody had to
do something she swallowed hard it
might be-it just might be-docie wasnt
so bad as the rest of the blue jay ranch
for tugs sake and as a patriotic duty
shed investigate

  i got to be goin she said abruptly
gee i got to- she fled down the ridge
flung herself on prunes and cut for the
trail every jolt made her cracked rib hurt
but she had to hurry before she lost her
nerve

  joker evidently thought they were going
back to mikes for more huckleberries for
he lit out with a glint in his eye puck
had to lariat him and tie him to a tree he
bucked and fought so that the frayed rope
broke once and she had to waste time tying
him again dont you know miked skin
you she panted and i cant have you
taggin me to the blue jay i got to sneak
in somehow so they wont shoot at me

  she tied prunes also then hurrying on
afoot circled the blue jay fence well out
of sight and crawled under at a brushy
point to the south nerves a-prickle she
crept through the bushes pausing every few
moments to listen her plan was to follow
the ridge till she could see the house and
there to wait until she saw coke and the
old man go out to work the tunnel as she
was sure they must then she could slip
down and talk to docie alone

  though everything looked peaceful
enough puck was as jittery as prunes
when he smelled a bear she couldnt smell
anything nor see anything either except
yonder the narrow road leading down
through the pines and the trail that had
been cut where the telephone line ran
kettle creek housewives never could un-
derstand the use of that telephone for
docie didnt visit over the wires and coke
blevins called red dirt only now and then
to order stuff

  a vulture hanging high in the blue let
out a scream that set pucks hair on end
shucks nothing could happen to her here
in broad daylight except that the sun was
blistering her and she was getting wild oats
down her neck and in her shoes she was

empty that was all and her rib hurt this
was her job and shed do it-same as a
soldier-for tugs sake and the govments

  now she was near enough to glimpse
the house in the gully it was a tumble-
down place but white curtains were at
the windows and a wisp of smoke threaded
from the chimney docie mitchell would
be the kind to have white curtains un-
bidden to pucks mind flashed an imaginary
picture of docie in the log cabin tug was
building docie soft-eyed and happy a
born home-maker setting a bunch of wild
flowers on the table feeding tug scrump-
tious chocolate cake   

  puck shook the picture from her head
that wasnt the real docie the real docie
was sweet on the surface and rotten under-
neath she must be if she was coke blevins
girl but puck had to prove it and she
wished with all her soul the business was
over a long time she lay watching the
house when nobody appeared she inched
forward trying not to crackle the dry resin
leaves

hat darn vulture circling
and screaming- must be
some carrion down there
that he wanted and that was
too big for him the shrill
bark of a woodchuck from
dump made puck jump a foot
in her nervousness she moved forward too
fast and suddenly had to throw herself
backward and grab at the bushes to keep
from falling down a sheer ten-foot break
in the hill there right under her was the
tunnel entrance and backed up to it the
old green truck above the thudding of
her heart she heard docies voice squeezed
unnatural you-you murdered him
and she heard cokes answer raspy
as a file he asked for it didnt he got
skeered and tried to git away in the truck
when our partner at red dirt phoned the
code signal the sheriff was cornin that
dont go see we stick together

  pucks eyes bulged with horror
sprawled face down beside the truck was
old man mitchell-dead

  coke went on harshly we got enough
ore here to keep us on easy street the rest
of our lives all we have to do is load it
duck soup

si

and drive away the sheriff cant git here
afore an hour i got it all planned how we

	an ditch the stuff for a while and fade-
  im not going

  oh yes you are pitch in and help load
girl-unless you want some of the same
your old man got

  keep away from me

  puck flattened on her stomach in the
weeds just above the tunnel opening was
petrified with fear by stretching her neck
she could see docie struggling to free her-
self from cokes grasp her face was paper
white and her eyes enormous black pools

  im not going i havent done any-
thing

  youre one of us if you didnt know
nothin its because you was too dumb or
too trustin mebbe i better explain he
sneered friends o mine at the gold horn
highgraded the stuff and we picked it up at
red dirt and brought it here when wed
collected enough we hauled it out and sold
it and nobody knowed but what wed mined
it in this tunnel perfect setup what i
cant figure is how the law got onto us
he twisted her arm you blabbed to any-
one 

  she shook her head

  you sneaked off one night to see that
damn forest ranger if you told him ill-
his hand rested on his gun

  no coke no

  sweet on him huh well ill fix him
when i get time

  ill help you load panted the girl
ill go away with you-only dont kill
him coke

  puck had never hated anyone as she
hated coke blevins right then if she only
had a gun  docie wasnt a fraud she was
just a sfim frightened girl who hadnt
known what her scheming menfolks were
up to and in spite of what shed said
she loved tug enough to go away with
coke to save tugs life puck knew this
now when it was too late there wasnt
time to go for help the only weapon she
had was a pocket knife she had to try
to save docie maybe if she hurled the
open knife with all her might   

  she had no chance to try for at that un-
lucky moment something crashed through
the brush behind her something big and

brown and bright-eyed joker hed busted
the lariat again and trailed her though she
grabbed to catch him he swerved by her
and in a graceful leap cleared the tunnel
opening and landed smack in front of coke

  coke hauled at his gun but held fire
as he recognized the elk that snoopin
kid he snarled where is she

  puck believed her time had come too
late she made a desperate break to get
away coke caught her dragged her fight-
ing and kicking to the tunnel

  you let that child go cried docie
and struck at him with an old timber

  he dodged his lips curled in a cruel
leer ill let her go all right-to join old
man mitchell but first she can help load
faster harshed coke and when docie
faltered he snarled ive changed my
mind about wantin you youd only be
a nuisance

  that meant he was going to kill docie
too hed never leave her and puck to tell
of a sudden puck knew what to do in
her pocket were matches which she always
carried in case she got caught out if she
could throw a lighted match or two into
the tinder-dry grass and make a smoke
tug would see and come busting watching
her chance puck flung one match-two

roke in a hurry was
heaving sacks himself
so at first didnt note
the yellow tongues of
flame darting through
the dry grass and rapid-
ly spreading into the brush puck stalled
for time in every way she could she
dropped sacks fumbled them stumbled all
over herself and docie catching on did
likewise maybe tug was coming now

  joker who had been investigating the
tunnel came snorting out at the smell of
smoke he reared back from the flames
that all at once encircled the entrance then
gave a frightened plunge through them
leaving behind the odor of singed hair

  at the same moment coke discovered
the fire and ripped out an oath the flames
in the dry grass had spread to the nearest
group of trees popping and crackling in
growing fury the fierce heat made the
three at the tunnel entrance shrink away


lulita crawford pritchett

lucky thought puck that this hole in the
ground was here to shelter them then
out of the tunnel billowed stifling smoke
the fire must have caught from the hill
through some cave-in or old shaft and was
burning the rotted mine timbers a back
draft carried deadly fumes straight to the
huddled three

  trapped  tug hadnt come maybe from
lack of nourishment hed gone to sleep at
his station pucks plan her fire would be
the death of her and docie but coke was
escaping he was springing for the truck

  no need to shoot you now he hissed
over his shoulder that firell git you

  just then came a shout tug tug charg-
ing down the trail yelling docies name
puck tried to yell back but her throat
emitted only a croak he plunged toward
the house in the noise of crackling
branches and the confusion of smoke he
couldnt hear docies anguished scream
and he didnt see the green truck till it was
almost opposite him

  crack went cokes gun tug crumpled
to the ground and the snaky tongues of
flame flicked toward him

  docie would have dashed through the
fire to him if puck hadnt dragged her
back beat out the sparks in her flimsy
dress and thrown her to the earth puck
choking and gasping woozy in the head
had just sense enough left to throw herself
face down against the naked rock

tuck couldnt clear away the black fog
that pressed down upon her   

  shes cornin around said a voice that
sounded like tugs but tug had been
killed

  puck blessed little puck that sound-
ed like docie crying only docie and she
were dead

  pucks eyes fluttered open heaven cer-
tainly resembled towners sawmill there
was even mike-and joker she sat up
joker was too big a sinner to go to heaven

  take it easy kid tug put his arm
around her and docie did too their faces
were smoke-blackened and their eyebrows
gone but gee they looked swell

  i th-thought we were all d-dead puck
sobbed

  pshaw a slug in one leg aint goin to

cramp my style long scoffed tug mike
and the sawmill gang saved us

  but how did mike-

  ill tell you how mike appeared wip-
ing his red face and swearing to relieve
his feelings you can thank that ding-
danged blinkety-blanked elk he come to
the mill for more huckleberries and i seen
a big singed spot on his hide you wasnt
with him then i looked off yonder and
seen smoke yessir thats one smart elk
here joker come joker i got a nice dish
of pree-serves for you

  coke shuddered puck

  his gas tank caught fire and exploded
afore hed gone two hundred yards said
tug blowed him to perdition

  docie was trembling tug abandoned
puck and tried to put his arm around the
girls shaking shoulders she pushed him
away her face stark

  you wont want to touch me when i tell
you i knew they were up to something-
coke and my stepfather-but i shut my
eyes to it i didnt have nerve enough to
go to the sheriff coke would have killed
me and dad promised this would be the
last time hed ever have anything to do with
one of cokes deals i didnt know how
bad it was

  dont honey begged tug

  let me finish i told you i loved coke
it wasnt true ive hated him ever since
he dodged the draft i knew his stripe
forget all that tug pleaded i love
you so much i swear lifell be right for
you from now on

  you cant love me after all the nasty
things i said to you that time you came
calling she panted coke made me say
them to get rid of you

  want you lord roughly he gath-
ered her close i better be askin you do
you want a army reject a good-fer-nothin
feller-

  she put her hand over his mouth a
soldier every inch she told him only
fighting here in the forests instead of out
yonder yes i want him oh i do
darlin gently he bent and kissed her
kissing decided puck was one thing
didnt seem to need any practice looked
like tug would never have to eat any more
rock soup itd be duck soup from now on

payne

w ith a gal named
anita hart a fellow
just couldnt miss getting in-
to town on valentines day

valentine vengeance

erry welch dropped
the receiver into place with
a deliberation which con-
trasted oddly with the seethe
of emotion within him he
turned to uncle byron
moore who stood by the stove warming
himself after his ride through the winter
morning and shook his head

  it didnt come through with this last
shipment neither asked the older man
his shoulders sagging with dismay then
were sunk you and me both terry the
cattlell starve

  terrys young wind-bitten face was set
and grim and determination gave an edge
to his deep voice beales says theres not
one crumb consigned to you and me in a
few days well be opening our last stacks
of hay uncle byron and springs still a
long way off im starting to black rock

pronto to find out the why of this funny
business and ill find it out too he
snapped

  uncle byron rubbed a gnarled hand
across his bearded cheeks you got rec-
ords of our orders all right terry re-
ceipts too  dont forget to take em
along

  the wiry hard-muscled young rancher
was moving purposefully about the smoke-
darkened kitchen of the sprawling log
house while he wrapped up bacon and
biscuits added raisins and cheese and then
tied them all in a small sack

  this kind of weather it aint safe to
start out without some grub he explained
briefly

  sure aint agreed the other human
critters cant break into a haystack or a
barn and get fodder like them danged elk
that busted into our upper fields he spat


lucretia whitehead payne

tliis last out viciously adding and you
cant even take a shot at em thout break-
in the law

  terry had stuffed shells into the belt he
buckled around him hung his gun in the
holster lying against his lean hips and now
was pulling on sheepskin coat heavy boots
and fur cap

  i hate you takin the long trip into the
valley young feller said uncle byron
but dont you worry none bout things
here on high mesa bob and me can take
care of everything till you get back   
which lioss you ridin

  im skiing down the west ridge of
black canyon with crust like there is on
the snow now ill shoot down like a falling
star ill hit the valley only a few miles
from jake connors ranch and jakell let
me have a horse to ride on to town

  uncle byrons good luck terry was
blown back into his mouth as terry
slammed out of the door and faced the
zero wind it seemed to freeze his own
breath in his lungs as he hit rapidly toward
the gap where black canyon yawned down-
ward from the edge of the high benchland
where his triangle t and his neighbors
slash m lay under three feet of snow

  winter always came early to high mesa
and this past fall the snows had rushed in
early covering grazing land and forcing
extra feeding yet terry and uncle byron
might have pulled through had not a band
of elk driven from their range by winters
severity visited high mesas hay fields
with disastrous results

  weve got to get cottonseed cake
terry had said after surveying the damage
ill write the firm in cheyenne that fur-
nishes the cake and order us a ton apiece
that ought to get us through ok

  the shipment had come to the town in
the valley but roy beales who was han-
dling the business for black rock had
sent word there was none for triangle t
or slash m terry had ordered a second
time and his conversation this morning
with beales had had the same import-
no cake for high mesa it was not a bit
funny it was so damned serious that
terry was going to find out the why of it

  he poised for an instant at the summit
of the silvery slope where the trail tipped

to follow the west ridge of black canyon
ahead stretched a world of white broken
only by the dark green of pines and out-
croppings of the black rock which char-
acterized the country balancing himself
to the angle of the decline terry was an
instant later skimming down the slope at
times coasting swiftly in a veil of swirling
white spray at others riding high on drifts
congealed to almost solid ice from alternate
thawing and freezing

  now he had started he could hardly get
to town fast enough how surprised anita
would be to see him hed be there for the
valentine day dance for years he and
anita had taken this festival in together
but this year terry had given up hope of
being able to do it

  at thought of anita the loveliest as well
as the smartest girl in the world a warm
happiness swept over terry although they
were not exactly engaged there was an
understanding anita knew that the only
reason terry hadnt asked her outright to
marry him was because he wanted to feel
he was firmly established as one of the
countrysides successful cattle raisers be-
fore he asked the richest girl in black rock
to be his wife

  anita hart had inherited from her father
the big hart mercantile company and ran
it with unbelievable efficiency and at a
profit equal to old tom harts for as long
as he could remember whenever he had
come to town with his parents terry had
played about the big store he always
thought the brightest spot and the most
entrancing sound in the cavernous depths
or in the shadows of great piles of mer-
chandise the one where he could see anitas
red-gold curls and hear her gay infectious
laughter

  so they had grown up seeing each other
often until in one certain blinding moment
terry had discovered that anita had be-
come the dearest thing in life his joy
when he found out that she returned his
love overwhelmed him and until this past
fall there had been no shadow between
them

  their quarrel which terry was sure
would be forgotten when they saw each
other again had occurred over anitas in-
sistence that he accept money from her to
valentine vengeance



make a down payment  the armisted
place a splendid ranch almost bordering
the outskirts of the town which he planned
to buy for his and anitas home in that
way anita could keep in close touch with
the store which was impossible if she went
to live on high mesa

   i cant accept your offer sweetheart
he had said fighting a weakening of his
resolve when he thought of being so near
his beloved for several reasons ones
because uncle byrons getting pretty old
and since his boys are both in the service
he needs me to help him if things get too
tough anothers because i wont take
money from anyone-even you sweetheart
-if i cant earn it myself by next spring
if i can bring my cattle through as i hope
ill be able to make a good down payment
on the place and see my way clear to go
ahead on a big scale but this winter i
must feed the hay on high mesa to my
stock and keep an eye on uncle byron and
the slash m as well

  anitas eyes had been stormy and her
graceful golden head imperious as she faced
him does uncle byron mean more to
you than i do terry shed demanded
if you stay on high mesa all winter
where do i come in well miss all the
good times ive planned

  terry had looked longingly at the per-
suasive lips so near his own for she would
not let him look into her eyes curtained
behind gold-tipped lashes uncle byrons
not really kin but hes done more for me
than most kinfolk helping me get triangle
t to a place where its making more money
than dad could ever do and we can tele-
phone and write anita mxa and when
spring comes and i sell the cattle well be
able to go out on the armisted place to-
gether just keep thinking of that the way
ill be doing and the time wont seem so
long

  anita had refused to understand when
she had such a generous income she couldnt
see why the man she expected to marry
should refuse to accept a loan from her
especially when it was on the home she
was to share with him and because terry
was proud and independent and she was
hurt and vexed they had quarreled bitterly
the next morning when he had ridden out

of town she hadnt come to tell him good-
by and although he made excuses to linger
around for an hour he did not see her and
rode away discouraged and sore at heart

  there had been a few brief impersonal
letters from anita in reply to his affection-
ate loving missives there had been a few
unsatisfactory telephone calls but most of
the time winters storms had put the line
out of commission this morning was the
first time terry had been able to get
through to black rock for weeks

          rom out of a winter world
          in which he had for hours
          seemed the only inhabitant
          terry at length reached jake
          connors ranch

              hi jake he called un-
fastening his skis and shaking fine snow
from his clothing you got a caller

  the gaunt bent rancher shambled to the
door and at sight of his caller squinted in
amazement ive heerd tell he vouch-
safed that the high countrys liable in
wintertime to send folks as live there loco

   looks like youre one of em terry
welch skiin round the country like you
was on a picnic

  terrys cold face cracked in a grin
sure jake im a gentleman of leisure
on my way to town to take in the valentine
dance tomorrow if youll loan me a horse
to get there then sobering as anxiety
again pressed on him you still got plenty
feed jake or you had to get cake

  im runnin a mite low on hay dang
this confounded long hard winter if this
blasted snow dont go off soon ill have to
get cake all right ive writ roy beales
and hes said he can let me have some was
i to need it

  so-o exclaimed terry in surprise
does that mean beales is buying more
cake than just whats been ordered keeps
plenty on hand and he thought he
didnt mention anything like that to me
and he knows that my cattle and uncle
byrons are in a serious fix

  the two were walking toward the stables
as connor answered handling it through
the hart mercantile i reckon beales acts
nowadays like he owns the concern prob-
ably thinks hes got anita hart lassoed


lucretia whitehead payne

you bein outa the picter now though how
a girl like anita who we all thunk was
goin to hitch up with you terry can take
up with that snooty cuss i dont savvy

  roy beales and anita the idea had never
occurred to terry and the force of con-
nors surmise struck him a sickening jolt
beales had come to black rock in reply
to an advertisement by the hart company
for a trained storeman and he had proved
he was all that yet he had never beeji
popular with the people who traded with
the store and to terry in particular his
sleek fox-like smoothness shifty eyes and
rat-trap mouth had always been obnoxious

  though he could hardly wait to reach
town and see the girl he loved he looked
carefully over the stabled horses with ex-
perienced eyes before he said can i take
the buckskin jake looks like hes strong
and speedy then he went on gratefully
some day ill get even with you for this
and dont you forget it youre a real
friend

  but terrys eyes were hard and his
tanned features bleak and grim as he rode
toward town at a fast trot was he too
late had anitas love for him cooled as
a result of their quarrel and his long ab-
sence he couldnt bring himself to be-
lieve it yet uneasy and unhappy thoughts
traveled close to him all the long cold ride

  it was late afternoon when he stabled the
buckskin at the towns big livery barn en-
gaged a room at the warm steamy hotel
and then strode along the snow-packed
street to black rocks most pretentious
building which housed the hart mercan-
tile companys big general store

  as terry pulled open the frosty glass-
paneled doors he smelled the never-forgot-
ten mingled odors of drygoods and coffee
and dried fruit and leather that drifted
through the establishment for a moment
he stood uncertainly inside the door his
hungry gaze searching for a golden head
that always caught and held the light just
as it caught and held his heart searching
also for the lovely animated face with gold-
lashed blue eyes and long laughing lips

  at last his quest was rewarded and he
reached anitas side just as her customer
departed

  anita anita mia he spoke her name

as if it were a melody singing through him
his heart was singing as she flashed a de-
lighted glance at him her lips curved in
delight her slender hands reaching out to
him in happy welcome how had he ever
had the strength of will to stay away from
her so long terry wondered as his arms
slipped about her and he felt the wonder of
her yielding to his embrace

  terry she breathed terry ive so
missed you

  i came for the valentine dance after
all you see sweetheart our dance i want
a hart for my valentine this year as
always

  so sure had he been of her welcome
agreement that he felt a chill worse than
that of his long hard trip when the light
died from her eyes and she pulled herself
free of his arms he was not conscious of
anyone near only of sickening disappoint-
ment as she said

  im afraid thats quite impossible
terry

  you mean he began and stopped
aware of someone standing behind him
listening

  a smooth patronizing voice broke in
in town on business welch something
we can do for you here in the store

  roy beales smiled at the rancher but
it was a smile devoid of warmth or friendli-
ness more like the expression of a fox
which had snatched its prey from a weaker
animal how like a fox he was thought
terry swinging around and looking down
on the storeman whom he overtopped by
four good inches

  his own voice was cold and expression-
less in town to find out why theres no
cottonseed cake for the two ranches on
high mesa and i aim to find out about it
before i leave

  beales hunched his shoulders insolently
and terry felt his hands clench at his sides
as anita slipped away and disappeared
beales said i told you over the phone all
there is to know bad business i realize
but you can probably buy hay to get you
through

  you know damned well i cant buy
hay snapped terry when practically
every cowmans had to buy cake it means
theyve no hay
valentine vengeance



  that doesnt necessarily mean theyre
short said the other with smug superior-
ity  some think its good to use cake along
with regular feed maybe i can locate some
hay for you

  and if you can said terry contempt-
uously you know that the triangle t and
the slash m couldnt get the cattle to it
what kind of a line are you handing me
beales you seem to forget pm a cowman
not a storekeeper

  leaving beales unceremoniously terry
hurried after anita who was putting away
things for the night you cant mean
what you said sweetheart he began re-
proachfully why i came to town mostly
to take you to the dance

  her voice was quite expressionless and
she did not look at him ive promised to
go with roy

  dont i come first he queried hurt
and unhappv id thought that you and
i-

  are just old friends terry so please
dont make it harder for me by not under-
standing what ive told you terry was
sure he heard a catch in her voice and had
taken an impulsive step toward her when
roy beales reached them

  oh here you are anita he said pro-
prietarily weve just time to talk over
that grocer order    gnight welch
edged thus unceremoniously out of the
picture terry said a brusque good-by and
let himself out into the cold night mingled
anger and disappointment fighting in him
there was however another piece of busi-
ness to investigate and he hoped grimly to
be more successful in this matter

mfter supper at the
hotel he went to the tele-
graph office and sent a
wire to the cheyenne
firm from which he had
ordered the cotton seed
cake then restless and consumed with
desire to straighten out the misunderstand-
ing with anita he went to her house she
hadnt seemed very happy when beales was
around and she had certainly changed after
he interrupted their first conversation if
terry could only see her alone

  a short walk brought him to her house

and he stopped outside the picket fence
his eager eyes traveling to the brightly
lighted living room he saw anitas golden
curls bent over some sewing and his heart
beat high for a moment until he also saw
beales stretched lazily in a big chair smok-
ing altogether a very domestic scene

  terry thought he had had enough blows
in the short time since he had reached black
rock this last one sent him almost reel-
ing back to the hotel where after an un-
happy pipe or two and some pessimistic
conversation with other ranchers regarding
the hard winter and shortage of feed he
went somberly to bed but not to sleep

  early next morning he visited black
rocks real estate operator jovial ed
gates ed greeted him with a friendly slap
on the shoulders which well nigh upset
terrys stalwart frame yet was heart-
warming in contrast to last nights recep-
tion at the hart store

  welcome to our city he boomed
what can we do for you

  i want to make a down payment on the
armisted place ed and heres a check for
the amount no use to explain that this
check represented practically terrys en-
tire bank balance he wanted to cinch the
deal while he was here

  gates shook his head regretfully youre
too late by about a month terry

  too late but id talked it over with
you last fall you understood that i in-
tended-

  but remember no money had passed
if you hadnt been away off there on high
mesa and the telephone out of order id
have got in touch with you but with you
snowed in in that damned high country it
was hopeless and this buyer had the
cash

  and the buyer the question a whip-
lash of despair

  anita hart though its funny shed
want a ranch her always busy at the store
probably aims to lease it i spose youve
heard about her and roy beales  she used
to be your girl didnt she terry too
bad for i cant stomach beales

  the transactions completed terry
asked this mechanically with a faint hope
that anita might have changed her mind
im expectin the last papers from the


lucretia whitehead payne

county seat any day sorry why dont
you see about leasing from anita

  perhaps i might said the other and
automatically found himself walking toward
the hart store hed face anita and get
an explanation for this despicable action
wasnt it enough for her to throw him over
for beales without knocking out his pur-
chase of the armisted place 

  on the way he stopped at the telegraph
office and found an answer from cheyenne
to the effect that both of his orders had
been filled and shipped to black rock the
firm was at a loss to understand why he
had not received the cake and would like
to have him investigate and report to them

  and that said terry between tight
lips is something more for roy beales
to try to explain

  terry soon found anita but could not
get a word with her in private she greeted
him casually and quickly and then absorbed
herself with customers whom she made no
attempt to escape finally ablaze with
anger over this snub terry got hold of
beales and showed him the telegram

  now lets hear how good you are at
explanations he snapped

  he had come upon beales in a corner
between a wall and a counter and at the
others trapped expression experienced in-
ward satisfaction despite the telegram
beales stuck to it that no cake had come
for triangle t or slash m and although
terry wanted to choke the truth out of him
-for he was sure he was lying-he couldnt
make a scene here

  ill see you about this again he said
grimly and went to see the owner of black
rocks other general store who until this
year had handled the cottonseed cake ship-
ments from grizzled martin cox terry
learned that beales had offered the chey-
enne people a substantial sum for the busi-
ness

  what could i do asked cox somberly
i couldnt afford to outbid him besides
i didnt know about it until the deald gone
through most of the ranchers dont like
beales thinkin he aint to be trusted but
so long as hes in with anita that every-
body thinks the world of they play along
with him

  terry thanked the storekeeper and

  departed more sure than ever that the
odor of something skunkish was growing
stronger

  somehow the day wore on until evening
and time for the big dance when terry
joined the merrymakers there he tow-
ered tall and handsome above most of the
men and he received a welcoming smile
from every girl present he was dancing
with paula robbins when anita and beales
arrived and terry caught for a fleeting
moment hurt amazement on the girls pen-
sive face an instant later she and her
escort joined the dance with beales taking
evident care to keep away from terry

  nor did terry make any effort to cut in
on anita until during an hilarious paul
jones he met her in the circle and delib-
erately drew her away out of the room
he felt a shiver shake her slender grace-
ful body and it sounded as if she was fight-
ing tears then in the quiet of the deserted
hall he bent his head until he could look
into her face and saw two great tears roll-
ing down it holding her closer he begged
passionately

  cant you tell me whats troubling
you my darling wont you tell me youll
marry me anita tnta and let me make you
happy

  oh terry if only i could please trust
me no matter what i do but let me go
now its of you im thinking

  no he began and saw beales com-
ing through the door a veritable thunder-
cloud in his sly eyes and fox-like face ill-
concealed triumphant satisfaction

  i suppose you were telling welch good-
by anita he said curtly but now come
back and dance and over his shoulder
ill say the same welch sorry i couldnt
run down any feed for you

  perhaps ill have better luck myself
retorted terry as soon as i attend to one
more piece of business

ttending to this
piece of business took
him now to the hart
mercantile building
where a key which anita
had given him long ago
when he used to do things for her after
store hours let him into the empty echo-
valentine vengeance



ing building going straight through to
the rear where the warehouse was located
he turned on a powerful flashlight and be-
gan clambering over piled-up boxes and
bales of merchandise

  he looked closely in the dark distant
corners and three times disappointment
had laid hold of him until in the last cor-
ner he found a huge tarpaulin throwing
back an end of this he found under it a
pile of sacks like those used to ship cotton-
seed cake and after making small slits in
several of the sacks he saw they contained
just that

  pulling a tapeline from his pocket terry
measured the approximate dimensions of
this pile and computed the contents the
result was close enough to the amount of
cake which should have been delivered to
him and uncle byron to prove to him that
beales had kept it hidden here probably
intending to sell it later to other ranchers

  beales wanted to ruin terry welch
this was now very evident if terry could
not get his cattle through the winter he
would have nothing to offer anita and he
had been counting on this years sales to
put him among the well-to-do ranchers of
the country beales wanted anita for him-
self and since he was unscrupulous and
underhanded it wasnt strange hed try to
ruin his rival but what about anita she
seemed to have sided against terry too
else why had she bought the armisted
place when she knew he planned to pur-
chase it

  it was all a disheartening puzzle he was
trying to solve and he went now to the
office where he should be able to find the
bills of lading for the cake on them would
be listed the stockmen who had purchased
it the amount each had ordered and the
price

  he felt like a housebreaker as he rum-
maged through the office desk and files but
success rewarded him sooner than he had
hoped and he had just stuffed the impor-
tant papers into his pocket when a sound
at the door brought him pivoting in that
direction

  roy beales stood there gloating mali-
ciously this is better than i thought
to catch terry welch red-handed ran-
sacking the office of the hart mercantile

company this spells your finish my
friend when anita hears about it now
hand over what youve just put into your
pocket

  terry made no move to comply you
havent all the cards by a long way beales
he retorted when anita hears what i
have to tell and can now prove youre the
one wholl be thrown out on your ear
now get out of my way

  a big automatic had appeared in beales
fist and the flame of hate burning in the
fellows narrow sallow face warned terry
that he was in real danger snapping off
his flashlight he hurled it straight at his
enemys head and as the fellow pivoted
and dodged it gave terry a split-second
chance with a swift lunge terry succeeded
in knocking the automatic out of beales
hand and his steel-hard arms closed about
the fellows chest pulling him backward

  squirming in terrys grasp like a snake
beales twisted around until he had his head
directly under his captors chin then like
a spring released he straightened the top
of his head connected with terrys chin
whose head snapped back and arms went
slack

  wrenching free beales evidently be-
lieved he had terry at his mercy ill tell
everybody that i caught terry welch rob-
bing anita hart and had to kill him in self-
defense and now ill have a clear field with
the girl even if she was holding me off all
winter

  groggy though he was terry was still
able to move and had already put a long
table between himself and beales at the
boast about anita the murk and haze which
enveloped him suddenly cleared still pre-
tending dizziness he stopped at one corner
of the table his head lolling forward on
his chest

  following up what he believed to be his
advantage beales covered the few feet be-
tween them hands clenched ready for a
knockout blow when he reached the ranch-
man but as he reached the spot terrys
whip-lash body jerked erect his long young
arms reached out and vised his enemy with
an inescapable grip

  at that instant the room was bright with
electric light and terry saw anita hart in
the doorway expertly holding a small pis-


lucretia whitehead payne

tol instantly beales broke into violent
accusations of terry welch

  ignoring the tirade anita spoke to
terry heres rope to tie him with until
we can straighten out this affair heres a
telegram to you i found out in the ware-
room after what it says i suppose youve
been trying to find out what happened to
the cake you ordered i found where it was
stored too and believe me terry id had
no idea till then that roy beales had been
up to such crooked business

   thanks for coming when you did anita
this is all thats necessary to show this
snake hell be better off if he takes the first
train out of town

  terry yanked beales along by the coat
collar and gave him a swift shove out the
front door reckon we wont see him
again he said shortly

  he turned then to show anita the other
proof hed found of beales crookedness
if id believed you knew anything about
it id have gone straight to you sweet-
heart but you seemed to have gone over
so completely to beales i had to do my
scouting on my own why wouldnt you

have anything to do with me since i came
to town

  anita put both arms around terrys
neck her beautiful eyes warm with affec-
tion roy threatened to ruin you if i
wouldnt agree to marry him and said he
had a sure way of doing it he learned that
youd wanted the annisted place and said
he was going to buy it himself i had to
hurry to get ahead of him it was the only
thing i could do

  the final papers of the sale wont be
ready for a day or two so i had to play
along with him for fear he might find a way
to block it hes utterly ruthless and almost
diabolical the way he can get anything he
wants he really had me scared once or
twice and wanting to keep him from hurt-
ing you i had to pretend i liked him but
its you ive loved all along terry dar-
ling

  if youll let me buy the armisted place
from you anita mla everything will be
just as i dreamed    and now lets
hurry back to our dance sweetheart i
want to get there in time to dance home
sweet home with my valentine

mustangs white and black

by j frank dobie

  these are the sort of legends that can grow up only among a free people
  in a land where love of liberty is a passion no nazi could understand them

he great horse went under
many names-the white
steed of the prairies the
pacing white stallion the
white mustang the ghost
horse of the plains there
were in fact various extraordinary white
mustang stallions scattered far apart and
living at different times in tradition
they blended into one superb stallion of
supreme grace beauty speed lire endur-
ance and intelligence the blend was an an-
imal whose passion for liberty was also
the passion of the free-riding men who
chased him both he and they were ready
to die if need be to maintain that liberty

  john r morgan came to travis county
texas from kentucky in  he was
soon riding with his uncle john w young
who had at that time been a range man for
going on a quarter of a century from
him and from other men who were then
old-timers morgan learned the detailed
history of the wonderful horse i will try

to give his story as he gave it to me when
he was a very old man it is a story that
belongs to days long before barbed wire
was dreamed of

  in the early s a remarkable stallion
appeared among the wild horses ranging
on onion creek in travis county he had
the markings of a purebred arabian his
form was perfect his alertness and vitality
were superb he was pure white his tail
brushed the tall mesquite grass that car-
peted the earth and his tossing mane swept
to his knees his only gait out of a walk
was a pace and it was soon found that he
never no matter how hard pressed broke
that pace his manad-o or bunch of mares
normally numbered from fifty to sixty head
-double the size of an ordinary mustang
maiiada

  his favorite watering place was on onion
creek near mckinney falls but he led his
mctnada over a great range southwest
across the blanco the san marcos and to
the guadalupe it was known that he at




j frank dobie

times ranged even as far south as the
nueces though this was not on his accus-
tomed round he kept clear of the timbers
never crossed the colorado to the east and
did not range into the rocky cedar hills to
the west he seemed to like the rich mes-
quite grass of rolling country edging the
blacklands better than that on the black-
iands themselves his habits were closely
studied

  it was observed that when persistently
chased the white stallion usually moved
southward it was generally supposed that
he had come up from that direction there
was some evidence that he had been im-
ported to mexico had been brought up as
far as the texas border by one of the own-
ers of the great horseranches occupying
that country and then after being estab-
lished on this ranch had quit it and the
semi-domesticated horse stock to run with
the mustangs many a good ranch stallion
in those days answered the call of the wild
mustangs some of them never to be re-
covered

  the white stallion no matter how
chased always in time came back to the
water of and the mesquite grass along
onion creek the favorite point of view
from which to see him and his manada was
pilot knob about four miles from mckin-
ney falls from this eminence john w
young himself saw the stallion and his
manada several times any mustanging
party that proposed a chase generally sent
a scout to pilot knob to locate their quarry

  the white stallions color his alert
movements and the large size of his mana-
da all made him and the bunch he led
conspicuous if started he would lead out
pacing-single-footing-the manada fol-
lowing at a dead run in a miles distance
lie would gain at least a hundred and fifty
yards on anything behind him then he
would stop and look back and wait while
his bunch approached if pursuers were
still following he would pace on gaining
and gaining but again would stop and
look back thus keeping out of shooting as
well as roping distance

  the indians had spotted him and they
gave him a few chases but the most per-
sistent chasers were from san antonio
then a horseback town a certain doctor of

san antonio who was a horse fancier heard
of the white stallion saw him in action and
offered five hundred dollars for him if de-
livered in sound condition five hundred
dollars in those days amounted to a small
fortune

  a mexican named santa ana cruz de-
termined to win the prize he had a ranch
on onion creek near mckinney falls and
had numerous vaqueros under him he had
led a desperate life and it is said that he
kept as many as ten guards around his
house every night his men had chased the
white stallion numerous times one day
they ran him seventy-five miles south and
when they got back home two days later
found him grazing with his mares on the
accustomed range

  now to win the five hundred dollars
santa ana cruz picked twelve riders
furnished each of them with two horses
selected for speed and endurance-particu-
larly endurance-and disposed them in the
direction that the white stallion might be
expected to run after he was started a
scout on pilot knob saw the manada go in
to water after the horses had drunk the
nearest of the twelve men began the chase
the white pacer took out in the direction
of san antonio that first day however
he did not keep his direction and before
the morning of the second day he had cir-
cled back onto his favorite range he was
crowded harder his mares lagged more
and on this day he crossed the guadalupe
going southwest for three days and three
nights the santa ana cruz men ceaselessly
pursued him the time picked for the
chase was in the full of the mooft in june
and the country covered was in those days
nearly all open prairie

  before the end of the third day every
animal in the manada following the white
stallion had been run down he himself
however had not once lagged had not once
broken his single-footing except to change
from right to left and left to right two of
santa ana cruz relay men trailed him
across the frio river then they quit the
white stallion was still pacing toward the
rio grande

  he never returned to his old range in
time the onion creek country learned why

  going on south the pacing mustang no
mustangs white and black



doubt drank at the nueces river before
modern ranchmen built tanks drilled wells
and put up windmills the wide country
between the nueces and the rio grande
was very sparsely watered in some places
it is a level country all brushed today in
other places it is crumpled into high rough
hills and cut by deep canyons about three
miles from a water hole in one of these dry
canyons there was in the s a mexican
ranch called chaparro prieto the low
rock house with port holes against indian
attacks and the adjacent corrals were lo-
cated in a wide draw matted with mesquite
grass nearby was a hand-dug well that
supplied water for the ranch people and
for the saddle horses all stock loose on the
range watered at the big hole in the canyon
the only watering within a radius of many
miles

  the hole was boxed in by the canyon
walls on both sides and by a high bluff
above it leaving only one entrance-from
the north one hot afternoon a vaqnero
from the chaparro prieto while riding
near the water hole saw a lone white horse

he maintained an alertness in ears eyes and
nostrils the wind was in the vaqneros
favor he cautiously slipped a hand over
his mounts nostrils to prevent a possible
whinny as the horse passed nearer he
recognized him from descriptions he had
often heard-as the pacing white stallion
of the mustangs

  here was a chance to rope what so many
riders had tried and failed to capture as
has been said there was but one entrance
and exit to the boxed water hole the
vaqnero knew that the thirsty stallion
would drink deep and come back up the
bank loggy with water after the mustang
had gone down the trail out of sight the
vaqnero placed himself in position for a
sure throw when the animal should emerge
the man was riding a fresh pony he did
not have long to wait

  within a few minutes the long sought-
for lover of freedom emerged his ears
working his body refreshed his senses
more alert he saw the trap and made a
dash so cunning that he eluded the ropes
throw quickly recoiling his riata for an-

he wheeled and with wide-open mouth rushed at his captor

approaching in a slow pace from the north
at the instant of observation he was hidden
by some black chaparral and was consid-
erably to one side of the trail the horse was
traveling

  the animals behavior indicated that he
had smelled the water he was very gaunt
which meant he had not drunk for a long
while he was evidently jaded but his
footing though weary seemed secure and

other cast the vaqnero spurred in pursuit
the steed of the prairies had come two
hundred miles or more from his range on
onion creek besides pacing in great circles
before he bad finally headed straight for the
rio grande his marvelous endurance was
at last wearing out the water that had
refreshed him also loaded him down

the second loop thrown by the fast-run-
ning vaqnero went over his head but he did


j frank dobie

not run full speed on the rope and jerk him-
self down his response showed that he
had been roped before he wheeled just as
the rope tightened and with wide-open
mouth rushed at his captor he did not
seem to see the horse ridden by the vaquero
he was after the man he nearly seized
him but the agile cow-pony had wheeled
also

   fortunately for the vaqueros life some
scattered mesquite trees grew just ahead
of him guiding his well reined pony he

he would lead out pacing the manada
following at a dead run

managed to get one of these mesquites be-
tween himself and the roped stallion the
mesquite served as a snubbing post for him
to halt and then tie the magnificent horse
magnificent for unlike many mustangs
appearing magnificent at a distance this
one remained so at close quarters even
though worn by his long war of defense

   tying him up as close as he could and
leaving him to lunge at the rawhide-strong
riata the vaquero left in a long lope to get
help at the rancho chaparro prieto he
returned in less than an hour w-ith two
other vaqueros with three ropes on the
white mustang now thus checking his at-
tempts to fight they led and drove him to
a spot on the prairie near the ranch corrals
where the mesquite grass was particularly
fine there they threw the proud king of
the mustangs tied ropes on him so that he
could not choke himself to death fixed a
clog on one of his forefeet and staked him
when night came he was standing where
they left him not having taken a mouthful
of grass

   the next day they carried a sawed-off
barrel used as a trough within the horses
reach and filled it with water he did not

notice it for ten days and ten nights he
remained there grass all about him water
at his nostrils tip without taking one bite
to eat or one swallow out of the trough
then he lay down and died he fulfilled
the ringing cry of patrick henry give
me liberty or give me death as he had
lived he died-nobly

ertan black mus-
tang stallions achieved
fame also but no one of
them ever became so
famous as the pacing
white mustang and
not add themselves together to
make one single continuous tradition here
are some of the several

  in the early days of parker county
texas a beautiful black leader of the mus-
tangs became the object of many mens de-
sire after they had tried in various ways
to catch him two or three persistent mus-
tangers dug a hole large enough to contain
a man out on a prairie which the black
and his manada frequently used grass
made the whole invisible except to eyes
almost over it day after day one of the
men rode to this hole gave his horse to a
partner to lead out of sight and with
loaded rifle waited for the mustang to ap-
proach wnthin shooting distance his ob-
ject was to crease the mustang-shoot him
through the top of the neck so that the
tendon running there would be so injured
as to paralyze the animal temporarily
creasing took an expert shot a fraction
high and the bullet would be harmless a
fraction too low and it would be fatal

   after the concealed mustangers patience
was about exhausted his companions man-
aged one day to haze the black stallion with-
in rifle shot the bullet paralyzed the
beautiful stallion all right-paralyzed him
permanently

   among the thousands of mustang horses
grazing in the san joaquin valley of cali-
fornia in early days the one that lives
strongest in stories still told was a black
stallion because he was the most beautiful
and the fleetest animal in all the mailadas
ranging around tulare lake he was the
most sought for pens were built with long
wings to catch him while many other mus-
mustangs white and black



tangs were captured in these pens the
black never allowed himself to be hemmed
in his fame spread finally two cowboys
spied him feeding out on the point of a
long tongue of land jutting into the lake
loosening riatas and yelling they rode to-
ward him at last they had the stallion
cut off he snorted and plunged into the
soggy-bottom lake when he got out to
where the water was about halfway up his
sides he began floundering in the mud the
men retreated so as to give him a chance to
get back on the land-and come by them
on his way out the black paused seemed
to consider and then plunged farther out
from the peninsula his struggles growing
more desperate it looked as if he designed
drowning rather than capture and drown
he did

he action of the captured
white stallion in standing
on grass and beside water
for ten days without touch-
ing either appears to have
been as deliberate as the
self-starvation of any hunger-striker in
india though his captors may have in-
jured him internally the injury could
hardly have destroyed his thirst certainly
they broke his heart the manner in which
the tulare black chose the fatal mud rather
than safe footing on man-dominated land
looks like another case of witful suicide
though terror may have driven him to
death-terror at a threat to his wild free
way of living

   in the fall of  w k shipman who
now lives out from the edge of san an-
tonio was an eighteen-year-old cowboy
ranging on jim ned creek in west texas
he had already bossed a herd up the trail
the sparsity of men on the frontier and
the opportunities for self-reliance made
boys develop early except for drift fences
the range was still open and many mus-
tangs yet ran on the vast broken prairies
east of the caprock shipman had noted
especially one band led by a blood-bay
stallion with black mane and tail he got
six other cowboys to go in with him to
capture this band all agreeing that ship-
man himself should have the stallion if they
ever got him within reach of a rope

  after some preliminary running the
mustangers managed to work a belled mare
into the wild band the stallion adopted
her and her bell proved to be a consider-
able help to the pursuers at night

  the mustangs were accustomed to water-
ing in jim ned creek to which they had
to descend from prairie country down
trails through the roughs now they
seemed afraid to enter the rough land and
thus get cut off from their open running
grounds though by crossing the breaks
they might have cut the buckboard off from
pursuit

  for three days and nights the cowboys
kept so close behind them that they took no
chances in going down to water and of
course ate very little at the end of this
time they were near enough walked down
so that they could be thrown in with some
manageable range horses and hazed into a
big cow pen

  in the pen the blood-bay stallion his
black mane and tail marking spanish an-
cestry showed up as beautiful as well pro-
portioned and as desirable as he had ap-
peared while running in the distance on the
prairies during the long chase he had ex-
ercised much more than the other animals
in his band sometimes leading them often
driving them frequently racing up one side
of them and down the other now he stood
gaunt jaded but still with plenty of life
in him and apparently as sound as a dollar

  when roped he struggled but did not
fight when mounted he did not pitch
guiding him with a hackamore and accom-
panied by two other men shipman rode
out of the pen toward jim ned creek some
distance off and into water not more than
eighteen inches deep the reins of his
hackamore loosened the mustang thrust his
muzzle into the water up to his eyes then
he lay down his muzzle still submerged

  his rider quickly loosened the girth and
all three men struggled to force the mus-
tangs head out for air he would not let
them he drowned himself right there
no doubt he was dazed past the stage of
using clear-headed judgment certain psy-
chologists say that no man who kills him-
self is entirely sane at the time however
that may be taking the mustang stallions
liberty from him took his instinct for life

the story so far

 deputy u s marshal steve ren-
nevant on tlic trail of the faro kid runs
onto wanted whitey hallmark whom
he passes up in the hope that hallmark will
lead him to other crooks then to water his
horse steve rides into the town of san sureno
where he learns hallmark is foreman for
diamond dan bannerman owner of
the double d the border belle saloon and ruth-
less and crooked boss of san sureno

  banncrman has about ruined the ranges former
top ranchcr jeff cruzatte of the anvil
and has even tried unsuccessfully to court jeffs
blonde and beautiful daughter anne

  here in town steve runs into an old friend a
piano-playing gambler pete modesto whom
tb has driven to dealing from the bottom of the
deck for bannerman pete almits to steve that
banner man has ruined cruzatte through crooked
cards but on learning that the rancher has gone
into the border belle to face down banm-rman
begs steve to get cruzatte out of there alive

  because he owes pete a debt for once having
saved his life and also perhaps for the sake of
blonde anne cruzatte steve goes to the saloon
and blocks bannermans play cruzatte gets out
safely but then the wolves gang up on steve
only because pete who is watching from a win-
dow throws his watch at a chandelier and puts
rut the light is steve able to escape

by now jeff cruiaties son bob has come

back bullet-ridden from a quest for money to
carry on the fight against the double d he is
put to bed in the cattle king hotel run by his
fiancee kate carmody and is carefully
nursed by kate and anne

  steve is now the target for double d gun-
hands particularly the two most dangerous
turk gallego and red haggin red
is set to ambush him but annes studied greet-
ing to the gunman warns steve he then  walks
up to haggin saying red grab-or git

part two

        chapter viii
        kindred emotions

ennevants blunt
 command seemed to
startle red haggin to

drive a wedge of inde-
cision into him re-
membering how hed
bullied other men anne watched him
closely and felt a surge of satisfaction
steve rennevant was ramming reds rep-


utation down his throat was deliberately
inviting him to fight

  turk gallego came through the batwings
and stood just clear of them peering briefly
at rennevant he said something to hag-
gin speaking so softly that the words
didnt carry across the street then he
went back into the saloon

  rennevant kept watching haggin kept
waiting for him to make up his mind he
asked finally well whats it going to
he

  the lingers of haggins right hand eased
an inch closer to his gun anne thought
now hes going to grab and hes awfully
last

  doc dineen came downstairs that
brother of yours is too tough to die the
medico reported he just smiled at kate

  swell anne exclaimed and motion-
ing for dineen to join her said warningly
dont go out just now doc there may
be some shooting

  rennevant took out his durham sack
using his left hand for this chore when
he lifted the tobacco sack to his teeth and


l ernenwein

pulled it open doc dineen exclaimed
the darn fool is fixing to roll a ciga-
rette

  anne didnt speak and for a moment she
didnt breath she just stood there watch-
ing red haggins right hand expecting to
see it flash up with a blasting gun for a
seemingly endless interval while haggin
stood like a crouched statue the street be-
came so quiet that anne could hear the
murmur of voices in bobs room upstairs
someone came along the hall started down
the stairs   

  then rennevant called proddingly
come on come on play or pass

  red haggin passed he sidestepped to
the batwings and backed through them like
a clown leaving a stage whereupon anne
sighed and smiled and turning toward the
stairway saw pete modesto looking pale
and sick as he always looked in the morn-
ing the old gambler went out and crossed
the street scarcely noticing rennevant
down at the livery stable hooligan slapped
his knee with the steel hook which served
him for a right hand and wincing at the
impact blurted the redhead turned tail
bejasus

  a few doors up the street a mystified
barber stood goggle-eyed over in the mer-
cantile doorway mayor matabelle loosed a
gasp of utter astonishment and jules lar-
son exclaimed theres the man we need
john-a professional gunman

  doc dineen came out of the hotel and
peered over his glasses at rennevant
that was kettledrum basins bad boy you
were talking to he said nobody here-
abouts ever talked to red like that before
and got away with it

  rennevant chuckled and going into the
hotel found anne waiting for him in the
lobby

  she said smilingly you play rough
dont you steve rennevant

  again as last night confusion disrupted
the orderly run of rennevants thoughts
but he managed to ask hows your
brother this morning

  bob is going to live she declared hap-
pily even doc dineen agrees with me
now then she said dad tells me you
turned down his offer of a job

  yes rennevant acknowledged and

decided that her eyes were dark hazel
ive got other plans

  she asked wouldnt your plans per-
mit you to ride for dad until my brother
gets well enough to ride

  well not exactly rennevant mut-
tered im sorry for your father being
in such a fix but-well you see maam
my gun isnt for hire

  i know youre not a professional gun-
hawk she said quickly

  how would you know that renne-
vant asked and saw embarrassment put a
rose stain in her cheeks

  i-i sensed it last night when you stood
in the hall she said in a hushed con-
fessional voice i dont know what you
are steve rennevant but youre no hired
killer im sure of that

  something in the words and the way
she said them put a high flare of satisfac-
tion into rennevant for upwards of five
years men had called him a merciless killer
a tin-star slug-slammer without mercy or
tolerance theyd given his gun skill
grudging respect but theyd shunned him
as a man apart from other men yet this
warm-eyed girl was saying she knew he
was something more than a grisly pariah

  and she was plucking at his sleeve say-
ing softly urgently wont you give us a
hand for just a little while weve got to
chouse bannermans cattle off our grass
before they eat up our winter graze and
weve got to rebuild five miles of drift
fence

  even then with the sense of her fingers
on his arm stirring his pulse to faster
rhythm rennevant had no intention of
granting her request hell a man couldnt
let a girls soft words and glowing eyes
interfere with duty-even though shed
saved him from haggins sneak play a
few minutes ago then abruptly it occurred
to him that he wouldnt be leaving this
country for at least two weeks perhaps
longer if he remained here without work-
ing someone might suspect he was a badge-
toter and spoil his chance of corralling the
hallmark gang

  anne spoke again still in that low con-
fessing tone i never was renllv afraid in
my life until last night when dad went into
the border belle she said id never
lobo law



known what fear was like but i know
now

  rennevant fingered his sweat-stained
hat he kept seeing all the things in anne
that hed ever dreamed of seeing in a girl
and because he knew that a man-hunting
lawdog had no right to romantic notions
he damned himself for seeing them

   all right he said finally ill ride for
your father just as a cowhand and not as
a gun-rider and im only staying a couple
of weeks please remember that maam
a quick smile curved her fulsome lips
she reached out and took his hand and said
i will ill remember our bargain steve
and from now dont call me maam my
name is anne

  the intimate tone of her voice and the
pressure of her slim fingers affected him
tremendously they put an emotion in him
different from anything hed ever felt

  all right anne he said softly

  for a brief moment then while they
stood with eyes in close communion steve
rennevant understood why countless men
had fought and toiled and died for the
women of their choice remembering that
dan bannerman had endeavored to win
this girl he understood diamond dans
insistent desire to possess her here was
completeness for a man here were warmth
and beauty and fragrance-a living shrine
to worship and sustain

  and because all his perceptions were
keyed to this fleeting flawless clarity
rennevant sensed a kindred emotion in
anne knew without question that she
shared some portion of the rising flame in-
side him as if in frank admission to that
fact her fingers tugged gently for release
and she said please steve

  her voice was low little more than a
whisper but the throb of suppressed ex-
citement in it showed how surely she shared
the emotion shed aroused in him how high
a flame they had kindled together

  he released her fingers and when she
said its cooler outside went with her to
the tree-shaded bench at the far end of the
veranda

  presently he asked why is banner-
man so set on owning anvil

  because hes a born range hog anne
said anvil and the homestead hills

would give double d a clean sweep to the
mexican border if bannerman owned an-
vil hed crowd the small outfits from the
homestead hills and have graze enough
to run the biggest bunch of cattle in ari-
zona territory

  well rennevant drawled its not a
new idea according to the bible they had
range-grabbing trouble way back when the
israelites were running cattle on the mesa
land east of jerusalem i dont know
whether those old-time cowpokes used cen-
ter-fire saddles or double rigs but they
had the same ideas about grass and water
anne eyed him wonderingly i would
never have guessed you were a bible read-
er she said

  im not but my father was a religious
man

  an old bitterness edged rennevants
voice as he added my father believed in
the bible and came as close to following
it as a cowman could but he died cussing
the thieves that shot him

  is that why you take pleasure in fight-
ing men like red haggin she asked
because you dont like thieves

  i hate em rennevant said flatly i
hate the very sight and shape of a thief

chapter ix

something to remember

ayor mata-
belle came across
the veranda and spoke
to anne rennevant
made ready to leave
but the mayor asked
going to ride for anvil
rennevant nodded giving the old mer-
chant a deliberate appraisal

  then i want you to hear what ive got
to say matabelle declared and joined
them  the bcnch ive tried to stay
clear of range squables he said but it
looks like well never have any peace
around here until dan bannerman is
chopped down to size hes trying to talk
tate kiley into foreclosing mortgages on
five pool ranches and wants tate to sell
them to him at half their real value tate
doesnt want to do it but the bank is over-


l ernenwein

loaned and cant finance a holdout fight
against double d

  what anne inquired has that to do
with us dad tried to tell larsons bunch
six months ago what would happen but
they wouldnt help him buck bannerman
matabelle sighed wearily i know he
muttered we all thought jeff was just
stirring up trouble for no good reason
we didnt believe bannerman would try to
hog the whole basin i dont like to see
range war come-but im not going to sit
by and let bannerman get control of our
bank and everything else in this town so
ive decided to back the pool with what-
ever money is needed to fight bannerinans
bunch to a finish no matter how long it
takes jules larson says his members will
all swing into line with your father-if
rennevant will rod the fight against double
d

  a quick smile curved annes lips but
rennevant didnt smile he asked moodily
why do they want me in on the deal
because you stood off bannermans
toughs in the saloon last night and bluffed
red haggin into quitting like a yellow dog
this morning matabelle explained

  he glanced at rennevants tied-down
holster and said slyly they want one
gunslick on their side somebody who
knows the tricks of the trade

  a cynical grin twisted rennevants lips
here it was again the same old grudging
respect for his skill with a gun for a grisly
pariah who knew the tricks of the trade
this peace-loving old merchant would
never guess the price a man paid to learn
those tricks he wouldnt know how lone-
some a drifting badge-toter could get nor
how many times the cold fingers of fear
clawed at a gunfighters innards when the
odds stacked up

  recalling how jeff cruzatte had refused
larsons advice in the saloon last night
rennevant turned to anne said your
father told larson he wanted no truck with
the pool bunch at all

  but this is different anne exclaimed
this is a chance to save anvil
matabelle asked will you run the
show rennevant

  which was a question rennevant didnt
like to answer siding a bankrupt old cow-

man for a couple of weeks was one thing
leading an organization in bloody range
war was something quite different-some-
thing a deputy marshal had no right to do
finally he said reckon id better talk it
over with jeff cruzatte first

  whereupon anne declared well drive
out to anvil right now i can hardly wait
to tell dad

  afterward when she had rented a rig
at hooligans livery and rennevant had
stowed his riding gear in back anne drove
out of san sureno at a fast trot feeling
happier than shed felt in months

  im sure dad will join the pool she
said hes called them a cowardly no-
good bunch time and again but that was
because they wouldnt fight

  so rennevant mused eyeing the
country ahead with a drifters strict atten-
tion for landmarks

  watching him anne tried to guess his
age right now with a sober straightness
to his lips and his sun-puckered eyes quest-
ing the slopes of sashay ridge he had the
mature look of a man whod wandered a
long time in many places yet when he
grinned he looked no older than bob who
was twenty-four

  she said softly a centavo for your
thoughts and watched the quick change
in his eyes

  not worth it he muttered digging out
his durham sack then as his fingers
shaped up a cigarette with practiced skill
he told her about rowdy

  even though he spoke no definite word
of affection for his horse the controlled
emotion in his voice showed how close a
comradeship thered been between them
which was another link in annes forming
chain of impressions he loved horses he
had voiced a deep-rooted hatred for thieves
and hed risked his life to save her father
from almost certain death last night it all
added up to her first hasty half-formed im-
pression-that despite his toughness and
his skill with guns this wary-eyed rider
was thoroughly honest and perhaps a
trifle lonely   

  ill pay hallmark for taking his spite
out on rowdy rennevant said and ill
do it with my fists shooting is too good
for that kind of snake
lobo law



  shooting anne reflected cynically is
too good for most of that double d bunch
theyd have been hanged long ago if law
badges were worth the tin theyre made
of

  rennevant asked slyly you dont think
much of badge-toters do you anne

  i do not she said emphatically
rennevant grinned and for a time while
the rig clattered up the long rocky slope
of sashay ridge they rode in silence he
covertly studied annes profile at intervals
knowing that she was the most beautiful
girl hed ever seen and wanting to have a
permanent picture of her in his mind-
something to remember on lonely nights

  at the crest of the ridge anne halted the
horse for a brief rest and rennevant asked
just what does matabelle stand to win
by backing the fight against double d
nothing except that beating banner-
man would make san sureno a decent
town to live in anne explained

  never knew a politician who wasnt
trying to get something for himself ren-
nevant said money or power or glory
anne laughed but you dont know
john matabelle hes been mayor so long
he looks on san sureno as his personal
property and he doesnt want it to get a
bad reputation in the territory
rennevant shrugged said slowly well
i dont like to get mixed up in a range
war and was searching for words to ex-
plain his reluctance when annes fingers
gripped his arm

  i wish you would she said urgently
the feel of those slim fingers disrupted
rennevants disciplined thinking they
roused a richer awareness of her presence
made him sense again how surely she
shared the strong run of emotion he felt
her face was turned toward him now so
that he could see the full sweet curve of her
lips they parted slightly as he watched
and whispered i wish you would steve
something flared up in rennevant then
something he couldnt control he said
all right-all right and putting his arms
around her added rashly theres some-
thing else id like to do

  i-i wish you would anne whispered
again and was gently smiling when he
kissed her

  for a timeless interval their lips met and
merged and sheer ecstacy had its way with
steve rennevant it was as if this girl had
always belonged to him as if shed never
been a stranger here was completeness
beyond compare for her lips were giving
him more than surrender they were an-
swering gladly generously with all the
wild sweet flavor of a girl in love and be-
cause she was so close and yielding against
him the beating of her heart was like his
own heart beating

  presently anne murmured please
and he released her she took a moment to
rearrange her tumbled hair and in this
brief interval of silence they both heard the
thudding tromp of a hard-ridden horse be-
hind them   

chapter x

lady-chasiri dude

ules larson strode out of
matabelles mercantile with a
broad smile on his angular
weather-beaten face ill back
your pool to the limit the
mayor had just told him and
i believe youll have steve rennevant for
a gun boss

  that meant the waiting was over it
meant an end to the womens talk of
patience of hungry kids and empty guns
no more shameful side-stepping when
bannermans brazen riders pushed double
d steers through the homestead hills no
more coward-calling by jeff cruzatte with
matabelle furnishing food for their families
and ammunition for their guns every mem-
ber of the pool would fight-gladly and
with a topnotch gunman like rennevant to
lead them theyd win   

  hurriedly in the fashion of a man with
important news larson went down bor-
der belle alley to the blacksmith shop
where alex engle was having a buckboard
repaired matabelle backs us to the
limit he told the young cowman anne
cruzatte just left for anvil and steve ren-
nevant went with her

  good engle exclaimed a rash smile
dimpling his round boyish face ill pass
the word to jim highbaugh and luke


l ernenwein

yancey on my way home you tell the
others

  larson nodded said the waiting is
done alex now we fight

  he went back up the alley and was pass-
ing the open doorway at the rear of the
border belle when he heard dan banner-
mans angry voice swear in red and
turk as deputies the big man bellowed
and arrest rennevant before he reaches
anvil

  then sheriff shumways voice asking
what charge will i arrest him on
robbery rustling-anything only be
damned sure he gets killed resisting ar-
rest

  the sheriff spoke again but larson
didnt wait to hear any more turning ab-
ruptly through the wells fargo wagon
yard he ran to hooligans stable saddled
his horse and rode out of town and be-
cause rennevants death now would be a
tragic blow to the pools chances for vic-
tory he urged the bronc to a hard run

  for a time while larson galloped
through the greasewood breaks west of
san sureno he failed to sight the livery
rig glancing back at frequent intervals
and seeing no sign of riders behind him he
felt a growing optimism there might be
a chance for the rig to race to anvil ahead
of the posse if he warned rennevant in
time   

  but when he glanced back again his
hope died instantly a plume of dust was
boiling above three riders on the road just
west of town and a moment later as lar-
son crossed a secondary ridge he saw the
livery rig topping the summit ahead of
him that meant there wouldnt be a
chance for the rig to outrun the posse not
a glimmer of a chance

  spurring his horse up sashay ridge
larson overtook the buggy and blurted out
his warning when rennevant showed no
sign of apprehension he added nervously
theyre coming fast

  so rennevant mused and glanced
speculatively at larsons rat-tailed roan
then he said i hear you want me to ram-
rod the fight against double d

  we do larson exclaimed we are
depending on it

  then ill start right now-by borrow-

ing your bronc rennevant said getting
down from the rig ill use my own sad-
dle always feel better with my own sad-
dle under me more used to it

   larson said sure and hastily stripped
his gear from the pantifig bronc

  what you planning to do steve
anne asked

  rennevant grinned-a reckless boyish
grin that reminded her of bob

  im going back and meet bannermans
posse he said lifting his saddle from the
rear of the rig

  watching him anne thought she knew
why he was a drifter he had a fighters
relish for conflict it showed in his grin
and in the way his eyes turned smoky blue
at times like this yet he hadnt wanted to
get mixed up in a range war and that
seemed strange

  rennevant climbed into saddle and draw-
ing a winchester from its scabbard said
ive got something here thatll slow those
three dudes down a bit-while you folks
drive to the ranch

  then he asked just where is anvil
from here

  anne pointed west toward the rampart
mountains use that high chimney peak
for a marker steve anvil is three miles
due east of it this is sashay ridge it
angles northwest into the homestead hills
which separate anvil and double d
range

  just like handing me a map renne-
vant drawled and rode back across the
ridge

  anne called good luck steve
thanks he said and just- before he
rode over the rim added grinningly see
you at supper time anne

  jules larson rubbed his sweat-stained
face a born gunman that rennevant
he declared no normal feelins at all
thats what makes his gunnin so good
remembering steves ardent embrace
and the hungry way hed kissed her a few
moments ago anne smiled secretively
hes a first-class fighting man she mur-
mured but he has feelings too-real feel-
ings

  which was something for jules larson
to puzzle out as he drove the livery rig
toward anvil   
lobo law



tjiding a little distance down the east
slope of the ridge rennevant eased
the roan out onto a projecting ledge and
had his look at the country below nothing
showed in the greasewood breaks and for
a brief interval he failed to distinguish a
sign of movement on the tilted harpin
turns of the road but presently a thin
dust haze drifted above a hidden switch-
back and a moment later three riders
appeared coming up the road at a trot

  sun glare reflected sharply on shum-
ways law badge it put a shine on turk
gallegos dark perspiring face and bright-
ened the ruddy stubble of whiskers on red
haggins heavy cheeks they were less
than half a mile away their sweat-lathered
broncs showing how fast theyd made the
run from san sureno giving their gear
a prolonged study rennevant decided that
gallego and haggin both had rifles in sad-
dle scabbards he couldnt be sure about
the sheriff

  and at this moment haggin peered up
at him halted instantly and snatched out
his saddle gun whereupon rennevant
fired   

  that first shot spooked larsons bronc
into a tantrum it also sent those three
riders scampering for cover on both sides
of the road rennevant took time to quiet
the roan he heard sheriff shumway yell
its rennevant and heard the nearby
sizzle of a slug before the rifles report
drifted up to him he spotted shumway
and tried to target the dodging sheriff with
two shots but the fiddle-footed roan made
accurate shooting impossible one of those
guns below was sending slugs too close for
comfort a bullet whanged within inches
of his head another spattered off a boulder
less than a yard away it was time to
move

  whirling the roan rennevant headed
northward along the ledge purposely re-
maining in sight so that the men below
could see the direction of his departure
red haggin had dismounted and was tak-
ing time for deliberate aim gallego was
rushing his horse along the slope evidently
intending to cut him off from town and
sheriff shumway was now riding up the
road to come in behind him

  whereupon rennevant grinned and

urged his horse to a faster pace they were
a crafty trio those three wise in the ways
of backtrail fighting but he knew a few
tricks himself even though this was the
first time hed ever been on the dodging
end of a chase   

  angling up to the summit rennevant
went northward this he decided was a
good chance to have a look at the home-
stead hills and if the double d crew were
pushing cattle onto anvil range again today
he might meet up with whitey hallmark
remembering how blood had spurted from
rowdys front feet this morning renne-
vant felt the same shocked anger hed felt
at hooligans stable and a familiar itch-
ing urge for vengeance

  presently quartering into a trail renne-
vant followed it into a deep canyon that
notched the ridge the runoff from last
nights rain had formed a sizeable creek
at which he watered the roan and took a
drink himself then listening for sound of
pursuit and hearing the remote rumor of
running horses he splashed downstream
for nearly three miles until he found a pool
where a bunch of range broncs had recently
drunk here he turned north again the
roans hoofprints merging with a jumble
of fresh tracks that pocked the muddy bank

  only an injun could track us out of
here rennevant mused and crossing the
canyon headed upridge at an angle that
brought him back into the summit trail at
noon

  the ridge here was covered with live
oak and thickets of manzanita climbing
a high outcrop of rock rennevant scouted
his backtrail seeing no sign of the three-
man posse eastward the land dropped
down to brush-blotched flats that ran all
the way back to the base of cascabelle
divide west of him anvil range was a
hazy sprawl of long mesas and wide val-
leys stretching west to the ramparts and
north to the timbered slopes of the home-
stead hills

  squinting his eyes against the suns harsh
glare rennevant tallied the chimney peak
anne had pointed out then scanned the
country east of it until he picked up the
far-off flash of a sun-glinted windmill the
distance was too great for him to distin-
guish more than a vague outline of build-

 ings and corrals but this remote view gave
 him a chance to charter anvils exact rela-
 tion to other landmarks so that hed have
 no trouble reaching it

   he was debating the advisability of rid-
 ing that way now when he noticed a high
 haze of dust to the northeast the wooded
 hills hid whatever was below the dust but
 the thought came to rennevant that it
 might be another drive of double d steers
 toward anvil if it was whitey hallmark
 would be bossing it so thinking renne-
 vant put his mount to a swift run north-
 ward

   the trail dipped occasionally winding
 through ravines and crossing dry washes
 but mostly its course was northward
 toward the continuing dust haze within
 three miles the manzanita and oak gave
 way to parade-like stands of wind-twisted
 pine and soon after that rennevant halted
 on a timbered hill directly above a home-
 stead clearing upwards of two hundred
 steers were being driven through the clear-
 ing by five riders the cattle passing be-
 tween a new log house and a pole corral

  this then was the way bannerman was
 planning to force jeff cruzatte off anvil-
 by crowding anvil graze devastating what
 little grass remained after the recently
 ended drouth and because the pool mem-
 bers had refused to fight double d used
 their range for a cattle trail to anvil

   eagerly like a lobo keening for quarry
 rennevant studied the faces of the dust-
 hazed riders below him seeking whitey
 hallmark-not finding him as the herd
 tromped by the homestead and passed on
 into the timber then a shrill voice
 drifted up from the house and glancing
 that way he saw hallmark grappling with
 a gingham-clad girl

   rennevant went down the wooded slope
 at a run pine needles here made a thick
 carpet that muffled the broncs hoofbeats
 and because hallmarks attention was com-
 pletely centered on the struggling sobbing
 girl he failed to see rennevant dismount
 beside the house

   a few kisses wont kill you hallmark
 was saying insistently

   he forced the girl back against the door-

frame hard enough to tumble her high-
coiled hair into loose disorder he held
her so she couldnt dodge his passion-
pouted lips but the kiss was brief   

  rennevant grasped hallmarks shoulder
jerked him around and bashed his nose
with a short-arcing jab then as hallmark
cursed and grabbed for his gun rennevant
hit him hard on the chin

  the double d foreman forgot about his
gun he staggered back in loose-jointed
confusion he ducked rennevants next
blow and took a teetering step sideways
like a drunkard at a dance

  fight you lady-chasin dude renne-
vant growled contemptuously 

  his hate was a flame inside him a high
hot flame that turned him savage he
rushed hallmark with both fists battered
down the guarding arms and smashed him
in the face hallmarks knees sagged and
he started to go down but rennevant
reached out and grasped the front of hall-
marks shirt he punched him in the
stomach propped him up and punched his
slack-lipped mouth then deliberately
measuring hallmarks bloody blank-eyed
face rennevant hit him with a long loop-
ing right flush to the jaw whereupon
wliitey went down-and out

  for a moment the silence was broken
only by the girls soft sobbing she was
small and dark-haired with a graphic girl-
ish beauty she stared at hallmarks mo-
tionless form as if still fearing him then
she glanced at rennevant and said he
did the same thing last week i didnt tell
my husband but i will now

  rennevant wiped his bloody knuckles on
his pants he stooped down unbuckled
hallmarks gun gear and handed it to the
girl a gun and bullets make good com-
panions when youre alone he said quiet-
ly-

  the girl was trembling so near physical
exhaustion that the holstered gun and belt
seemed almost too heavy for her to hold
she said thanks for your help and
smiled up at him through tear-misted eyes
thanks a lot

  alex engle hes in town with my
father jules larson

  rennevant chuckled fate he reflected
was still playing tricks he said you
dont owe me any thanks maam your
fathers warning probably saved my life
a couple hours ago

  how strange mrs engle exclaimed
then added reverently providence must
have had a hand in it

 mebbeso rennevant mused and
glancing at hallmark saw that his boots
were moving

  those boots he noticed then were brand
new so new their soles were scarcely
marked at all new high-heeled boots with

fancy stitching and stiff unscuffed soles

  a kind of brutal anticipation took hold of
him as he watched the double d ramrod
regain consciousness it replaced the ur-
gent need for conflict in him the need hall-
mark had cheated by refusing to fight

  turning to mrs engle he said youd
better go into the house and stay there
until your husband returns maam and
if any double d riders come asking about
whitey just tell them he rode off with
a galoot named steve rennevant

  then as hallmark got slowly to his feet
rennevant walked over to him and said
savagely fork your bronco romeo were
taking a little pasear

  where to hallmark demanded

  to the double d rennevant mut-
tered or in that general direction

  then he shoved hallmark toward his
bronc

        chapter xi
        drifters dream

wo miles northwest of
engles homestead renne-
vant called an order to
whitey hallmark who rode
directly ahead of him get
down

  this was a rock-studded strip of table-
land hemmed in on all sides by rearing
wooded hills and far enough from the cat-
tle trail so thered be no likelihood of meet-
ing double d riders it suited rennevants
purpose perfectly

  hallmarks bashed nose was still bleed-
ing he kept wiping it on his sleeve smear-
ing blood across his swollen jaw what
you aimin to do he demanded thickly
through puffed broken lips

  rennevant ignored the question he said
turn around and when whitey hesi-
tated knocked him around with a jolt on
the shoulder

  i didnt do nothin but kiss her hall-
mark whined i wasnt plannin her no
harm

  you got paid off for that at the home-
stead rennevant said tying hallmarks
hands securely behind him this is some-
thing else whitey this is to show you how
a horse feels with two nail-punctured feet

  that silenced the double d foreman
bringing no denial but when rennevant
unbridled hallmarks horse and shooed it
off with a slap on the rump the scar-faced
rider blurted its eighteen miles to dou-
ble d

  yeah rennevant grunted and getting
into saddle slacked out a few feet of rope

  you figgerin to make me walk it
hallmark demanded

  yeah rennevant said again move
 
on

  but im wearin new boots whitey
complained this is the first time i wore
em

  so i noticed rennevant acknowl-
edged and when hallmark stubbornly re-
fused to move touched spurs to his mount

  the roan lunged forward the rope
snapped taut whitey hallmark yelped
but he didnt go down he ran behind the
roan like a well broke pack horse   

  that was the way it started this strange
pasear toward double d and although
rennevant soon pulled the bronc down to
a walk there was no stopping for rests
nor for water at occasional gullies nor for
a looksee on the many ridges they topped
steadily and silently except for the one
time he inquired the direction of double
d rennevant rode northward and be-
cause whitey hallmark had a riders fren-
zied fear of being dragged to death he
walked fast enough to keep a margin of
slack in the rope walked and limped and
finally shambled like a sore-footed steer
mile after mile until each staggering step
lobo law

was agony-until the stones he stepped on
were like nails driven into his blistered feet

  twice hallmark stumbled and fell and
scrambled up in panic-prodded haste it
was mid-afternoon now with sun glare
burning down at full heat sucking the
moisture from hallmarks sweat-stained
shirt presently he fell a third time where-
upon rennevant dismounted

  reckon mebbe you know how my hoss
felt this morning he muttered and turned
hallmark loose

  the double d foreman had gotten up
quickly but now he sat down his amber
eyes were hot with a futile festering re-
sentment that was close to turning him ber-
serk he opened his lips as if to vent the
venom of his hate but he clamped them
shut again without speaking

  rennevant grinned and remembering the
handcuffs in his saddle bags felt tempted
to arrest hallmark here and now but that
would expose him as a badge-toter and he
wrasnt ready for that yet   

  so he said dryly ill be seeing you
again whitey and ill be teaching you
another lesson youll be a well educated
galoot when i get through with you

  then he turned west circling his back-
trail as a precaution against running into
the posse crossing an open summit he
saw another homestead clearing another
log house and corral a woman in a poke
bonnet was spading a garden plot near the
house and a little girl with bright red rib-
bons in her hair was playing with a puppy
on the shaded stoop

  watching that tranquil scene and know-
ing how hugely range war would change it
rennevant felt a futile regret it seemed
almost impossible that this country was on
the thin edge of bloody conflict that these
hushed hills would soon resound to the
crash of guns and the curses of dying men
yet even at this moment all the ingredients
of hate and greed and violence were in
these hills five gunhung riders w-ere push-
ing cattle onto anvil grass whitey hall-
mark was limping toward double d with a
bloodlust brew of hate running hot in his
veins and somewhere perhaps over the
next ridge a three-man posse stalked

  no there was no peace here just a
temporary hush before the storm just a
iittle time for playing with puppies on
shaded stoops  

  riding on down the slope rennevant
skirted a meadow where cattle grazed
instinctively checking their brands he saw
a lot of double ds a few y drags pot
hooks and some ae connected which he
guessed was alex engles brand the pool
cattle were mostly cows and calves but
the double ds were all big steers with
vented brands-the unreadable bug
brands of old mexico that meant theyd
been brought across the line honestly or
otherwise

  recalling what anne had told him about
anvil making a wide wedge between the
homestead hills and the border renne-
vant toyed with the suspicion that diamond
dan bannerman might want anvil for
something besides extra graze if he was
dealing with mexican cattle thieves this
wedge of range would be priceless

  rennevant was thinking about that when
turk gallego stepped from behind a wind-
fall with a leveled gun in his hand and said
quietly almost whisperingly dont do
anything foolish friend 

  cursing himself for a careless fool ren-
nevant eyed gallego intently wondering
if shumway and haggin were nearby if
they werent too close there might be a
chance to ride this little man down for he
was less than five feet away

  but even as rennevant made ready to
jab spurs to the roan gallego said softly
dont do it friend

  he came all the way out of the windfall
the reins of his bronc looped over his left
arm he eased off to one side keeping his
sharp eyes on rennevant every instant not
lowering the gun nor relaxing the menace
of its aimed muzzle

  there was a strangeness to this and it
tugged at the fringes of rennevants mind
gallego could have ambushed him easily
without risk to himself right now he could
release the guns hammer and be positive
its slug would slam through the durham
sack in rennevants shirt pocket but turk
gallego was waiting for what



please mention newsstand fiction unit when answering advertisements
lobo law

   then turk said something that further
 puzzled rennevant he said i dont know
 what your game is friend but youre living
 on borrowed time

   still closely watching he canted his head
 as if listening for expected sounds and in
 this brief interval a startling thought struck
 steve rennevant a possible explanation for
 gallegos reluctance to end this deal swiftly
 and brutally as red haggin would have
 ended it or sheriff shumway pete mo-
 desto had said gallego was new on ban-
 nermans payroll turk looked tough and
 he probably was tough but he didnt have
 the vicious look of a cold-blooded killer

   rennevant relaxed in saddle what
 he asked does that badge say youre wear-
 ing in your pocket

   gallego didnt lower the gun and there
 was no visible change in the sober mask
 of his swarthy face when he said border
 patrol what does yours say

   rennevant chuckled knowing that this
 little rider had guessed his lawman identi-
 ty first deputy u s marshal he
 drawled and remembering how strongly
 gallego had attracted his attention last
 night in the saloon said amusedly you
 keep strange company turk you do for
 a fact

   got my reasons gallego muttered and
 lowered the gun he listened again then
 said whisperingly two herds of sonora
 steers been smuggled across the line in the
 last three months im trying to find out
 when double d plans to make another raid
 into mexico

   so that was it this taciturn little law-
 dog was playing a crafty waiting game
 and a dangerous one if bannerman so
 much as suspected his role gallego would
 die with a bullet in the back and now
 with open range war threatening hed be
 a target for pool guns along with every
 double d rider in these hills

   hell is going to pop around here
 soon rennevant warned you want me
 to tell my friends who you are so they
 wont be shooting at you

   ni turk said instantly somebody
 might talk out of turn bannerman is about
 due to grab another herd of sonora steers

and i want to get the deadwood on him
this time

  then he added you better make some
tracks muy pronto friend red and shum-
way arent far off

  rennevant nodded there were some
questions he wanted to ask this man but
there wasnt time for it now good luck
he said and riding on through the trees
heard gallegos bronc go up the slope at
a lunging run turk he reflected would
need a lot of luck to stay alive in this
deal   

  afterward as rennevant crossed a val-
ley with good graze in its bottom he saw
a big bunch of mexican steers mixed with
slat-ribbed anvil cows and scrawny calves
keeping tab he tallied five double d
brands for every anvil that ratio diminish-
ing somewhat as he rode farther south but
three to one-even two to one-spelled
eventual disaster for cruzatte who needed
every blade of grass to nourish his drouth -
famished stock one month of overcrowd-
ing would ravage this range

  no wonder old jeff had gone loco in san
sureno last night without a crew to push
bannermans cattle back hed faced sure
ruin and although the homestead hills
outfits faced the same fate they had re-
fused to fight but they were going to fight
now and rennevant was idly formulating
a plan for the coming conflict when he
topped a bluff some three miles north of
anvil

  here he halted having his first clear
view of cruzattes home quarters seeing a
spacious l-shaped dobe house with its
gallery facing east a bunkhouse several
sheds and an array of corrals were sep-
arated from the main building by a triangu-
lar compound a huge cottomvood obscured
one end of the gallery and twin rows of
pepper trees bordered the roadway that
skirted a windmill tank on the south side
of the house

  it was rennevant reflected a fitting
home for a saddle-warped old pioneer a
cow country palace to be proud of a hard-
won heritage to protect against the designs
of greedy men and because hed been
homeless as a stray dog for five rough-and-

tumble years steve rennevant felt a sud-
den sense of loneliness that house down
there and the log cabins back in the hills
were symbols of something accomplished-
monuments to the men whod built them
the poorest homesteader had a shack to
come back to when the days riding was
done he had a woman to share it mak-
ing it a home but what did steve renne-
vant have to show for five years riding
just a lot of horse tracks in the dust

  remembering how anne had kissed him
up there on sashay ridge rennevant knew
why this urgent sense of lack and loneliness
had come at sight of anvil anne was down
there her presence like a magnet attracting
his attention shaping his thoughts and it
would always be like this no matter how
far a distance lay between them she would
be the one full image of his desire-a con-
stant unwavering beacon across the long
and lonely miles

  for the first time in his life steve ren-
nevant took a look into the future sooner
or later some noose-dodging thief would
beat him to the draw and even if that didnt
happen until he was too old to care it was
a dreary picture a man could take pride
in the badge he wore and in reaping retri-
bution for his dead father but there came
a time when that wasnt enough and that
time he guessed was almost here

  perhaps he mused there might be an-
other homestead in the hills when his law
chore here was finished a cozy stout-
walled home with curtains at the windows
and a blonde goddess of a girl to welcome
him when days riding was done   

at dusk anne saw rennevant ride
into the yard she had just taken a
pan of biscuits from the oven she stood
at the window for a moment seeing the
ramrod straightness of his tall form in sad-
dle and feeling a quick surge of relief that
he was all right then as the hot pan
burned through the towel which protected
her hands she hurriedly deposited the bis-
cuits on the kitchen table

  her father called a friendly greeting to
rennevant from the veranda and presently
anne heard the drone of their voices over

richard brothers  sskvsgsh

at the horse corral jeff had been some-
what flabbergasted at the news that mata-
belle was going to finance a showdown
against double d so surprised and pleased
that hed discarded all his bitter resentment
toward the pool at once hed been down-
right jovial with jules larson and later
when larson had borrowed a horse and
ridden away her father had called well
show the double d bunch jules well show
em good and proper

  now anne guessed he was telling ren-
nevant about the plan he and larson had
discussed the huge task of hazing double
d stock off anvil and then cleaning it out
of the homestead hills it was almost dark
when she went to the door and called
come and get it

  a cool breeze ran down from the ram-
parts and there was a hint of impending
storm in the massed clouds above sashay
ridge but this lamplit kitchen was a cheer-
ful room

  he said hello anne and sniffing the
food-scented air added sure smells
good

  anne aint much account in a kitchen
cruzatte drawled with mock gravity but
shell do till i can git a chinee cook
presently when they were eating anne
noticed fresh scars on rennevants knuck-
les recalling what hed said about paying
hallmark off with his fists she nodded at
his hands and asked did you meet
whitey

  yeah rennevant admitted i met
him

  he seemed reluctant to discuss the de-
tails so anne didnt press the subject but
he showed no reluctance about eating nor
in his praise when the meal was finished
best tasting supper i ever ate he de-
clared almost soberly and anne knew he
meant it

 afterward while she washed the dishes
anne listened to steve and her father dis-
cuss ways and means of waging war against
double d first- thing is to git them
danged mex steers off my graze old jeff
announced then well have to chouse em
out of the hills

  you planning to drive them back to



please mention newsstand fiction unit when answering advertisements
lobo law

bannermans range rennevant inquired
puffing contentedly on the cigar jeff had
given him

  sure where else would we drive em
well ive got reason to believe they
were smuggled out of mexico rennevant
said seems like it would be easier to
drive them south that way youd be do-
ing three jobs at once youd be getting
shut of them quicker bannerman would be
losing them and mebbe the rightful own-
ers might get em back

by gosh i never thought of that
cruzatte exclaimed a quick smile warm-
ing his faded eyes also thered be less
double d riders messin up our drive
rennevant nodded and presently asked
how many men in bannermans crew
eighteen not counting shumway
the talk ran on covering all the angles
of armed conflict how much ammunition
and supplies would be needed wrhich men
would ride with rennevant as roving gun
guards while others worked cattle how to
meet the showdown fight when it came

well have twelve men and mebbe two-
three youngsters wholl do for cow chous-
in cruzatte reported seems like we got
a real good chance of winnin
la chance anyway rennevant said
but licking the double d crew may not
end the trouble its my hunch you could
kill every rider on bannermans payroll
and still not win

  cruzatte didnt agree with that dia-
mond dan he declared is just one man
hes only as strong as his crew take that
away from him and hes finished

  but later when anne sat with him on the
gallery after jeff had gone to bed renne-
vant voiccd his hunch again therell be
no real peace in this country until banner-
man leaves it and i know of only one
thing that would make him leve it

  a bullet anne asked softly

  yeah rennevant drawled a bullet
between the eyes

  then while a full moon played hide and
seek with the high-banked clouds above
sashay ridge they talked of other more
pleasant things-and some of it was said
without the use of words

              t ten oclock that
  night sheriff shumway
   wv	and red haggin rode

 leg-weary horses into
 san sureno and reported
 to their boss somebody
 tipped rennevant off shumway declared
 hed left the livery rig and was hossback
 when we went up sashay ridge

   did you get him bannerman de-
 manded

    the sheriff shook his head

   bannerman slammed a half-smoked cigar
 into a cuspidore so rennevant got away
 again he roared three to one and you
 let him slide through your fingers
 somebody warned him we was cornin
 shumway alibied

   what of it bannerman demanded
 you got close enough to see him didnt
 you

   both men nodded at which diamond
 dan exclaimed what the hell you think
 im paying you big wages for-just to fan-
 cy dance through the hills admiring your
 shadows

   then he asked wheres gallego

   we split up shumway explained
 tryin to cut rennevants trail never did
 see turk after that we even stopped by
 the ranch but he didnt show there neither
 whitey told us rennevant jumped him
 from behind beat hell out of him and took
 his horse whiteys face is a mess and he
 blistered his feet all to hell walkin home
 by god thats good bannerman
 shouted half my crew riding the hills
 and rennevant makes monkeys of them
 all

   theres a thousand places for a man to
 hide in shumway protested you got to
 give us time to hunt him down dan
 shumways pride was hurt and he
 showed it but red haggin took banner-
 mans denunciation with stolid indifference

just bit a shuck off through the brush like
mebbe he was tryin to head rennevant off
but he didnt do no shootin

  say shumway exclaimed somebody
sent word ahead to rennevant that we was
cornin after him-and only us four knew
about it

  yes bannerman mused instantly in-
terested just us four

  he plucked a fresh cigar from his pocket
and bit off its end with a savage snap of his
big teeth that he said thoughtfully
might explain what happened yesterday
and it might explain why rennevant came
here

  he went to the door opened it and gave
the saloon a searching glance piano pete
was dealing stud to three players-an el
paso whiskey drummer fat foster the
barkeep and a clerk from the mercantile
no sign of gallego

  bannerman turned to haggin said im-
patiently go get two fresh horses from
the stable were riding to the ranch right
now

  how about me shumway asked

  you stay here and keep your eyes
open bannerman ordered if gallego
comes in bring him to double d and if
you see rennevant-shoot him

  they went out through the saloon to the
street then and the mercantile clerk said
secretively wait till diamond dan hears
the news

  piano pete tried to break up that talk by
raising the pot ten dollars on a jack of
hearts come on he urged lets play
poker

  but fat foster asked again wthat news
you talking about gebbert

  mayor john is backing the pool with
wide open credit the clerk declared
those hills boys will be well heeled with
bullets from now on

  you sure about that the barkeep de-
manded

out to the stoop at a ponderous waddling
run but bannerman was already riding

question in her irish eyes

  anne was right the medico declared

  whereupon kate let out a little squeal
of happiness and kissed docs pudgy
cheek   

  up on society hill mayor matabelle was
playing a final game of dominoes with his
wife and out at double d turk gallego
gave whitey hallmark a two-word explan-
ation for his late arrival

  got lost the dark-faced little rider
said flatly

  during the next forty-eight hours a radi-
cal change took place in the homestead
hills men who for months had advertised
their peaceful intention by riding unarmed
suddenly sprouted colt-filled holsters they
rode with a new look in their eyes even
their talk was different taking on the ag-
gressive tone of fighting men and although
their womenfolk watched this change with
dread and foreboding more than one wife
looked upon her husband with new respect

  in less than two days time the pool-an-
vil combination was completely organized
and men were riding toward the appointed
meeting place with extra horses for the
grueling job ahead from west creek and
blackjack canyon they came from burnt
meadow and sombrero butte and the pot
holes-all heading for jules larsons j
bar l here at the northern fringe of the
homestead hills the drive would start
and here steve rennevants roving patrol
against double d raiders would make its
headquarters

  soon after sunup of the second day
rennevant hazed ten broncs northward
from anvil behind him in the ranchyard
anne cruzatte helped her father hook a
four-horse hitch to the chuck wagon jeff
was going to san sureno for provisions
and would reach j bar l sometime before
dark anne despite her urgent desire to
make a hand at the roundup was going to
remain in town with her brother bob

  when rennevant rimmed the mesa north
of anvil he glanced back and saw anne

wave to him he couldnt distinguish her
features from this distance but he knew
shed be smiling and he knew exactly how
the smile would curve her lips and fashion
twin dimples in her cheeks and so he
grinned and rode on across the mesa like
a man with pictures in his mind and five
hours later choused the broncs into lar-
sons corral

  alex engle and his wife had already ar-
rived when the young husband tried to
thank rennevant for stompin that low-
livered snake hallmark rennevant said
cant use any thanks alex-but i could
use a guide for a looksee at the range north
of here

  sure engle said eagerly ill be
proud to show you and i know a perfect
lookout spot for keeping tabs on double

  whereupon he proved it by taking ren-
nevant up the brush-tangled summit above
pyramid pass northern gateway to the
hills

arrived then ollie shannon rode in with
his two teen-age sons and an hour later
jim highbaugh luke yancey and sam
stoval came driving eight loose broncs
ahead of them late in the afternoon jeff
cruzatte wheeled into the yard with the
anvil chuck wagon piled high with provi-
sions extra winchesters and ammunition

  makes a man feel young again he de-
clared grinningly and shook hands with
men he hadnt spoken to for months

  soon after that gabe lee oldest settler
in the hills rode in with his son-in-law
big broad-chested pete meadows and they
were soon followed by the two logan broth-
ers who completed the pool membership

  at dusk when rennevant returned with
engle he glanced reflectively at the camp-
fire where mrs larson and her daughter
were helping old gabe lee prepare a chuck-
wagon supper the smell of dutch-oven
cooking made him remember the last round-
up hed ridden with his father back in
texas seven years ago thered been no
hate in him then nor any notches on his
gun----

  rennevant was thinking about that when
jeff cruzatte called come on over here
where the boys can git a look at you

steve and ushered rennevant into the
circle of firelight heres our gun boss
the gent who made bannermans slug-
slammers shiver in their boots

  rennevants face turned ruddy an okl
resentment stirred in him and for a long
moment he stood moodily silent every
man in the group seemed to be looking at
him as if he were some sort of gunslick
freak

  tell us how you want the work done
jules larson invited

  rennevant shook his head the brush-
poppin is up to you and jeff he said
bluntly give me four men and ill try
to keep bannermans bunch from interfer-
ing with your work

  who do you want to ride with you 
alex engle asked eagerness brightening
his eyes

  you for one rennevant said then
he chose lean lantern-jawed jim high-
baugh luke yancey who was also on the
lean long-geared side and big pete
meadows

  its going to be rough rennevant
warned id like that understood right

now

  ollie shannon asked you reckon were
goin to cut the mustard

  rennevant shrugged mebbe yes meb-
be no he muttered and realizing that
some of these men probably wouldnt live
to see the roundup finished added soberly
itll take some doing

  a tolable lot of doin gabe lee called
from across the campfire

  and a lot of dying mrs larson
phophesied

  for a long moment then as mrs lar-
sons words cast their spell on the group
there was a thoughtful silence it occurred
to rennevant that most of these men had
never drawn a gun against another man
no wonder theyd been afraid to buck
bannermans gunslick riders no wonder
theyd waited until there seemed no other
way of survival and now that theym de-
cided to fight what chance would they
have

  as if in answer to that question there
was the rushing thud of hard-run horses
at the edge of the clearing and a mans
high-pitched yell here comes company


l ernenwein

  get away from the fire rennevant
warned at once and heard a horse slide in
a swerving turn	s

  then as another horse drifted into the
yard the first one went charging back into
the woods its hoof pound rapidly diminish-
ing

  rennevant peered at the oncoming bronc
the animal stopped ten yards away breath-
ing hard and letting out a nervous snort as
rennevant moved toward it

  easy boy rennevant soothed and
wondered why this riderless animal had
been deliberately hazed into the yard then
as his eyes focused to the darkness he saw
the vague shape of something slung across
the saddle-and guessed instantly what it
was

  jules larson said worriedly one of
them rode back into the woods

  and jeff cruzatte asked who is it
steve

to be continued

   turk gallego rennevant muttered
 and leading the brortc into the firelight
 saw that his guess had been correct

   gallegos hands and feet were tied to
 opposite stirrups his head dangling gro-
 tesquely the back of his shirt was stained
 a reddish brown between the shoulders and
 there was a border patrol badge pinned
 there blood ran down his neck making
 gruesome patterns on his loose-jawed
 face

   shot in the back jules larson ex-
 claimed

   shock ran its quick course through these
 men it held them in stiff astonishment

   mrs larson demanded excitedly
 whos shot in the back

   she elbowed her way through the ring of
 silent men took one brief look and turned
 hastily back to the dutch ovens dont
 look ruth she warned its-its
 awful

gp workers anyone in fact who
t wanted to try his hand at rodeoing
with all these brand new riders
the stock had a holiday the rodeo
was sponsored by the tuscon division of thevul-
tee consolidated company whose workers found
broncs as hazardous as bombers

  some new feminine talent showed up at madi-
son square garden this year for instance mitzi
lucas beautiful daughter of the tad lucas callcd
by many the greatest cowgirl of all time this
was mitzis first trip to the garden and she made
a big hit with the newspaper men of the big
city mitzi though its her ambition to be a great
cowgirl like her mother wants to get into some-
thing to help win the war when she left new
york she was planning to go into a defense plant
in tuscon

another veteran cowgirl and a fine one newcomer
nancy bragg made new york sit up and take
notice nancy is pretty and graceful and a darn
good trick rider

  new york missed vern goodrich trick roper

that waddies heart had stopped waddies
brother took charge and laid him to rest in colusa
thus passes another top-hand

signed a new roping saddle which is fast proving
its popularity the yeach saddlery co of tren-
ton mo is manufacturing it lowry incidentally

agencies milt tayor directed the arena and bob
barmby furnished the bucking stock which was

   a cowboy mounted on a coal black mare

              man of aquarius    jan -feb

exact date of birth yearmonthday of month --

the sea and all that sails upon it are the life-
forces behind the aquarius man his is the
sign of the water-bearer and he is a born
sailor he usually loves boats and ships and
has a way with them whether sailing them or
building them his love of adventure of travel
is apt to take him to far strange ports and places
and his gift of adaptability will keep him content
in whatever odd environments he finds himself

  usually a quiet easy-going person the aqua-
rius man can be tempestuous and raging when
aroused to fighting anger he has a keen sense
of justice and honor and will always be one of
the first to rush to the defense of the helpless
there is none of the bully in the aquarius man

  if unable to enter actively in the war effort
the aquarius man may find an outlet for his
talents in some field that can use his genius for
detail and concentrated work he is careful con-
scientious and an excellent craftsman and he
has amazing vitality

  the aquarius man often finds himself falling
in and out of love with disturbing frequency but
once he finds the real love of his life he is con-
stant and content he makes an excellent father
partially because he remains much of a boy at
heart no matter how numerous his years and
partially because of his great depths of under-
standing

  the zodiac sign of the water-bearer also gives
the fortunate person born under it rather special
talents he is usually a very good dancer and
he is always entertaining and witty perhaps his
most special gift is the ability to follow and copy
the moods of whatever person he happens to be
with at the moment this ability makes him very
popular with his fellow men

  despite the horrors of the war it happens to
offer to the aquarius man an outlet for his gifts
of the water sign and it is not at all unlikely
that the end of the war will find him high on
top of his chosen profession
