this month is illustrated the story the
silent destroyer by henrik dahl
juvc here we see graphically what the
atomic rays from the occidenta destroyer
do to the oricnta flyer the enemy ship is
cut in twain from one end to the other as a
knife cuts through butter a passing sweep
cuts off the tailpiece and the enemy ship is
hurled earthward to destruction it demon-
strates the tremendous power of atomic rays
once they have been developed as they
surely will

next month

the ark of the covenant by victor macclnre
we are now getting into the heart of this great mystery
and we find that the interest and suspense in the story
keeps on increasing to the inevitable climax yet the
author always keeps ahead of you and you are never per-
mitted to guess the solution to the great problem the
next installment is particularly interesting and thought
provoking

the yellow air peril by harl vincent this
well-known author has a technique all his own and as an
engineer of one of our great industrial institutions he
knows his science as few authors do in the present
story he has shown us how the possession of some great
scientific secret as applied to aviation may be used by
unscrupulous powers

flight in  by bob olsen this versatile writer
has produced one of the outstanding air stories of the
year and it will be long before it is surpassed it cer-
tainly contains a terrific amount of most excellent
glimpses of what the world of aviation will look like in
 this story is prophetic in many instances and
incidentally mr olsen has supplied a few inventions of
his own which we are certain will be realized in the very
near future

the air terror by lowell howard morrow you
remember islands in the air by this well-known
author here he is back with a most exciting air story
full of adventure science fight and daring incidentally
it contains excellent aviation-science that will hold you
spellbound until you finish the story

and others

chapter i
a visitor from die past

iaptain burke gauthier stared
over the wilderness about him with unsee-
ing eyes among the new crop of saplings
a herd of deer grazed quietly their shadows
lengthened by the setting sun nearby two
cub bears rolled and tumbled about in a fierce sham
battle while in the trees the birds twittered contentedly
as they snuggled down for the night high in the air
huge cigar-shaped monsters flashed silently by with a
momentary glistening of soft evening colors from
their silvery envelopes one separated itself from the
orange glow of the sun zipped by close overhead and
vanished behind the hills to the west

  i see that the new york-shanghai limited is on
time said a voice behind the brooding captain it
was a soft cultured voice that fitted strangely into the
atmosphere of quiet purposeful activity in the sky

  the captain turned slowly to see his chief officer
lieutenant evenrude

  yes he said in the same well modulated tones
evidently our forces are successful in holding the
ground they have taken in eastern orienta
lieutenant evenrude regarded his quiet thoughtful
superior for a moment as though hesitating any-
thing new from g- staff meeting this afternoon
yes we think that we know where the orienta
forces are making their anti-nullifiers that is where
ghorski will be stationed we have instructions to
stand by at midnight for action orders - you know
what danger that means when i explain that g-
thinks that if we can capture ghorski we may stop
the war they base their reasoning upon the assump-
tion that the traitor has taken no one into his con-
fidence but is keeping the anti-nullifier a secret to
elevate himself to power among the orientals its
strange that the occidental government should be so
careless as to permit one such as he is to share their
most carefully guarded secrets but to capture ghorski
he was alright when his aura was photographed
upon his admission to the service he must have
changed almost completely since then suggested
evenrude there are rare cases where this has
happened he added

  yes i know they should check up on those in
high confidence every
few months as some psy-
chologists have been ad-
vocating perhaps au this
trouble could have been
avoided but since it is
done and the war is flam-
ing it is our duty to
stamp it out as best we
can

  this conversation was
interrupted by a crack-
ling in the underbrush
and presently a man
emerged from the wilder-
ness the captain stepped
toward him and arrest-
ed his progress

  my friend dont you
know that you are on
forbidden ground have
you a pass

heifbir dahl jxtve

  n presenting this extraordinary story to ours
  readers we make a prediction and state that
  it is without a shadow of a doubt scheduled to
  become a classic in aviation fiction there is
  enough science contained in this single story to
  provide sufficient ammunition for a dozen
  others which will give the reader an idea of
  the tremendous wealth of science contained in
  it five hundred years hence the conditions
  and instrumentalities used by the author in this
  story will probably become part of our world

  in any event the story gives us as accurate a
  prelude to the future as it is possible for a
  trained scientist to give and with the skill of
  a magician he weaves the incidents so that the
  final climax of the story is so subtle that it
  leaves one chuckling particularly is this story
  recommended to those of us who are used to
  and must live among irritating noises during
  their entire lives

  no said the
man in a voice com-
paratively harsh as
compared to the
soft tones of the
two officers i just
j changed dimen-
sional conscious-
ness and happened
to land in this
woods where am
i

  the two officers
looked at the mans
face and then stared
more intently with
a flicker of amaze-
ment in their eyes

  havent i seen
you before-or per-
haps your picture asked the captain yes i recall
now-in our fifth grade history covering the twentieth
century there is an account of theodore a addison
you are the living image of him

  the same the man answered with a wrinkle of
amusement about his eyes i have been living in the
fourth and fifth dimensions and during my experiments
discovered a means of changing consciousness and
clothing myself with three-dimensional matter but
where am i

  you are but a short distance west of new york
city and happen to be on ground closed to all except
those of a character trustworthy enough to be en-
trusted with some of the most cherished secrets of the
military department on which side are you
which side what do you mean

  pardon me i did not think about your having lived
in other dimensions but we are at war so you under-
stand that my question is natural

  i see of course i am an american and my
sympathies are naturally with the united states

  you are slightly behind the times if you will excuse
my way of putting it you are trying to cramp your-
self into terms of the twentieth century while this is
the twenty-eighth century and times have changed
slightly all of the white people have combined to
form one nation called occidenta and the colored
nations have united to

form orienta but we
cannot accept your state-
ments  you shall have to
go to the classifying lab-
oratory for a pass lieu-
tenant evenrude will
accompany you

  when the two were
gone captain gauthier
walked to a huge boulder
into which he disap-
peared through a door in
the side

a visitor enlightened

captain gauthier
was sitting at his
desk in the underground
laboratories and hangars
when lieutenant even-
rude accompanied by
	air wonder stories

addison reported an hour later silently the lieutenant
handed to his superior the pass and classification papers
made out to addison and stood by while the captain
examined them

  you stand high in the confidence of the occidental
government he said as he gave the pass to addison
you are free to go anywhere you choose

  this classification routine interests me-this for-
bidden ground interests me-these two nations in-
terest me-everything interests me i should like to
stay here until i get my bearings in this changed
world if i may quietly replied the man of the twen-
tieth century he had caught the carefully modulated
speech of this day and was striving to soften the harsh
unpleasant tones that was peculiar to his own time

  how do they classify one

  we are expecting orders to go out on a very
dangerous mission but while we are waiting we can
become acquainted during the centuries since you
labored as an inventor science has practically sup-
planted superstition denominational religion as you
knew it has disappeared and science has taken its
place our mathematicians have extended their
theorems into the seventh dimension which we believe
to be the highest in the particular universe in which
we exist the control of people through fear of the
unknown has given way to the power of knowledge
and it is through knowledge that science is now striv-
ing to control the behavior of people

  even during the middle ages the steel age as we
call it scientists discovered that the human body is
surrounded by an aura and that the condition of this
aura reflects the state of health enjoyed by the in-
dividual through the use of better filters and highly
developed photography we have gone farther and found
that the color and other characteristics of the aura give
us an index to the mental and moral development of
the person by studying the colored photograph of
the aura we can determine with reasonable certainty
the reaction the individual will exhibit to any ordinary
stimulus before elections the aura photographs of the
candidates are circulated and the people can then judge
for themselves who are best fitted for office it is
our purpose to place only high-minded men in any
position of trust whether public or private those
with criminal tendencies are suppressed and kept where
they cannot do any serious harm we have succeeded
in weeding unworthy men out of office until now
corruption among government and corporation officials
is practically unknown

  now you will understand why we were careful
in answering your questions until we had your classi-
fication papers you will notice that in the picture
of your aura a clear blue predominates that indicates
a marvelous mental development this fringe of bright
gold indicates a fine moral and spiritual development
on the other hand an aura that is roily such as a
brick red dirty brown or gray belongs to the type we
suppress in extreme cases it may be a smudge of
black

  you probably wonder at the color of the clothes
which were issued to you upon your classification
you will observe that your clothes are of the same color
as your aura that all may see to what state of develop-
ment you have attained this is a great factor in
stamping out deceit and crime for it is now impossible
for a wolf to stalk in sheeps clothing as it were
of course when the system was first inaugurated a
few tried to wear false colors but were apprehended

almost immediately and needless to say never repeated
their duplicity

  i understand addison nodded now if i could
bother you for information concerning the forbidden
ground

   surely said the captain i am an officer in the
g- department of the occidental army in other
words i am attached to the secret service our ac-
tivities include more than the ferreting of information
from the enemy this underground laboratory is
unknown to all except those whose auras are very nearly
perfect it is through this scientific classification that
we are able to maintain this secrecy here we experi-
ment with and build anti-nullifiers for military use
until the war broke out it had been merely a pre-
cautionary measure to be used in controlling the colorcd
races especially the black race on the african con-
tinent until they had progressed to the stage when
they grasp the idea of self-conquest and are self-
regulating-

ready to depart

addison was about to interrupt with a question
when the adjutant snapped off the lights and their
attention was attracted to a lighted screen on one wall
a face appeared and words mentioning this identity
sounded over the radio the face disappeared and
the screen was filled with the image of a sheet of blue
paper covered with typewritten words the adjutant
touched a button and the image faded away almost
instantly the lights were turned on and the adjutant
lianded to the captain a photographic film which he had
taken from a compartment in the wall opposite the
television screen addison following the lieutenants
example looked over the captains shoulders while
he read from an exact facsimile of the image that had
appeared on the screen

   while addison wondered at this total lack of military
discipline the captain finished reading and said quietly
action orders to stations

  addison hesitated may i go he asked uncer-
tainly

  surely although i warn you that our mission is
very dangerous you must assume all responsibility for
your presence

  with a simple yes addison followed the two
men through several large rooms where men were at
work before machines he marvelled at the lack of
noise

   i noticed that everything is so silent and swift and
efficient he said to the captain

   yes the officer fell in step with addison even
during the steel age the people were beginning to
outlaw noise we find it unnecessary and abhor any
noise or harsh voices

  suddenly addison stopped he had been so in-
terested in his questions that he had not noticed that
although they were underground and that it was night
outside the rooms were lighted as though by sunlight
and further that there were no shadows in fact the
light seemed to come from all directions but was so
evenly distributed that it did not hurt his eyes

  how do you illuminate the place he asked in
surprised tones

  i shall explain when we are aboard the ship the
captain smiled we have orders to depart immediately
so cannot stop now

  they left the factory rooms and after walking
through a wide corridor emerged in a huge cavern
the silent

where rested a row of torpedo-like ships each some
five hundred feet in length and fifty feet in diameter
addison with his characteristic eye for details counted
twenty of the metallic sky-blue shapes here and there
crews of men worked silently about the monsters that
towered high above them the captain touched a but-
ton and there sounded in the silence of the vast cavern
the faint musical tinkle of a bell the sound was fol-
lowed by two short rings and addison was amazed and
awed to see one of the huge monsters rise slightly and
like a sinister phantom drift slowly and soundlessly
through a great door into another room where it
settled gently upon bunks built on the floor his scalp
tightened as he watched this graceful display of pon-
derous and terrible forces with the two officers he
followed the ship and the door closed silently behind
them they walked toward the center of the towering
form where a door opened and a flight of steps slid to
the ground

  watch the roof said the captain

  the light grew dim and addison was astonished
and terrified to see the roof of the cavern settle down
for perhaps a hundred feet and then split through the
center but the lights were extinguished and he could
see no more until an opening appeared the length of
the ceiling and the stars shone through silently like
the parting of drifting clouds the roof opened until
the entire ceiling was gone

  a section of the woods is lowered trees and all
and slid aside to let us out the captain explained
come we must get aboard

  they climbed up the stairs into a small dimly-lighted
room where the captain closed a switch and the stairs
rose soundlessly disappearing between the walls the
door closed behind them but no sooner had the door
shut than the room burst into the usual daylight
brilliance addison felt the sensation of rising in an
elevator and turned to the captain with a question on
his lips

  yes said the officer this is an elevator we
are going to the third floor where the control room is
located

             chapter ii
             a silent flight

they stepped from the elevator into a narrow
corridor and then to a large well-appointed room
where several officers sat at desks one of them
speaking slowly and distinctly into microphones
strapped to his chest others were operating tele-
vision sets and radio apparatus

  to whom is that officer telephoning inquired
addison after carefully surveying the room

  he isnt lieutenant evenrude answered he is
a stenographer he speaks into the microphones and
his voice operates a silent typewriter in the filing room
in another part of the ship as fast as the sheets
of paper are typed the filing clerk binds them into
books constituting the ships log but we must change
shoes-here is a pair of magnetic shoes for you you
have to wear them when the gravity is nullified or you
wont be able to walk about while we are in the air
nothing in the ship has weight so you understand the
necessity for magnetic shoes to hold you to the deck

  addison felt awkward in the shoes that clung to the
carpet-covered steel floor the others however seemed
to wear them with the ease of long association sud-
denly a strange feeling came over him his heart acted
queerly and his blood rushed to his head leaving him

destroyer	

faint and groggy then he felt pulled against the
floor it relieved his heart and drew some of the
blood from his head but it was disconcerting never-
theless the feeling that was being forced against
the floor gradually lessened to be supplanted by a
sensation of lightness that left him giddy he felt
as though he were some plant on an ocean floor and
that his body were waving gently in the water

  with considerable difficulty addison tottered across
the room to a chair into which he attempted to drop
but attempt to sit down ended in his merely folding
up grasping the arms of the chair however he drew
himself into the easy depths of the thick cushions
where he rested with a weightless feeling he was
able to remain so only by clinging lightly to the chair
arms there were straps attached to one side of the
chair and after buckling himself in he felt more secure

  while addison struggled to maneuver his unwieldy
person about this strange place of no gravity captain
gauthier was busy at a desk where addison observed
he kept his fingers hovering over several banks of keys
similar to the old-fashioned typewriter occasionally
the captain pressed certain keys while he watched a row
of small gauges along the wall back of the desk
evidently the controls thought addison

  he felt a sudden pressure against the chair as
though an unseen hand had shoved against his chest
but this sensation gradually lessened and ceased alto-
gether at the same time the lights were dimmed
and soft glow flashed up on the four television screens
before the control table the captain glanced over
the screens relinquished the controls to lieutenant
evenrude with some brief instructions and then came
over to the distressed visitor

  i suppose that the sensation of flying is rather
unique for one who has not traveled in anything but
the old gravity-defying type of ship he smiled

  flying addison gasped are we under way
now i have been waiting for the motors and pro-
pellers to start

  the captain smiled we are now twenty miles
above the earths surface and have been traveling on
our course at about a thousand miles an hour for
several minutes we nullified gravity and rose ver-
tically it was during this acceleration that you felt
pushed against the floor and as we reached our level
of flight the negative acceleration gave you the feeling
of lightness while we were accelerating our forward
speed you no doubt experienced a pressure against the
back of your chair

  addison turned this astonishing information over in
his mind for a few moments and then asked but
how do you drive this ship without motors and pro-
pellers and what makes the vehicle so steady in the
air currents

  we have discovered a new force which we have
harnessed for our needs immortal in our history is
a hindoo scientist of the steel age who conducted the
first experiments which led to this development it
is the same force which bursts the seed pod and pushes
the frail dandelion through the pavement although
of course we apply it on a much larger scale

  we stabilize the ship with tiny full-floating gyros-
copes similar to those used in the gyroscopic compass
and mounted in the bottom of the ship in a small
gondola against which the gravity has not been nullified
when the ship changes its course slightly or in other
words when the housing about the gyroscopic ap-
paratus changes position slightly the shafts on which
	air wonder stories

the gyroscopes rotate close electrical contacts as they
strive to retain their positions these contacts close
relays which direct the forces used in opposing the
external forces striving to buffet the ship about using
a gyroscopic control is more satisfactory than a large
stabilizer especially in a battleship for by simply open-
ing a multiple-pole switch we disconnect the stabilizer
and take over full control of the ship during battle
maneuvers a large brute-force stabilizer would be
a detriment under such conditions all of these opera-
tions are handled by remote control from the keyboard
on the control table

addison marvels

dut you were asking about the lighting ap-

  	paratus i recall from history that at your time
during the steel age you thought yourselves quite
accomplished when you succeeded in heating a wire
in vacuum or some inert gas and thus securing a
light having an efficiency of three or five per cent
we use cold light with an efficiency of ninety to ninety-
five per cent we are using but one lamp at present
in this room and it consumes a little less than three
watts yet it is as effective as ninety or a hundred watt
lamp of the old style

  there is nothing mysterious about it however
much as it differs from the old method we use a
tiny short-wave radio transmitter sealed in a tube of
fused quartz here he opened a compartment in the
wall and took out a spare tube you will notice that
point inside the tube-it is tipped with a radio-active
material which emits a stream of electrons the grid
and plate are connected electrostatically for the feed-
back the rate of oscillation is varied until it is of
the frequency of white light and the movable adjust-
ment is welded in place with a ray welder focussed
through the quartz tube we have other lamps on
board that are adjusted to emit colored light and the
searchlights we are using at the moment are infra-red
these rays are invisible but penetrate the mists well
and the reflected beams are picked up on the televi-
sion plates around the shell of the vessel being inter-
preted as white light on the screens before the control
table we are thus able to see where we are going and
to view the ground while to anyone without apparatus
we are invisible we have an adjustable light in
another room if you care to examine it

  with the help of the captain addison managed to
navigate into another room where the officer touched
a button on the door casing and the room was flooded
with white light with a dial on the switch plate
connected through the walls with the mounting of the
lamp the officer rotated the bulb changing the light
through the entire spectrum of colors as he varied
the wave length the colors were brilliant not at all
like the results from the old method of shining a white
light through a prism for there was something vital
about the colors emitted and addison marveled

  i have been wondering why you have the control
room in the center of the ship instead of out where
you could see through windows

  we place the control room there for the greatest
protection against the enemy but youll understand
that better when i show you our fighting methods
you were going to tell me about the two nations
and the reason for the war said addison when he
had watched the light for a time

  yes said the officer starting for the control room
where he assisted addison to a chair and pulled him-

self into another

  you recall that i told you of how science is now
in control of all governmental and industrial activities
the captain continued when they had strapped them-
selves into their chairs that is also true of educa-
tion of course through our educational system in
the hands of scientists we are gradually bringing the
people to a consciousness of world citizenship and have
succeeded to the extent that all white nations lave
been consolidated into one indivisible and harmonious
country that is true also of the colored races we
were just getting to the place where we thought that
we were civilized enough to enable us to unite the
two nations and make a truly unified world with all
military institutions delegated to the museum as relics
of barbaric ages

  but one man in whom there has developed a
collosal selfishness and a distorted ambition has dis-
rupted our cherished plans and thrown us into a
frightful war this man ghorski by name vas once
a member of the experimental force working on the
anti-nullifier which has been developed by the occi-
dental g- service and held as a secret ghorski
whose aura was good at the time of his admittance
to the service evidently changed as may happen in
rare instances taking advantage of the desire of the
colored races for revenge after the suppressions and
extortions by some of the white nations during the
steel age he has convinced them that by their superior
numbers they can overrun the white race and sub-
jugate them he has a powerful personality and
has succeeded in rousing the desire for world dominion
among ambitious leaders despite the earnest opposition
of the farseeing statesmen and writers of orienta it
is very discouraging truly he is an evil genius such
as one might expect to read about in ancient history

  our aim of education under the scientific regime is
to direct the naturally aggressive tendency of the human
being into channels of personal conquest by this i
mean that there are vast possibilities in the human mind
which can be developed only through constant effort
and it is toward the unfolding of these latent powers
and away from the false ambition for wealth and per-
sonal power that our psychologists are arranging the
curriculums we realize that this is the only means
by which we can hope to realize our ideal of world
peace

the age of man

t have been wondering how it happens that i

  j found a wilderness a short distance west of new
york addison mused while he digested the informa-
tion he had just received

  that said the officer is very simple we make
all of our food in laboratories and have little use for
cultivation of large areas we have allowed most of
it to return to its natural state we prohibit the killing
of animals having found that this law promotes our
efforts toward peace our citizens live along the
rivers and other scenic spots leaving much of the unat-
tractive land wild and elemental

  for some time they sat in silence addison glanced
from time to time at a clock mounted above the control
table and became interested they had started on their
dangerous mission at midnight and had traveled for
an hour and a half but the clock indicated the time as
twelve ten and now was stationary

  i see your clock has stopped he smiled at the cap-
tain surely he could find one little detail that did not
the silent

function perfectly

  the officer laughed no that dock never stops it
is a local time clock indicating the local time at any
spot on the surface of the earth over which we happen
to be flying at the moment its speed is controlled by
a compass and an earth speed indicator all corrections
being automatic we are now traveling toward the
west at about a thousand miles per hour so we are as
it were keeping up with local time hence the hands
are stationary should we change our course the com-
pass and speed indicator would keep the clock on the
proper local time for instance if we were now flying
due south or due north along a meridian where the
local time is the same the clock would run at normal
speed on the other hand were we flying due east at
the speed we are now traveling westward the clock
would run at double speed again should we increase
our present speed in the course we are now holding
the clock would run backwards this is a great factor
in determining our exact position during inclement
weather

  addison grinned sheepishly and looked at the clock
with new respect

  again there was silence and the visitor yawned
despite his efforts at suppression

  here said the commander handing him a small
green tablet this is a counter-irritant and antitoxin
against the effects of fatigue poison although we
sleep realizing that sleep las other purposes than the
mere resting and elimination of fatigue we resort to
these tablets during emergencies such as the present
one

  addison swallowed the pill and gradually the feeling
of sleepiness and fatigue gave place to a sensation of
freshness as though he had been asleep for several
hours

  of course the marveling visitor hesitated all
of these wonders are commonplace to you but you
realize that they are intensely interesting to me and i
trust that you understand my position and sympathize
with me while i ask numerous questions

  certainly the captain laughed i have often
thought that it might be curious to conduct a person
of the steel age through our present civilization-and
i find it interesting

  by the way you call the twentieth century the steel
age what do you call this

  we term this the age of man because man
through his scientific knowledge and his change of
purpose has taken practically full control of the earth

chapter iii
addison learns more

addison rested back against the chair and
turned his attention to the screens above the con-
 trol table they appeared similar to the one over
which the captain had received his orders but each
was flooded with an even light suddenly he leaned
forward with interest for he saw a shape nose into the
field of light gradually it appeared-a flying craft
similar to the one in which he rode although he did
not know that it was twice the size of the battle craft

  what is that he indicated the image of the craft
drawing away on the other edge of the screen

  that is the alaska-san francisco express crossing
our course two miles below that television screen is
connected with a transmitter plate in the bottom of the
ship our ship dispatcher routed with them twenty

destroyer	

minutes ago and they chose the lower level i see they
are three seconds behind schedule

  you use television a great deal how does it
function

  it is similar to the ones used during the steel age
although vastly improved come and ill show you the
apparatus

  in a small room on the other side of the wall against
which the control table stood the officer opened a com-
partment revealing the maze of connections and ap-
paratus constituting the hidden part of the control
mechanism much to addisons amazement the officer
walked up the wall that he might better view the tele-
vision apparatus which was too high for easy inspection
from the floor although the sense of up and down
was rather vague it seemed to addison that the floor
was normally toward the earths center of gravity but
when he stopped to think he recalled that they were
released from the dominance of gravity and proceeded
to follow the officer a little apprehensively to be sure
with the idea of assisting himself up the wall with his
hands after the manner of climbing a ladder addison
ventured to follow the captain and then straightened
up perpendicular to the wall with an expression of
utter amazement instead of a feeling that he was
walking up the wall it seemed to him that the entire
room rotated ninety degrees leaving the floor to form
one wall of the room and the wall which he was climb-
ing to take the place of the floor he looked at the
ceiling now forming a wall and wondered if-tie tried
it and surely the room appeared to rotate until the
ceiling was where the floor had been and the floor
above him constituting the ceiling  mulling this phe-
nomenon in his mind addison stepped back onto the
wall but which instantly seemed to become the floor
and stopped beside the captain where he stood looking
down into the compartment containing the television
apparatus the captain who had watched the visitors
experiment laughed

  where there is no gravity as in this case he ex-
plained we have no definite sense of up or down but
we and our ancestors for centuries have come to re-
gard whatever we are standing upon as being below us
or down so we instinctively regard whatever our feet
rest upon as being down although now during normal
flight the floor happens to be toward the earth in
fact since the sensation of up and down is a matter of
individual conception this wall is actually down and
the opposite wall is up while we are standing here
during battle maneuvers the ship often turns com-
pletely over although we have no sensation of the move-
ment-there is no movement except to one who might
happen to watch us from some external point we
who are accustomed to riding in this type of ship can
feel changes through the centrifugal force which
appears when the vessel rotates

  i have observed that the laws of inertia and centri-
fugal force are still operative despite the lack of
gravity

  yes these phenomena deal with mass rather than
weight in motion or at rest and here we have a case
of mass without weight

  i understand although it startled me at first now
about this television

 since the general principle of this machine is iden-
tical with that of the old steel age apparatus for trans-
mitting motion pictures we might well review the old
machine as a starting point as you know the light
from the subject for example a persons face is di-
	air wonder stories

vided mechanically into a series of horizontal lines or
rays of varying intensity these rays act upon a light
sensitive valve which passes more or less electrical
current as the intensity of light from various parts of
the face opens or closes this valve this varying cur-
rent is then used after being amplified to distort the
carrier wave of a regular broadcast transmitter as
though it were the varying current from a microphone

  this distorted carrier wave is then picked up on the
receiving antenna and used to operate the valves in an
ordinary receiving set when the distortion is ampli-
fied sufficiently it is used instead of operating a loud
speaker to vary the intensity of the light from a special
lamp the varying light from this lamp is then cast in
a thin line upon a screen and when the placing of
these lines of light are exactly synchronized with the
pick-up at the transmitter we have an image of the
original

  by way of analogy if we should stretch pieces of
thread tightly across a frame so close together that the
result appeared to be cloth and then paint with dyes
a picture on this cloth after which we should remove
the threads and tie them end to end we have accom-
plished the purpose of the pick-up if we then blow
the assembled length of thread through a tube to some
distant point we lave done the work of the transmitter
if at the receiving point they cut the lengths of thread
apart and assemble them in a frame exactly as they
originally were they have acted as a receiver-they have
the picture

  because in the first attempts they used a motor-
driven disc through which was drilled a spiral of holes
for lining the image at the transmitter and also for
laying it upon the screen at the receiver the image
because of the slowness and other limitations of the
disc was necessarily very small and coarse and syn-
chronizing the receiving disc with that of the trans-
mitter was a source of constant trouble

a sumptuous meal

tn our present day apparatus continued the officer

   indicating a huge lens the image to be transmitted
is brought to a flat field at the focal plane of this lens
this image which is very bright is divided or lined by
these three tiny lenses-there is one for each primary
color-and the threads of light focused upon these
three special light-sensitive valves for transmission
these tiny lenses-pick-up lenses we call them-are
connected by levers to highly responsive piezo crystals
these crystals which as you know change shape in
response to varying or alternating electrical currents
are agitated by crystal-controlled local oscillators mov-
ing the pick-up lenses on their vertical axes through
an arc that just covers the twenty-inch wide image
field the lenses are moved on a horizontal axis to
cover the twenty-inch height of the field being moved
up and then down to cover the field twenty times per
second by a carefully governed motor thus by im-
pressing upon the piezo crystals an alternating current
with a frequency of  cycles per second we have

	lines per picture for each color or  lines
for the picture in colors- lines per inch of screen
by a similar arrangement we lay the varying light on
the screen at the receiving station since we have a
large number of transmitters or plates as we call them
set in various parts of the vessels shell for viewing our
surroundings we use a large oscillator to control all of
the piezo crystals for the televisions lookouts and
telescopes

  telescopes

  yes by using many of the tiny pick-up lenses at
the transmitter and receiver making hundreds of lines
to the inch and examining the receiving screen through
a microscope we have a telescope

  back in the control room the captain explained how
the four screens above the control table could be
switched over to any of the receiving plates about the
hull revealing the surroundings in the light of the
infra-red searchlight

  and here is a telescope said the officer indicating
a screen set in a table over which was mounted an eye-
piece in a swinging support he closed one of several
switches and a cone of light appeared on the screen

  that is the glare of the infra-red searchlight di-
rected toward the ocean

  addison peered through the eye-piece and was
startled to see how close the waves appeared

  they sat for a time in silence and then the com-
mander picked up a phone and talked for a few
moments presently a chef appeared bearing a tray
of small cups which he served to all in the room
addison looked into his cup of pills dubiously and
turned his questioning eyes toward the captain

  i told the chef what your colors are and he arranged
a menu best suited to your needs this is synthetic
food from our laboratories said the officer swallow-
ing one of the pellets

  addison grinned several times during what the cap-
tain called a leisurely meal how different from the
real feast of the steel age i this struck him as being
ludicrous and he chuckled inwardly as the dozen or so
little pills slid down i wonder what these people
would do if they were at an old-time table with its back
nearly broken under the weight of food he thought
struggling to hide his amusement from his gracious
host

  they settled down for an after dinner chat as the
captain put it and addison bubbled over with mirth
it was more of an after pill chat

  what is this mission we are on he asked finally

  we are on our way to a spot in the likiang moun-
tains near the village of likiang on the yangtze river
one of our agents reports that there is unusual activity
there and thinks that is the place where the orientals
are making their anti-nullifiers-machines that destroy
the gravity nullifying power of any ship during the
time they are directed at the ship if that is true and
we are fairly certain that it is you can imagine that
the spot is protected by every means at their disposal
and that we are going into the lions den but orders
are orders	 -

chapter iv
a slight annoyance

again the conversation lapsed and addison
watched the screens over the control table sev-
 eral ships crossed their field of vision but every
move seemed to be so carefully directed that he ceased
to worry about the possibility of a collision at this
frightful speed the ship was silent ominously silent
addison thought although the crew seemed to be at
ease it did not seem possible that this was a battle
craft on a dangerous mission-it was more like a
pleasure trip gradually a slight hum pushed its way
through the stillness the captain listened a moment
and a look of annoyance crossed his face

  someone is careless he said pushing a button

  a man appeared evidently a mechanic
the silent

  what is that hum demanded the captain it is
very annoying

  the commutator on the lighting generator has a
hard bar the man explained i was going to turn
it down this afternoon but the unexpected orders inter-
rupted me

  i see cut the load over on the other machine and
take this one down to the machine shop for repairs
well take a chance on the one machine-its better
than enduring that annoying hum and tell them to
rush die job

  regardless of how carefully one trains a crew there
are always evidences of negligence the officer apolo-
gized to addison when the man was gone i give
them repeated orders to keep things in repair but they
forget

  again they were interrupted this time by a man who
entered and laid two films on the captains desk
addison noticed that they were photographs of blue
typewritten pages

  more orders from headquarters said the com-
mander if you will pardon me-

  another agent has confirmed the report of the first
and they are now certain that our objective is the secret
factory we are seeking he informed addison when
he finished reading

  how do you make photographs so quickly asked
addison more interested in the process than the report
i was going to ask you about it when i saw the one
made in your office back at the airdrome

  i had forgotten that you used to immerse your
plates in chemical baths and otherwise go to a great deal
of trouble and then secure only a black and white
result the captain nodded

  we have two kinds of films the black and the
white in either case the emulsion is in the presence
of a powerful catalytic agent which makes the film
exposing out i mean that when the film is exposed
in the camera the picture appears instantly and requires
no development we use a gas which is a negative
catalytic force and permanently stops all action we
release this gas inside the camera automatically after
the exposure so we can take the completed picture
out immediately

  the black films have a black emulsion which turns
lighter upon exposure to light the more intense the
light the lighter the result they are responsive to
colors and reproduce them perfectly since we start
with a black film and high-iights appear light we
obtain a positive we print these on black paper or
film to obtain copies in positive

  ths-whife films have a white emulsion that turns
dark upon exposure to light resulting in a negative
to obtain positive copies we print them on white paper
or films

  that is how we simplify our office and paper work
he added

  by the way where are we now asked addison
i should like to know how you calculate your position

  captain gauthier read the local time-clock and a
chronometer and fed the data together with the exact
direction of their course into a computing machine from
which he took the answer written on a little slip of
paper similar to that used in an adding machine

     n-   wl he read
we are well over the pacific ocean and not very far
from our objective

  for a time addison sat watching the screens above
the control table he marveled at the number of ships

destroyer	

that appeared out of the night to be swallowed again
in the gulf of darkness he became restless and asked
if he might explore the ship

  certainly said the captain arising and assisting
addison to his precarious balance i believe that it
would be easier if i carried you since you are not
accustomed to walking in this space of no gravity
no it will not appear ludicrous to the crew for they
all know about you and can appreciate your difficulties
in fact they are wondering why i have not carried you
before if you will take off your magnetic shoes-

  addison unbuckled his shoes a little dubiously and
drew his foot from one of them

  be careful the captain warned hang onto me
when you take your other foot out if you should
exert force against the floor you would overcome the
inertia of your bodys mass and continue upward until
you bumped your head against the ceiling and continue
bouncing between the floor and ceiling until the tissue
and air friction stopped you or until somebody with
shoes caught you

transmutation i

addison clung to his host and gingerly removed
his other foot leaving the shoes fast to the floor
a feeling of utter helplessness came over him he
attempted to walk but could gain absolutely no traction
for there was no force to set up friction between his
feet and the floor it occurred to him that he was like
a wisp of smoke to be wafted hither and yon as suited
the fancy of any air current that might stir

  hang onto my arm to steady yourself and well go
directed the officer

  the visitor grasped the captains arm and held him-
self with some degree of success in an upright posi-
tion although there was no load on the commanders
arm when they started however addison felt a
slight pull until he was under way then the inertia
was overcome and he floated along with no hindrance
to his host they were now in the narrow corridor
which ran the length of the ship and addison tried an
experiment twisting on the supporting arm slightly
he maneuvered his body until it was at right angles to
that of his new found friend and again experienced
the phenomenon of the corridor revolving to accom-
modate his position it seemed to him that the captain
was now walking up the side of a tall shaft in which
addison hung from a precarious position two hun-
dred fifty feet below was the bottom and the same
distance above was the top i he gasped with dizziness
and then laughed when the thought of the absence of
gravity came to his rescue

  as they progressed on their tour of inspection addi-
son was astonished at the great amount of machinery
some of great mass and the number of the crew busy
over the ship he shuddered to think of the great
splash should the gravity-nullifying equipment fail

  the visitors curiosity was aroused when he noticed
a continued duplication of small twin apparatus all
about the shell of the craft these were faced invari-
ably by a lens of some five inches in diameter for one
part of the equipment while the companion machine
extended what appeared to be a flat tube about eight
inches wide and half an inch thick through the wall of
the vessel the tube passed through a ball which was
set in a socket in the outer wall of the craft permitting
the tube to be moved about and still keep an air-tight
joint

  what are these he asked his guide
	air wonder stories

  that machine upon which the lens in the shell is
focused is an anti-nullifier while rays from it are
directed upon an enemy ship it paralyzes the nullifying
forces of the vessel permitting gravity to crash it to
the earth this smaller machine is a molecule dis-
rupter it stops the activity of atoms and destroys
their power of attracting one another and maintaining
space between themselves during a battle we cut huge
slices out of the enemy craft until a vital spot is injured
sometimes if we catch an enemy ship unaware we cut
it completely in two before they can maneuver out of
the danger come down to the repair shop and ill
show how it operates

  the captain carried addison to the elevator in
which they descended to the large well-equipped ma-
chine shop

  this said the officer indicating a box some three
feet square and one foot deep is the insulator you
will notice that it is thinner than paper yet it weighs
when on the surface of the earth many tons it is
made of atoms which are not in motion and hence
impervious to the action of the disrupter rays and
protects the floor and whatever happens to be under
the floor from destruction

  captain gauthier went to a clamp on the wall from
which he unfastened a small machine appearing to be
an old-time electric drill of the small portable type
he plugged the cord in a receptacle protruding from
the floor near the insulating box and then went to a
scrap box from which he selected a piece of steel about
a foot long and three inches square while he was
gone addison clinging to the box to keep from floating
away examined the contrivance it was a hand tool
with a flat tube similar to the one shown him just
before but smaller addison noticed that the opening
was about the thickness of paper and four inches wide

  this ray said the captain laying the bar in the
box is used for many purposes it is of greatest
value for cutting any kind of material and for making
elements of which we are short when the force
arrests the atomic activity the cessation of atomic mo-
tion liberates a great quantity of heat but when the
ray is turned off the molecules build up again and use
the heat since it is impossible to prevent some of
the heat from escaping the mass cools down until it
has absorbed enough heat from its surroundings to
furnish energy for the complete crystallization
whereupon the mass gradually warms up to room
temperature

  the captain pointed the ray machine tube at the bar
and pressed the trigger in the handle sweeping the rays
broadside the length of the bar with one quick motion
and at once releasing the trigger a blinding glare
and intolerable heat emanated from the box he
dropped a tiny object into the terrible furnace and
closed the lid

  you see the bar is no more he continued to the
awe-inspired visitor when the molecular structure is
disrupted the matter loses its identity and builds back
up into most anything to control this rebuilding
we drop some substance among the lifeless atoms
around which they build the formation identical with
that of the seed as we call it in this case i dropped
a chip of diamond into the presence of the dead matter
so the atoms as they absorb latent energy of molecular
structure will arrange themselves to form a diamond
should i leave hie lid open vast quantities of air would
result in fact all the air that we are breathing now
that we are so high that artificial air is necessary i

made in this way in short it is our method of
transmutation

over the enemy

present ly the officer opened the lid and addison
was astonished to see that the once fiery mass was
covered with frost the officer lit a powerful torch
and directed the intense flame into the box the frost
persisted for some time despite the applied heat but
gradually melted at which juncture he turned off the
torch and picked up the resultant substance addison
was astonished to see that it was a diamond crystal of
more or less regular shape but with a flat bottom

  some of the atoms combiried to form air so the
mass of this crystal is not so great as that of the steel
bar the captain explained we use this method in
the laboratory for making quantities of otherwise rare
elements and for many fields of research the lifeless
atoms lie on the bottom of the box in the form of a
fine almost imperceptible dust but as they become
active they gather about the seed element and slowly
as they crystallize push the seed upward and build
beneath it we create any element or compound
whether amorphous or crystalline in this way we
have found a method whereby we render the atoms
permanently dead and yet hold them together in any
form we wish it is of these lifeless atoms that this
box is built another instance of the rays use the
underground laboratory and hangar was excavated
with this disrupter and the atoms of the rock and
earth gradually turned into air and water

  but we are nearing our objective and i must return
to the control room

  back in the control room addison again donned his
shoes and struggled over to the control table he
looked over the dials and was surprised to find that
they were now sixty miles high and had changed their
course and increased their speed the local time-clock
however was stationary

  we started out on the wrong course to deceive any
spies who might happen to see us the captain ex-
plained we have increased our altitude to better
conceal our movements and have swung toward our
true objective which is    e long and
   n lat a point about five hundred miles
north of mandalay we have maintained a speed such
as to arrive there at midnight should we sight an
enemy ship the entire crew will be warned by the
ringing of a small bell in which case strap yourself
into a chair or hang onto something for support

  addison was still thinking of the demonstration in
the machine shop and shuddered when he inedao
imagine what a terrible battle might nsue should they
meet the enemy to think of slicing one of these huge
monsters into shavings i now that he was close to the
control table and could see the screens better he no-
ticed that each was divided into two-inch squares by
fine lines

  why the divisions  he asked lieutenant evenrude
who still handled the keyboard

  firing cross-hairs he ansered when an enemy
ship is imaged on any of the crosses he is covered by
one of the atomic disrupters the firing board is
there he indicated another table which addison had
thought was a duplicate control for the ship

  the captain was feeding some data into the calcu-
lating machine after glancing at the answer he
touched a button in response to which a man appeared
and strapped himself into the chair before the firing
the silent destroyer



table addison watched this preparation apprehensively
but those on the ship continued their routine duties as
though nothing had happened the captain sat at his
desk constantly punching figures on the calculating ma-
chine and comparing the answers with positions on
maps spread out before him addison grew nervous
they were evidently in enemy territory and all was in
readiness for combat he wondered how it would seem
to find himself plunging toward the earth in half of
this ship of steel

  we are over the territory of the enemy now said
evenrude without taking his eyes from the dials and
screens if you will strap yourself into the chair
between this and the firing table you can see what is
going on

  the visitor strapped himself into the chair indicated
and found it like everything else in the craft securely
fastened from this point of vantage he watched the
two tables with their alert operators he noticed a
slightly different color on the screens and asked the
cause

  we have changed from infra-red to ultra-violet
searchlights or in fact a band even shorter than ultra-
violet evenrude said without turning his head we
hope that the enemy is not equipped with this latest
invention if our supposition is correct our lights
will not show up on their screens and thus give us the
advantage

chapter v
battle

at first he saw nothing to indicate a ship but
presently he noticed a spot on the second screen
that was slightly different in color than the rest

  number two section twelve evenrude spoke to
the gunner and then to addison that is the light of
their infra-red searchlights probably a scout guard-
ing the factory ill maneuver to get the craft in the
screen and on the cross-hairs

  as he watched addison saw the light become
brighter and more concentrated and felt a slight pres-
sure this way and that as the ship was being maneu-
vered presently the enemy ship appearing only half
an inch long entered the screen from the edge it
looked like a tiny fish with many searchlights reaching
out and groping in the darkness as evenrude brought
the ship closer the image grew to an inch in length

  intersection twelve-two evenrude said quietly to
the gunner ready

  addison watched in fascination evidently even-
rude had cut out the gyroscopic control for his fingers
now danced over the keyboard as though he were type-
writing a letter in haste the image of the enemy
danced and bobbed unsteadily in the little square but
persistantly edged toward the intersection suddenly
there was a blinding glare of white light where the
ship had been addison blinked away the glaring
after-image and looked again the enemy now ap-
peared nearer the center of the screen while at the
bottom of the picture he saw an object for an instant
just as it left the field of vision he looked closer at
the ship and gasped the nose of the monster had
been cut completely off

  intersection eleven-eight said evenrude as though
nothing had happened we have them on the de-
fensive

  the stricken ship was now twisting and turning to
throw off the aim of its pursuer and evenrude found
it difficult to get it into the intersection for an instant

addison saw it approach the intersection and the screen
was enveloped in another flash of confusing light
when he could again see the enemy appeared un-
touched but it suddenly changed course and a huge
shaving from the top left the vessel and continued on
the original course for a moment and then tipped
downward and dropped faster and faster out of the
field of view addison gasped they had cut off a
slice as though the monster were a carrot

  finish him on nine-thirteen intersection said
evenrude in matter-of-fact tones

  again the struggle to get the enemy into range
began a blinding flare that covered the entire screen
made addisons eyes swim and all was over when
he again could see he was astonished to behold two
objects tumbling end over end toward the earth the
ship had been divided through the center from prow
to stern

  addison sat for a moment spellbound a five
hundred foot ship had been cut into pieces and hurled
to earth with its crew of two hundred men yet the
routine in the control room of the victor had scarcely
been disturbed he looked about again and saw the
captain calmly working over his maps and the
stenographer voicing the happenings for the record in
the ships log

  a man entered laid several sheets of red paper on
the commanders desk and departed the officer read
one of the pages and then gave one to the stenographer
one to the television operator and one to each of the
men at the control and gunners tables

  that was good work he commented and praised
his men we destroyed the enemy without much
damage to ourselves

  addison thought for a moment and then the signi-
ficance of the officers last remark dawned

  without much damage to ourselves you dont
mean that we were damaged  he asked incredulously

  the captain smiled grimly we caught the enemy
unaware but after the first attack they were active
they cut a slice from the bottom of our ship near
the stem we lost about two hundred tons of our
mass sixteen of the crew are gone and seven wounded
they cut off most of the machine shop and all of the
crews quarters the head surgeon in the hospital
says that all of the wounded will recover but it will
require much care in two of the cases

  addison was aghast to think that sixteen of their
own men had plunged to the ground in a shaving cut
from the steel monster beneath his very feet and yet
he had known nothing of it until now he recovered
from the horror and shock of this news and was
thoughtful for several minutes

  why dont you insulate your ships with the material
used in the construction of the box in the machine
shop-that lifeless atomic insulation - to guard
against the atomic disrupting apparatus of the enemy
he asked the captain

  it is only recently that we have discovered the
means of holding the dead atoms together but our new
ships which are now under construction are so in-
sulated but there were none yet in commission when
we left

  the captain returned to his desk while evenrude put
the ship on her course again

  we are almost over the valley we are seeking
said the lieutenant i imagine that they know of our
coming and we may see some real action soon they
may send a fleet of ships after us or they may use
	air wonder stories

anti-nullifiers from the ground in either case we
expect a difficult time

  what will you do to protect this ship addison
asked it seemed hopeless to continue on the mission
now that he had seen the frightful effect of the
weapons and they were now reasonably sure that the
enemy expected them

  well turn on all of our disrupting guns and then
spin on our longitudinal axis that will cut deep
gashes in the ground for miles around and possibly
destroy their defensive equipment of course it is
a desperate chance that we are taking but the world
is in a desperate condition at present so we feel that
we are justified

desperate moments

addison turned this idea over in his mind but
was interrupted by a flash of red light from the
instrument board on the wall lieutenant evenrude
cut out the gyroscopic control

  the captain came over and stood beside addisons
chair to watch the instruments and give orders

  close the master switch he said calmly to the
gunner we are directly over the objective and to
evenrude spin 

  addison clung to the chair in desperation forget-
ting that he was strapped in he felt his body thrown
this way and that until his senses reeled by an effort
of his will he controlled himself and looked at the
calm officers at the keys and then up at the screens
first one and then another in rapid rotation flashed
into brilliant light

  he noticed the red light sometimes it was gleam-
ing brightly and again it went dark only to flash up
again each change being accompanied by a jar of the
ship

  what is the red light he gasped

  anti-nullifier indicator said the captain in
other words when the red light is on our nullifiers
are paralyzed and we are falling

  change the course to three points east of north
said the commander weve gone beyond our objec-
tive

  addison watched the dials on the wall and was
horrified to see the altimeter sink rapidly while the
red light was on but mount when it was extinguished
but they were losing altitude continually nearer to
the earth with each flash of red

  i had no idea that they were so well protected
said the captain with a frown if we dont destroy
their antinullifiers soon were lost

  as they drew nearer to the earth the blinding glare
that flashed successively over the screens became so
bright that addison was forced to turn his swimming
eyes away he watched the instruments and the wild
spinning of inclinometers levels compasses and others
he knew nothing of gave him an idea of the wild
contortions the ship was going through but he could
feel it too as his body was thrown this way and that
one of the advantages of eating pills of synthetic food
rather than the old time bulky meals occurred to him
now

  they were only two miles above the earths surface
and addison had tensed himself for the frightful shock
he felt must surely come when the red flashes from
the instrument board became more intermittent and
finally ceased altogether the commander gave an
order and the flashes on the screens ceased the instru-
ments steadied and all came to rest

  put her in neutral and well hold this position
until morning said the captain apparently we
have destroyed their anti-nullifiers since they have
gradually ceased to function

  addison leaned back to gather together his senses
as time passed and he listened to the silence he dozed
nor did he realize that he had slept until the captain
spoke to him

  do you wish to go outside

  addison started and looked questioningly up at the
grim smile on the commanders face

  do you wish to go outside he repeated

  oh yes by all means

  the sun was just peering up over the mountains
to the east when allison stepped from the ladder to
view the landscape and what a landscape

  as though some giant had gone over the mountains
and valleys with a huge plow cutting bottomless fur-
rows promiscuously in every direction as far as the
eye could reach the territory was a riot of frightful
destruction i

  addison gasped in horror he stared at the captain
with blank amazement

  this treatment is meant to be a trifle disconcerting
to the enemy the officer smiled it is only the
second time in history that any battle-ship has torn up
the ground in this fashion in fact we are not per-
mitted to do it except under exceptional circumstances
but go over and look into one of the furrows

  although the captain knew what to expect the other
members of the crew had never seen such havoc and
crowded along the crevice into which addison was
staring they could not see the bottom of the cut
but were intensely interested in the sides when the
atoms had taken up energy to again form molecules
they had crystallized into fantastic shapes of metal and
quartz that glistened and sparkled in the sunlight as
though striving to atone for the frightful wounds
they explored farther down the canyon jumping over
the two foot gashes they found the bodies of several
unfortunate orientals who had been caught in the
flaming destruction and around a turn two fighting
vessels similar to their own addison traced the fur-
rows down the mountain side through the ships and
up the other side of the canyon-nothing escaped the
ships had been cut this way and that into many sec-
tions the edges of the incisions as always fringed
with glittering crystals

an old-fashioned weapon

suddenly the captain stopped beyond the ships
the canyon floor widened to about a thousand feet
and here as though the fateful plow had struck a huge
flat rock and slid harmlessly over the ground was
untouched

  all hands aboard the ship he ordered quietly
battle stations

  addison was about to inquire as to the cause of
this sudden order when another quiet voice broke the
grim stillness

  all hands in the air

  the hands of the occidental crew instantly reached
upward and the visitor turned to see who had taken
charge of the situation he turned cold and froze
in his tracks with some twenty-five men at his back
each armed as was he stood a man with a small
molecule disrupter leveled at the exploring party

  search them ordered the stranger

  while the leader kept the first group covered with
the silent

the deadly disrupter the prisoners filed one at a time
between guards who quickly searched them and passed
them to a new and growing group it reminded
addison of the fateful trickle of sand through the
neck of an hourglass several of the officers had
carried small pocket disrupters and were quickly dis-
armed by the silent guards addison underwent the
search with apprehension the guards took from his
pocket a heavy black object and examined it curiously
but returned it to him-he carried no disrupter he
edged over to captain gauthier and bent close to him
be ready when i make a move he breathed

  the captives had all been searched and the leader
of the enemy walked up to captain gauthier

  we expected a move of this kind so insulated our
shops and hangars you certainly changed the map
but we captured you and your ship thanks for the
ship he said with a quiet smile we figured that
if we turned off our anti-nullifiers one at a time you
would think that you had destroyed them-and the
trap worked

  you win for the time being ghorski the captain
said slowly what are you going to do with us
well question your men and then make all of
you immortal we havent decided what to transmute
you into but have been thinking of a huge gold nugget
for the museum at singapore

  addison who had looked upon ghorski as a rather
pleasant person shuddered and any hesitancy he had
felt gave way to desperation quickly he drew the
heavy black object that the searchers had scorned and
pointed it at the traitors right shoulder there was
a flash of fire and a report that blasted the stillness to

the

destroyer	

atoms mountain peaks barked savagely at one an-
other while the two groups of quiet-loving men stood
rooted to the ground in horror that their sensitive ears
should be thus tortured a queer look of mingled
pain and astonishment spread over ghorskis face and
he clutched at his shoulder his right hand hung limp
and the disrupter slid from his numb fingers captain
gauthier startled as he was recovered himself and
seized the disrupter from the traitors stiffened hand
it was a tense moment and gauthier was equal to it

   addison turned his head away and well that he did
a blinding flash that left the sunlight pale and sickly
by comparison lit the canyon for an instant a wave
of frightful heat like the breath of an angry furnace
rushed by scorching his clothes and singeing his hair
slowly and apprehensively he turned and there not
twenty-six men but fifty-two pieces of men lay in
grotesque huddles on the ground frozen solid

   alright said the captain quietly feeling his numb
outraged ears well go down and destroy their
laboratory and hangars i am sure that the orientals
will be ready to listen to reason now but how did you
make that frightful racket

  i shot with a colt  automatic said allison
simply handing the heavy weapon to the captain who
examined it curiously

   seems to me that i saw one of these in the museum
of antiquity at chicago but i didnt pay much atten-
tion to it how did you happen to bring such an old
fashioned contrivance along

   i had no idea of what conditions i might encounter
on this plane so brought it along as a precautionary
measure addison smiled sliding the gun back into
his pocket

            chapter i
            the leviathan

          it was an exceptionally quiet afternoon ia
denver the sky was devoid of the usual
swarms of private aircraft ordinarily
these should be many afolt transporting
their owners with bird-like grace and
leisure along their varied pleasure and business pur-
suits but the absence of these swarms on this day was
perplexing at least to one who had been accustomed to
watching the various types of craft darting hither and
yon along the ordinary airlanes above denver the hub
city of western aero travel
on an ordinary day one would have seen a constant
stream of trim-looking graceful and swift craft of
various types and proportions forming a perfect cross
as they sped along the governmental lanes to and from
los angeles chicago and new york or el paso
vancouver and alaska

  intently i scanned the air i was standing at the
time at my huge specially built-in exposure on the
eastern side of my hotel-apartment on the hundred and
ninetieth floor of the new orvilk wright aero hotel
and terminal building which had recently been erected
in the memory of the early pioneer of aviation it was
my favorite spot and i leaned lazily against the massive
frame of the big window while studying the oddly
vacant sky in front of me for miles and miles i
could see over the rolling western plains far to the
south i could see the white streak of the great
american desert looming oddly against a background
of solid green occasionally i could catch a glimpse of
the colorado a silver thread winding its way snake-
like through a maze of mountains and when the atmos-
phere was just right it was possible for me to see
even the great inland sea formed by the reconstructed
boulder dam

  here and there were speeding craft which by look-
ing at my radio-controlled chronometer timepiece i
accepted as being the usual hourly planes bringing in
the mail from outlying points off die lanes of ordinary
travel needless for me to say as early as  the
government had kid out a system of airways trans-
versing the entire united states with direct lanes for
air travel this afforded the necessary protection to
the countless planes that ordinarily should be soaring
over denver and allowed 
them to avoid the treach-
erous atmospheres that
made air travel over cer-
tain portions of the
rocky mountains indeed
dangerous only govern-
ment planes were allowed
to stray off the estab-
lished lanes - the pri-
vate craft being forced
to observe the law rig-
idly moreover privately
owned planes were for-
bidden to rise above the

	foot level thus
keeping them well below
the upper levels of com-
mercial travel planes
violating the legislation
put into effect in 
were immediately

eam repp

  brought to earth
their screws made
dead and cylinders
locked by a power-
ful system of radio-
active forces broad-
casted by the gov-
ernment observa-
tion and policing
stations the cul-
prit piloting the of-
fending craft was
dealt with immedi-
ately and severely
in accordance with
the statutory pro-
visions for such of-
fenders there was
no place in the air
for those who for
sheer love of adventure endangered the serene souls
traveling in the majestic air-liners in the higher levels

  presently ray eyes roved to the east through the
pale haze that hangs like a ghostly curtain from the
sky over the country some miles east of denver i
caught sight of a tiny speck that grew gradually in size
until it loomed majestically and awesomely in the air
like some terrestrial spectre i was surprised to see
that it was a gigantic air-cruiser and traveling at a
terrific speed in a lane high above the usual level for
ordinary commercial flight

  i watched the advancing leviathan of the air with
growing interest as it sped like an arrow straight to-
ward the hotel even at its distance of more than a
score of miles i could see that its geometrically shaped
nose was colored with the traditional insignia of the
united states air forces the craft was the first of
its kind to have ever cruised in the direction of denver
and suddenly i remembered having seen it under con-
struction through the screen of my super-sensitive 
power television receiver i was awed at the tremen-
dous speed of the leviathan and intently watched its
advance toward the great landing atop the wright
aero hotel in a few seconds it shot to within three
miles of my building and allowed me a chance to take
in the graceful stream lines rear aileron laterals and
a rigid stabilizing fin rising from the rounded top
 surface of the crafts

 jte take great pleasure in introducing to
 rr our readers mr ed earl repp our new
 author whom we consider one of the most
 promising science-aviation fiction writers of the
 day

    in his initial story the author introduces so
 many new instrumentalities of science as applied
 to aviation that it fairly takes your breath
 away stopes of aviation of the future are
 always intensely interesting because they bring
 to our vision in the most thrilling way pictures
 of strange ways of conquering distance and
 if the story is as good as the present one it
 makes not only interesting reading but gives
 one a prophetic insight as well

    while some of the things mentioned in this
 story may sound improbable to-day there is no
 denying that they may become commonplace
 long before the period mentioned in this story
 will have been reached

long narrow cylindrical
body unlike other mod-
ern craft the leviathan
displayed not a single
screw she seemed to-
tally absent of propellers
and i studied her under-
surface for a glimpse of
her propulsion principles

  as the craft came
closer i noticed a dozen
or more streaks of pale
blue fire trailing with
a hissing sound that grew
to a roar as the ship
neared the landing the
streaks of fire slowly dis-
appeared in a wraith of
pale vapor suddenly the
nose of the craft dipped
downward and just as
	air wonder stories

suddenly the blue streaks vomiting from underneath
her rear aileron laterals and elevating aerofoils van-
ished from out of horizontal chambers constructed
along the sides of the crafts body just below a long
line of cabin windows there appeared gradually two
wide stabilizing aerofoils spreading like the wings of
an eagle that floated the ship to a graceful landing i
expected to feel a tremendous quake surge through
the building as the craft landed but there was not the
slightest quiver

a pleasant meeting

interested in this new type of ship i dashed
out of my apartment and in a minute i was stand-
ing on the landing beside it over the nose of the
ship i noticed for the first time the controlling com-
partment enclosed entirely behind thick transparently
rigid asbestos gelatin the new form of glass that i
had read could withstand the terrific heat caused by
the great friction through the atmosphere this gteat
craft i thought certainly needed that protection
hadnt it come into view and landed from a distance
of probably more than twenty-five miles in the space
of a minute i doubted as i scanned the ship admir-
ingly that twenty-five miles per minute was all this
great air-cruiser was capable of doing

  as i strode along the ship toward the narrowing
tail my nostrils dilated under a force of some strange
gaseous substance a thin wisp of vapor seemed to be
issuing from a spot underneath the aileron laterals
fourteen tubes in all protruded from under the

laterals-in a diamond shape formation they were

thick and powerful-looking and glowed with a peculiar
blue luminosity that even at the distance where i stood
seemed to bum my skin sharply truly there were
the vents from which issued the propulsion explosions 
internal combustion engines with outlet mani folds ex-
tending to the tubes under the laterals with the centri-
fugal force of a rocket gave this great ship its
astounding soeed

  true the combustion of gaseous substances to cause
the rocket propulsion force was not entirely new
it had been evolved in  by a german and utilized
for the first time to propel an old time racing car i
remembered seeing the historic machine in the inter-
national museum for mechanical and scientific expan-
sion over in new york but what i saw now was
truly a great piece of work the result no doubt of
years and years of steady research and experi-
mentation what really awed me was the absolute
secrecy that the government used in preparing this
leviathan of the air for service now it was doubt-
lessly upon its maiden voyage or trial cruise out of
the big station at kitty hawk now the world was
going to really learn something about modem aviation
in comparison with this tremendous craft our com-
mercial ships seemed like mere pigmies in goth longitu-
dinal surface and velocity this craft i speculated
would be capable of outdistancing with little effort
even the fastest of our tiny sport model racing planes
of the humming bird principle

  i was studying intently the under-carriage of the
great ship lost in absorbing the construction of the
unusual claw-like grips which tightly clamped ap-
parently by suction to the floor of the landing held
the ship firmly suddenly i felt a hand touch my
shoulder i jumped nervously

  come on mr holdon and ill show you something
worth looking at i heard a laughing voice i was

surprised at the mention of my name for i had kept
close to my apartment and my amusing television since
i had left new york for a summer vacation in denver
i turned and found myself staring into the bright
young face of lieutenant bob allison son of my life-
long friend and benefactor senator allison

  bob i cried happily for i was very glad to see

the smiling features before me what-how on

earth - what are you doing here your dad talked
with me only this morning and he told me that you
were stationed at kitty hawk of course he must
have been mistaken for you couldnt be two places at
once tell me about yourself bob what do you
think of this contraption of the united states air
forces quite a ship eh

  you bet mr holdon he replied eagerly  shes
a real boat dad was right too for i am stationed at
kitty hawk i left there just exactly an hour and
twenty minutes ago and here i am at denver

  you-y-o-u what i stared at him incredulously

  why sure mr holdon i left kitty hawk at 

this afternoon-in this ship the u s a f

annihilator and it is just  now surprised arent
you you ought to be riding around in old tubs that
cant do better than  miles per hour why mr
holdon this craft here can do sixteen hundred miles
per hour without effort imagine colonel lindbergh
doing the atlantic in  hours in  i dont envy
him that flight after a cruise in the annihilator i

  i laughed softly at his references to dear old lindy
who had performed such a wonderful feat in the old
days but of a certainty our heroes of to-day were
gaining new glories almost daily take lieutenant-
colonel brockenridge for instance he succeeded
several years ago in an attempt to fly around the entire
globe without a single stop and when he reached the
starting point his plane was functioning with such per-
fectness that he continued around a second time that
was a wonderful feat for the advancement of aviation
but of course it did not hold the dangers that con-
fronted lindbergh considering the development of air-
craft since his historical flight in the spirit of st
louis

  my lord bob you young bloods will get yourselves
killed yet i groaned holding his steady hand in my
nervous grip why all the secrecy about this wonder-
ful annihilatorf it will revolutionize all aviation i

  well you see mr holdon the government does
not want to be caught again unprepared as it was fifty
years ago when the eastern powers swooped down on
us with this ship and five thousand others like it
we have the supremacy of the air at last by that
supremacy we can force the entire world to maintain
perfect harmony in peace and no more will they attempt
to add rich old uncle samuel to their long lists of
conquests to gain superiority over anything absolute
secrecy must be practiced of course the government
gave the public an insight into the construction of the
craft but so far as mechanical principles are concerned
only a few have been thus far permitted to know them
i dont think it will revolutionize the aviation industry
to any great extent in view of the fact that the govern-
ment will not permit ships of this type to be con-
structed for public use at least not for the present

something about joan

 a nd you came here in the annihilator bob ill

  v bet your father will have a fit at you taking
such chances i said
beyond gravity	

  no mr holdon he wont the young man smiled
confidentially he is responsible for me being one of
its commanding pilots he saw to it that i received
a commission on board the annihuator but believe
me i had to work for it

  certainly you did bob i know you well you
are like your father in many ways he wouldnt
accept anything unless he was absolutely certain that
he had earned it robert your father is one of the
finest men in this country and you should be proud
of him

  thank you mr holdon im sure that the feeling
is mutual all around naturally im proud of dad
hes the best fellow and the finest friend ive ever
had but speaking of friends mr holdon wheres
joan

  joan oh vou mean that death-defying young
sprout of miner well robert my boy that girl is
going to mean the end of me yet i cant keep her
out of the air she left this morning for los angeles
to go bathing said shed be back about mid-afternoon
ill have to tame that young lady bob

  young allison laughed delightedly his even white
teeth bleaming softly his trim slightly upcurled
mustache that was the fad among the smarter young
officers of the day did not add much to his handsome
face bob allison would have been handsome even
under a six months growth of whiskers

  tame her mr holdon do you think you could
do it after all these years she always was as wild as
any of the youngsters in our set you know i havent
seen joan in ten years she was at school in warsaw
when i entered the government academy of aviation
at new orleans does she still have that funny little
nose that the youngsters used to kid her about
thats right bob it must be ten years since you
saw her at that joan was an odd youngster and that
upturned nose was the main source of her worry ill
bet she licked all the kids in washington over it but
wait until you see joan as she is now why bob shes
as ugly as a greasy accelerator

  i squinted at the lieutenant to see how he accepted
my teasing word-picture of my untameablc daughter
i expected to see his face cloud but he continued
smiling pleasantly

  joan couldnt be as ugly as all that mr holdon
i might say frankly that i believe youre having some
fun at my expense go right ahead and have it be-
cause it does not alter my brain-picture of joan ive
always admired her in spite of the fact that she used
to think that i was put on this earth for the sole
purpose of making fun of her nose

  i whistled softly

  dont tell me youre in love with a girl you havent
seen in ten years bob

  his face colored under the taunt he stared down
at his neat-fitting boots

  wel-- mr holdon i dont just know whether
i am or not ive always admired joan i thought
her little nose was cute

  no my boy joan no longer has that nose nature
took its course and developed a nose that would cause
the statue of liberty to hang her head in shame joan
is as good to look at as she is wild and fearless bob

itll take a good man-a damn good man to tame

that youngster if you can do it you have my
blessing

  bobs face brightened perceptibly and his steel blue
eyes snapped eagerly he gave my hand an apprecia-

tive squeeze and grinned bashfully i scanned the
western skies searching for a glimpse of joans trim
little areospeedster with its brilliant red and orchid
color-scheme the air was queerly vacant except for
commercial planes

  dam funny bob i remarked uneasily that on
a day like this there are so few planes in the air
what do you think is keeping the swarms in their
hangars 

  why mr holdon didnt you get the government
bulletin over the television requesting pleasure ships
to remain out of the air to-day 

  no i didnt i said surprised

  well thats the reason why the sky seems so de-
serted the government broadcast a bulletin this
morning requesting that all air travel with the excep-
tion of necessary flight be suspended for twelve hours
that was a protective measure to give the annihilator
right of way from kitty hawk to points west

  so thats it eh and that joan had to take-off in
the face of a government order prohibiting it i must
have fell asleep after she left this morning bob and
failed to hear the gor on my television receiver if
i had known you bet joan would not have hopped
off

                joan arrives
mh well you neednt be alarmed over that shes
 in no danger of crossing our combustion ex-
hausts because we are not going farther west than
denver when we take to the air this evening we
cut a straight line across the divide for new york
to map a new route for official aircraft

  im a little bit worried about joan-in fact bob
im always worried about the little rapscallion here
it is four oclock she should have been back by now
leave her alone and shell come home dragging
her little plane behind her laughed bob id like
to see her before we take off though we hop off at
seven

  i suppose joan would like to have a look at the
annihilator bob i teased him im not so sure
about its officers she might not care to see any of
them especially one who used to tease her about her
nose

  you dont think then that shed be glad to see me
mr holdon then you and i will look over the
annihilator

  oh come on my boy dont take it so hard i
said shell be tickled to death to see you well wait
for her i know shell enjoy it dont worry about
me ill trail along with my eyes closed lets go
down to my apartment perhaps i can find out where
joan is at this time she has a small aero-television
system on her plane by the way what brought the
annihilator to denver when it could have flow
el paso or some other city

  lieutenant bob allison blushed profusely and turned
his head skyward

  well now mr holdon i really dont like to say
im not the ships commander you know im just a
pilot but if you really want to know im not too
bashful to tell you confidentially dad thought it
would be a good idea if i came out here to denver to
renew old acquaintances denver was as good as any
other destination to the war department dad ar-
ranged that too and i wanted to see joan there
you have it all in a grease-cup the annihilator
cruised out here for my personal benefit but nobody
knows it
	air wonder stories

  well ill be damned i expostulated you young
bloods seem to have control of everything why in
my day-

  suddenly a blood-curdling shriek sounded overhead
like the wail of a tropical tornado i looked up won-
dering what sort of a craft was demanding the right
of way to land on top of the wright aero hotel
swooping in graceful circles at a terrific speed joans
trim little aerospeedster with its tiny transparent
aerofoils whined above with muffled twin-screws in
preparation for a drop landing the tiny ship
glistened under the glare of the sun zoomed upward
in three daring half-cockle turns to slow its speed

  we watched it breathlessly

  thats joan my boy i said proudly nudging
bob shes certainly in a hair-raising mood today

  she can handle that mosquito alright mr holdon
bob allison said admiringly shes got plenty of
landing space she must be getting a birds-eye view
of the annihilator here she comes 

  instantly joans tiny plane stopped dead above the
landing the twin-screws on each of its two small
gyroscopic motors rigid and still over the enclosed
cockpit rose a series of small whirling blades that
held the aerospeedster in the air with the ease of a
humming bird gradually the whirling heliocoptic
screw slowed down as the speedster settled toward the
landing it came to a gentle standstill between the
leviathan annihilator and a huge trans-continental air-
liner with a few scant inches to spare on either side
of her tiny ship she looked like a tick nestling under
the belly of a wolf-hound immediately she stepped
out of the cockpit a vari-hued dressing robe around
her slender form and a tight-fitting helmet covering
her head and there arose a great applause from the
crowds of officers and civilians grouped around the
annihilator

  true to the traditions of eternal femininity joan
accepted the plaudits joyously as though she expected
men to slap their hands together in appreciation of her
flying ability if not the exciting warmth of her beauty
as she walked blithely toward the elevators which
would carry us down to our apartment floor she waved
at an occasional acquaintance or spoke to a casual
friend she seemed to show little interest in the huge
leviathan of the air although i could see as she neared
us that she was bubbling over with excitement

  joan i called with my usual severity that ex-
pressed more of a habit than actual wrath what
do you mean by stunting like that over the airdrome
dont you know that i have to pay your fines every-
time you get caught performing like an idiot where
on earth did you get that crazy siren come here
dear

  come along daddy be a good sport gosh the
siren you mean my new right-of-way whistle i
bought it over in los angeles at the sky-hi they
have the nicest things there daddy i just had to
stop off for a few minutes and i couldnt look without
buying a new whistle

  bob allison stood aside as i remonstrated with joan
he was smiling happily i wondered if joan would
recognize him after a lapse of ten years she grasped
the lapel of my jacket and shook it playfully

  father she whispered who is that handsome
young lieutenant standing over there his face seems
familiar why the idea hes even flirting with me
how brazen

  she stamped a daintily-clad foot still encased in her

narrow orange and red bathing slippers

  why joan dear i said feigning an expression
of astonishment dont you know that young man
im ashamed of you joan think hard and see if
you cant remember the young man you used to think
was put into this world for the sole purpose of teasing
you

             chapter ii
             making plans

 winked at bob who maintained his distance
taking pleasant amusement out of the situation he
smiled broadly behind a gloved hand that hid most
of his face

  you dont mean to tell me that he is that little
shrimp of a robert allison do you daddy she asked
excitedly why the very idea he still laughs at me
too  i hate him

  its bob allison and no other darling i said
patting her gently he piloted the annihilator here
from kitty hawk just to see you joan hes going
to be our guest until the ship departs at seven come
here bob

  in several swift strides bob reached us hat in hand
his dark brown hair ruffled by a slight breeze blowing
in from the west

  joan i said turning her head around after she
had deliberately swung her upturned face toward the
annihilator this is robert allison son of my very
dear friend senator allison you remember bob from
your childhood days back in washington dont you
he thinks your nose is very pretty now dont you
bob my boy

  i think it is adorable mr holdon he replied
enthusiastically in fact i think it is the prettiest
nose i ever saw honest joan if youll give me a

chance to appraise it ill-

  youll laugh at it bob allison she interrupted
impudently ill never forgive you for teasing me
about my funny little nose

  ah joan said bob appealingly that was only
kid play how could you hold any bad-feelings toward
me for something i did when i wasnt responsible
you seemto forget that you always called me that
little shrimp of a bob allison dont you

  the sides of joans pretty clearly-arched lips
twitched in an effort to suppress a laugh that was
struggling to find an outlet i noticed it but bob could
hardly have seen the slight movements for he con-
tinued ill at ease over her impudent attitude toward
him i felt that joan was enjoying the situation at
his expense she is a chip off the old block when it
comes to teasing people who appealed to her

  just think joan he said softly its been ten
years since i laughed at your nose ive never for-

otten and i am here really to ah-a-ah er-er apologize
or making fun of it honest joan

  well do you expect me to stand out here freezing
to death while you stumble all over yourself trying to
apologize she said i never accept apologies in
public anyhow mr allison you may accompany us
to the apartment

  i shot a wink at the young man as we entered the
radio-controlled elevator his discomfiture under the
stinging lash of joans ready words was amusing
indeed and i understood perfectly that joan was
merely playing with him it was her way of enjoying
the companionship of her most cherished friends and
of course bob could not know this she was not
beyond

unlike any other woman-she made a man feel as
miserable as she possibly could then would bring him
back to normalcy with soft words and sympathy

  following its usual sudden drop the elevators auto-
matic doors swung open and we found ourselves in the
broad spacious hall of our apartment floor a few
seconds walk carried us to my apartment during
the rapid drop in the elevator joan maintained a stoic
attitude toward bob he seemed very uneasy because
apparently joan still resented the taunts that he had
playfully heaped upon her during their younger days
together i was enjoying it hugely although i felt
that poor bob should not be made to suffer just to
satisfy joans coquettishness

  youve a nice comfy apartment here mr holdon
bob volunteered as he seated himself in the spacious
divan in the living room

  without a word joan made haste toward her own
chamber i did not doubt but that she was chilled
coming into the open air out of the warm control cabin
of her little plane

  yes bob i said handing him my humidor of
favorite cigars joan and i like it here im content
to remain here for the rest of my days if i can keep
that female upstart out of mischief

  i dont seem a very welcome guest to her mr
holdon he said disconsolately

  i could not suppress a laugh

  dont pay any attention to her attitude my boy
she is just trying to tease you-trying to have some
fun in her own way

  oh so thats it bob said brightening shes
still the same old joan

  thats right bob i said grinning she was
laughing at you up on the landing

  he chuckled softly and his face lightened as he
settled himself into a more comfortable position

  im a dud with women mr holdon he said

smiling but i-i-

  but youre one of the best pilots in the united
states air forces is that it i interrupted

  nothing like that he smiled modestly theres
a lot of pilot-navigators better than i and i dont hold
any medals i meant to say that i have not had much
experience with the fair sex ive been too busy trying
to get ahead yet i always cherished a secret feeling
for joan that killed any desire to mingle with others
thats heroic my boy i said with admiration
ive watched you all these years through my own and
your fathers eyes im convinced that theres not a
cleaner or more upstanding young man in this country
than you bob

  its nice of you to say that i appreciate it sin-
cerely he smiled

  oh i have reason enough for saying that i said
seriously ive always figured that someday you and

joan would-

    whats that you say daddy

a warning

at the sound of joans musical voice i turned
bob arose politely delight written plainly on his
tanned features joan had silently entered the living
room and was smiling radiantly

  wh-y-y joan bob stammered his eyes sparkling
happily

  dont stammer like that mr allison she said
havent you ever seen a woman before

   listen little girl i said seriously let bob alone

gravity	

hes leaving with the annihilator at seven and we
just have time for a quiet dinner and an inspection
tour of the ship before he departs

  im sorry robert she said apologetically you
dont know how glad i am to have you with us lets
forget all that childhood silliness how do you like
this evening frock isnt it pretty

  it is pretty joan but it doesnt make you any more
beautiful than you really are complimented bob
meaningly you are beautiful joan

  do you think so robert father sometimes says
im a little hellcat with horns on but i guess i am
a little wild at times she laughed

  your father dont seem to realize that youth must
have an outlet for its bubbling vitality joan then
he turned to me as i sat regarding them through half
closed lids youve got to expect youth to be wild at
times mr holdon im sure joan knows what shes
doing

  humph r i grunted you might be right but im
not going to admit it i had a young colt once out in

california that was as wild as joan and-

  oh daddy dear ive heard about that colt for fifteen
years joan laughed dashing over to my side and
placing a sweet-scented hand over my lips havent
you ever thought of burying it

  alright youngsters have your fun while i order
dinner sent up just make yourselves happy and for-
get about everything but bubbling and silly youth ill
call you when dinner is ready

  filet migntm et table dhote for bob and daddy
joan called after me as i walked toward the automa-
ton service control hidden behind a beautifully-carved
closet door in the dining salon the automaton service
had become a boon to hotel and apartment dwellers in
 lowering the cost of living considerably and do-
ing away with whatever maid and valet relief that was
required in the earlier days by fashion and leisure

  i glanced over the menu board controlled auto-
matically from far below in the chefs kitchens pressed
a series of buttons on the panel and a few minutes
later a low buzzing sound issuing from an announcing
cowl told me that our dinners had arrived i busied
myself setting the table usually joans nimble hands
decorated the dining table but on this occasion i under-
took to perform those details myself allowing joan
and bob to enjoy a few quiet moments in the living
room before his departure in the annihilator

  frequently as i busied myself in the dining salon
i could hear their laughter i conjectured that they
were discussing their younger days together and i
listened intently for it is the gay spirit of vigorous
youth that makes life worth living for the elder
generation

  dont be silly robert joan was laughing ralph
jordan never did mean anything to me

  well all the kids in our set considered him your
beau bob said seriously

  ralph was a nice boy and he was the only one
who did not take great delight in teasing me but
ralph isnt the kind of a man that appeals to me
he simply cannot keep up my pace hes too old-
fashioned and still clings to a slow old plane that has
been in his family for years joan said meaningly

  thats comforting joan bob whispered maybe
im not too late

  i never dreamed you felt that way toward me
robert joan replied

 no
	air wonder stories

  you always seemed too interested in aero-dynamics
and physics to pay any attention to me after we out-
grew our childhood bitternesses

  but i always had an indelible picture of you
stamped in my mind joan i always hoped that per-
haps someday-well that we might meet again in a

more pleasant manner

 why robert-

  oh ive always loved you joan

  joan was searching his eyes intently i had a guilty
feeling as i watched unobserved bobs face was
flushed but his eyes were on joan glowing with ad-
miration dinner was ready and waiting on the table
yet i hesitated to interrupt them a feeling of content
surged through me what could be better than a
match between the son of my dearest friend and my
own wild impulsive joan i turned away and sat
down in front of my television for the news of the
day leaving the two in the living room to their own
thoughts and aspirations although i wanted bob to
explain to me the principles of the great annihilalor

  at the touch of my fingers on the tiny button switch
the television screen glowed before me i moved the
single dial control gently and as has been my habit i
tuned in on the government weather bureau in wash-
ington softly the features of the official announcer
appeared on the screen he began his usual droning
report i throttled down the volume of his voice

  all aircraft flying lanes over the divide are advised
to shift  kilometers to the south of the denver
summits to avoid a terrific up-draft of air sweeping
upward from latitude  today the announcer was
saying this upward pressure ppo density of -
velocity is lifting from  feet to an elevation beyond
the surface of the earths atmosphere all craft are
warned against the up-draft for its upward suction is
reported by the rocky mountain weather observer to
be more rapid and pronounced than it has been for
many years a powerful electrical storm is reported
raging in that vicinity at an elevation of  feet

oifo to  kilograms per centimeter of width stay
clear all craft pulled into the draft will be drawn
up into the outer atmospheres with no hope of return-
ing to earth dm announcing please stand by for
further storm warnings

                 allison boasts
t ord i whistled id hate to get caught in
lthat up-draft its a wonder that science has
not found some way of breaking the force of it that
pressure forming a down-draft on one side of the
divide over the ridge and an up-suction on the other
with a wide ratio causes more serious accidents than
all the air-pockets over the pacific between san
francisco and hawaii oh wej that warning will
keep planes away from the draft theyd be fools to
fly into it

  whats the matter daddy your face is the color
of chalk

  joan was standing beside the set dining table with
a hand looped through bobs arm they were smiling
happily

  the washington bureau just announced that a
high-velocity updraft is sweeping upward over the
divide i was thinking what a terrible thing it would
be to be drawn up into the outer reaches of the earths
atmosphere with no hope of getting back to earth
that means any ship caught in it would be shot out of
the earths orbit where the absence of gravity would
pull the craft into the infinite probably to spin around

the globe eternally like a new satellite

  oh daddy your imagination is running away
from you i nothing like that could happen joan
said with a shudder have you got dinner ready
weve just time to eat and inspect the annihilator

  nevertheless my dear i said you are not going
into the air tonight no telling just what direction
that up-draft will shift im not taking any chances
of you attempting to explore the outer atmosphere of
the earth 

  thats right mr holdon bob said holding a
chair for joan at the table such explorations should
be confined to the annihilator

  you dont mean bob i inquired that the
annihilalor could navigate that powerful divide
pressure

  the annihilalor can conquer anything but inter-
planetary travel mr holdon he answered proudly
shes not quite strong enough for that

  but you wouldnt attempt to fly through the pres-
sure of a high-velocity up-draft would you robert
joan asked nibbling daintily at a wafer plainly
alarmed

  i wouldnt of course joan bob said smiling
affably but if our orders were to fly a straight course
from denver to new york we could hardly escape the
draft im sure the annihilator can pass through it
under the force of her powerful driving exhausts

  you have a lot of faith in that ship bob i said
aircraft have been destroyed in divide drafts for
years

  thats true too but no craft as powerful as the
annihilator has ever been drawn into them he smiled
enthusiastically

  just the same i am proverbially a missourian
ive still got to be shown i said with an uneasy laugh

  following the very pleasant dinner we donned our
jackets and helmets and were lifted up to the port of
landing on top of the towering wright obelisk the
sky to the east was murky with a heavy mist black
clouds hovered high overhead and the ominous roar of
distant thunder could be heard frequently the sun
had set in a horizon of blood-colored clouds and the
very atmosphere seemed foreboding yet in spite of
a pending storm commercial craft dotted the sky
hurrying to reach their destinations and discharge their
cargoes and passengers from the murk high over-
head came the periodical hooting of some huge crafts
right-of-way horn ordinarily the usual storms and
uncertainty of the elements would not prevent craft
from keeping aloft for air vessels were constructed to
withstand them but the ominous warning from the
washington weather bureau had obtained results in
so far as pleasure flight was concerned

  presently lieutenant allison obtained the necessary
passports permitting joan and me to enter the
annihilator he ushered us into a receiving elevator
that had been dropped from the interior of the craft
to the floor of the landing and we were lifted into a
spacious and luxurious reception room joan paused
to greet an acquaintance while bob handed our passes
to the officer of the day sitting at a little desk near
a rigid metallic door that opened into the central
chambers of the ship

  pardon me joan bob smiled taking her by the
arm weve got to hurry the ship leaves on
schedule

  i trailed along behind them as they entered the ships
huge interior
beyond gravity	

  considering the arrangements of the cabins in the
big craft it was not so terribly different from the
usual palatial airliners in hourly service between new
york and paris or los angeles and shanghai across
well-established airlane routes it contained a great
luxuriously decorated dining hall for commanding
officers and guests well up forward officers cabins
spacious and neat with double white metal bedsteads
lined a network of wide hall-like companionways

  occasionally it was necessary for us to drop down
small flights of rigid stairs and cross over metal web-
bings to get to other sections of the main deck i
inquired why this was necessary and i was astonished
to learn from bob that all decks were suspended on
a gyroscopic principle like the old-time floating com-
passes of the early mariners by this principle he
explained for my benefit the decks would remain on
an even flat surface regardless to whatever angle the
body of the craft might be tilted

  you see mr holdon bob explained hardly re-
moving his eyes from joans enticing features this
ship is constructed on a sort of a fourth dimensional
principle there are many new features that have
heretofore been untried the gratings which we just
crossed over are more or less heat radiators it gets
mighty cold above the  foot elevation and we
must have warmth the annihilator departs abruptly
from the old type of airship and is of rigid construc-
tion throughout its exterior

        something new in aeronautics
tphe annihilator is constructed entirely of cobalt-
a steel with the interior structure of four-electron
beryllium the strongest and lightest metal known the
cobalt-steel structure is highly magnetic and to a great
extent conquers gravity through magnetic repulsion
this is the first vitally important step of science to-
ward the expansion of phenomena of electromagnetism
to be perfectly frank this ship can actually fly with-
out the use of the exhaust drive or any other mediums
of propulsion magnetized cobalt-steel with its power
to repulse the gravitational pull can carry this craft
through the air at an astounding velocity but by
adding the exhaust driving system much has been
added to the speed of this type of aircraft the
velocity is increased some six hundred miles per hour

  you are probably aware mr holdon that these
equations of gravitational repulsion are not entirely
new the famous einstein theories of the old days
on relativity have just been developed american
scientists working secretly in the washington labora-
tories of the government have at last succeeded in
insulating against gravity proving the einstein theory
that electromagnetism and gravitation are actually the
same thing according to the theories of dr bryce
b sheldon head of the department of physics at
the kitty hawk laboratories we need not be surprised
if interplanetary travel will shortly become a reality
through the medium of electromagnetism

  now daddy you understand everything about the
construction and gravitational repulsion of the
annihilator said joan with an excited laugh lets
see if you can remember it all robert you certainly
understand your physics and aero-dynamics dont
you

  and blamed little about women i put in

   bobs skin colored under a flush

   i dont know about that father said joan in his
defense he isnt so shy as one would think

   all the same hes not a ladies man joan i said

else he would have had a fine time trying to explain
the development of electromagnetism cobalt-steel and
einstein theories by the way bob what are the
collapsible aerofoils along the side of the ship used
for when it can rise and land by gravitational ac-
ceptance and repulsion

  oh you mean the safety aerofoils we were test-
ing them out on landing they are used for a gliding
landing if anything goes wrong with the electro-
magnetism generating system it does take a lot of
work to absorb all that stuff mr holdon but now
that im beginning to learn something about eternal
femininism i think i shall ask for a transfer to the
san diego station so i can fly over here in an hour
or so

  i see i hadnt thought of the aerofoils as safety
units i said it would be nice to have you near
here we could see you often what do you think
about it joan

  i wouldnt mind it at all daddy she replied look-
ing at bob squarely but didnt i hear you say
yesterday that you intended to visit kitty hawk for
a month or so

  really mr holdon bob asked eagerly of
course you both will be my guests when you come
ill be waiting for you

  im not certain yet bob ill think it over tonight
and let you know in the morning i returned bob
looked at the chronometer strapped to his left wrist

  im afraid well have to take a hurried glimpse
at the under-decks control cabin and mechanical com-
partments mr holdon he said excitedly its
almost time for us to take off and i want you both
to see them

  perhaps wed better just look at the controlling
system robert joan put in you can explain the
mechanical units as we go along

  well to tell the truth there really isnt much to
see in the mechanical compartment he said smiling
in fact theres nothing in the way of open apparatus-
its all rigid and stationery and operated along the air-
current principle everything is encased in beryllium
housings and various gases are forced from supply
tanks into the explosive chambers and vented through
the driving exhausts there are several generating
dynamos operated from special air-pressure tanks that
furnishes the electro-magnetic power for the repulsion
of gravity of course you understand that the ship is
not capable of nullifying gravity in its entirety but
to a large extent the insulation against it makes it
possible for us to rise straight up to a certain dera-
tion where a diminished gravitational pull exists we
will eventually insulate against that too

  we walked along a wide central promenade toward
the sharply pointed nose of the annihilator joan
watched bobs face intently as he explained some of
the more important principles in the construction of
the great ship frequently he gave her arm a gentle
squeeze and they both smiled as fine a couple and
as healthy and vigorous a pair as i have ever seen i
said to myself admiring joans shapely figure and
bobs squared military shoulders

              chapter iii
              the take-off

we had no more than entered tne control cabin
and concentrated on the maze of instruments
it contained when a loud gong sounded some-
where within the ship i was disappointed when bob
explained that it was the signal for all members of
	air wonder stories

the crew and officers staff to report at once for the
take-off i glanced around the control cabin trying to
appraise the many and varied instruments that it con-
tained but bobs voice called my attention from them
and we returned to the crafts discharging elevators

  night had fallen when we found ourselves deposited
on the landing in spite of the glaring flood-lights that
bathed the entire airdrome and its brood of aircraft in
white i could see occasional flashes of lightning flaring
jaggedly from behind banks of ominous black clouds
toward the east for miles and miles the divide ap-
peared to be blanketed with a cloak of milling twist-
ing cloudbanks outlined clearly by the jagged streaks
of electricity few planes were in the air and they
were marked with their own brilliant aileron and aero-
foil lights typical of restless commercial craft they
scudded through the air swiftly like scattered night-
birds 

  im sorry folks bob said with a resigned gesture
as we stood for the last few minutes with him before
the scheduled departure of the annihilator im sorry
you didnt have a chance to see the controlling system
of the annihilalor really its worth seeing

  thats perfectly alright robert said joan placing
a hand on his sleeve that will be an incentive for you
to come again-to show father the controls

  dont listen to her my boy i said it will be
an incentive for us to visit you at kitty hawk ive
got to see through that ship and im sure joan would
like to go through it again with you

  thats great mr holdon ill tell dad that you
are coming and hell be down from washington to see
you bob said pleased ive got to get aboard now
i dont want to be left-as much as id like to re-
main here ill be expecting to see you both in kitty
hawk sometime tomorrow he turned to joan
good-bye joan he said youll come wont you
we will robert she replied earnestly well
leave in the morning and be in kitty hawk in time
for afternoon tea my speedster can do it in three
hours

  will you go to the officers club dance with me
tomorrow night he asked eagerly

  if you want me to she whispered softly

  thank you joan good-bye mr holdon see
you tomorrow by the way well broadcast our voyage
to new york you can pick us up with your television
if you wish but we will not be able to talk with
your  power receiver you ought to be able to follow
the ship through we broadcast at  kilocycles
on the  channel band

  good-bye my boy i said as he took joans small
hand affectionately ill watch you all the way to
new york my regards to your father

  with that lieutenant allison entered the open
shuttles of the receiving lifts and was wafted up into
the control room of the annihilator presently we saw
his face at a control cabin window joan waved a
hand i smiled up at him pleasantly and nodded

  suddenly a hissing sound surged through the
annihilator and i hustled joan away spectators had
already taken to a safe distance the body of the
ship seemed to glow for an instant as the magnetic
energy passed into its cobalt-steel casing insulation
repelling gravity had been contacted and the ship rose
into the air gracefully and swiftly her driving exhaust
tubes silent and dead with an eagle-like swoop she
turned her nose upward in a- half loop and headed
eastward into the thick murky haze long streamers

of brilliant light shot ahead of the ship and from the
cabin windows along her trim strcam-iines there came
the constant glow of her internal lights

  we watched the annihilator as she passed out of
vision into the eastern blackness she raced more
than five miles eastward before she suddenly opened
her exhaust tubes where we stood we could hear the
steady roar of her propulsion explosions the roar
gradually died away as the great craft gained momen-
tum occasionally we caught a glimpse of the streaks
of fire trailing along in her wake gradually they too
disappeared into the blackened eastern heavens
quickly joan and i walked into an open elevator and
soon found ourselves in the apartment glad to feel
the warmth of the automatic heaters for it had grown
chilly on the landing

  presently i found myself studying joans radiant
features her dark brown hair hung in thin curling
whisps around her temples she had donned a com-
fortable dressing grown and was seated on the divan
scanning over the pages of the aero-chronide oddly
she seemed a very different girl from her usual con-
fident impulsive self ordinarily at this time she would
have been scudding across the sky to visit some friend
miles away or transporting her chums to a party in her
snappy little aerospeedster  now she remained at
home for a quiet evening for the first time since we
had taken up our abode in denver

  whats the matter joan dear i asked

  nothing father she replied without lifting her
face i just feel like staying home this evening why
do you ask

  no reason at all dear i thought it rather odd
that you would elect to remain home with me so sud-
denly its going to be a bad night isnt it i said
walking over to my eastern exposure to scan the sky

what the television showed

through an almost constant display of lightning
i could see the black clouds in the east tumbling
violently under an upward pressure the heavens over
the divide were in an uproar thunderous claps
reached my ears and lightning flashed in long jagged
streaks that seemed alive with fire a terrible fright-
ful night over the rocky mountain summits but
aircraft would avoid the upheaval of the elements at
merely the cost of a slight delay

  hardly more than ten minutes had elapsed following
the departure of the annihilator until i donned my
smoking jacket and sat down at the television receiver
slowly i adjusted the controls and gradually the long
shape of the air-leviathan loomed on the screen glisten-
ing under a coat of ice which was very unusual for
this season she seemed to be in the very center of a
terrific storm and while the atmosphere seemed void
of snow the ship was actually encrusted by ice she
was traveling at an amazing velocity and i tuned in
the powerful radio reception units of the television
suddenly the hissing roar of her driving exhausts came
in through the super-dynamic reproductive coils the
suddeness of its roar and volume caused joan to jump
nervously stifling a little cry i throttled the instru-
ments until the roar was barely audible claps of
thunder frequently caused the coils to sputter and
flashes of high-tension lightning created an occasional
glow along the redudng units

  joan walked to my side and sat down i turned on
the double-wave screen in front of her and tuned it on
the  channel band the annihilator pitching peril-
beyond gravity



ously and fighting to retain even keel glowed on the
screen the great craft was at last above the divide
enveloped by upward tumbling clouds thft whirled
toward the infinite like the spinning cone of a tornado
the roar of a terrific suction-pressure and the low
steady moan of the ships driving exhausts sounded
ominously in the reproduction units yet in spite of
the maddened elements the annihilator seemed to be
holding her own and i patted joans tensed hands
assuringly she stared at the glowing screen a worried
look on her ordinarily joyously alive features

  theyll make it joan i said although i was
keenly afraid that the terrific up-draft would win over
such a huge craft as the annihilator despite her
super-powers to combat the elements i felt that she
was meeting her match in the whirling upward
pressure

  but daddy joan said suddenly she doesnt seem
to be moving ahead at all

  i stared fixedly at the screen the annihilator was
pitching and rolling dangerously her nose leaping in
uick jerks toward the upper levels her pilots were
ghting madly to keep her nose pointing to earth but
with each terrific upward jerk she was lifted skyward
at an increasing angle the annihilator had en-
countered an up-draft more terrible in its form than
it had been for nearly a century

  my god joan i gasped theyre in it i tune
your screen in on  kilocycles slightly under the
th channel band and pick up the ships control
cabin

  instantly joans quick fingers manipulated the dials
and the surface picture of the annihilator rolling and
tumbling madly disappeared from the screen she
switched on the reserve reproduction coils auto-
matically breaking the circuit in the coils at my hand
and simultaneously with the sound of shouting voices
her screen glowed with a clear picture of the cabins
interior together we watched the perilous motion of
the craft and the excited pilots controlling the ship
from her cabin alternating my gaze between the
two glowing screens i immediately saw that lieutenant
bob allison was sitting at the wheel controlling the
stabilizing aerofoils at her tail his face grim deter-
mined and pale his hands clung to the jerking wheel
with a grip of steel he manipulated the control for-
ward occasionally and just as often the tremendous
force of the up-draft shot it back he groaned once
when the controlling wheel shot back pinning him
between it and the rigid accommodation in which he sat
he worked the wheel forward slowly each move-
ment of the controlling system was clearly defined on
the screen in front of me for each time bob shoved it
forward the annihilator smoothed out her nose
pointed slightly to earth

  joan watched bob allison intently as he strove to
prevent the ship from shooting into the upper atmos-
pheric reaches i glanced at her face it was white
her lips quivered slightly as though stifling a sob i
said nothing and concentrated on the scenes before us

  that bob was weakening at the stabilizing control
was easy to be seen i groaned and joan placed a
shaking hand on mine suddenly his voice weak and
shaking calling for assistance came to us through the
coils again the wheel shot back and struck him
across the chest with such force that it caused his face
to color with a bluish tint i noticed a thin trickle
of blood oozing from the corner of his mouth joan
screamed and hid her eyes bob slumped in his seat

his hands frozen tightly on the wheel there was a
scurry of activity in the cabin as other pilots dashed
for the snapping control i tore my eyes from the
cabin scene and glanced at the ship entangled in the
whirling elements

  scarcely had my eyes settled on the tumbling craft
than her nose shot upward with a terrific jerk
instantly the annihilator rolled over on end and
plunged like a comet toward the upper reaches i cast
a rapid glance at the other screen the cabin was in
an uproar and men were milling frantically back and
forth across the even surface of the gyroscopic floor
bob still sat in the pilot accommodation while two relief
pilots clung rigidly to the wheel snapping them back
and forth like whip-lashes bob was senseless from the
steady pound of the whipping control against his
breast i stifled a groan there was the son of my
dearest friend in mortal agony and perilous danger
before my very eyes and i was powerless to aid him
joan stared at the scene through wide eyes that were
moist and red i felt a lump rise in my throat here

was the end of the annihilator i thought and-the

abrupt passing of robert allison who seemed as much
of a son of my own as he was of my friend senator
allison i wondered if the senator was aware of the
catastrophe he probably was i decided and like our-
selves was watching through his television screens
each sickening plunge of the huge craft

beyond gravity

suddenly a bright flash crossed our screens
and from the coils at joans side came a quick
sharp voice i listened intently joan bent over
slightly dabbing her eyes with a tiny square of silk
crisp and curt came the words through the coils

  official government orders the voice said authori-
tatively all radios and television receivers and broad-
casters are ordered off the air at once annihilator
lost in terrific rocky mountain up-draft government
demands all broadcast and reception right-of-ways at
once for communication with the ship without inter-
ference anyone disregarding this official command
will be dealt with accordingly off the air until further
notice 

  with a muffled oath i switched off the receivers
and turned toward joan she had gotten up and had
gone over to sit upon the divan her face was buried
in her arms and her form was convulsing with sobs i
sat down beside her

  joan darling i said struggling to swallow the
lump that had risen in my throat hell come out all
right dont cry joan

  oh im so afraid daddy she sobbed nestling
her head on my shoulder that bob will never return
to me think of the sadness in the loss of all those
brave men in the annihilator

i know dear i said forlornly but weve got to

expect such things-weve got to accept them like

genuine men and women aviation must progress and
develop life does not count i

  life counts with me father she sobbed sternly
and seriously i never was more happy in all my
life than i was this evening with robert i

  do you care for bob joan i asked tilting her
tear-dampened features up to me

  ive always cared for robert daddy she said
without hesitation and with feeling you know that
ive talked about him always

bob allison is a man joan dear i said feeling the
	air wonder stories

lump in my throat more than ever i had denied
joan nothing in all her life but here was one time
when i could not help her obtain her hearts desire
i could not bring robert allison back to her i would
have gladly done so were i capable

  hes like his father both are good men and true
im glad joan darling that you feel that way for
bob

  suddenly the automaton service system in the
dining salon buzzed i patted joan on the shoulder
and walked over to the pane and pressed a button
over the mail receiving tubes instantly the latest
edition of the aero-chronicle shot out into its recep-
tion chamber i tore it open and read the headlines
nervously

  usa f annihilator lost in terrestrial storm

  government reports ship located out of globes

  orbit racing at high velocity opposite to

  earths motion hold little hope for its return

  to field of gravity

  stunned i sat down again beside joan and handed
her the paper i turned my head away to hide hot
stinging tears that had welled up suddenly in my eyes
the reaction left me in a daze and it was with an
effort that i rid myself of it

  for long torturous minutes that seemed like eternal
ages we sat there joan reading aloud the aero-
chronicles account of the disaster the lines as she
read them were punctuated with deep long-drawn
sobs

  presently she grasped my arm and shook it

  look daddy she sobbed read this about
robert i

  i winced as i accepted the paper and read a short
paragraph in black agate type slowly i read the
paragraph again to escape nothing

  lieutenant robert allison chief pilot of the
craft and son of senator allison was seriously in-
jured when the stabilizing control wheel snapped back
and crushed several of his ribs according to radio-
telepix reports received from the annihilator by the
government station at washington lieutenant alli-
sons condition is considered serious by attending
physicians on board the ship as the result of slight
lung puncture caused by a fragment of bone he is
reported to be resting easily however in the
annihilators hospital and arrangements have been
made for an operation physicians are prepared to
operate at any moment the report stated

  i cast the paper aside and stood erect joan sat
staring straight ahead through wet unseeing eyes i
began a ceaseless march back and forth across the living
floor it was impossible for me to sit still in the
face of such a sudden and unexpected tragedy

  unable to withstand the torture of inactivity i
walked swiftly over to the television receivers and sat
down what was patriotism anyhow when the son of

my dearest friend-our own bob lay hovering

between life and death beyond hope of ever being
seen on this earth again the government would not
know if i switched on the current of the receivers for
a glimpse at the annihilator and her difficulties what
if it did i could afford to pay the heavy fines exacted
for ignoring government commands of this order and
surely i would not interfere with official communica-
tion

  decisively i lifted a hand to the circuit switch and

pressed it up instantly the screens glowed showing

two contacts-the government station at washington

and the annihilator nervously i watched the huge
ship now on even keel and racing at terrific velocity
across the heavens at an elevation high above the range
of ordinary aircraft in an instant the ship passed
out of the screen-only the washington station re-
mained fixed i turned the dial gradually to the left
and slowly the ships rear aileron laterals crept onto
the screen i continued to move the dials to maintain
the ships presence on the screen from the reproduc-
ing coils came the droning voices and i listened
intently

  hello washington an understandable voice was
saying are you still with us

  yes annihilator we are with you came another
voice louder and more distinct in answer i knew it
was the washington operator speaking i looked
around for joan she had disappeared the wash-
ington man continued

  senator allison inquires about his son lieutenant
allison how is he getting along

 there was a brief pause then-

  hello washington the annihilator operator
called dr banksley reports that lieutenant allison
is doing nicely after a fourth dimensional operation
atomic argonite has been injected into his blood and

hes coming along fine but what good-

  thats fine annihilator report to commander
rankin that we are doing all we can to bring you
down what your oxygen generators are out of
commission talk louder annihilator the wash-
ington voice cut in

a ray of hope

my sudden joy at hearing of bobs improving
condition was short lived i hesitated to call
joan to tell her what i had heard i continued to
listen the voice of the annihilators operator was be-
coming weak

  oxygen generators are out of commission due to
some atmospheric pressure he said weakly com-
mander rankin reports that the electromagnetising
units are working perfectly and they are trying to
obtain enough gravitational force for a drop through
the narrow pocket over san diego california latitude
 longitude dc we exhausted our reserve driving
explosives bucking the up-draft head on he says if
you can get to us about a pound of concentrated nitro-
radium we might be able to force the ship through
the atmospheric stream into the pocket and bring it
down he believes we can do it with nitro-radium
in the exhaust system but for the love of god hurry
well be over san diego at five oclock sharp in the
morning rankin says if you get it to us through the
pocket well pick it up in the nets as we pass over it
and drop down to earth if we can on the next revolu-
tion  if you fail its good-bye

  there was a buzz of conversation in the washington
station as the annihilator shut off her radio-telepix
system i thought i heard senator allisons voice
and was half tempted to make contact with that station
but thought better of it i felt overjoyed at the un-
expected developments although i had a guilty feeling
for having deliberately disregarded the stem orders
from the government to keep all radio and television
currents shut off but no matter if my offense had
been detected my rising hope would be more than
worth the cost i switched off the receivers and looked
beyond gravity	

for joan

  scarcely had i rose from my chair in front of the
television than the automaton service buzzed again
i fairly ran to it to receive the latest edition of the
aero-chronicle containing up-to-the-minute develop-
ments and official governmental bulletins

  quickly i glanced over the single page of type the
headlines glared with encouraging hope statements
by many prominent scientists hailed the possibilities of
future craft along similar principles of the annihilator
government officials openly complimented the ships
officers and men for their heroic bravery in the face
of certain destruction my mounting joy stopped
suddenly however when my eyes read swiftly over
a notice that the ship had not yet been saved and
that scientists and government officials ought to be
working out ways and means of bringing it to earth
instead of raving about heroism and infinitesimal pos-
sibilities with many valuable lives hanging in the
balance but nevertheless hope was plainly written
all over the sheet and i called joan

  she came into the living room from the door of
her chamber her eyes dry but strangely blank she
smiled weakly and i placed an arm around her
shoulders we sat down on the divan and i explained
to her in detail just what i had heard of the official
communications between the washington station and
the annihilator her face brightened perceptibly as
i held the latest issue of the paper before her eyes
a short story in the center of the page told her that
lieutenant allison was improving steadily after the
operation and radium injections she gave a happy
little cry	

  oh im so glad daddy dear she said i had
given up all hope for him 

  theres always a silver lining behind all the black
clouds joan i said remembering the old saying of
earlier days i glanced at my wrist-chronometer joan
straightened abruptly

  what time is it father she asked impulsively

  why darling its well past two oclock  i replied

  then weve time to get to san diego  she ex-
claimed we can get there before five to watch the
rescue work i

  i stared at her gaping

  why joan you are not thinking of flying to san

diego tonight-in this terrible weather are you

i asked incredulously but knowing that if she had
decided to do that very thing it would be beyond my
ability to prevent her

  i am father she said rising from the divan and
youre going with me run along now and put on
your flying togs

 but joan- i protested

  as usual i became the victim again to joans im-
pulsive determination

  the flight from denver to san diego was nothing
short of a nightmare for me joans little stream-
lined aerospeedster sped through the sky like an arrow
its twin-screws with reversal motion spinning at a
terrific revolution rain and sleet beat down upon the
tiny transparent aerofoils of the plane with such force
that i could not understand how such a frail-looking
craft could bear up under it but joan paidno atten-
tion to the storm whirling around us she kept her
eyes glued to the instrument board looking by turns at
the glowing compass the altimeter and the barograph

  i watchcd the barograph for a moment the mag-
nesium-tugsten-alumino propellers of the plane were

revolving faster than ever before and were registering
 revolutions per minute the altimeter gave
our height at approximately  feet i drew
joans attention to the velocity-indicator she smiled
and gradually increased the acceleration the tiny
ship shot ahead with a jerk and the velocity-indicator
needle stopped at  miles per hour

  joan i said heatedly youll rip the plane to
pieces with that speed hadnt you better slow it
down weve plenty of time to get to san diego

  dont fear daddy she answered this little
speedster is capable of doing even better than that i
want to be in san diego with time to spare isnt
the moon pretty straight ahead

  far to the west the moon appeared through a bank
of gray seething clouds stars surrounded it and i
felt relieved at knowing that better weather lay ahead
of us

            chapter iv
            a mad flight

gradually as joans aerospeedster skudded
westward the heavens brightened the plane
shot like a comet through banks of murky clouds
and finally i scanned the earth through the trans-
parent plates set in the floor we were over the long
white stretch of the mojave desert a sand-storm
was racing to the north over the desert but we were
high above it the little ship bathed in the phosphores-
cent glow of the moon behind us a wall of black
tumbling clouds illuminated with frequent flashes of
lightning hung down from the higher reaches

  joan deliberately disregarded all established airlanes
and drove the plane in a straight line toward san
diego the whine of the twin-screws muffled to escape
detection by any aero-traffic police who might be
hovering in the air within the borders of california
far ahead i could see through the clear moonlit skies
a faint glow that guided aircraft to the landing on top
of the towering obelisk-like lindbergh aero hotel in
san diego it glowed incandescent hovering on the
edge of the far-off horizon i could see the glow
despite the fact that we were yet an hour from it i
glanced at the chronometer on the instrument board
we had been in the air slightly less than an hour by
computing the velocity of the plane i concluded that
we would arrive in san diego a good half hour before
the time the annihilator would pass over the perpetual
air-pocket high above san diego

  i scanned the space below us we were passing
over the central level of airlanes dozens of craft of
all kinds were skimming along the usual routes and
to me at our great elevation they appeared like long
lines of eagles and gulls passing each other in inde-
pendent flight i heard the roar of powerful screws
overhead i looked up in time to see a huge airliner
pass over us

  presently i found myself silently speculating on the
seeming impossibility of rescuing the annihilalor my
mind likened the disaster with the historical catastrophe
of the submarine s lying at the bottom of the
atlantic beyond the aid of man then i began wonder-
ing how the san diego rescuers would be able to
compute the exact moment required in their attempts
to deliver the driving-exhaust fuel to the annihilator
as she shot over the pocket just outside the earths
atmosphere it seemed an utter impossibility-as im-
possible as it was for deep-sea divers to go beyond
their depth to attach oxygen-tubes to the s and to
	air wonder stories

raise it to the surface before life had fled from its
human cargo

  with those dire thoughts in my mind i dozed
joan was too intent upon controlling the plane to
engage in conversation with me and as the aero-
speedster sped toward its destination i slept exhausted
by worry and grief

  after what seemed an exceptionally brief period
i was awakened by a sudden shriek from the planes
right-of-way siren i sat bolt upright bewildered
joan was smiling at me and motioned for me to look
down through the floor squares it was daylight and
san diego lay directly below us its tall flat-topped
buildings rising like monumental obelisks hundreds
of aircraft skudded through the air at various eleva-
tions another day of activity had begun over the
southwests aero-metropolis the bay was dotted
thickly with amphibian craft and the government aero-
drome with its swarms of fighting planes stood out
in bas-relief against the green of the area surround-
ing it

  suddenly joan tilted the aerofoil controls and the
plane plunged headlong toward the earth at a terrific
speed it shot plummet-like toward the landing atop
the lindbergh aero-hotel the building seemed to
shoot up to meet us like some gigantic rocket wind
whistled and whined along the narrow aerofoils of
the peedster as it sped in a perpendicular nose-dive
toward earth i sat in my chair rigid struggling for
breath i cast a frightened glance at joan a deter-
mined smile played around her lips and her eyes
sparkled with the joy of the thrilling drop

  for gods sake joan i managed to say between
choking gulps remember that im an old man i

  this will make you young again daddy she
smiled but i promise not to do it any more with
you in the plane youre old-fashioned-like ralph
jordan

  id rather be an old-fashioned fogey than an up-
to-date corpse joan i said as she twisted the
speedster out of its nose-dive and pointed its whining
airscrews toward the government aerodrome across
san diego bay

  well go direct to the government field daddy
she said

  but you cant make a landing there joan you
know they dont allow private craft to land on the
reservation i said

  just the same we land father she replied de-
terminedly im going to be on the inside of the
barricades when they begin to rescue the annihilator
it will be up to you to get us out of any difficulties

  i havent any friends there joan i complained
i dont believe you ought to-

  i dont care daddy i she said we are going to
drop there tell them you are former congressman
holdon and everything will be alright im sure

  well alright joan go right ahead i said with
resignation

begin firing

joan shot the tiny plane toward the government
aerodrome shut off the twin-screws and elevated
the heliocopter blades the plane hovered over the
field for an instant and then dropped slowly to the
ground without so much as a warning from its siren
to tell of its arrival it settled between two gigantic
combat ships their big guns casting long shadows that
almost completely hid the streamlined speedster from

the rising sun but the plane had been observed on
landing and before we could get out of the cabin
armed guards had come up i stepped out first joan
hopped down beside me

  im sorry sir said a debonair young naval officer
as i dropped down to the ground i have an order
for your arrest sir

  what are the charges son i asked

  the young guard smiled

  landing on a government reservation sir he said
  i turned to joan grimacing

  see what youve done young lady i said severely
youve led us before a firing squad-it will serve you
right if they shoot you at sundown i

  its not that serious an offense sir the guard said
with a grin we dont shoot beautiful young ladies
at sundown or any other time sir though you will
have to explain yourselves to the officer of the day
oh never mind the od son i said take us
direct to the officer in command i am congressman
holdon and this is my daughter joan well explain
to the commander

  the officer gulped and his face reddened beneath
his tan

  very well sir follow me he said nodding to
the other guards to disband he turned on his heel
and walked swiftly toward the administration build-
ings nearby we followed

  this is indeed an honor mr holdon commander
wilkins said after i introduced joan and myself and
explained our visit but i am very sorry that such
an urgent cause brought you here i have very grave
hopes for our men recovering the annihilator you
and miss holdon are welcome to remain to watch the
work

  thank you commander joan said pleasantly
glancing at her wrist chronometer isnt it time the
work began

  we begin firing at  miss holdon com-
mander wilkins replied and will continue at brief
intervals until shortly after five the annihilator is
expected to pass over here at exactly 

  begin firing i asked awed do you intend to
create a downward vacuum in the outer atmospheres
with high explosives

  not at all mr holdon the commander smiled
our largest anti-aircraft guns in battery formation
are loaded with gravity nullifying cobalt-steel pro-
jectiles each one contains ten pounds of concen-
trated nitro-radium these projectiles insulated against
gravity as they are will be given greater impetus from
the earth by the added force of high-explosives in the
guns as the annihilator races along the other air-
stream magnetized steel nets will be hanging from
her belly to pick up any of the missiles that might be
in her path therefore our guns will hurl shells into
the air through the pocket over which she will pass
five feet apart and at intervals of  seconds
lord i exclaimed with apprehension and alarm
suppose she fails to pick up any of the projectiles
then what

  oh father joan cried they must not fail
commander wilkins hung his head and stared down
at the toe of a restless booted foot i turned at the
sound of a voice in back of me

  pardon me sir said a white-coated orderly
radiogram for commander wilkins from the
annihilator i beg to report sir that the batteries
are ready to begin firing
beyond

  commander wilkins dismissed the orderly and tore
open the envelope containing the radiogram from the
annihilator after a second he handed it to me and
i read it aloud to joan

  annihilator will pass over san diego pocket
  longitude dc latitude  at exactly 
  world time everything is ready to accept
  your deliveries of nitro-radium eight members
  of the crew and staff are dead from lack of
  oxygen if we fail to pick up your deliveries
  we cannot hope to last more than six hours
  or one more revolution around the globe
  please stand by for results we are coming

  joan stifled a cry of alarm i handed the radiogram
back to commander wilkins without a word he
strode swiftly past us we followed him to the anti-
aircraft batteries like a long line of towering steel
shafts the guns pointed to the heavens in a fan shape
in readiness to hurl barrages of projectiles into the
path of the oncoming annihilator

  commander wilkins mounted a steel platform and
looked out over the towering batteries i glanced at
my chronometer and looked overhead the sky above
the airdrome was entirely void of any aircraft high
up in the higher levels a great white cloud floated
lazily across the sky over the city of san diego
itself their heliocopters maintaining perfect balance
rested thousands of aircraft their occupants intent
upon watching developments in the rescue work of
the great annihilator joan clung to my arm tightly
as we stood some distance away from the batteries

suddenly the batteries roared as one with such
terrific explosion that the earth rocked and
trembled the concussion lifted us from the ground
and set me down with a thump joan sprawled across
my legs i shot a rapid glance skyward the heavens
were depthless but a gradually vanishing series of
whining notes told me that the first discharge of fuel
for the annihilator was on its way i pulled joan
down as she attempted to rise and clapped my hands
over my ears again and again the batteries roared
at intervals of seconds joan hid her face against my
breast sobbing i looked over toward the platform
commander wilkins was standing close to a waist-
high railing clutching it tightly other men sat on
the floor of the platform he alone was standing

hope gone

eventually the firing ceased and i helped
joan to her feet commander wilkins followed
by a knot of gesturing officers and civilians was
walking toward us his face was grave as he came
up and saluted politely

  i should have warned you and your daughter mr
holdon he said that the concussion would knock
you down i am happy to see that you were not
injured

  thats all right commander i said i couldnt
have kept joan away

  do you think you will have any success com-
mander joan asked apprehensively

  i can only hope for the best miss holdon he
said

  joan smiled with rising spirits

  we are going to watch the annihilator on the
television screen would you like to join us com-

gravity	

mander wilkins continued joan nodded he turned
to the knot of waiting men standing a short distance
away gentlemen he said this is miss holdon
and her father former congressman holdon they
will watch the annihilator with us

  with that informal introduction we accompanied the
group to the radio-television headquarters as we
strode toward the building i felt a hand touch my
shoulder i turned my head and observed the serious
set features of professor stilsen director of astro-
nomical research of the washington university

  why professor stilsen i greeted him i didnt
recognize you in the group what are you doing
here

  have been vacationing up at la jolla mr holdon
he said the government radioed me early this morn-
ing to come down here and help out as much as i
could in gravitational and atmospheric details im
glad to see you mr holdon 

  thank you professor i said it was nice of
you to help out of course you know that senator
allisons son is on board the annihilator he is a
very close friend of the family we flew over from
denver this morning to watch the rescue work what
do you think about it

  well to tell the truth im a little doubtful he
replied shaking his head seriously it is and has
been my opinion that when the projectiles reach the
same atmospheric stream that holds the annihilator
they will either continue on through it or be swept
along the same course as the ship there is a slight
chance that the annihilator will pick up one of the
shells providing it passes over the pocket at precisely
the same second the projectile reached the air-stream
on the other hand the projectiles might strike the
ship and damage it

  hardly three minutes had passed after the firing
of the last salvo from the batteries before we arrived
at the radio-television headquarters commander
wilkins ushered us into the rather large room con-
taining the powerful radio-telepix apparatus the room
beyond the reception and broadcast panels was some-
thing like a small theatre with a fairly large screen
on the wall in front of several rows of chairs we
sat down joan on one sidej me and professor
stilsen on the other around us sat the remainder
of the group silent and tense commander wilkins
remained near the panels and its operators

  during the few seconds that followed the silence
jr the room was oppressive i watched joan she
sat in stony immobility her eyes boring into the blank
dead screen professor stilsen likewise stared at the
screen his lips twitching nervously and beads of per-
spiration standing out on his brow

  presently the reproductive coils somewhere near the
panels in back of us sputtered a dim outline ap-
peared on the screen before us joan grasped my arm
tensely gradually the glistening body of the
annihilator loomed and quickly passed out of sight
the operators twisted the television dial-controls and
slowly the leviathan moved back into the oblong square
in front of us professor stilsen let loose a groan
and pointed with shaking hand along the tail of tha
huge ship the aileron laterals and elevating aero-
foils had been tom from their sockets and were trail-
ing along behind the craft at a distance that on the
screen appeared to be several feet

  my god the professor shouted almost in a
frenzy theyre done the controlling aileron and
	air wonder stories

aerofoils have been shot away one of our projectiles
must have gone through the tail of the ship 

  joan screamed and suddenly went limp an officer
sitting at her side got up and returned with a glass
of water i chafed her hands automatically unable to
tear my eyes from the screen the annihilator was
racing across the sky like a comet a mass of wreckage
that had been her aileron laterals following her
around her traveling at precisely the same velocity
were several tiny shapes that glistened under the glare
of the sun some of the projectiles hurled into the air
a few moments before had been wafted into the atmos-
pheric stream circling the earth there they remained
near the annihilator and yet too far away to be of any
help to the distressed leviathan

  i felt joans hands quiver i glanced at her quickly
she was reviving i looked again at the screen in
the instant the scene had changed and in place of the
annihilators surface the crafts control cabin con-
fronted us god what a sight men and officers alike
naked except for their trousers sprawled on the
gyroscopic floor they tore at their throats with
frenzied hands several still immobile forms lay at
one side of the deck hands across their rigid breasts
embraced by death

  the reproductive coils howled suddenly and the
operators throttled down the volume from behind
us came words that were punctuated with deep groans
and wheezing coughs we sat tense in our chairs
joans face was hidden behind my back to shut from
her eyes the terrible sufferings of the dying men in
the annihilator

  h-h-ello san diego came the rasping words
from the annihilators choking operator

  weve got you annihilator came commander
wilkins voice from behind in answer whats wrong
annihilator

  were done-finished the ships operator said

in a dry weakening voice that was filled with soul-
searing sadness but void of fear one of your shells
tore away the aileron laterals and elevating aerofoils
we have no control over the annihilator we picked
up two of your projectiles but we cannot make use of
them because your shell also destroyed the exhausts
of the driving system theres a gaping hole under
the tail stream lines and what oxygen we had in the
compartments is escaping we cant last for another
six hours san diego thanks for the nitro-radium
you did your level best i guess its good-bye to

every-

  wait a minute annihilator commander wilkins
sharp crisp voice shot through the speaking tubes be-
hind us dont give up like that wheres com-
mander rankin this is commander wilkins speaking
i want to talk with him

  dont give up the annihilators operator said
scornfully then his voice came to us in shrill
hysterical laughter presently he seemed to get con-
trol of his reasoning rankin sir i am sorry to
report sir that commander rankin has been uncon-
scious for an hour ill send for lieutenant david-
before the annihilator operator could finish our
reproductive coils sputtered and went dead the screen
before us became suddenly blank

  hello annihilator commander wilkins called
frantically into the speaking tubes whats wrong
annihilatorf weve lost you

  the screen glowed for an instant and went blank
again i sat stunned at a few broken words that had

come in through our reproductive coils during the
instant flash the annihilators radio-television units
had suddenly ceased to function-her electrical cur-
rent exhausted the operator had yelled at the top
of his weakened lungs his final good-bye to the earth
he had loved so dearly  commander wilkins cursed
softly joans form convulsed in spasmodic jerks

  thats the end i said aloud dropping my chin
on my chest forlornly professor stilsens hand found
mine and gave it an abrupt squeeze i nodded unable
to lift my head

            chapter v
            a mad plan

for what seemed ages we sat there the room
was silent except for the sound of joans con-
vulsive sobs and the heavy breathing of the
others i looked sideways at professor stilsen his
features were working oddly and his eyes glittered
suddenly he arose the scraping of his chair against
the floor broke the stillness

  by god he said pounding his hands together in
quick steady claps thats not the end we are
going to save those men

  commander wilkins eyed him with growing interest
do it professor stilsen he said tensely and you
will have the eternal gratitude of mankind

  to hell with gratitude commander he shouted
almost running toward the officer if the govern-
ment would listen a little more attentively to science
this disaster would not have occurred

  what is your plan professor several officers
asked simultaneously and eagerly

  you wouldnt understand he shouted hotly i
told you in the first place that there was danger of
destroying the annihilator with your projectiles you
wouldnt listen to me but heres my plan

  eagerly and intently the entire room gave its atten-
tion to professor stilsen i placed an arm around
joan as i watched his perspiring features he
continued

  that operator said they couldnt last longer than
six more hours evidently they have enough oxygen
for some of them to survive that long in six hours
the annihilator will pass over this aerodrome again
i know that for certain with the earth rotating at a
velocity of  miles every twenty-four hours and
the outer atmospheric stream racing in reverse of the
earths motion at twice the velocity of the earth only
six hours are required for the annihilator to make the
complete revolution the very fact that it passes
directly overhead is a phenomenon exactly in our
favor weve got to make use of it now for at the
next rotation of the earth the outer atmospheric stream
will shift its course and the annihilator will be gone
forever

  listen to me laugh later if you want to but listen
to me now commander wilkins you will order your
ground shops to begin work immediately on con-
structing twenty-four huge cobalt-steel kettle-shaped
drums i will give you exact specifications your
mechanics will fit onto the open end of each of these
drums a six-inch thick circular plate of steel socket-
damps will be attached to the rounded bottoms of the
cobalt-steel drums to accommodate stationary cables and
high-tension electrical lines get twenty-four large
pinkerton winches each complete with cable enough
to reach a distance of  feet weld cables to-
gether if necessary by my plans and figures the
beyond gravity	

cables need not be more than an inch thick

  we will attach these cables to the socket-clamps
by electro-magnetizing the cobalt-steel drums you will
insulate against gravitational force and they will
voluntarily rise into the air held captive to the
anchored winches the electrical energy will pass
through the steel plate and produce a high degree of
magnetism forming a powerful electro-magnet all
twenty-four of the magnetic drums will be sent up to
an elevation slightly below the atmospheric stream in
which the annihilator is held captive i have figured
that the magnetism in the twenty-four drums will
exceed whatever gravity insulation that might exist in
the ship consequently it will be attracted to the
electro-magnets and be drawn down through the pocket
into the earths heavier atmospheres by slowly re-
ducing the electro-magnetism from the drums leaving
the current flowing through the steel plates they can
be lowered with the annihilator resting on them under
the influence of magnetic attraction we will anchor
out the ground winches at fifty feet apart and permit
the drums to rise directly in the path of the ship i
feel certain that this method will bring successful re-
sults by drawing it back into the earths orbit 
that is my plan gentlemen and if you agree with
me let us get started at once  we have but five hours
to finish all ground work and thirty minutes to raise
the magnetic drums i

  immediately the radio-television headquarters
quaked with resounding applause i glanced at joan
her face was brightening i felt somewhat relieved
surely this plan formulated in the active brain of
professor stilsen while he watched the terrible scenes
on the television screen would result in the rescue of

the annihilator and its men-if any still lived

when it reached again the pocket over the airdrome
professor stilsen held up his hand impatiently to
stave the continued plaudits of those in the room

  gentlemen gentlemen he shouted  am not
entitled to your plaudits or praise save it for those
brave men in the annihilator and let us begin work
at once we need every bingle second

  commander wilkins held out his hand professor
stilsen grasped it in a firm grip

  professor stilsen he said with exhilaration we
will do exactly as you bid everything under my
command is at your service we have the men and
the facilities necessary to carry out your plans i con-
gratulate you for the most feasible plan offered my
command is yours

  i couldnt do anything without your help com-
mander the professor said modestly let us pro-
ceed with the work before us

  immediately commander wilkins spun on his heel
and issued crisp orders to his subordinates in the room
and then excused himself to the civilians professor
stilsen followed him out of the room the others
representing various papers remained in discussion
while joan and i made a hasty retreat with five
hours hanging on our heads we had no desire to loaf
around the airdrome in the agony of dragging minutes

  the airdrome had suddenly become a scene of ceas-
less activity as we walked from the radio-television
headquarters toward our plane nestling under the
shadows of the big guns mounted on the huge combat
cruisers men and officers were hurrying hither and
thither clearing the field or executing the crisp orders
of commander wilkins great ships were being taxied
off the field and as we arrived at joans little speedster

and entered its comfortable cabin the triple screws
of the big combat cruisers beside us roared they
raced across the landing toward their hangers

  joan shot her aerospeedster into the air vertically
and headed its screws across the bay within a minute
we dropped down on the landing on top of the lind-
bergh aero-hotel registered and went to the seclusion
of our suite

the last effort

needless for me to tell what transpired be-
tween us at the aero-hotel the minutes dragged
slowly and we were at the point of nervous exhaustion
when finally the hands on my chronometer indicated
that the time had arrived for the rising of the magnetic
drums over the airdrome quickly we donned our
helmets and jackets and were soon up on the landing
joans plane had been hauled into a hangar and she
stamped a foot impatiently as it was being brought
out for flight

  joan had long since recovered control of herself
although her face bore an expression of pallid rigidity
she had offered silent prayers for the man she loved
since childhood hovering between life and death in
the annihilator that he would still be living if the
leviathan was actually brought to earth was im-
probable from her expression i presumed that she
had resigned him to whatever fate held in store for
him with the choking words of the annihilators
operator ringing in my ears i could not see how bob
allison injured as he was could survive without suf-
ficient oxygen to maintain life in his already weakened
lungs and six hours is a very long time to live
under thosecircumstances i thought

  presently joan reversed the screws of her speedster
and it halted over the airdrome with heliocopter blades
whirling for a gradual descent the little plane settled
on the vacant field and we stepped out a figure
came running toward us with a warning to move the
plane from the landing joan entered it again and
taxied it into position near massed government ships
at the end of the field i was walking across the
landing under the guidance of the guard when joan
came up to us panting she had ran across the field
and the effort had returned some of the color to her
cheeks

  as we neared a row of low white buildings at the
side of the landing i noted that they were strangely
silent the shriek and groan of machinery that was
creating an uproar when we had departed for the hotel
had died down the very atmosphere seemed tense
eventually we entered the buildings and the guard
led us at once to commander wilkins he was holding
a conference with professor stilsen and nodded as
we came up to him professor stilsens face was
grimy with perspiration and dust the professor ex-
cused himself and walked away swiftly commander
wilkins turned nervously joan grasped his coat
sleeve

  how are you progressing commander she asked
tensely

  he smiled assuringly

  excellent miss holdon he said his voice filled
with excitement we had a little delay with the cables
but everything is shipshape now in a moment we
will be ready to elevate the magnetic drums the
winches are anchored on the other side of the landing
so as to pull the annihilator down against the air-
currents and the drums are being welded to the cables
	air wonder stories

weve worked ceaslessly with this job miss holdon
and i feel confident that professor stilsens plan for
the rescue of the annihilator will work out satis-
factorily

  thats great commander i said enthusiastically
the whole world will appreciate your efforts and im
certain that the government will too

  as long as we succeed and professor stilsen gets
his due rewards i will be content mr holdon he
replied that professor stilsen is a veritable moun-
tain of energy and knowledge it is a shame that
men like him are not in command of the governments
powers instead of us who know practically nothing
but militarism

  there came suddenly from the outside a shrill siren
blast joan jumped nervously i looked questioningly
at commander wilkins

  it is time he said will you join me on the
observation platform

  before we reached the observation platform
professor stilsen had mounted it and was standing
by the rail a long table-like bench had been built
on one side of the platform for newspaper representa-
tives they sat in a line radiophones on their ears
talking steadily into individual speaking tubes that
carried their words direct to the offices of their re-
spective sheets and automatically set the type from
the vibration of their voices the drone of their voices
mingled together in a jumbled unintelligable cacaphony
of unamalgamated sounds

  i helped joan up the platform steps commander
wilkins followed close behind suddenly there came
a distant hissing sound professor stilsen had
signaled for the high-tension electrical current to be
turned into the magnetic drums i hurried joan to
the top of the platform on the far side of the
landing stood a row of huge winches their cables taut
and rising skyward rigidly i looked up high over-
head at an equal elevation floated a row of odd look-
ing objects held captive by the taut cables even under
the brilliance of the sun they gave off a distinctly
discernible glow the magnetic-drums were in the
air at last

  i glanced at professor stilsen his grimy features
were set he held up an arm for an instant and then
brought it down rapidly instantly there came a high-
pitched shriek from the spinning winches and the
gravity nullifying magnetic drums were on their way
skyward i held joan close to me as we watched the
rising drums they gradually disappeared into the
fathomless skies and we could see them no more we
turned to professor stilsen he stood tensely at the
rail staring into a small glowing screen in front of
him that told clearly the upward progress of the drums
commander wilkins was at his side presently he
gave another signal and the shrieking of the winches
died down to a low moan and finally became quiet and
still their cables taut and rigidly motionless the
voices at the speaking tubes on the table-like bench
droned excitedly

  suddenly there came a loud snapping roar from
the line of winches professor stilsen groaned one
of the cables had parted several feet from the spindle
and its frayed end in contact with the high-tension
wiring was shooting vivid blue sparks into the ground
the winch glowed for an instant and crumpled under
the force of the short circuited current joan covered
her eyes as several limp forms were carried away from
the spot

  ive prepared against that professor stilsen
volunteered our doctors will probably bring them
to shortly

chapter vi
pulled toward earth

commander wilkins patted him gently on
the shoulder i glanced at my chronometer
nervously and toyed with a wisp of curling
brown hair that hung from underneath joans helmet
she clung to me pathetically her eyes on professor
stilsens broad back as though watching for some
move that would indicate the presence overhead of
the annihilator i too found myself watching the
tense form of the professor suddenly he stiffened
and bent over sharply to stare into the screen in front
of him

  there she comes he shouted exultantly her
nose is dipped and shes standing still above the line
of drums the magnets are fighting the atmospheric
stream and the annihilator is being attracted down
to them

  with a shout of joy he broke away from the rail
and danced wildly on the platform commander
wilkins continued to watch the screen as a cheer arose
from the men stationed at the winches joan threw
her arms around my neck and hugged me tightly i
felt a feeling of exhilaration surge through me and i
offered a silent prayer that fate had not been too
severe on the brave men inside the annihilator

  i looked again at professor stilsen he was stand-
ing at the screen once more his hands gripped firmly
on the rail

  shes resting horizontally on the drums  he cried
one more second for the magnetic attraction to
circulate through the ship and we will haul her down

  he raised a hand over his head in preparation for
the signal that would start the uniformly controlled
winches rewinding the cables

  well retract the electric-magnetism from the
cobalt-steel of the drums he said as if to himself
slowly lowering his hand they will fall gradually
of their own volition the attraction in the plating will
captivate the magnetic body of the annihilator and we
will wind in the cables

  despite the tremendous weight of the cables the
drums and the huge leviathan of the air resting on
them the winches rewound the lines without apparent
effort they hummed softly as the incoming cables
wound around the huge spindles high in the air
hung a speck so infinitesimally small that my eyes
could scarcely observe it there came the roar of a
million voices from across the bay and suddenly the
atmosphere was torn with the shrieking of sirens and
the shrill blasts of whistles the annihilator had

been seen-she was being hauled to earth i the

voices of the news reporters continued their ceas-
less droning as they acquainted the world with the
facts as they stood professor stilsen sat down on a
stool in front of the screen mopping his brow with
trembling hand

  gradually the annihilator was drawn earthward it
loomed in the heavens like a great bird suddenly
stricken in flight hundreds of aircraft hovered over
it like swarms of locusts attacking an eagle they
followed it at a distance as it came slowly down

  without warning and with a suddenness that caused
my breath to cease the annihilator literally tore itself
free from the magnetic-drums and leaped back into
beyond

the sky it shot heavenward ploughing through a
swarm of aircraft like an unleashed demon the
magnetic drums hung in position deserted i stood
stricken unable to tear my eyes from the terrible
scene joan screamed and at the sound of her voice
i withdrew my eyes from the rapidly rising annihilator
and tumbling wreckage i expected to see professor
stilsen sitting on the stool with his head buried in his
hands instead he was once again at the rail waving
a hand frantically at the men lined along the winches
instantly there came a rapidly mounting shriek as the
cables spun from the spindles

  professor stilsen grasped a sparking tube that was
lying beside the screen and yelled into it i looked
overhead rising rapidly and gradually decreasing the
distance between them and the annihilator the
magnetic-drums were shooting into the higher reaches
at a terrific velocity they glowed like green balls
of fire under an increase of electrical current
professor stilsen yelled again into the speaking tubes
and the drums vomited green sparks under additional
current that was meant to hold the annihilator at all
costs should they make the magnetic contact again

  slowly very slowly the annihilator checked its up-
ward rise and rapidly the drums shot up under it
the huge leviathan finally floated motionless and then
began a downward descent to meet the attraction of
the magnetic drums there came another thundering
roar of voices from across the bay and this time the
annihilator was alone-no swarms of aircraft fol-
lowed her as she was being drawn slowly but surely
earthward

  i turned to commander wilkins who was standing
beside joan watching intently the downward course
of the huge ship

  they are either dead or unconscious from lack of
oxygen miss holdon the commander was saying
otherwise she would not have torn herself loose from
the drums

  what has that to do with it joan said drying
her tears

  well you see he answered the ships electric-
magnetizing units must have been working perfectly
sending constant current through the cobalt-steel hull
creating an insulation against gravity they could
not have known they were over the pocket or did not
care for that matter otherwise they would have shut
off the units in consideration of the possibility of un-
expectedly dropping through it into the earths heavier
atmosphere had the units been shut off the
annihilalor would not have shot upward it would
have crashed to earth

  i understand commander joan said if the
electro-magnetizing units had not been functioning the
ship would not have broken loose the magnetic
drums would have held it

  thats rifjht miss holdon he replied looking up

  do you really believe they are dead commander
she asked her eyes filling again with tears

  that is hard to tell commander wilkins an-
swered they may be unconscious or very near so
probably those who are alive do not know that they
are inside the earths orbit again they may have
all the compartments closed to keep what oxygen they
had in them

  gradually the annihilator dropped earthward her
huge body casting a long shadow over the airdrome
the winches groaned as they rewound the cables pro-
fessor stilsen sat like a marble image watching   

gravity	

  as a precaution against further disaster he grabbed
up the speaking tubes suddenly and yelled into them

  dont break the current in the magnetic plates until
i order youl he said holding a tube to his lips and
apparently speaking to the operators handling the
electrical control systems of the magnetic drums
release the gravity insulation slowly from the drums
and stand by your posts for further orders

hopes and fears

presently the annihilator touched the earth and
 rolled over gently the magnetic drums still attached
tightly to her glistening body immediately she be-
came surrounded by milling workmen and there came
to us where we stood on the observation platform the
resounding beat of compressed air hammers and cutters
as they strove to make an opening in the huge cobalt-
steel hull there seemed to be nothing to indicate that
any life existed within the annihilator and i hung my
head joan clung to my arm her body sagging

  commander wilkins nodded to me and i half carried
her down the platform steps to the ground with
faltering steps she walked with us toward the
annihilator apparently from nowhere had come auto-
motive ambulances and hospital planes white-coated
and trousered figures scurried past us carrying
stretchers i hustled joan along to keep up with the
rapid steps of commander wilkins and finally we
arrived at the side of the ill-fated leviathan

  there came an exultant shout from a gaping hole
in the side of the ship as the first limp form was
handed through it into eager waiting hands i noticed
a peculiar sound of whirring machinery issuing from
the ship as we came up to it suddenly it ceased the
electro-magnetizing units had been shut down but the
magnetic drums still remained in position

  in a constant stream limp human forms were
handed through the gaping hole made in the side of
the annihilalor joan tore her eyes away in time to
forego the sight of one man screaming wildly and
hysterically being brought from the bowels of the ship
as terrible as it was it caused my hopes to rise sud-
denly for if one man lived there was an odd chance
that life existed in others joan kept her face hidden
behind my back i continued to watch and presently
my eyes beheld the familiar features of lieutenant
allison his face was pale as though in the embrace
of death and i held joan tightly as his inert form was
given to waiting arms

  i had not wanted her to see that face but i could
not withstand the agonized torture of standing there
without learning of his fate i decided that if bob
was dead we should know of it and i hustled joan
from the milling crowd to follow the two men carrying
his inert death-like form across the field

  slowly we followed and as we walked along in the
direction of a long white building over which rustled
a red cross flag i explained to joan what i had seen
she gave a little cry and fairly flew toward the
hospital i struggled to keep up with her the two
men were just entering a door with bobs limp form
as we came up we followed immediately into a long
room filled with rows of white-sheeted cots some with
pale agonized faces showing from the coverings
others covered entirely

  joan dashed forward as bobs form was being laid
upon a cot but two white-capped nurses halted her

im sorry miss one of them said you will
continued on page 
when the grey shape filled the field of my gun-sight again i noticed that the ship floated
in a thin pinkish haze that shimmered as heat from a hillside in summer and a i
pressed the trigger the dancing refraction spoiled my aim

the story

new york is startled by m mysterious and daring robbery early one
morning everyone in the financial district is but to sleep for two hours
by some strongs gas let loose and some nnhnown and mum robbers
help themselves to millions of dollars of told and millions in negotiable
securities from three banks the next day the securities are found in
the post office addressed to several hospitals and boxes containing
millions in radium also consigned to hospitals james boon son of the
president of the national metallurgical one of the invaded banks decides
to investigate the robberies he finds that the gas has stopped all autos
in the invaded district and also hod tarnished gold ftt feat seemingly
impossible he also finds near the banks a little powdered glass which
seemed to be the remains of the containers of th gas he findf men
who noticed a hale in the streets before falling asleep he takes the
mailer up with dan lamont a scientist friend who is trying to dis-
cover what gas has been used and how several days later comes the
news of the robbery of a gasoline station in newark of considerable
avialion gas and also ihe invasion of a provisions store with a great
amount of provisions taken but in this case money is loft to pay for
them from what boon and lamont can figure out and from ihe evi-

find the deck covered with apparently dead men and the ship rolling
as though it had no control they discover after making a landing on
it that the same bandits had made a raid on the ship by putting every-
body to sleep and stolen from the safe  m gold boon picks

chapter vi
searching the clouds

we had left the parnassic at about six oclock
new york time with a flight of nearly
twelve hundred kilometres before us keeping
the merlin at a steady four-sixty per hour we expected
to make the battery soon after half-past eight

  from the bearing which the radio indicator had
given us of the westburys position dan and i
plotted out her relation to the parnassic at the time
of the raid and found that she had been just over sixty
kilometres from the liner she was probably one of the
freighters we had sighted in approaching the parnassic

  now the hour given by the westburys skipper as
the time when she was brought to-eight bells in the
middle watch or four oclock in the morning-revealed
the astonishing fact that the raid on the parnassic had
been pulled off sixty kilometres covered and the oil-
tanker stopped all within an hour even at record
airship speed the flight between the two vessels would
occupy nearly twenty-five minutes which left thirty-
five in which to board the liner break open the strong-
room and specie boxes and remove three thousand kilos
of gold before casting off it seemed incredible that
one group of pirates could have effected the two
operations

  we tried to work out the raids with every conceivable
type of craft taking into consideration the time factors
and the six thousand kilos weight of gold and oil that
had been carried away we even tried dick schuylers
idea of a motor-ship giv-
ing her the highest
known speed for sea-
borne craft but wc
found the thing impos-
sible despite the fact that
we provided her with
hydroplane type of
power-boats as auxili-
aries we were inevit-
ably brought back to our
airship

  when we came to con-
sider what kind of ma-
chine would have made
possible the whole series
of operations-from the
gasoline station at new-
ark wall street the
parnassic to the descent
on the ivestbury - the
weight of the evidence
was strongly in favor of

    a dirigible of the
    very latest type
    and the abstraction
    of the gasoline
    from the newark
    station and from
    the ivestbury was
    an additional sup-
    port to the idea
    since an airship
    carrying out these
    operations would
    certainly need to
    replenish her fuel

   we imagined the
pirates operating
from a base within
a days flight of
victor hmcltoe	new york and

   judging from the
raid on the parnassic probably situated over the
canadian border the weakness of the raiders posi-
tion in using a dirigible or dirigibles for their operations
lay in the conspicuousness of their craft and of the
sheds necessary for docking them we did not lose
sight of the possibility that the pirates might be mas-
querading as a corporation engagedin civilian transport
a few such companies were in existence despite the
popular prejudice against the so-called lighter-than-
air machines on account of the structural weaknesses
which in the latter seemed to be past curing but every
dirigible that took the air
whether experimental or
otherwise could only do
so under permit or li-
cense from the govern-
ment it would present
no great difficulty there-
fore for the police to run
to earth any unregistered
airship on american ter-
ritory

       with the help of lord
    almeric and miss tor-
    rance and an occasional
    word from milliken dan
    and i decided on a pres-
    ent plan of action if
    the raiders had used an
    airship they would now
    be making for their base
    and could not be far
    away from us in the air
    f to escape detection they

 n the present installment this classic of
 scientific-aviation stories takes on greater and
 greater interest and the reader follows breath-
 lessly the wonders of this latter day aviation
 the author has a marvelous knack of remaining
 ahead of you at all times and he is continuously
 outguessing your own efforts to decide what is
 going to happen

     none of the scientific instrumentalities which
  the author brings into this story are either im-
  possible or improbable quite the contrary the
  latest scientific researches show that the scientific
  content of mr macclures story will probably
  seem quite tame twenty-five years hence

    this summer we are to witness a great many
  exhibitions of various monster airships of the
  lighter-than-aic variety and while these airships
  may not be as perfect as the ones described by
  the author we may rest assured that not many
  yean will pass before they have seen such
  perfection
	air wonder stories

would probably get to as high an altitude as possible
we determined that while keeping our course for
new york we would go up in search

  first we got in touch by radio with dick schuylers
headquarters but while we were asking for him he
himself broke in from another direction

  im just taking a flip out to meet you jimmy he
explained cheerfully look out for me soon

  have you heard from the pamassic i asked him
just got the radio from her captain the airship
notion seems to be all right anyhow we cops
are acting on the idea and are going through our
particular sphere with a fine comb its a silly
question jimmy-but you havent seen any signs
of a dirigible have you

  no id have told you-

  help us in this climb as high as you can with-
out discomfort to your passengers and keep a sharp
lookout if you see anything tip me the direction
and well be after the jokers like a knife for the
nonce so-long jimmy cheerio dan

  dicks request came on the heels of our own de-
cision we had already turned on extra heaters and
the compressed air and were climbing good and
high we kept up a bright lookout but until dick
and his scouts hove in sight below us to the west
the upper air was clean of aircraft

  as we dropped to meet him dick began an-
other discussion he agreed that the likeliest di-
rection in which to look for the raiders was to the
northward and on his order his five scouts made a
sweeping movement under our bows to starboard
which was pretty to watch he himself came near
enough to us to let us see his cheery grin and to
give us a wave of his hand before turning to follow
his scouts presently all six were the merest dots on
our starboard quarter

  it was worth while carrying a passenger like
miss torrance she was keenly alive to everything
that was happening and like her uncle took a use-
ful part in the lookout in fact she had her eyes
so steadily fixed on the upper air that we were in
good sight of new york before she realized the
landfall

  i will say that her first view of the city was al-
most worthy of her i have never seen the old hive
look quite so splendid it was one of those cool
bright sunny mornings we sometimes get in march
that make everything look so clean

  the pale golden light picked out all the towers
and pinnacles of the city in wonderful definition
until they became mere points of light against the
smeary blue of the distance this blue distance
rose up and up till it lost itself in the tawny base
of the sky and from that cloud was piled on cloud
in an arch that curved towards us in gold and pale
tan and grey to end in dazzling white against the
deep blue right over our heads the waters of the
bay looked in the sun like a filmy grey-green gauze
carrying countless spangles except where the tall
buildings threw their long shadows which were
deep indigo with lighter patches of pure cobalt i
think even lord almeric was stirred out of his
habitual quiet by the sight

  my dear he said to his niece you are to be
envied new york has summoned all her charm
to greet you in all the years i have known her
she has never seemed so winning

  lovely lovely see all the buildings like golden

cliffs the girl cried so tiny i it makes one
think of man as only a very industrious insect-
like the weeny things that build the coral islands

  then you have to thank mr boon for giving
you a gods-eye view of your kind kirsteen said
lord almeric with a smile

  she turned to me and looked up with those
serene blue eyes of hers very grave

  do you ever develop a godlike indifference to
the invisible little active creatures below you mr
boon 

  no said i im afraid im always too con-
scious that im just one of them myself and that
my particular activity is only a part of the human
scheme miss torrance

  she turned to milliken with a smile and his wide
grin about split his old face

  what about you mr milliken do you ever
feel superior

  bless you miss said milliken i know the old
earths pulling at me all the time and that some-
time ill have to give in and get down you cant
be a god if your job has a string to it

  the philosophy of flying in a nutshell kir-
steen lord almeric laughed

  i see i must not become imaginative said miss
torrance mr milliken is braver-minded than you
are mr boon im sure there are moments when
he isnt earthbound

  when milliken goes red he gets black-if the
irishism can be excused i have never seen him
quite so dusky as he was when he pushed the
merlin into the long drive that would bring us into
our hover to the landing-stage at the battery it
was a marvel to me how quickly he and miss
torrance had understood each other and i was not
a little envious of my mechanic id have given
a good deal to have said something that pleased
her

  well anyhow the gods-eye view soon became
the ordinary human view and we floated gently up
to the seaplane jetty just after the quarter to nine
my father had already arrived in fact i had seen
the seven pass far below us as we came down over
long island he was waiting for us on the landing-
stage and he and lord almeric shook hands like
old friends there was a trifle of formality to go
through with the customs but that was soon over

  lord almeric and miss torrance poured thanks
on milliken who was to take the merlin back to
gardiner bay until he was almost ebony colour
with embarrassment then dan and i joined the
party to go uptown for breakfast

a faux pas

while we waited for lord almeric and miss
torrance to discard their wraps and make
themselves comfortable after the flight dan and
i gave my father a full account of the mornings
doings he already had heard the bare particulars
as supplied to the press by the captain of the
pamassic for the papers were selling in the streets
with the news the full force of the air police both
the sea and land divisions had been mustered at
once to sweep the air in wide radius round new
york the navy and the river police were active
among the shipping at sea and in dock through
the night the territorial police had been scouring
town and country examining garages and all places
the ark of the covenant	

where the thieves might be concealed and all
known criminals in new york of the safe-breaking
persuasion had been rounded up and their haunts
thoroughly examined but no clue to the where-
abouts of the stolen gold was discovered

  the chances are that it is in the air at the
present moment dad i said to him we must
have passed somewhere near the airship-if airship
it was-on the way out we must have sighted
the westbury less than half an hour after the pirates
left her if the airship is making for the american
continent at all it can hardly escape being seen at
least with all those police machines out

  do you think theyll be able to send her down
it depends greatly in what circumstances they
come on her she may be too high to be got at in
an open plane and the police machines are no-
toriously unsuited for high altitudes but the fellow
that sees her may be able to broadcast her position
to all aerodromes and so get properly equipped
planes to help i wont consider shes escaped until
dark has come on

  lets hope you prove right said the old man
things are too uneasy to be comfortable and a
solution of the mystery would stave off a lot of
trouble for the business world

  miss torrance and lord almeric joined us then
and we went in to breakfast the talk perhaps
naturally was still of the robberies until the two
bankers fell to discussing some obscure financial
situation lord almeric asking his niece for con-
firmation of some figures effectually isolated dan
and myself and it was with something of awe that
we heard miss torrance talk familiarly of millions
using such phrases as ranking pari passu funded
loan par of exchange in spite of her obvious
efficiency the talk fell strangely from the lips of
such a pretty girl i think even my father was
surprised

  you have a wonderful grasp of figures miss
torrance he smiled

  wonderful because of my sex mr boon
not at all said my father wonderful in any
case

  my niece lord almeric explained comes of
a stock famous in mathematics robert torrance
the mathematician was her uncle

  then miss torrance dan lamont butted in
you must be related to-i beg your pardon

  he broke off in confusion and flushed red miss
torrance regarded him with kindness

  if you intended saying that i must be related
to david torrance the physicist who disappeared
just over twenty-two years ago she said i am
proud to say that he was my father mr lamont
im sorry dan stammered i did not mean
to cause you pain

  you do not hurt me by recalling the fact ol my
fathers disappearance i never saw him-and he
never saw me i was born after he was lost uncle
almeric is the only father i have known-indeed
the only parent-and his kindness has softened any
regrets i may have for my real father he was a
reat physicist i believe and i treasure any in-
formation about him any praise that is given to his
work

  david torrance was a great man dan said
quietly with recovered equanimity every scientist
owes him a debt of gratitude and must regret that

he was not permitted to work longer the best
men of our time he finished warmly are plodders
and half-blind crawlers compared with david
torrance 

  thank you mr lamont the girl murmured
and her eyes were misty

  well spoken dan  said my father and turned
to lord almeric and his niece dan lamont he
explained has one of the greatest reputations
among physicists in this country-so his opinion on
such a subject is of some value

  red-faced as usual at any reference to his
eminence dan rose in some confusion

  if youll excuse me miss torrance-lord al-
meric he said hurriedly i-i must be going
some important work-i-good-bye miss torrance
-sorry i was clumsy good-bye lord almeric-

  wait a moment dan said i ill come with
you

  i	too made my adieus and we both went off

  there was nothing new to hear in dans labor-
atory except a lot that was speculation and clean
over my head at that so i left my friend to take off
his jacket and plunge into work i could see no
useful purpose to be served by stopping in new
york and i went down to the battery where didcot
was still standing by with the seven

  we moored at the workshop jetty within half an
hour

vanished

then began a fortnight of close application to
work the flights we had made on the merlin
had given me ideas for slight variations in the de-
sign and i wanted my shops to be set as soon as
possible on the task of making a merlin ii which
would incorporate those ideas

  my hurry was actuated by the certainty that i
had of the raids being carried out with a new type
of dirigible i had that inexplicable feeling general-
ly termed a hunch that we had not seen the last
of the raiders and that before we were done with
them there would be a few merlins in the air

  i was puzzled by the radium which the back of
my mind refused to let me dissociate from the
pirates if indeed those priceless boxes had come
from the mysterious organization that had carried
out the amazing series of raid in two days they
were no ordinary crooks that we were opposing
the sale of the radium dan assured me would
have brought in nearly as much money as the
robbers had stolen

  there was something underlying the raids that
the mind could not fathom an idea too big to be
merely criminal too vast in conception to find its
limit in the affairs of the past two days

  to me my side ol the job was now plain the
menace was from the air and the air was my ele-
ment i had i could tell myself without immodesty
the finest weapon for air fighting that was known
to exist and my business was to perfect that weapon
to the best of my ability

  to bring the position to its lowest estimate

  if the gifts of radium to the institutions were not
the work of the raiders it was extremely unlikely
that a criminal gang possessed of such powerful
and effectively proved aids to plundering would be
content with their present gains it would be
humanly impossible to resist the temptation to work
	air wonder stories

the feat again they might wait until the outcry
against them died down till the forces that might
be opposed to them were lulled into a false sense
of security but it seemed to me psychologically im-
possible that a criminal gang could withstand the
itch of their fingers for such easily acquired wealth

  in any case hurrying up my work would do me
no harm my ideas for the improvement of the
merlin were concrete enough to warrant pushing
ahead i did not want for some indefinable reason
of sentiment maybe to part with my original model
to the government the merlin was almost alive
to me and i knew that milliken shared the feeling
besides in herself she was the most flexible of ma-
chines-responsive grateful to ones hands-just
that uncanny accident of assembled material that
happens once in a hundred times her design might
be repeated over and over again to the fraction of
a millimetre and yet no machine be produced that
had her personal quality

  the variations in the design which i contem-
plated were merely to make the machines that
might be built from it safer in unskilful hands the
original merlin in the hands of milliken or myself
would be capable of everything that her sister-
planes could do

  before dark that tuesday night it became plain
that no trace of the air pirates would be discovered
the air police abandoned the chase having combed
out a great radius from new york without the
slightest result during the day i had been in radio
communication with dick schuyler who kept me
well informed and his last message before he went
off from a long spell of duty was that the author-
ities were taking the tardy step of doubling the
patrols for the night

  my father arrived at the workshops soon after
seven and for a while he sat beside me on a high
stool as i worked at the drafting table thus
perched he told me very calmly of an exhausting
day the run on the banks of the monday had
been repeated on the tuesday and there had been
the greatest difficulty in meeting the situation
nothing but selling had gone on in the stock ex-
change and the fall that had ensued in all classes
of shares in some cases reducing quotations by
as much as half had produced a position in the
matter of loan accounts unheard of in the history
of banking

  if the government investigators were to ex-
amine our books at this moment jimmy said the
old man theyd find a position of affairs that
theoretically could land me in jail think of that
id rather not think of it dad said i the
things quite abnormal isnt it its out of all
relation to the actual loss

  of course it is its the result of cold feet-
dont you call it-among speculators in the stock
markets not a few men have been ruined to-day
who two or three days ago were worth considerable
fortunes theres nothing more unreasoning than
a scared investor or speculator its all madness-
stark madness coming home to dinner

  give me a minute to hand this over to the pat-
tern-maker and ill be with you

  we had a quiet dinner together at hazeldene
and my father approved of my plans

  i dont see what else you can do son said
he the thing is too big for ordinary detective

work im convinced youre on the right lines what
about finances

  im well in funds dad that mooring tackle
brings in enough in royalties to keep the sheds
going full swing even if they did not pay-which
they do thank you all the same dad

  thats all right then i depend on you to play
fair and let me stand my share of the expenses
mind that

  you shall have the gasoline account dad i
grinned at him i can see old milliken joy-riding
furiously at your expense

  ah my father said suddenly thats a good
man of yours jimmy-that milliken lord almeric
and his niece are greatly attracted to him

  by the by he went on i have asked them
both out here for the week-end i hope youll be
able to show them round your shops

  very glad

  and perhaps youll be able to spare a little time
from your work to look after miss torrance she
is very much a business girl but im sure shed like
to do a theatre or two-something like that
when i have the drafting done for the new
merlin ill be delighted

good i knew you would well i must do some
work son are you going back to the shops
must dad said i i want the men to have
a clear start in the morning good-night dad see
you at breakfast i hope im bunking down at the
shops but ill come over in the morning
half-past eight then good-night jimmy
next morning by the time i had breakfast with
the old man i had done enough work to let my
fellows get a clean start on laying down the keels
of three new merlins the drafting had taken me
and my assistant all night so when i had driven
my father down to the jetty and had seen him off
with didcot on the seven i turned in leaving
milliken in charge of the construction

  i slept until two oclock in the afternoon when
i was awakened by an s o s through the bank
from sir peter weatherly who had berthed the
pamassic in the morning and wanted the evidence
of dan and myself for the police it was a nuisance
but there was nothing for it but to take the seven
and get to the battery as soon as i could

encountering die police

i found dan and the old sailor being badgered
into a state of irritation by one of the government
investigators who could not accept the evidence
they had given him but wanted the very things
explained that everybody was puzzled about the
pair of them greeted my arrival like a couple of
lost pups-they both had that extraordinary likable
doggy quality you sometimes see in men-and
listened to my evidence with obvious relief i
imagine the investigator had badgered them into
thinking my version might possibly contradict their
own

  but its preposterous the investigator cried
three sane men can produce only a bare yarn
like that

  what sort of yam do you expect us to produce
i asked of course its preposterous from start
to finish its up to you to explain the pre-
posterousness

  the man was rattled a relic of the bad old days
the ark of the covenant	

of the police he found himself like the rest of us
against a blank wall and the fact annoyed him
he banged his fist on the table

   this is a case of collusion i he yelled

  ill give you one minute to get back your
sanity  told him if you cant do it in that time
my friends and i will quit

  quit will you he snarled if you say another
word ill have the three of you detained

   if you say another word like that said i ill
have you pushed out of the service for the damned
fool you are you get an account of this affair from a
man so distinguished at his job that his country
gives him one of its highest honours you get an-
other account from another man equally disting-
uished except for his age and a man trained in the
most exact observation as well ill say nothing of
myself finally except that until now my honesty
has never been questioned and you have the gall
to use such a word to us as collusion i as an in-
vestigator youre not only crudely impertinent-
youre a pitiful vulgar joke i

  why-why-you pup i you-you-skinny
mangy pup i he gasped livid with rage

  youre a judge of pups maybe the kennel you
came out of taught you that said i but it failed
to teach you how to investigate come on sir
peter come on danny

  there was no attempt to stop us and we got into
the street old sir peter took hold of my hand and
shook it nearly enough to take my arm from its
socket

  i congratulate you young man he cried
fifty years at sea and i never heard a man ticked
off like it before and only one casual cuss-word
in the whole recital thats the wonder of it i

  it was curious how the traditional dread of the
shipmaster for the police had got the better of the
dignified commander of the great liner and had re-
verted sir peter back to the innocent seadog put-
ting him at the mercy of a common bully but by
the time we had adjourned to the smoke-room of a
neighboring hotel the sailor was himself again

  i wont forget that mr boon he said that
fellow had got me so flummoxed that i thought i
had been in league with the pirates

  you ought not to have gone to the police bureau
at all sir peter i told him you should have re-
ceived all inquiries on your own deck

  i wish i had he breathed im at home
there-and even my king bless him couldnt order
me about

  i was mad at the treatment of my friends and
we went to the hotel stenographer who took down
a letter to the chief of police in which i ex-
plained that sir peter and dan had been treated
with extreme discourtesy and that apologies were
due to them they got letters of apology next
morning

  the incident however was symptomatic of the
exasperation and bewilderment the authorities were
experiencing the newspapers came out with the
most wonderful theories interesting enough to read
but not the least helpful to those whose job it was
to solve the problem of the raids the country was
gone over as it were with a fine sieve without the
slightest result the land and air police were bit-
terly attacked by the press and even the naval and
military authorities came in for condemnation as

time went on the old ground had keen furhed over
and the old facts redressed so often that the public
got sick of the affair and skipped any items in the
papers that referred to the raids but business con-
fidence remained badly shaken

  dan lamonts investigations of the gold tarnish-
ing resulted in his finding compounds of copper and
a hint of some radio-activity this seemed to me
absurd but it fired dannys enthusiasm since he
thought it indicated that the raiders had discovered
some enlargement of the science of radio-activity
as applied to the atomic theory he had the terriers
tenacity and he went after the thing from every
possible angle worrying the facts and himself until
he developed between his eyes a permanent furrow
of concentration he bored after an explanation of
the mysterious sleep too and discovered at least
one gas which if not lethal in its effect was tre-
mendously anaesthetizing in so far as it stunned the
olfactory senses properly it might have been called
a lachrymatory gas for its effect on the nose made
the eyes stream i

  the work on the three merlins meantime pro-

tessed rapidly at the workshops near gardiner

ay and i had time to devote to social obliga-
tions dan and i dined two or three times with
lord almeric and miss torrance and we all had
a golfing-flying party at hazeldene during a week-
end the workshops were inspected thoroughly
and milliken and miss torrance formed a curious
compact of friendship that had the effect of making
my mechanic go about with a ready grin on his
normally formidable countenance she petted him
shamefully and even flattered him into letting her
take the joy-stick of his beloved merlin nobody
could blame milliken for being enslaved-miss
torrance had a way of deserving any little service
one might do for her hazeldene and the workshops
were dull places for quite a while after she went
back to new york on the monday

louisville next i

the establishment at gardiner bay was not a
large one but it was fairly well equipped it had
a small foundry where we did all the castings for
the wings and body-work of our planes and of
course we had a moulding shed there was a
smithy with a good welding plant drawing-office
pattern-makers shop fitting shop and in addition
to our mooring-shed and landing-stage we had a
large field for landing with a one-bay hangar

  the only part of the work we did not do our-
selves was the building of our engines these came
from a little-known factory in which i had an in-
terest near pittsburgh its products were reliable
to a degree and beautifully finished developing a
great horse-power in ratio to their weight we
seated these engines ourselves on the machines we
constructed and we had our own notions of fuel
supply and cooling system

  with this small establishment working at top
speed we were able to have three merlins lying in
the fitting shop awaiting their engines by the
wednesday of the second week after the wall
street affair this last piece of assembling had to
wait it was all to our advantage that our power-
units should undergo the very strict tests that the
factory at pittsburgh considered necessary before
passing out any engine
	air wonder stories

  there was one thing that made the enforced
wait easier to bear i had more time to spend
with lord almeric and his niece their visit to
new york was nearing its end for lord almeric
had almost finished the work that had brought him
to america only a matter of business with the
treasury in washington remained to be seen to
before he returned to england miss torrance it
appeared was taking advantage of the trip to spend
some months in washington with relatives there
a piece of news that seemed pretty good to me
it sounded such a waste of time for a girl like her
to come to america for a fortnight washington
was less than an hour away for a machine like my
merlin

  we were having dinner together on the saturday
evening before going to a theatre my father was
there lord almeric of course dan lamont and
miss torrance i was telling her how easy it would
be for me or milliken to run down to washington
and take her back again if she wanted even a day
in new york she laughed at me

  there doesnt seem any end to your american
hospitality she said does there uncle
american hospitality said lord almeric is
the only thing known to work more than twenty-
four hours a day

  no but seriously miss torrance i insisted
i think it would be a real good plan just to wire
me if you wanted to come to new york boon
gardiner l i plane wanted torrance-just
that and within an hour milliken or i or didcot
would be fluttering down on the potomac

  as easy as that

  as easy as that said i and to show you how
easy it is im going to ask lord almeric to let me
carry you both to washington to-morrow may i
lord almeric

  my dear mr boon-you must not make us im-
pose on your good nature 

  but i had my way at seven oclock on the sun-
day evening milliken and myself took off from the
battery in the merlin with lord almeric and miss
torrance and some of their luggage soon after
half-past seven in the first-creep of dusk we sighted
the pale lights of the aerodrome and seaplane basin
on the potomac and by twenty to eight we had
landed our passengers

  dont forget miss torrance that there will al-
ways be a bus at your disposal whenever you want
to come to new york i said

  i wont forget mr boon good-bye and my
grateful thanks for many kindnesses she said
good-bye mr milliken remember that youre to
coach me for my pilots certificate

  milliken grinned that big grin of his

  ill remember miss torrance he said it
wont take you long

  good-bye mr boon said lord almeric i
shall see you on my return to new york good-
bye milliken best wishes for the success of your
new machines

  they stepped into a government automobile that
was waiting for them and drove off

  funny how milliken sizes people up i never
thought of that and i sort of kicked myself for
having so blatantly offered the use of a bus

  dad fetch it milliken i grumbled whats
the good of making friends only to lose them i

dont even know her address it seemed inquisitive
to ask

   thats all right mr boon said milliken cheer-
 fully shes a niece of the president everybody
 knows his telephone number

  the white house how did you know

   she told me coming along i have to send her
a copy of your book on flying

   why didnt she ask me tor one id have had
one specially bound for her-

   milliken looked at me queerly

   maybe thats why she asked me to get her one
 mr boon shes a very independent young lady

   we lockcd the merlin up in a private shed it
was the only way i could induce my mechanic to
leave her and come with me to an hotel though
the machine was fully protected in the matter of
patents after dinner we both went along to look
up a man in the air department and spent the re-
mainder of the evening talking shop we got back
to our hotel at a late hour and went to bed

   i was awakened at eight oclock in the morning
 by a negro bell-hop bringing me a cup of tea

   papeh suh he said theys bin anuthuh of
them bank robbin businesses down at louahville
suh-ma home town as wuz them robbers is shoh
the piratinest white men ah evah see-

   he handed mean extra edition that still smelled
 of wet printing ink and across the front page in
 staring letters ran this announcement

the parnassic trick pulled on louisville i
town pot to sleep while four bulks are robbed

mysterious radium gifts appear again

   i jumped out of bed and ran into millikens room

   milliken milliken the raiders have been at
it again down at louisville this morning

   milliken who was shaving himself with an old-
 fashioned razor turned and looked at me calmly

   gracious jinks he said-and went on shaving

chapter vii
to louisville

 for a space i gazed at my mechanic in silence and
 nothing was to be heard but the whisper of the
 razor on his stubby beard he wiped the soap
 from the blade and turned

   when do we start for louisville he asked

   as soon as we have had breakfast i said as casu-
 ally-he was not going to pull off any quiet surprise
 on me

   we were down at the seapiane-basin by nine and
 after filling the merlins tanks took off just after the
 hour we gave her plenty of gas and covered the
 eight hundred kilometres to louisville in an hour and
 forty minutes

   it was useless attempting to get near the robbed
 banks for the streets were thronged with people packed
 tight and deep i went right to the headquarters of the
 air police where there was a chance that i might be
 known and was lucky enough to find the local com-
 mander an enthusiastic supporter of the aeronautical
 research society of which i was an office-holder

   the raid on louisville was simply the wall street
 and newark affair on a smaller scale the sleep had
 come upon the police and the watchmen at two oclock
 in the morning and the strong-rooms of the banks had
 been cut open by the same means as that used in new
the ark of the covenant	

york gold to the amount of a million dollars had
been taken from the four banks with securities to an
amount not stated but these last had been found at
the post office in two envelopes addressed to local
hospitals the hospitals also were the recipients of a
box of radium each smaller than but otherwise iden-
tical with those left in the new york post office

  the robbed banks might roughly be put in groups of
two the national bank of kentucky and the fidelity
and columbia trust in main street and the citizens-
union national and the louisville trust in fifth
street it might have been possible for the raiders to
have effected their anaisthetizing with two bombs such
as i had imagined had been dropped in new york but
though i looked for the smears of glass as best i could
in the dense crowd i was disappointed

  a feature of this raid was that the post office had
been affected by the anasthetic doubtless because it
stood across the way in fourth street from a large
grocery establishment from which a quantity of com-
estibles has been abstracted in this food-store messrs
shapp  zort money had been left to pay for the goods
as in the case of schombergs in newark

  when we arrived the news had just come through
that a gasoline container down the ohio to the west
was showing a deficiency of fifteen hundred litres of
aviation spirit the sequence of coincidence was
complete

  can you give me any information about the street
cars that were running at the time of the raid  i asked
the air police commander

  there are not many cars run on sunday evening
but the few that were out were stopped-notably one
down fourth street to the levee he replied the
driver in falling took his hand off the safety lever
which of course automatically brought the car to a
standstill

  what about any automobiles

  we can only find three that were in the affected dis-
tricts and they seem to have been stopped in some
way quite unfathomable

  what sort of patrols had you up at the time com-
mander

  only one scout who had been out towards the
cumberlands on patrol during the time of the raid
he came back in the ordinary way at half-past four
having seen nothing to report in fact he was filling
in his sheet when the news came of the robberies i
immediately called out the other scouts and three of
them went up i then radioed the news to all stations-
a general call-but so far there is no trace of the
raiders

  could you find me some one who was doped i
asked him

  i think i could put my hand on a land cop he
said

  we went to the police station and found a man who
had been on duty in the affected area during the night
his story was exactly similar to that of my new york
friend mcgrath-no noise to startle nor any smell-
there might have been a faint luminosity he couldnt
say

  had you any gold about you while you were on
duty i asked him

  i have an old gold dollar i keep in my ticket pocket
for luck he said why sir

  would you mind letting me see it

  he went over to the side of the cot on which he
had been lying when we entered the station dormitory

and took the dollar out of the little pocket in front of
his tunic

  well im durned he exclaimed the things
gone rusty

  i expected it would be said i thanks very
much

  my commander friend was rather astonished at
what he thought was acumen on my part and as we
went down to the levee i told him a few facts about
the new york raid

  this is a big thing mr boon he remarked as we

stepped out on the levee its a national affair-

  i answered without much thought

  i shouldnt be surprised if it became an international
affair

  international-hey he broke off as he saw the
merlin say mr boon is that your plane

  thats her my latest model the merlin said i
with some pride

  shes the prettiest thing-and looks fast

  she is fast fast as lightning and i told him
about her

  well mr boon he said hurry up and sell a
copy or two to the air police if all you think about
these pirates is true we can do with a few like her
after a close inspection of the plane we said good-
bye and milliken and i took off up the river heading
for pittsburgh we wanted to see about our new
engines

  it was one oclock when we left louisville and we
made the suburb of the steel town shortly after two

  while we inspected the engines a boy was sent out
to bring us in a quick lunch which milliken and i ate
as we made our inspection the engines were splendid
and the charts of their tests showed a wide margin of
efficiency they were ready to be crated for their
journey i got an idea and turned to milliken

  say milliken i said why dont we-

  -take them with us he finished with a grin i
was just thinking what a pity it was to leave them to
the mercy of the railroads

  can she do it 

  can she do it milliken repeated scornfully
huh

  the job presented no great difficulty we unshipped
the limousine top of the merlin then laid stout battens
across the floor of the cabin the three engines were
brought one after the other on a traveling crane into
the boat-shed and were lowered into the open cabin
to preserve our flying balance we had to bring them
forward almost up against the pilots seat the job
was over and the top replaced by four oclock and we
set off for long island six hundred kilometres away

a serious conference

as we passed over the northern spurs of the alle-
ghanies dotted with little towns and hamlets it
seemed to me with all my thoughts on the raids that
it was not beyond possibility that a camouflaged airship
shed could be concealed among their woods and valleys
there were spaces wide enough sparsely inhabited
where the secrecy of such a base could be preserved for
a good length of time sufficient-except for accident
at any rate-to enable the raiders to carry out quite
a number of operations before making their get-away

  remembering the wide areas of thinly populated land
in this modern america even within a few hours
striking distance of the crowded eastern states it
came to me that the hunt for the lair of the marauders


air wonder stories

could easily be a long one it was amazing to think
that the airship could so easily descend on a town
without observation and vanish so to speak in thin
air in none of the raids so far had there been any
reliable story of the vessel having been seen-except for
the dream of the besotted finn klenski there had
been the usual crop of lies fantastic enough to defeat
themselves but the clear unstrained evidence of the
credible witness was lacking

  although none of the raids had been attended by
loss of life there was something terrible in the silent
approach in the middle of the night the uncanny power
of robbing all waking folks of consciousness in the
rapid operations in the dead quiet and in the stealthy
retreat when the work was done it did not need the
recollection of the first sight of the helpless parnassic
to make ones hair prickle at the thought of the mar-
velous potency in the hands of creatures more definitely
malign than the raiders had shown themselves

  as i thought of these things a whimsical notion
came to me and i turned to milliken

  i wonder if they use the boon double silencer
i said

  shouldnt be surprised he returned picking up my
thought with that queer quickness of his there was
a mechanic down at the louisville levee who had been
awake all night he never heard the slightest hum

  was he out of doors during the time of the raid
at all

  yes

  and saw nothing

  not a thing

  did you ask him if he looked up at the sky

  no i didnt bother he was an air mechanic i
tell you

  i had to grin at millikens sparing way of making
enquiries he knew too well that an air mechanic
would be sure to glance up at the wind indicator and
every now and then look for any change in the weather

  funny thing if theyre using my silencer i said

  huh said milliken and i had to guess whether
he agreed or otherwise with my sense of the curious

  we made gardiner bay before six oclock and turned
all hands on to unloading the new engines we
shunted them through the sheds on the overhead elec-
tro-magnets and deposited them each to its own bed
on the new planes ready for fitting milliken was not
content until he had the propeller and the engine cap
fixed on one of the buses just to get an idea of the
general effect

  pretty he said grudgingly quite pretty im
glad we gave them green bands though wouldnt like
the old girl to see them making free with her own
particular blue

  say milliken i protested dont get absolutely
stuck on the old girl as you call her were going to
design even a better bus yet

  he looked at me pityingly

  some people he remarked in a general sort of
way are like julius csesar they keep on bein am-
bitious till it busts them

  that i reminded him cruelly was pretty much
what you said when i first suggested the merlin to
you

  aw well said he with a half-ashamed grin the
merlins a peach then he broke off thankfully
heres your dad on the seven

  we went down to the jetty as the seven was brought
to and to my surprise the first person to step ashore

was not my father but lord almeric pluscarden

  hullo lord almeric i i said thought you were
in washington

  i have been in washington he smiled but i have
had to come back in a hurry your father kindly sent
the seaplane for me

  hullo jimmy my father broke in been to
louisville

  i nodded

  i thought youd go come along home to dinner
lord almeric and i have something to discuss with
you

  the three of us got into the roadster and soon were
sitting down to dinner at hazeldene there was a
touch of gravity in both my father and lord almeric
though they spoke without restraint discussing the
louisville affair very keenly

  the radium settles it said my father were up
against no ordinary crooks

  its a big thing i agreed

  theres some idea underlying the whole series
said lord almeric it is hopeless for your press to
attribute it all to a revival of the i w w idea men
who give gifts of radium to hospitals and research in-
stitutes are hardly of that kidney

  no said my father

  what would you say was the notion back of it
all i asked them

  heaven alone knows the old man burst out it
could not have come at a more awkward time we
have enough on our hands already-eh lord almeric
truly lord almeric nodded gravely

  i had better take my son into our confidence my
lord the old man said formally

  i agree it would be better

trouble brewing

the old man turned to me and gave me a keen
look

  jimmy he said quietly lord almeric will agree
with me that the world is ready to seethe over un-
less we can pull back in time we will be in a world
war again let me show you our situation here
japan over-populated in the most appalling fashion
is knocking at our door insistently wanting some of
our room the british dominions are closed to the
yellow immigrant and japan is prevented by the world
from getting all she wants in siberia and china that
pot is ready to boil over

take the european situation there is germany
snarling over new russia like a dog with a bone and-

your pardon lord almeric-

  not at all boon said lord almeric and britain
-ah-jimmy if i may take the privilege-britain
ready to fly at germanys throat because the bone is a
particularly juicy one

  poland too my father went on betrayed for the
second time in history by the european powers-and
by america who ought to have known better france
again hardly mended yet from the devastation of
- naturally sick at seeing a country in her debt
forging ahead of her ready to take up the sword
against her old enemy then theres that hotbed of
swaggering clashing nationalities the balkans each
new state more bumptious and aggressive than the
other i tell you jimmy if any lesson came out of
that war where you fought and which cost so much
in treasure and blood simply chucked away the world
has forgotten it
the ark of the covenant

 

  why on earth cant they all settle down with what
theyve got and do a bit of work i asked whats
at the root of it all 

  what is the root of all evil jimmy said lord
almeric

  thats it said my father money each nation
thinks the other is making more than itself and that
without working for it the great ciy is unfair com-
petition if one nation has the wit to think ahead
to take the right line of development to meet a coming
need in commerce its neighbor yells unfair com-
petition i 

  i know little of things international said i to
lord almeric except concerning my own line i
hope theres no chance of a row between your country
and ours sir

  no thank god theres that comfortable streak
in us both that makes us admire a successful rival in
trade rather than immediately want to cut his throat
the shopkeeping instinct if you like-but of value to
our sense of proportion but we may find ourselves
on opposite sides willy-nilly if some of the hot-heads
come to blows if america had to take a firm hand
with japan what could britain do if she sided with
japan she would alienate her overseas dominions who
will not have the jap on any consideration if we in
britain supported america we should endanger large
financial interests we have in the east we should
lay our eastern possessions at the mercy of the yellow
people for new china would be dragged in it is an
exceedingly complex situation jimmy and not one
that can be threshed out after dinner

  let me accept it as threshed out said i where
do you lord almeric and dad come into it 

  on the money side said the old man theres
lots of them that would like to fight but they cant do
it without money and there are numbers of people
asking for loans at the moment ostensibly for devel-
opment work we have to go very carefully lord
almerics mission in america has been for the forma-
tion of an understanding between britain and our
people as to how far we may go in this or that direc-
tion in our discussions-between an american group
of financial firms and banks and an english group as
represented by lord almeric-we have come upon a
new situation that may well upset the whole arrange-
ment it may lead us into a big war nominally through
one with japan

  good lord

  now lord almeric has to get to london in quick
time to put the case before his people there can be
no question of cabling it we did not want you to

work in the dark-

  i dont mind working in the dark dad you want
me to get lord almeric to england 

  youve got it jimmy i have pledged lord almeric
my word that you will get him to london by some
means or other by saturday

  i wondered if you could put me aboard some ship
reaching southampton on friday morning said lord
almeric i am ashamed to throw myself into your
hands so helplessly-but your father insisted

  dad was quite right lord almeric said i youd
be leaning on a broken reed to try the transatlantic
aviation their weekly plane doesnt leave until friday
morning and it would be the early hours of monday
morning before you reached london clumsy brute
-for all its four engines

  i thought perhaps you could overtake the thessalic

or the purlhalia said his lordship

  let me see i searched for a shipping list

  the thessalic sailed on friday night and is due to
reach southampton next friday morning the pur-
thalia left last night sunday and reaches southampton
next sunday morning so she washes out

  suppose we started to-morrow the thessalic will
be over three days out more when we reach her
lord shell be well over three thousand kilometres
out when we overtake her i might as well fly you
all the way sir

  but surely that would be unnecessary-i could not
think-

  dont you see sir the whole distance is under
six thousand kilometres i should have to fly about
seven thousand on the double journey to the ship and
back i had better fly you the whole way it will give
me time to put the merlin in first-class order anyhow
ill have to ship new tanks for extra oil and gasoline
will the merlin do it the old man asked

  you bet you dad in thirteen hours we leave
here on thursday evening before dinner and we reach-
battersea aerodrome at one oclock on friday allowing
for the difference in time how will that do lord
almeric 

  splendid i i cannot find words to thank you jimmy

-or you boon-you overwhelm me with kindness-

  we wont say anything about that said my father
gruffly will we son

surely not said i ill be glad to give the merlin
such a good test all you have to do lord almeric is
to regard yourself as so much make-weight cargo
heaven forbid lord almeric laughed you
might find it necessary to jettison me

  id jettison the merlin first i blundered redden-
ing at my apparent rudeness to a man so courteous

  heaven forbid that too said lord almeric the
sea police might arrest us in midair for having no
visible means of support

  he put an arm on my shoulder and we went to the
billiard room where his lordship conscientiously col-
lected a nice selection of the boon dollars by thoroughly
beating my dad and me at pool and snooker i went
to bed early for i intended to get some work done
before breakfast and left my elders trying trick shots

  i was just dropping off to sleep when my father
came into my room

  hullo dad i said whats the matter
  nothing much-just wanted to say good-night son
  good-night dad-

  you know jimmy he said slowly im tickled to

death with my own son-

  thats funny dad i sat up to say i was just
thinking i was sort of proud of my own father

  oh said he well-good-night jimmy
  good-night dad

across the atlantic

the next two days were spent in fixing the engines
in the new merlin and in making tests of them
milliken and i were in the air a good deal trying all
sorts of fool tricks to prove the design no good but
we could find no fault in it we had a winner all
right

  in the meantime the old merlin was being tuned up
-not that she needed much tuning-and the work of
putting in the extra tanks for the atlantic flight went
ahead	

  lord almerics luggage was brought over by didcot
	air wonder stories

on the seven and everything was put in order we
rigged up a pair of collapsible bunks from the side
walls of the cabin so that our passenger could sleep if
he wanted to and so that milliken and i could lie down
in our off spells then we had a little vacuum-box
for hot food and everything necessary for feeding
in comfort

  at seven oclock on the thursday evening we said
good-bye to my father and dan lamont who had come
over to see us off and to a great rah-rah i from the
staff of the workshops we shot off across the bay the
merlin quietly picking up into her cruising speed of
four-fifty kilometres an hour

  the weather report had given warning of low storms
off the coast and we climbed high to ride over them
so there was not much to see below us at three thou-
sand odd metres up we came into a side wind from the
north fairly strong which must have given us a lot of
drift but the merlin was flying easy and there was
no pitching to speak of

  milliken relieved me at eight and i joined lord
almeric in some food for we had not dined before
leaving he was a charming companion who talked
interestingly and had the knack of making one talk
as well it seemed that there were few corners of the
earth he had not visited and his outlook on life was
correspondingly wide there was nothing insular about
him with his open collar and its old-fashioned broad
silk cravat of the shape the english call ascot he
looked what he was a very distinguished englishman
of the best type but the curious thing was that he
appeared as much at home in the cabin of the merlin
as he would have been in his own library

  when i spelled milliken so that he could have some-
thing to eat lord almeric continued his talk with him
charming my mechanic into an unwonted loquacity it
was gently done and it had its reward for milliken
when he did talk talked very much to the purpose
over my shoulder i heard more of millikens life laid
bare to lord almeric in half an hour than i had got
from the mechanic in the years we had been working
together

  now if youll excuse me sir i heard milliken
say by and by ill just chuck some of this stuff over-
board and wash up

  let me bear a hand said lord almeric you
wash and ill wipe i

  if it comes to that sir said milliken you wash
and ill wipe i know better than you do where to
stow

  good this the grease remover lord almeric
had taken off his jacket

  thats the stuff sir and heres a dish-cloth

  a rush of cold air at this moment made me turn
round milliken had pried up the hatch with a fork
through the ring and was scraping the refuse through
the opening

  all the world is my garbage can which with this
fork i will open lord almeric laughed

  ah said milliken thats old pistol isnt it

  slightly amended-

  they fell to discussing shakespeare and by the time
they had finished their chores and were lying down
on the bunks on the opposite sides of the gangway
they were pooh-poohing the bacon-shakespeare theory
they then fell to talking of dry-points and etchings
i could not help thinking the subjects curious common
ground for a great banker and a fine mechanic to
meet on

  milliken relieved me at midnight our time and i
took my turn on the bunk

  where are we now jimmy asked lord almeric
sleepily

  just clearing the newfoundland bank we should
be-four hundred odd kilometres west a point or two
south of cape race

  splendid murmured his lordship and fell asleep
an example i proceeded to follow

  it was bright day when i woke to relieve milliken
four oclock by our timepiece and about seven in the
longitude we were passing

  passed the purthalia about fifteen minutes back
said milliken id say a hundred kilometres to the
north

  then weve drifted a bit but not so much as i
expected

  ah-hah  he yawned wind shifted round about
two-blew us back again

  he fetched me a cup of coffee and then turned in

  two hours later ireland came up like a smudge of
blue smoke on the horizon to port and a few minutes
later the lizard widened out into the spear-head of
cornwall and devon

  i can never fly high over england i love to see the
patchwork of fields the dark purple of her woods and
the tiny white ribbons of her roads the slender threads
of silver that mark her waterways i had to come
down close enough to get the shape of her red roofs
all the jolly homey villages nestling in wooded hol-
lows or sprawled over low downs each with its church
spire or tower rising from a patch of green green
sward white speckled with the headstone above her
ancient dead it was april in england then

a night in london

there was no time to saunter but i wanted to
we had to get our passenger into london by one
oclock english time lord almeric was astir and
had made an astonishingly neat toilet he was drink-
ing coffee

  this is the first time i have been robbed of five
hours in a day he said i am certain i shall order
eggs and bacon at lunch from force of habit

  big ben on parliament house chimed out the quarter
to one as we dropped into the basin at battersea and
before he spoke again at the hour we were stepping
into the taxi that was to take us to lord almerics
house in knightsbridge but i dont think that mil-
liken was very easy in his mind that the merlin was
safe even in the lock-up shed in which she was berthed

  lord almeric would not hear of either milliken or
myself going to an hotel he insisted that we make
his house our own milliken tried hard to refuse but
his lordship effectually stopped all protest he led
us to a little nest of rooms not separate from the house
but somehow possessing an individuality-if one may
use the word-of their own he opened the door of
a tidy mannish sitting-room

  i had a boy at one time jimmy he said quietly
he was killed at messines these are his rooms-
just as they used to be when he lived in them noth-
ing has been touched though my servants keep them
warmed and aired there are two bedrooms and a
bathroom-through there-and another living-room i
have had them made ready for you both i shall be
very very glad if you and milliken will occupy them
while you remain in london

  i heard a joint in millikens hand crack softly as his
the ark of the covenant

fist clenched

  my only fear is that i shall be a poor host lord
almeric went on my time will be much occupied
as you will understand jimmy-in fact i must be
back in harness at once i have a conference in the
city at three and other in westminster at six i
question if i shall be back until late at night my
people will attend to all your wants and will serve
your meals here if you should think of going to a
theatre im certain that milliken would like the pro-
duction of twelfth night at the haymarket bunter
my butler will get tickets for you now i must go
pray excuse me i shall hope to see you to-night

  he went out leaving us there milliken and i looked
at each other in silence for a space

  i didnt want to stop in his lordships house mr
boon milliken said slowly but when he asks us
to use his dead boys rooms he gives me the one thing
i couldnt refuse it must mean a lot to him-this

  you bet you milliken

  and i thought lords and such-like all bunk i that
one he nodded to the closed door- that one makes
me see ive been a fool

  we bathed and changed and lunch was brought to
us in another of the rooms the butler appeared to
see if we were all right and we let him get tickets
for us

  can you tell me i asked him where i might find
files of the london daily papers for a week or two
past 

  in the small library downstairs sir we keep files
of the times morning post and telegraph and of a
number of the financial journals may i show you
the room sir

  please

  i found that the london press had treated the new
york raids in daily reports that never got over half a
column the parnassic had the honor of a full column
on the first day and dwindled to half a column on the
next while the ivestbury was squeezed into twelve
lines louisville was almost crowded out by two pages
of parliamentary crisis and a long murder trial that
which had taken all america by the ears seemed to
matter little in england it was according to a note
in the times purely an american concern

  we saw nothing of lord almeric until late at night
when we found him waiting for us to arrive from the
theatre we sat for an hour or two round the fire in
his sitting-room yarning and drinking some of the
best whiskey i have ever tasted it must have been
close on one oclock in the morning when we went
to bed

           chapter viii
           a raid on london

somewhere in the house a telephone bell was
ringing insistently it rang in long peals and
just when i would think it had stopped for good
it would begin again more furiously than ever i put
my hand under my pillow for my watch then switched
on the light over my head it was half-past three
the bell still shrilled through the house then came
the sound of a door opening and the bell was stopped
by the murmur of a voice presently came the shuffling
of feet and somewhere nearer at hand another voice
took up the murmuring there was silence again
firm footsteps now came masterfully to my door and
a knock

  yes come ini i cried



  the handle turned and lord almeric entered
wrapped in a dressing-robe

  something has happened at the bank he said
good heavens sir i exclaimed you dont
think-

  im inclined to think it is-our friends of the
parnassic-or others of the tribe

  but-but in london its incredible sir

  we live in an incredible age jimmy would you
like to come with me to the city im going there at
once

  sure ill come said i and jumped out of bed
while i was dressing lord almeric had gone off
to give orders for his car and to dress milliken ap-
peared in my doorway

  anything the matter mr boon he asked

  i told him

  jinks he said want me with you

  not unless youre keen to come-

  im not said he shortly

  very well then if i dont get back by breakfast
time go over to battersea by yourself hire what
mechanics you want for the merlin and get her over-
hauled have you any british money

  oh yes didcot changed a hundred dollars for me
in new york is it two and a half of these florin
things to the dollar

  as near as doesnt matter two florins and eight
pennies are more like the sum

  all right iu get back to bed

  and he did with no further comment

  there was little stir about the streets as we sped
citywards except for great trucks of fruit and
vegetables the big horses pulling them plodding along
sagaciously with little or no guidance from drowsy or
even sleeping drivers the asphalted streets were wet
from recent washing and here and there we came upon
sweeping machines with their wide rotary brushes
working anglewise to the gutters now and then we
would pass a solitary policeman or a pair of them
their rubber capes glistening under the street lamps
even this slight activity slackened by the time we
reached the strand then we came to fleet street
where the newspaper offices were ablaze with light

  they have not received the news yet lord almeric
said softly if they had you would see the reporters
streaking towards st pauls like hornets from a
nest

  we whizzed up ludgate hi and passed under the
shadow of st pauls the city was like a place of
the dead

  it looks like the stillness of an actual raid lord
almeric i whispered

  yes-but the city is always like this at night
thronged during the day and a jam of traffic-but
like herculaneum for stillness after eight oclock
at the corner of the mansion house a policeman
stopped the car and peered in at us flashing his torch
when he saw lord almeric he saluted and waved us
on policemen were streaming into the open space in
front of the royal exchange we pulled up outside
the bank of england and a policeman opened the door
of the automobile a white-faced inspector met us
inside the building and he was immediately joined by
a subaltern of one of his majestys footguards-the
coldstream i think it was this officer was as white-
faced as the policeman but keeping a stiff upper lip in
spite of his obvious misery

  this is a bad business my lord said the inspector
	air wonder stories

the bank of england robbed

  lord almeric nodded and turned to the young
guardsman

  youre guy pennefether arent you he asked
  yes lord almeric

  permit me to introduce a friend of mine mr james
boon mr guy pennefether-inspector trueman
now let us go to your quarters pennefether youll
come also inspector you shall tell me quietly what
has happened then we shall inspect the damage

the guardsmans tale

mthere isnt much to tell lord almeric said
x the young fellow when we had reached one of
the rooms occupied by the officers of the nightly guard
this was a neat little mahogany-panelled dining-room
in the heart of the building

  sit down pennefether and compose yourself
lord almeric said kindly you too inspector i
dont wonder you are shaken jimmy find a seat for
yourself please

  i took a chair near the table that stood in the middle
of the room

  now mr pennefether

  i havent much to say lord almeric we took
over at the usual time the sentries were mounted in
the usual way inspected changed all according to
orders nothing unusual happened until half-past mid-
night when my sergeant came into the room here with
me after doing the rounds i had asked him some-
thing about one of the men in my platoon-as a matter
of fact it was about his chance of winning the cruiser-
weight championship of the brigade-when suddenly
sergeant withers stopped speaking whats the
matter withers  i said he blinked at me nothing
sir nothing he said something passed over me-
queerlike then something queer told hold of me i
began to see the sergeant as through a haze he got
further and further away his voice becoming fainter-
then be seemed to crumple up-like a concertina i
dont remember anything more    until i woke up

  i had fallen asleep or become unconscious spread
across the table and still sitting in the chair  my
watch was in front of me-and to my horror it pointed
to a quarter to three i had been asleep for a full two
hours i got up in a hurry to make for the door when
i stumbled across my sergeant who was lying stretched
on the floor i

  a moment mr pennefether i said what metal
is your watch

eh oh gold-gold-a little plain watch i wear

with my uniform-

  may i see it please

  it is still lying on the table beside you there-urder
that paper

  i found it and turned it over i nodded to lord
almeric

  tarnished i said

ah said lord almeric go on pennefether
naturally i was bewildered i stooped over
withers and shook him he woke up without effort
and presently was on his feet stammering out
excuses   

  the rest of the young guardsmans story was as we
expected he had rushed out into the corridor and
had found all his men fast asleep his sentries fallen
at their posts with their rifles beside them his next
thought was for the vaults the big steel doors had
been cut open and the interior of the vaults were strewn

  with the wreckage of cases

  in the matter of the bank of england the inspector
could bring up no new point he had been wakened
by one of his men having fallen asleep without any
premonitory symptoms and on going his rounds he had
found all his points asleep or on the verge of waking
he had joined mr pennefether at the vault door but
he told us that three of the joint stock banks in old
broad street had been forced open and their strong-
rooms cleared

  our friends hold to their thorough methods said
lord almeric to me there is a scope in their ras-
cality that takes the breath away

  he turned to the young officer of the guards

  it is useless to beg you not to be concerned penne-
fether he said gently that you must inevitably be
but i beg you-and you also inspector-to be rid of
the idea that you are in any way culpable you could
not have foreseen this event nor could you have helped
yourselves if you had the blame if any attaches to
me i should have taken steps to protect the bank
from this outrage come-let me see the extent of
the damage

  in the bank premises everything was scrupulously
neat and tidy until we came to the vault door and that
had a section cut through it it was big enough for
lord almeric to go through and i followed him

  they have not been greedy said he they have
taken only a million pounds sterling jimmy-and have
left the remainder now let us see how they have
treated our securities

  he turned to a side-door which also had been treated
with the flame inside the room was a heap of mould-
ering papers and from this there rose a pungent smell
the papers were securities and they had been destroyed
beyond recognition by having had acid poured over
theml

  the wantonness of it  cried lord almeric the
sheer damned wanton uselessness of it ur-r-rl the
theft of the gold i can understand-but this-this
means months of work-chaos-endless useless bother
and vexation

  does it represent much money sir i ventured

  millions i cannot say how much it will be re-
coverable the greater part of it perhaps but when i
think of the complications-the damned messiness and
bother-ur-r-r

  he recovered himself quickly

  i beg your pardon jimmy im making an exhibi-
tion of myself-but the thing is so unpardonably stupid
come well go to my room and think this out

  your pardon lord almeric theres something
id like to do before the crowd gets about could you
put me in charge of a police officer while i go snooping
round to find out if the thing links up with wall
street

  why of course would you oblige me by taking
mr boon round inspector and seeing that he is not
interfered with

  very good my lord

conjectures

i went off with the inspector and got outside the
buildings i hunted round the streets about the
bank in comparative quiet the london police are
nothing if not efficient and they had drawn round the
district a cordon that was impassable only a few
civilians were about the streets

i found four star-shapped splatters of powdered
the ark of the covenant	

glass on the exchange side of the bank and two in a
sort of courtyard within the buildings they were
perfect in shape and showed me what the smears i
had found round wall street would have been but for
the crowds that had trampled them about we went
along old broad street and there i found traces of
the powdered glass three splashes opposite the robbed
banks i thought it would be a waste of time to do
anything further in the way of investigation i had
seen enough to convince me that it was the wall street
and pamassic gang or another allied in method my
next move i thought would be to get an ocean track
chart

  on my return to the bank i found lord almeric
closeted with a military-looking man alert and keen of
manner

  this is mr james boon sir thomas said lord
almeric general sir thomas basildon jimmy chief
of the criminal investigation department

  we shook hands

  i have wanted to meet you mr boon said the
newcomer kindly i have known your work for sev-
eral years-and admired it

  ttiats very kind of you sir are you the general
basildon who was connected with the british air
force

  i am

  then you have something in your old line here sir
thomas said i im willing to bet you already have
your air police out in full force scouring the air
towards the atlantic

  sir thomas nodded slowly and looked at me
keenly

  youre the man who first propounded the theory
that the american raids were carried out by aircraft
he asked

  cant claim that amount of credit sir it was just
the obvious sort of idea that must have come to a lot
of people together i said an airship because of cer-
tain difficulties of manoeuvring taking up the weight
of the stolen stuff the regular practice of stealing
gasoline

  let me say at once that i agree with you and that
i have taken a very serious view of the matter as it
might concern us here i wanted our people to adopt
the recent american plan of supplying gas-masks to
all guards on banks and to put up gas-proof glass ob-
servation cages at favorable points that was your
idea too he broke off

  no the suggestion for that came from a friend
of mine dan lamont sir

  ah yes mr dan lamont said sir thomas
well i wanted our people to adopt these measures
but they are slow to move-damnably slow they
were convinced that the raids were an american con-
cern the measures are being adopted after prolonged
discussion but they come too late as usual to be of
any service he laughed grimly we shall prob-
ably have the masks and the cages ready by the time
the raiders have been run to earth

if you think that you will have your scouts out
they have been in the air this last hour or so mr
boon replied said thomas with a smile i under-
stand from sir almeric that you have been on the
scene soon after each raid

  with the exception of the west bury yes

  there are some points on which i should like the

benefit of your experience mr boon-

  anything i can do sir-

  he questioned me shrewdly until i had covered the
ground of the whole raids down to the minutest detail
then when he had satisfied himself that he had ex-
hausted all my information he got lord almeric to
have an ocean track chart found for us and we pored
over it together

  it took the transatlantic companys airships a net
sixty hours from new york to london but a less
heavily-built machine might do it in fifty-odd adding
on the difference in time between the two cities brought
the time occupied to about sixty gross that is to
say if an airship with a cruising speed of about one-
thirty kilometres per hour had wanted to be over lon-
don just after midnight on friday she would have had
to leave her base on the american continent not later
than midday on the wednesday but the chances were
that to escape observation the departure in actual case
had been made in the dark of the early wednesday
morning

calculations

the louisville raid happened on sunday night and
monday morning and it was likely that the air-
ship had made her base either in the dark of the mon-
day morning or on monday night leaving louisville
about four after the raid it would be six before she
reached any likely base in the alleghanies and by that
time the farm folks would be about on their morning
chores the vessel could hardly escape being seen in
the light at six oclock this brought us back to the
notion of a base at least twelve hours flight from
louisville and gave additional color to the theory of
a base over the canadian border probably in some
undeveloped district back of ontario

  to berth an airship on the monday evening and
to have her fitted out again for a raid across the
atlantic within thirty-odd hours was something of a
feat there was the unloading of the louisville haul
the refilling of the ballonets with gas the retuning of
the engines and the general tightening up and over-
hauling necessary for such an important voyage if
the raiders were using only one dirigible she was a
wonder of efficiency

  it was quite within possibility that they had two
machines for their operations and the three of us
discussing the situation in lord almerics room were
not inclined to dismiss the idea idly when we con-
sidered the daring which could conceive and carry out
raids on such a wide radius and the magnitude of the
organization behind the conception indeed it seemed
not too far-fetched an idea that the organization oper-
ated from bases in both the old world and the new
and that in imagining one solitary lair in ontario we
were seriously underestimating the power of this mys-
terious force

  there seemed to be neither rhyme nor reason in the
operations of several millions of pounds sterling in
gold lying in the bank of england the raiders had
abstracted merely one so lord almeric told us and
all the trouble that had been involved in forcing the
three joint stock banks had not yet been rewarded by
the finding of any gold but in each of these banks
there had been the same insensate destruction by acid
of thousands of pounds worth of bearer securities it
looked like the work of madmen impish destructive-
ness and senseless expenditure of energy why trouble
to force four banks when there was sufficient loot in
the most important

it might have been i suggested that they broke
	air wonder stories

open the broad street banks first were disappointed
of a haul from them and destroyed the securities out
of spleen then came onto the bank of england only
to find that there was more gold here than they could
get away with

  im afraid jimmy said lord almeric that that
explanation will not serve it is a matter of almost
daily news how much gold is deposited in the bank
here it is also common knowledge that the joint-
stock banks since the war have kept no reserve of gold
but have had a working arrangement with us

  these are not criminals in the ordinary sense said
sir thomas the distribution of the radium points
to that the care that has been exercised to preserve
life in the raids there is some idea as you have said
mr boon underlying it all and the future will prob-
ably show what the idea is we may regard this raid
as a demonstration of power an attempt to bring chaos
into the business world to upset values-some cranky
method of advertising an idea presently to be revealed
if i may be allowed to express what is merely an in-
tuition on my part i do not believe that these raiders
value even the gold they have taken they have mar-
velous power-marvelous but the vulnerable point
in any scheme of attack is its weakest link that is in
the air in this case i cannot believe that the scheme
of the raiders can be carried out with a dirigible we
have proved the vulnerability of the airship time and
again and it is on this point that we will get them i
shall not concern myself solely with looking for these
criminals or cranks on solid earth i will keep after
them in the air and by god-get them too-if they
are on my side of the globe 

and fears

tully for you general i couldnt help yell-
jd ing he spoke with such force i beg your
pardon

  not at all said he the best thing you can do
is to get back to america at your quickest speed and
pitch into the authorities there if the raiders are
operating from canada until measures are taken to
stop them the whole of your wealthy cities round the
great lakes are at their mercy-chicago buffalo de-
troit-and the coastal cities also-boston philadel-
phia washington make them see what you and i see
that if this menace is to be scotched they will need
aeroplanes fighting aeroplanes that can climb to five
thousand metres and more make them understand
that this is not any parochial question or national but
that it is for the world to face and beat for me i
shall strongly represent to our government that the
canadian authorities be asked to go over their ter-
ritory with the minutest search they can and i will
put the french police on their guard-and the ger-
mans-the germans-

  he broke off and eyed lord almeric queerly

  no my dear basildon said lord almeric i
can believe much of them but that they would leave
so many millions of the gold they so badly want be-
hind them-no

  a blind

  not they they are incapable of the sacrifice
humph perhaps youre right-perhaps youre
right though by george theyve got the ships-and
you never know but what they have the gas im
certain that they have never stopped their research
think again basildon-think again would the
matter of a few americans or englishmen asphyxiated

deter brother german from using poison gas if he
had conceived the idea of these raids

  they want something better than their zeppelins
to get across the atlantic with sir thomas said i
and besides how about housing them once they were
in america 

  we i relinquish the idea sir thomas said i
shall put the french-and the germans-on the qui
vive if london this week why not paris or berlin
the next

  why not lord almeric agreed

  br-r-r and this damned government to move into
action pah think of it pluscarden the solemn
idiots sitting all night through to this very morning de-
bating a reduction of the air estimates-while this is
happening practically at the other end of the street
i wish to heaven the raiders had given them a whiff
of the gas-the prosy pusillanimous pompous pin-
headed-

  it is hard to say how far sir thomas would have
got with his alliteration if the telephone bell had not
rung just then smiling at his friend in spite of
the gravity of the situation lord almeric picked up
the receiver

  yes he said into the microphone sir thomas is
here scotland yard for you basildon

  ah good  said sir thomas we may have some
news

basildon gets his wish

sir thomas basildon took the receiver from
lord almeric and sat on the desk to talk into the
instrument

  yes ferguson-basildon speaking he said eh
ah yes well i half expected that army and navy
stores aha-that too eh just a minute fer-
guson he turned to us

  the things complete a petrol station at purfleet
-the anglo-american oil company-reports a de-
ficiency of six thousand litres of petrol and the whole
establishment put to sleep the army and navy stores
in victoria street have been forced open and a large
quantity of foodstuffs taken away money being left

now ferguson-

  he turned to the mouthpiece again and almost im-
mediately an incredulous look passed over his face

  no he shouted dont pull your chiefs leg
ferguson-it isnt done tell me again with their
faces blackened  well im damned

  he burst into a roar of laughter shaking shaking
until lord almeric and i sprang up in alarm soldiers
have given way to hysterics in the midst of a great
nervous strain before and i thought the general had
an attack i dont know what lord almeric thought
but he evidently considered the laughter a little ill-
timed

  no no im all right really-im not unstrung
gasped sir thomas the raiders did gas the com-
mons this morning-and every man jack on the treas-
ury bench woke up with his face blackened blackencd
by george-with burnt cork

  what cried lord almeric you arent serious
basildon

  serious as cholera said sir thomas ferguson
has just told me-and hes too solemn to joke on any
subject

  there was no help for it lord almeric tried hard
to keep his face straight but he couldnt-and presently
he and the general were lying back helpless in chairs
the ark of the covenant	

laughing till tears streamed down their faces i thought
it funny enough but their laughter got me more than
the joke

  confound it basildon said lord almeric mop-
ping his eyes the things farcical it couldnt have
been the raiders-surely not i

  must have been pluscarden boxes of radium were
left beside the mace addressed to some ot our research
institutions the things conclusive

  it might have been one of the opposition who woke
up first and snatched the opportunity to make the front
bench look ridiculous it is enough to wreck the gov-
ernment

  might have been that sir thomas chuckled and
i hope it does wreck the government we may get
the die-hards back again thank god

  let us hope so basildon well there is little use
in remaining here we can do nothing until the clerks
turn up when we can go through the books heavens
what a mess said lord almeric i think a ride
home and a bath then early breakfast is the idea
let us go jimmy

  just let mr boon show me those splashes of pow-
dered glass pluscarden sir thomas said and im
with you could you drop me at scotland yard if i
send my car on  i want to talk to you on the way
surely said his lordship ill pick you up out-
side

  there was no great crowd in the streets yet for it
was barely six oclock but sir thomas no sooner ap-
peared than he was surrounded by newspaper men
who wanted a statement

  i cant give you any statement yet sir thomas
protested yes-yes you can say i believe it to be
the work of the pamassic gang that must be obvious
i shall issue a general statement when i get back to
scotland yard i must treat you all alike

  they fell away from him but watched him from a
distance and when we had finished looking at the
smears of glass and had gone on i saw them gather
round the spot and examine the powder closely

  glass bombs i agree-probably containing the gas
in liquid form said sir thomas i wonder what
it is

  the newspaper men were still hanging round the
smears when the three of us drove away in lord
almerics automobile

  i must have those policemen sent away said sir
thomas when we had passed through the cordon which
was holding a small crowd back from the area which
had been gassed it is nothing but a waste of time
he and lord almeric talked earnestly enough as we
made our way to the west end but though they did
not exclude me from the conversation it was of stuff
that was greek to me and i was more interested in
the wakening streets i should like to have seen how
fleet street was taking the event but we went down
a street which brought us out on the embankment by
blackfriars bridge passing the building that during
the war was known as adastral house where i had
tried to get into the british flying corps by swearing
i was a british citizen they wouldnt have me be-
cause of my age i was only a kid then the build-
ing now seemed to be the offices of some commercial
firm i remembered my chagrin at being turned down
by the british authorities though they were extraor-
dinarily kind to me and looking back at that time i got
a-tingle all over to think that i was taking a lively
part in an affair pretty night as exciting as the war i

had wanted so much to get into

  it made me smile to think of the intense awe i
should have had for the general in those days or even
for lord almeric kind as he was a mighty queer
set of happenings thought i that brought me to be
sitting in a limousine with the chief of the british
c i d and the deputy governor of the bank of
england

  we dropped sir thomas basildon at new scotland
yard passing through the courtyard into whitehall

  you must permit me to worry you a trifle more
mr boon said sir thomas as he stepped from the
automobile i want you to recount your experiences
to some of my men may i ring you up at lord
almerics-or no-let us fix the time at twelve-thirty
to-day and perhaps i may be able to snatch a minute
or two to sec your new plane-what dye call it-the
merlin-ii i may be allowed

  delighted sir said i twelve-thirty then
here

  here he replied ask for me at this door theyll
bring you straight up

  as we turned into whitehall i caught a glimpse of
crowds in parliament square

  surely the senate-the parliament isnt still sit-
ting i asked lord almeric

  no he smiled i expect theyve gone home by
now but you know what crowds are they will hang
around parliament square for hours in the vain hope
that they will see somebody who has had his face
blackened and they will give a circumstantial account
of how nearly they accomplished it years after

one-third the suns speed

we reached lord almerics house in knights-
bridge about half-past six milliken was no-
where to be seen i looked about for a servant and
found the one who had opened the door yawning on
the landing

  do you know where mr milliken has gone i
asked

  no sir he must have slipped out early before
the ouse was properly astir sir-if he has gone said
the man with an air of suspicion

  very well said i

  i guessed that my mechanic had gone down to begin
work on the merlin so i had a bath and presently
joined lord almeric at breakfast

  what plans have you for to-day jimmy asked
his lordship

  first i shall cable my father and get him to begin
the campaigns against the raiders so that a cordon of
scouts can be drawn round the coast to-night then
i will have to attend to the merlin i propose starting
for america at ten to-morrow so as to arrive before
dark

  bless me how on earth can you do tliat

  i leave at ten from here and taken thirteen hours
to make long island nominally eleven oclock at night
-but as a matter of fact it will be six oclock amer-
ican time when i arrive i get back the five hours
we lost coming here

  i had forgotten that said lord almeric with a
smile one of these days you young men will be
beating time itself

  ah said i weve got to fly at about thirteen
hundred kilometres per hour to beat time across the
atlantic from east to west

good god he cried you dont mean to say
	air wonder stories

youve reckoned it out

  why not i grinned at him when i started
flying ninety miles an hour was thought good going-
thats a hundred and forty-four kilometres my mer-
lin does three and a half times that speed five hundred
odd-which is more than a third of sun speed
jimmy said his lordship i give you up you
are too much for me tell sir thomas basildon that
when you see him to-day will you 

  all right sir

  he made for the door where he turned

  good morning jimmy said he then do you
think it will ever be done

  why not shells do it we might find a new
principle of flight

  he went out shaking his head

  i finished breakfast and went down to battersea
where i found milliken with half a dozen mechanics
busy over the merlin

  hullo milliken i said where did you get to
this morning

  here said he knew that the sooner i got on
the job the better seeing that well be going back
to-morrow shes in fine trim though-and as sound
as a bell

  good did you have any breakfast 

  theres a quick-breakfast counter and hot-dog cabin
in the street on the other side of the bridge said
milliken but they dont sell any fruit

   e means a cawrfee stall sir one of the mechanics
explained

   i get that

  were goin to take im round the corner presently
wen we knocks off to a chop-ouse ell get a real
breakfis there but e wont get no dog or fruit-
cqt the sossidges might be dog-and a banana
when the mechanics had gone taking milliken with
them to the chop-ouse i got off my coat and jacket
and went over the bus as milliken had said she was
as sound as a bell i worked with the men until mid-
day when i walked to scotland yard

  i told all i knew to half a dozen detectives and
stood the fire of questions they shot at me until at last
they all got up and trooped out solemnly shaking hands
with me each one of them then sir thomas came
along and inspected the merlin he expressed a high
opinion of it and offered to use his influence if i
wanted to dispose of it to the british air board i
told him that would depend on what the american
authorities thought of it and if theyd approve of
britain having it my own country naturally coming
first with me he patted me on the shoulder at that
and said i was quite right then we had lunch to-
gether at his club and after that i collected milliken
and pulled him around the town

  crowds were collected here and there about the
streets and youd come on small knots of people
laughing like mad over the papers it did seem as if
nobody cared a red cent about the raid on the banks
but that everybody thought a great deal of the joke
played on the british ministers i knew that many a
minister and public servant had been sent into retire-
ment through ridicule in france and that the trait
was peculiar to the french but if the cabinet of the
british government could stand the guffaws that went
up that afternoon they were gummed to their seats
with hercules cement i collected a few of the journals
for future reference and took milliken to a picture
theatre

  it was late again when we got back to lord ai-
merics and we found his lordship waiting for us with
the whiskey decanter all ready when at last we did
go up to bed he came into our rooms and pushed a
tissue-wrapped package into my hand and another into
millikens then he went away before either of us
could say anything

  i must say that lord almeric had speed in doing
kindnesses millikens package contained a tobacco box
of silver inside the lid of which was engraved 

to w m

in remembrance of an enjoyable atlantic flight with
as proper a man as ever trod neats leather
from a p

  mine was a gold cigarette-case and in it was in-
scribed

chapter ix
berlin and paris

on the sunday morning milliken went off early
to the merlin taking his own luggage and
mine lord almeric and myself were having
breakfast together and had barely started when a
servant came in with word that sir thomas basildon
wished to speak to his lordship on the phone lord
almeric came back with ever sd slight a ruffle of
excitement on his habitual calm

  basildon was right he said he has just told
me that the raiders visited both berlin and paris this
morning

  in one night i exclaimed then it looks as if
they have more than one airship in europe lord al-
meric from berlin to paris is well over seven hun-
dred kilometres and the voyage would take the aver-
age airship more than four hours did he say at what
time the raids took place

  no he is on his way here now to say good-bye
to you jimmy and he will have breakfast with us
we shall have full details then he turned to the
butler sir thomas basildon will have breakfast
bunter

  very good my lord

  we are beginning to find the amazing measure of
our mysterious enemy lord almeric went on it
must be a huge organization think of the quantities
of ore which must have been reduced to result in all
that radium-and the expense of the operation why
the amount left in new york louisville and london
here represents as much money as has been taken in
the various raids that alone is a staggering fact
the preparations for these raids must have occupied a
number of years

  im with you there lord almeric said i and
the secret has been astonishingly well kept it beats
me to know how the airships could have been built and
their docking sheds erected without the connivance or
at least the hoodwinking of the government in which-
ever country the bases of the raiders are situated i
said bases-because the thing gets bigger every bit of
news how can we be certain that there arent a num-
ber of bases both in europe and in america  im begin-
ning to get fogged lord almeric when the thing
first started i thought we were up against an ordinary
gang of crooks using new methods and that one en-
the ark of the covenant	

counter with them in the merlin once she was carrying
her armament would settle the business im not so
sure now i dont know where im going to begin

  the problem is not at all a simple one lord
almeric agreed but you are taking the only way in
which you personally can deal with the situation
jimmy if you can persuade your government to be
fully prepared for further raids you will do a great
service and you never know but that you will have
the luck to encounter one or other of the airships in
your seaplane it will be an interesting fight if it
ever occurs

  theres the devil of it i said my bus would
have a better chance of whacking them than any other
in existence-i may sound a bit chesty when i say

that but you know how good she is-

  i think i do he smiled and i dont think you the
least chesty 

  well then i sell my design to the government
and so give a number of good fellows a chance to pull
off the fight i want to have myself id like to be
selfish and hog the whole thing for james v boon
nonsense jimmy said his lordship with a twinkle
youll play the game and give your side full benefit
of your knowledge you realize as well as anyone
that only good team-work will scotch this menace
no hogging wont do i agreed ill have to
put the merlin into the pool

  in an incredibly short time we were joined by the
chief of the c i d who must have done violence to
all the speed laws of the city

  what do you think of it pluscarden he de-
manded didnt i say paris and berlin ch

  yes you were right basildon

  an astonishing thing about it to me is both cities
being attacked on the same morning said sir thomas
already busy at the breakfast-table the raid on
berlin seems to have started at half-past twelve this
morning the district round the reichsbank was sub-
jected to gas at that time while the berliners were still
on their pleasures it was seen that something queer
was happening folk venturing over a certain fairly
definite line simply fell staggering to the ground while
others outside the line could watch it happen the
police tried to get into the district but met with the
same fate

  it did not dawn on anyone he went on anyone
in authority for some time that the city was going
through a similar experience as that of new york and
london-even though i had warned the police yester-
day morning-but at last gas-masks were sent for
they were no good against the anaesthetic the police
wearing them fell just the same would you oblige
me with the mustard mr boon

  did they try to get above the district in the air
i asked passing him the pot

a realization of war

thanks he said im coming to that while
 they were still fiddling about with the masks and
making bull-foolish rushes into the gassed area nobody
had thought of calling out the air scouts they found
the air clear on the tops of the buildings and tried to
approach that way but of course came to openings
that were impassable it was over an hour before the
first air scout came wheeling over the district-the
damned fools-and by that time there was nothing to
be seen above or below about two oclock it was
possible to get into the area though here and there the

police were overcome by the gas even then pockets
i suppose where the fumes-or whatever it is-had not
dispersed only the reichsbank had been forced
there was no gold to take but not only had securities
been destroyed but the bulk of the ledgers had been
absolutely obliterated by the use of acid this is
amazingly good ham pluscarden-your own breeding
good god said lord almeric yes-the ham
is from the farm

  ive seldom tasted better said sir thomas calmly
yes he went on a pretty rotten trick the usual
boxes of radium had been left this time in the bank
itself by one-thirty every available aeroplane was in
the air but though they may still be searching up to
now there has been neither sight nor sound of the
raiders reported thats berlin now heres a fact
that will make you pause and consider mr boon
within three hours paris was visited

  one moment sir thomas i interrupted three
hours actual flight-or clock time

  i mean three hours actual flight he replied im
remembering the hour difference between berlin and
paris clocks shortly after three paris time the
raiders had descended on that city here some con-
siderable time passed before it was discovered that any-
thing uncommon was in progress the raid was con-
centrated on the banque de france and if you remem-
ber your paris theres not much doing just there even
though the avenue de lopera close by may be swarm-
ing with night-birds as soon as the alarm was given
-pretty much from the same circumstances as had
become apparent in berlin-soldiers and gendarmerie
were pushed along to surround the banque but they
could not venture closer than the north side of the
place des victoires on the north and on a line from
the palais royal on the south the police brought
gas-masks with the same result as in berlin they
even brought up a wagonful of oxygen tubes which
they drove slowly up rue des bons enfants releasing
the gas as they went but the driver of the camion
was overcome and switched off his engines before they
were half-way up the street and the crew was so
affected that nothing could be seen of what was hap-
pening round the banque meantime there had been
no delay in bringing up the air police except for the
time that had elapsed before the alarm was given the

airship was seen-

  ah cried lord almeric and i felt a thrill run up
my spine

  it was seen said sir thomas again it was
snuggled down on top of rue bailiff hugging close
to the buildings the unfortunate thing is that both
the scouts who saw it developed engine trouble and
had to come down one almost crashed in the palais
royal gardens-he hit a plane tree-but the other
made a good landing in the place du carrousel by
the time the others came up the airship was gone and
although the french and we have been scouring the
air-searchlights and everything-not a single trace of
the airship has been discovered

  what an unlucky thing that the engines of both
machines conked i said

  if both pilots hadnt been men of proved daring
and pluck said sir thomas the inclination would be
to say they funked for when the engines were ex-
amined not a thing wrong could be found its a
mysterious affair i cant make it out

  could the airship have done anything to them i
asked
	air wonder stories

  i dont see how she could he replied they were
flying high enough to clear the buildings in landing-
and surely out of range of anything the raiders could
do what makes me mad is the selfishness the pig-
headedness of the german police my people didnt
get the news from berlin until after the paris call
and apparently the french only heard from berlin while
the raid on paris was actually happening if the ger-
mans had been anything alive and had sent warning to
the french in time the chances are that the airship
would have been intercepted on approaching paris
theres a rotten thing if you like the whole chance
of getting at the raiders gone-and all because the ger-
mans were too busy getting excited over their own
affairs to think of anybody else

  you realize of course sir thomas i said that
if the same airship raided both paris and berlin it
must be up to doing close on three hundred kilometres
an hour

  i hadnt lost sight of that mr boon he replied
and i dont know what to think if it wasnt the same
airship were left to the conclusion that there are at
least two in europe which leads to the possibility that
there may be one or two in america-and these raids
are given the significance of a real war whats the
greatest airship speed made hitherto-can you
remember

  propert with his america did nearly two-twenty
kilometres in an hours spurt off sandy hook in 
i reminded him but a puff of wind buckled his ma-
chine it was too light in construction

good-bye

t remember phew three hundred is amaz-
x ing speed for a dirigible-but-the brain that can
discover a gas capable of putting cities to sleep-will
you deny it the ability to invent a machine to do a
mere three hundred kilometres the hour 

  notme said i it seems to me were up against
one of the cleverest minds of the century where did
they-the raiders-get all that radium for example
lord almeric was asking the question just before you
arrived

  blessed if i know said sir thomas very much
the bewildered soldier for a moment that radium
would be enough to float a company in the city with
millions of capital-eh pluscarden

  yes i should think so said lord almeric but
basildon-you havent mentioned the damage that was

done to the banque de france-

  bless me said sir thomas helping himself to
marmalade didnt i tell you what happened there
they left radium as usual-and also gold ingots valued

at twenty-five millions of francs-

  what lord almeric jumped to his feet

  they left gold valued at twenty-five million francs
sir thomas repeated quietly

  what madness is this cried his lordship it is
fantastic incredible

  im giving you the information that was passed to
me pluscarden sir thomas said distinctly

  my dear fellow-i did not refer to you but to this
action of the raiders lord almeric explained tell
me did you learn if these ingots were stamped with
any government mark

  i asked particularly about that they bore no
marks by which they could be identified

  it is astonishing i can find no real motive for
any of the raids-but this-this-what do you make of

it basildon

  i can make nothing of it-especially as the ledgers
of the banque de france suffered the same treatment
as those of the reichsbank-utterly obliterated

  the thing seems to me so wanton-so useless said
lord almeric the trouble that must ensue-no rec-
ord of transactions-how can all the complications that
must result be sorted out it is monstrous

  its pretty damnable sir thomas agreed rising as
he spoke if the idea of the raiders is to bring busi-
ness to a standstill they are going the right way about
it well we must do our best to run them to earth
sitting still wont do any good youll do your best
when you get back to america mr boon to make those
in authority realize the position your father will help
you there

  i shall cable mr boon myself said lord almeric
and jimmy here will supplement my efforts

  that being so said i the best thing i can do is
to get back to america as quickly as i can i can do
nothing further on this side sir thomas 

  you have done us great service in bringing lord
almeric back so speedily and in telling us about the
american raids said he your work is on the other
side of the atlantic but i shall keep you posted if
any new development occurs of which the news might
help you in your investigations i shall inform you as
quickly as i shall the police over there-depend on that
now ill say good-bye-and wish you every possible
good luck i hope we shall meet again mr boon

  i hope so sir i said good-bye and good luck
to you sir

  thanks good-bye i shall see you later plus-
carden 

  yes i intend to see jimmy off-then i sliall be
fully available basildon

  good

  sir thomas marched off and presently lord almeric
and i were driving down to battersea and the merlin

  we wasted no time in getting away lord almeric
bade milliken and me hearty farewells and to a cheer
for my mechanic from his english confrires-with
whom he had apparently established himself a favorite
-we took off just before ten oclock due west and
headed for our own country with our luck holding
we reckoned to be at gardiner bay by half-past five
american time

the return

we were flying high by the time we got above the
bristol channel and every now and then we
would pass a plane one of sir thomas basildons
scouts he must have sent out word of our departure
for we were not challenged when we passed near
enough we invariably got a signal wishing us good
luck and once or twice a voice came over the radio
phone which was in open circuit with a cheerio
merlin-keep your eyes skinned going over

  once above the open sea i gave the pilot seat to mil-
liken and turned to read the english journals i had
brought with me they were full of course of the
raid on the bank of england and for the most part
the story was told without much flourish or waste of
words in the leading columns of some the fact was
glossed over that the government had been caught nap-
ping with a policy of reducing the air service and
space was taken up with useless condemnation of the
criminals behind the raid those particular journals
it was easy to see were government organs
the ark of the covenant



  the papers of the opposite party vigorously rubbed
in all the damaging facts and were brightly humorous
over the blackened faces of the cabinet one journal
spoke ponderously of the affair in the house of com-
mons as if it had been a sort of negro-minstrel show

 the westminster troupe of minstrels

  there has long been a suspicion of a familiar flavor aboui
the nightly entertainment at st stephens hall time and
again some chord of memory has been struck and we have
endeavored in vain to trace where we load heard that note
before but the bright idea conceived by the leading comedian
at our famous house of amusement-nothing more subtle than
the use of a little burnt cork-revealed in a flash whence came
the old familiar flavor the negro minstrels of course i

  brudder bones cane yu tail me the simularrity between an
orphan boy the prince of wales a bald-headed man and a
monkeys mother

  no brudder jawnsun ah cane not tail you the simularrity
between-etc etc

  the surprise sprung upon us was an elaborate one it was
known that great efforts were being made on the part of the
management to provide a full-dress bumper entertainment
none of the leading lights of the front bench were to be
missing from corner-man to corner-man and from the front
row to the back bench of the chorus the full complement of
the company was to be turned out for this occasion only vve
were to witness the screaming absurdity entitled too much in
the air

  it must be confessed that the entertainment dragged a little
at the start due to the inclusion of too many stump speeches
in the programme

  the speakers morever all were too conscientiously imper-
sonating the old-time members of parliament and it is a well-
established axiom in the art of entertaining that dose imitation
of familiar types need not necessarily be funny the broad
touch of burlesque was needed it is painful to report so
tedious did the show become that not only the audience fell
asleep but the entertainers themselves were lulled into peaceful
slumber i even the bright particular stars of the front bench
wcre affected and fell victims to their own soporific platitudes
sleeping by the clock a round couple of hours

  whether it was that the leading lights of the troupe slowly
awoke to a realization of the failure of the show and took
swift measures to rescue the situation or that the boring of the
audience was calculated to heighten the intended surprise is a
matter on which we are not prepared to express an opinion it
is sufficient to say that when the other occupants of the hall
woke up and found the stars of the front bench all confessing
the real significance of their earlier efforts by having tad their
faces burnt-corked a shout of laughter went up which bade
fair to wreck the house the pity is that the management did
not introduce the surprise earlier in the evening instead of
taking such elaborate measures to secure one big laugh it
would have given point to the coincident occurrence which was
taking place in the city  

  with a modesty not habitual in popular entertainers how-
ever the leaders of the troupe have emphatically disclaimed
all knowledge of how the delightful surprise was worked and
even have tried to attribute the happy inspiration of the burnt-
cork to the visitors to the bank of england in their haste to
be so wonderfully modest they have almost an air of wishing
to convey the impression that their efforts in the earlier part of
the evening composed a serious attempt to reduce tne air
services of the country that the st stephens troupe has some
sort of right to discuss such an important matter cannot be
denied but if the troupe really was trying to discuss this
serious national question and really was determined that the
air service of the country should be reduced in the face of the
outrage on the bank of england-which might readily have
been prevented by an adequate air patrol-their participation
in the affair passes beyond a joke it is no joke for the coun-
try to be deprived of a million pounds sterling while black-
faced minstrels occupy scats that once were filled by statesmen
and handle matters affecting the countrys weal with the absurd
insouciance peculiar to their kind   

  there has been a growing feeling throughout the country that
st stephens is hardly the place for antiquated forms of amuse-
ment and that the old hall should be brought back to its one-
time dignity as a chamber for the serious and considered gov-
ernment of the nation sharing this feeling we venture the hope
that this last effort on the part of the minstrel troupe may
prove laughable enough to laugh them from their benches
should this consummation be reached we for one will be apt

to reconsider our opinion and regard the joke-for joke it then
will be-as the only one we have ever encountered that really
is worth a million british sovereigns

  the other opposition journals did not see the affair
quite that way but they all made the most of it in
their own manner it seemed to me more than likely
that the english cabinet would be laughed out of
office

  by the time i had got through all the sunday papers
and found that none of them had anything to add to
the details sir thomas basildon had given about the
paris and berlin raids i was due to relieve milliken
it was close on one oclock london time and perfect
flying weather there was hardly a cloud in the sky
and below us the sea was like a bowl deep blue in the
centre and shading off to a delicate green at the sharp
edge of the horizon

  we had left the police machines far behind us but
we were passing over a british warship merely a
grey dot with a widening streak of white behind it
further ahead on the sea a series of sinister black
shapes was spread out on a wide line their wakes so
definite and the black smears of smoke athwart them
so copious that we knew them for destroyers traveling
at full speed later when from a grey shape below
us a white fleck parted flickering in the sun only
experience told us that the ship was a plane-carrier and
the flickering speck one of her machines taking off but
though we must have been in sight on such a clear day
we passed unchallenged in a few minutes these ships
of war lay far behind us over the edge of the sea and
only now and then would we see the squat shape of a
freighter the more graceful lines of the passenger ship
-plowing along in the slow placid pursuit of their
lawful occasions

  noon overtook us after about four hours flying
about two oclock by the greenwich time on the con-
trol-board and after that the sun increased his lead
south of us until his angle narrowed almost to dead
ahead we kept a strict watch for the airship until
after six by our clock and giving her the amazing
dirigible speed of three hundred kilometres an hour
by that time we should have overtaken her supposing
she had left paris shortly after four in the morning
but the sky remained clear of aircraft until the time
when we came upon american machines with warships
in convoy throwing a cordon round the atlantic
seaboard

  by then we had made landfall with cape race and
little more than two hours later we were hovering down
into gardiner bay long island i had had a radio
put through to my father telling when we might be
expected and he was there on the jetty to shake milli-
ken and myself by the hand when we landed the
clock in the hall at hazeldene was striking six when i
sat down for a rest and yarn with the old man

a new recruit

tv ty father listened with his usual quiet to all i had
v to tell only putting in an occasional question or
two and when i had finished he nodded satisfaction

  sir thomas basildon is right said he weve
got a long way to go before we reach the end of this
business well and what do you propose to do your-
self is there any way i can help

  yes dad i said there is i want to get a sori
of roving commission with the air police i want to
be my own master go my own way and work along
my own lines with danny lamont to help me a sort
	air wonder stories

of genera permit to scout about in the merlin-armed
to take action if i meet the raiders-thats what im
after can you fix it for me

  ill try the authorities are not likely to favor any
privateering but-youre going to dispose of the mer-
lin design to the government 

  yes i returned and thats another thing i
want you to help me in the air board knows me well
enough-but i want speed i dont want to be hung up
in washington for weeks until the merlin is tested
the merlin should do the trick herself-but youd
better get straight to the president said my father
i can fix it for you to see him your reputation will
stand you in good stead there since youre not likely
to be putting up any fool ideas when can you be in
washington 

  tuesday morning ill fix up the armament be-
longing to the old merlin on one of the new machines
and be fully prepared to show her on tuesday mil-
liken can fly the old merlin at the same time and take
a mechanic or two with him i dont want to part
with the only armament i have i might have to wait
weeks for another equipment so when the tests are
over ill remount the guns on the old merlin down
there

  i see then  write a letter personally to the
president right away so that hell have it by first mail
to-morrow

  he went off to carry out this idea while i made for
the bathroom and a change of clothing

  i have mailed the letter said my father when we
sat down to dinner and if ben whitcomb wont
do me the favor i ask him ill be a mightily surprised
man

  you know the president very well then dad

  we were together as struggling young men at one
time jimmy he replied-then with a reminiscent
smile golly what a lot of fun we got out of that
mighty thin time i

  i got to bed early and slept until five oclock when
i went down to the workshops to get a start made with
mounting the armament on the new merlin milliken
was on the spot when i arrived and under his direction
the first shift was getting the guns ouf dan lamonf
turned up in the middle of the day and as the work
was well ahead i had time to give him all the news
from the other side of the atlantic and to tell him
what my plans were

  if you get these letters-of-marque jimmy he

said youll have to sign me on as one of the crew-

  but what about your laboratory work dan ill
be away from new york for days on end maybe
months

  i have to admit that this job has me beaten jimmy
said he and i dont like it i cant get at the tarnish-
ing of the gold and i cant discover a gas that will
do all the supposed gas of the raiders can it seems
to me that they have discovered processes miles ahead
of present-day ideas and i want to know why and
how i want to be on the spot next time anything
happens and since youre going to look for trouble it
seems to me my likeliest chance is with you my
laboratory work can wait this thing has got me going
i particularly want to know where in the world theres
enough ore to produce all that radium youll let me
in on this jimmy if i dont know anything about
flying i can easily learn to use a gun at least-and-
and-im pretty handy with a skillet

  all right dan its a bet consider yourself en-

tered on the ships books

  he took hold of my hand and wrung it as if i had
presented him with a medal

  youre a regular good fellow jimmy he said
and say jimmy-if theres any shortage in the-in
the ships chest-dont forget ive got sacks will
you

  i wont forget dan

  nothing would content him then but that i should
write him out a list of the things he would need in his
kit and when that was done he made for new york
as quickly as he could to buy the stuff

  the new merlin was all ready late in the afternoon
and milliken and i went up in her to try her for speed
and for the synchronizing of the forward gun which
was an arrangement of our own she answered per-
fectly we had a new speedometer fixed which was
numbered up to six hundred kilometres and in one
short burst the hand touched five-thirty in that fact
alone there was enough to make thf government ex-
perts go crazy over her compared with the fastest
known machine she was a streak of lightning

  i will own that when i stepped ashore after the tests
i was almost drunk with excitement and milliken was
little better i was all impatience to hear the result
of my fathers letter to the president and i got through
to the old man on the phone

  i was on the point of ringing you up son he said
but youve saved me the trouble the president has
this minute left off speaking to me he says hell be
ready to see you at eleven oclock to-morrow and i
promised him youd be on the doorstep of the white
house right on time

  fine dad

  i wont tell you what he says to your proposition
but he was mighty flattering to your old dad youll
learn from him to-morrow say son-how did the
new merlin behave

  i wont tell you dad-but it was mighty flattering
to your young son youll learn from him at dinner
i heard him chuckle but it was characteristic of him
to put up the receiver at once

a presidential conference

at half-past nine next morning the original merlin
 took off with milliken and two mechanics and a
minute or two later the new machine with myself and
another couple of men streaked after them headed for
washington we took it easy and landed in the sea-
plane basin of the potomac just before half-past ten
right at eleven i was standing on the doorstep of the
white house never so nervous in my life i had
stepped in and was giving my card to a servant when
a white-haired little sturdy man came walking swiftly
down the passage to shake me warmly by the hand it
was the president

  you must be young james boon said he and
opened his watch right on time glad to see you
come along to my workroom and tell me all about
this wonderful machine of yours and whats this free-
lance policeman notion you have

  he led me into a little room furnished half as an
office and half as a library

  bless me i said he and so youre jimmy boons
son are you as good a man as your father

  not by miles sir said i

  ah you might fall that short of him and yet be
a good man said the president come now just
ell me as quickly as you can all you know about these
the ark of the covenant	

raids they are a matter of grave concern to me sit
down-and shoot

  luckily i had all the facts arranged in my head
ready for such a request and i was able to give him
a pretty concise summary of all that lay within my
knowledge while i was telling him i had the oppor-
tunity of taking in something of his personality i
judged him to be hot-tempered generous and yet
obstinate a difficult man to drive

  hm said mr whitcomb when i had finished
you seem to have kept track of all the evidence there
is and to have been untiring

  i am glad to have from you the opinion of sir
thomas basildon and of lord almeric it is better
than any cabled account this is a very serious busi-
ness and the effects are already disastrous-

  he rose to pace the room in impatient short steps
there is a financial panic in london paris and
berlin-business is being brought to a standstill in all
those capitals and the chaos is likely to spread the
cables this morning give cause for the deepest appre-
hension where it will all end i cannot foresee the
country has been swept from north to south without
any trace being revealed of these marauders and the
canadian authorities report no favorable outcome of
the search of their territory but we must keep on
cost the country what it may i can see no other help
for it i agree that our only chance of running the
raiders to earth is to be fully prepared for every emer-
gency to be certain that no means of following the
slightest clue shall be neglected

  he turned to me with a keen look that yet passed
over me as if to some greater audience

  in the deciding of what the country must do to over-
come such a terrible and bewildering menace he said
i cannot see that anything is to be gained by sticking
close to rule and regulation on the contrary i believe
that the enterprise you offer is better untrammelled
therefore you shall have every permit that is neces-
sary james boon i do not know from what point
you will make a start but you may have the luck-and
i will venture that you have the intuition and skill-to
light upon some clue which will lead to the clearing up
of this mystery

  thank you sir

  his regard of me lost that absent air

  no he said with a smile dont thank me thank
rather your own proved value as a citizen or if you
will have it that that is to be deprecated thank two
excellent advocates in your cause

  two advocates sir

  why yes my old friend your father-and my
secretary

  your secretary mr president

  would you like to meet my secretary  very well
then-you shall he went to a side door and called
kirsteen

  and in answer miss torrance appeared at the door
this is your advocate mr boon said the presi-
dent she has been pleading your cause ever since
she opened your fathers letter to me

  im awfully grateful to you miss torrance i
mumbled as we shook hands

  uncle exaggerates miss torrance declared i
only pointed out that it would be foolish of the gov-
ernment to lose the help of one of its best airmen by
sticking to silly rules how was my unde almeric
when you left him mr boon

  he was wonderfully well miss torrance he sent

every kind message to you

  dear uncle almeric and how is my friend mr
milliken

  fine hes in washington with me

  i must see him presently and the merlint

  great i said she has three sisters now-

  that reminds me of duty said the president open-
ing his watch we must see this wonderful merlin
ah half-past eleven the air secretary and his
myrmidons should have arrived get your wraps
kirsteen if you are coming we must not keep them
waiting

  is the merlin to be inspected at once-to-day i
asked in surprise at this hustle

  there will be some trouble if she isnt said the
president grimly

chapter x
a secret commission

in the new merlin i took up two crack pilots and
a designer while milliken in the original machine
carried the president miss torrance and a bunch
of delaware bay and there i fooled with the new bus
doing all the maddest stunts conceivable until even the
pilots with me were i believe a bit scared the speed
of the machine had amazed the experts but her quick
climb that hovering flight of hers and her astonishing
qualities in manceuvre astonished them still more long
before we were back on the banks of the potomac and
heard the enthusiastic verdict of the authorities it was
fairly evident that the merlin design would pass to
the government at my own price

  i spent the afternoon in the offices of the air board
going over the drawings of the machine and into costs
with the designers there meantime milliken and two
mechanics had gone by rail to gardiner bay to bring
back the other two new machines which were to be
purchased by the government when i rejoined the
president and miss torrance that evening for dinner
at the white house i had in my pocket a bank draft
for the handsome price which was paid for the merlin
design and the three new buses the quick settling of
the deal was due to the president and when he and
miss torrance and myself were alone after dinner i
tried to thank him he put a hand on my shoulder
in a kindly way shaking me and tried to stop me
saying anything

  why son he said there no need for thanks you
brought along your design just when it was most
needed and wed have been fools to let what kirsteen
calls red-tape hinder the concluding of the bargain
we ought to thank you publicly for giving us such

a wonderful plane but i have something for you-

  he produced an envelope and handed it to me in
it was a letter appointing me for special service with
the air police and mentioning dan lamont and milli-
ken as my assistants

  turn back the front of your jacket said mr whit-
comb and when i did so he pinned a little silver badge
to the lining it was the badge of the secret service

  there said he now in the morning at ten
oclock you will go to this address he handed me a
card on which a direction was pencilled you have
only to give your name to the doorman and he will
take you right to the man who nominally will be your
chief dont bother to ask his name it is seldom the
same two days running i want you to see him because
there may arise an occasion when it will be impossible
for you to report direct to me and in that case you
	air wonder stories

will report to him ordinarily you are responsible to
nobody but ben whitcomb get that 

 yes sir

 very well then burn that card when you have
 memorized the address

  can do that now sir said i and dropped the
 card into the open fire

good said the president take lamont and
milliken with you to-morrow

 i shall have to get dan lamont on the phone right
 away then

 youll find dan lamont at your hotel when you
 get back there to-night said die president with a
 smile

 why-hes in new york i blurted

not at all he laughed hes on his way to
washington we phoned him to come right off and
fixed a room for him at your hotel at least my sec-
retary did

 i turned to miss torrance and it came to me that
 she was just the prettiest girl i had ever seen there
 was a little faint flush on her cheeks and her eyes
 were shining as if she were a little breathless with
 some excitement her lips were slightly parted

 its mighty kind of you miss torrance i mum-
 bled to take so much trouble for me i dont know
 how to thank you

dont try please-it was mr milliken-

 milliken

 milliken and the merlin-and oh the whole thing
 she cried you two and that lovely plane-and that
 modest little man mr lamont i envy you all four
 next to being a man myself and joining you-the best
 thing i could do was to see you got your chance
 youre lucky in your friends mr boon

 i am that i said warmly especially if i may
 number you among them

 then i felt my ears grow hot and my neck go red
 at blurting this it seemed so gauche after all she had
 done for me in friendship

 that sounds ungrateful and silly i stammered

but i only wanted to hear it from you-

 she was a little bit rosy herself but she held out her
 small fist in a frank way and her serene eyes looked
 right into mine

 isnt that the american way she smiled to
 shake on it

 sometimes i said and took her hand

 im green with envy at your luck she said though
 you deserve it every bit-but im with you and the
 crew of the merlin heart and soul

 thats just fine said i and wished that kissing a
 girls hand was still the fashion presidently i took
 my leave of her and her uncle

a quiet interview

sure enough when i got back to the hotel dan
lamont was waiting for me in the foyer he im-
mediately dragged me up to his room to look at the
new kit he had bought there were bags of it he
must have about cleaned new york

say danny i remarked to him what do you
think youre making the trip on-a cargo-steamer 
aw jimmy he pleaded its just a few little

 things i thought wed find useful-

 i gave you a list didnt i 

 and i stuck to it jimmy-faithfully i got three
 or four of everything you said then i got them to
 throw in some extra comforts for you and milliken

  the only extra comforts that milliken and i will
appreciate my son are maybe a few extra bands of
shells or another litre or two of gasoline youll have
to leave five-sixths of this behind dan

  i know im a goat when it comes to spending
jimmy he said i get so blamed enthusiastic
well said i when you ijought this lot you cer-
tainly were in no fit of depression

  he looked at the collection with a touch of despair
for a minute then he brightened up

  tell you how jimmy he said well leave this
stuff at our base and draw on it whenever we want
new outfits

  i took my letter-of-marque from my pocket and
flipped it over to him

  then said i perhaps wed better have the presi-
dent alter this so that youll be definitely commissioned
quartermaster general to the force

  he read the presidents letter with growing excite-
ment then danced about the room

  bully for you jimmy he cried oh boy i
knew youd pull it off

  i folded back my jacket and showed the badge
  consider yourself under arrest i said

  my he gasped youve gone and joined the
hicksville temperance cadets

  so i put him in one of his own kit-bags

  next morning dan and i collected milliken who
had returned to washington late the previous night
with the two new buses and the three of us then went
off to the address given me by the president it turned
out to be a modest little office in a back street with
its window-screen of colored bamboo beads and its
brass plate on which the name had been made unde-
cipherable with years of rubbing it might have been
the office of either an attorney or some old-fashioned
importer

  we were led by the doorkeeper into the presence of
a quiet grey-haired man in a nondescript grey suit
who presently was chatting to us in a pleasant flat
voice that seemed to have no high lights to it he
spoke of nothing much except the weather and the
prospects of business during the year

  business is likely to be a little upset by these raids
i ventured apropos of the last subject trying to give
him a lead to our particular affair

  ah yes he said softly most annoying-most

annoying-

  he rose and held out a limp hand

  glad to have seen you mr boon-and you mr
lamont-ah milliken he said quietly dismissing us
ah-if in your travels you should have any affairs
with my firm just look up the local agent for aunt
mandys soap you wont forget-aunt mandys
soap buy a packet we are running that line pretty
strongly at the moment branches everywhere

  and with that he gently shepherded us out of the
office

  well said danny when we were out in the street
what do you know about that aunt mandys soap-
buy a packet

  when in doubt we buy a packet of soap and so
find the nearest s s agent i take it said i queer
sort of fellow that-doesnt seem to have energy enough

to wink-

  got us weighed up all right grunted milliken
darent breathe but he saw it stringy guy too-
wouldnt like to fight him

  quit joshing milliken i protested why hes
 - 

the ark of the covenant



like a wet rag

  dont you believe it milliken said stolidly chest
like a barrel arms like a monkey notice when the
pencil rolled off his desk

  not particularly why

  never reacned the floor milliken said gazing a
the sky caught it without any noise quickest reflex
i ever saw

  which shows i suppose that if milliken spares his
tongue he makes full use of his eyes danny and i
had noticed nothing about the chief-as the quiet man
in the back street might be called-except that he
seemed bored to death with the mere effort of living

flying orders

the next ten days passed slowly milliken and
myself were engaged in demonstrating the new
merlin to the government flying-men and at the same
time we had to oversee the refitting of the armament
to the old machine with other alterations necessary
for our campaign dan lamont was kept busy col-
lecting stores and on his own account he was making
a selection of instruments which he thought might help
him in solving scientific problems connected with the
raiders

  with all three of us dead eager to be setting out
the delay was irksome but we consoled ourselves that
we were doing good work in putting the pilots wise
to the efficient use of the machines and that in any
case it was better to wait for the next move on the
part of the raiders

  the merlin was fully ready for action by the middle
of the week following our commission the fighting
top was fixed and we had shipped all stores and am-
munition she carried four guns we had dispensed
with two of the smaller so that we now mounted the
fore and aft guns firing half-kilo shells and a machine
gun on either quarter the arrangement was that
milliken or myself whichever of us happened to be
piloting should handle the bow gun while the other
should work that at the stern dan lamont if not
occupied in scientific observation was supposed to turn
his attention to the quarter guns firing on the side
handiest in any encounter incidentally he proved an
apt pupil under the instruction of milliken and myself
we arranged the ammunition bands for each of the
guns with great care so that there would be no hitch
in a crisis and we put the spares where they would
be handy for fitting at once

  dan made it his job to render us as immune from
the raiders gas as he knew how on his advice we
laid in a cylinder of oxygen and fitted air-tight covers
on all openings the gun embrasures we filled with
fabric double pleated like camera bellows and pierced
to take the barrels and telescopic sights and fitting
tightly to them but flexible enough to permit a good
arc of fire the material was some close-woven as-
bestos stuff of dans own choosing and he said it
would not only keep out the gas but would resist the
heat of the gun-barrels after heavy firing our gen-
eral idea was that should we get into action with the
raiders we should immediately close all apertures turn
on a thin stream of oxygen and do our fighting from
a hermetically sealed cabin a quicklime apparatus ab-
sorbing the carbon-dioxide

  dan also had caused to be fitted under the hatch a
bottle arrangement for automatically taking a sample
of the gas should we get into it

  during the fortnight in washington we freguently

met kirsteen torrance and her uncle the president
less often she was inclined at first to think us a
trifle slack about getting down to business but the
president persuaded her that we were doing the right-
and harder-thing in waiting kirsteen took a deep
interest in our preparations and was often in the mer-
lins shed she renewed her acquaintance with milli-
ken who greeted her every appearance with his widest
grin and delighted to explain to her the smallest detail
of our outfit we thought of her as our mascot

  we had an idea that the next of the raids would
most likely come on the great lakes and we decided
that if we got no news by the evening of the first
sunday in may we should make a hit-or-miss start for
the buffalo end of lake erie on monday morning
news came- to washington by radio however that
scrapped our plan at once dan and i were having
tea with miss torrance at the white house when
the president came into the room with a flimsy in
his hand

  flying orders boys he said ships have been
stopped to-day on the cape route from england
at what point i asked and got to my feet in a
hurry

  northwest coast of africa-between madeira and
the canaries by daylight too

  come on danny i said well get off right
away youll be breakfasting at funchal by five

oclock to-morrow-

  quick work said the president approvingly

  good-bye miss torrance good-bye sir-

  nay nay said the president kirsteen and i
will see you off ill ring for an automobile well
go together

  it was close on five oclock when we took off from
the basin by the potomac and a clear godspeed
from a bright-eyed kirsteen a hearty good-luck
boys from the president were the last words we
heard as we set out on our venture

fruitless searching

night came on us very quickly for we were fly-
ing towards it but while the light lasted dan
took a final lesson on the machine-gun from milliken
with the dark we hit into a severe storm which tested
the merlin very thoroughly we had to climb high
before we got out of a heavy driving rain and when
we had avoided that we came into electrical disturb-
ances that played the very devil with our compass it
was tricky and difficult flying for the lightning flashed
above and below us dazzlingly brilliant and the at-
mosphere was terribly pocketed so that we pancaked
in a most sickening fashion the smash of the
thunder-clouds was deafening there were times when
only the fact that milliken was standing on his feet
persuaded me that we were not flying upside down
the disturbed area must have covered ten degrees of
longitude for we were in it close on two hours at
last however we passed out of the storm belt and
could see the stars and we were more sure of our
course as a consequence

  milliken and i spelled each other every two hours
while dan once the interest of the storm was over
slept peacefully it was bright day when we sighted
the azores though our clock showed only half-past
two three hours later we were swaying gently on
the swell in the very exposed bay of funchal

  milliken cooked breakfast on the gasoline stove then
after a visit from the port authorities dan and i went
	air wonder stories

ashore we could get no official information about
the raids that was worth considering the portugese
did not seem to care a red cent about the stopped liners
we had better luck at blands where englishmen
were in charge

  there were three acts ot piracy on the sunday two
union-castle liners and one belonging to the r m
s p co being the victims in each case the strong-
rooms had been the objective specie being taken from
all three ships and from a union-castle liner which
was homeward bound the raiders had made a consid-
erable haul in diamonds the method of attack was
similar on each ship a sudden descent from the sky
by the airship swift and unexpected and almost im-
mediately the anesthetizing of every soul aboard close
on a brief period of terrible panic among the passengers
and crew this last was a ghastly feature which had
been missing from the night raids

  for a week the weather being fine enough to per-
mit a stay in the exposed harbor we made funchal
our base and we haunted the shipping routes from the
coast of spain to the cape verde islands but we
had not the luck to sight our quarry the following
sunday while we were making towards the azores
we intercepted a radio which told of raids on the north
atlantic shipping we filled our tanks at san miguel
and cast a wide circle north into the sea lanes flying
until dawn on the monday morning without result
we returned to the azores

  it came to dan lamont and myself simultaneously
that these very islands would make an ideal base for
all the known operations of the raiders a notion that
seemed to hit all the international searchers a little
later the seaplane base began to fill with british
french american and german machines until by the
middle of the week there was hardly mooring room for
another bus meantime dan and i had gone ashore
to test the aunt mandys soap scheme we bought a
packet and sure enough made the acquaintance of an
alert young american who had an office in a quiet
back street we did not need to introduce ourselves
he greeted us by name as soon as he saw us

  we enlisted his help for a search of the azores
and while his dago myrmidons scoured the land we
examined every nook and cranny from the air we
raised no game whatever altogether we spent an-
other fruitless week in the azores

  look here the distributor of soap said finally
theres a dandy landing-place for an airship on
madeira ive just remembered it a plateau lord
knows how many feet up towards the west end of the
island they call it the paul da serra-a barren place
it is-utterly deserted id give that the once-over if
i were you i think youre on a false trail in this
particular group of islands

  well we were just sick of the sight of all that un-
used ammunition in the cockpit of the merlin and our
soap friends description of the paul da serra cer-
tainly did make it look like an attractive landing-place
for an airship

  it was nearly a fortnight since we had left wash-
ington may was more than half over and we were
still short of the fight we wanted anyhow a faint
hope seemed better to us than none so we made for
funchal once again with the intention of flying over
the plateau on the early morning of the next day-
sunday it was

  as luck would have it this was the time chosen by
ffie merlin for her first breakdown it was noth-

ing much just a fleck of enamel stuck by some chance
in the jet of one of the carburetors we could have
flown all right but milliken and i did not want to get
away with two cylinders missing the locating of the
trouble was enough to delay our start until long past
dawn it was seven oclock before we got over the
plateau and as will be shown later that fleck of enamel
lost us an excellent chance the paul da serra was
bare when we flew over it-but it had been occupied
not an hour and a half before

  it was the merest chance that sent tis northward
on patrol for we had considered another flight to cape
verde islands but northward we went there are
some would say we were urged by fate

battle at last

our northward course had lasted barely half an
hour when far below and ahead of us there
opened out a situation that had about it more than a
touch of drama

  broadside to our path lay a liner spick and span to
the smallest detail in the clear air of the summer morn-
ing but so far away as to be a miniature ship almost
nestling on her tall masts there hovered the long silver
shape of an airship 

  dan and milliken were doing small chores in the
cabin behind me and i found myself calling them-
somehow in a whisper

  by christopher old man dan breathed weve
got em at last i

  millikens only comment was to pull the breech-cover
off my gun and set the belt of shells

  keep high sir he muttered when that was done
and drop on them-quick

  thats the idea i whispered close all open-
ings action as rehearsed

  right sir

  he and dan quickly cleared for action while i gave
the engine as much gas as it would take the merlin
leapt forward at dizzying speed and now we saw
what we had previously missed that we were not alone
in our hurry to the scene from the east raced a war-
ship a plane-carrier we could see from her forward
platform and british from the fleck of white and red
at her peak her distance from the liner could not
have been more than sixteen kilometres and the white
surge at her stem and bows showed how quickly the
distance was being covered neither the airship nor
the cruiser i felt certain had spotted the merlin if
the cruiser sent up a plane we would have to be spry
to get in the first shot

  stations boys i i yelled then for i saw the airship
begin to rise from the masts of the liner ill dive
below her milliken burst her as we pass below

  aye aye sir

  down down down we streaked-quicker than ever
kestrel swooped my shoulder was snugged in the
piece of the gun and my finger was trembling at the
trigger up up up to meet us came the mass of the
airship till her side loomed like a great wall i flat-
tened then and every fibre of the merlin protested at
the strain suddenly my gun blatted as of its own
volition i could just glimpse the gouts of flame as
the shells burst in the grey side of the airship before
i had to dive under her-then behind me i heard milli-
kens gun give voice in a prolonged roar

  the enemy must have risen quickly for i found the
merlin still a good height above the level of the sea
the speed of the dive-done with the engine almost
the ark of the covenant	

full throttle-took us far beyond our quarry since i
could not turn without depriving milliken of his shot
i pressed the foot-bar for the turn and danny loosed
off excitedly

  hold your fire danny  i yelled were not near
enough 

  hell jimmy he shouted gimme a chance will
you i

  despite my climbing turn we had lost the level of
the rising dirigible and we now had to climb at a steep
angle but i set the merlin to the task all out she
answered willingly

  high above us floated the silent grey shape of the
airship and it seemed as if she were disdainful of the
worst we could do her no answering burst of fire
came to us no sign that anyone moved on her she
was uncannily still it was amazing that she still could
float level for at least three of my shells had taken
effect on her envelope and milliken was not the man
to expend ammunition unless his target was plumb on
the cross-hairs of his gun-sight but she floated hori-
zontally rising quickly apparently unharmed

  we were gaining on her i thought but the angle
at which we had to climb seemed likely to take us clean
under her so i gave her a burst of shells before turning
to spiral as we came round dannys gun stuttered
out long roll-it must have been nearly a drumful-
and presently millikens heavier metal took up the
ground bass of the chorus till the cabin was clamorous
with the roar through which came the thin tinkle of
spent shells falling still no answer came from the
enemy

  when the spiral brought us round so that the grey
shape filled the field of my gun-sight again i began to
notice that the ship floated in a thin pinkish haze that
shimmered as one sometimes will see the heat do as
it rises from a hillside in summer it was a curious
effect curious enough to hold my attention even in the
excitement of that moment and i called dannys atten-
tion to it before opening fire on the target but as i
pressed the trigger the haze enveloped the merlin her-
self and a sort of dancing refraction spoiled my aim

  wonder if that haze has anything todo with their
gas said dan in my ear as we swung round once
more and he added something that was drowned by
the noise of millikens gun

  just at that moment to my intense disgust tha en-
gine of the merlin which had been working beauti-
fully gave a despairing whine and petered out i felt
the bus slip back and i flipped up her tail so that we
came into a head dive as we came down the engine
picked up and failed once or twice in an odd fashion
till at last-when i had got the bus into her steady
hovering descent-it stopped altogether we alighted
on the face of the sea

  at once milliken sprang for the engine hatch but
dan lamont seized him by the arm

  dont open anything yet milliken he yelled not
yet-were still in the haze it might be the gas

  gas-hell said milliken i want to see whats
happened to the engine

  jimmy danny cried in distress as the mechanic
gently put him aside

  just a moment milliken i intervened lets
think this thing out-mr lamont may be right

  right sir said milliken and stood aside at once

escape

the pinkish haze lay about us as we rode the sea
to the north of us the liner still wallowed in the

troughs and the british cruiser was coming up hand
over fist from the east the airship floated motionless
in the sky to the south of us seemingly none the worse
for our attack nor making any attempt to get away
my glance fell on the clock attached to the control-
board

  mighty i exclaimed in surprise its hardly ten
minutes since we sighted her

  whats to be done about the engine mr boon
milliken demanded

  well be guided by what mr lamont says milli
ken whats your notion danny i asked

  dan was on his knees working the bottle for
sampling the gas he looked up then rose

  ive worked the bottle he said but i cant test
the gas here if this haze is what i think it is we
cant open anything for long without  being doped
this is what i say its damned unscientific-but i
dont believe in tests even on white mice let me
open a port slightly and take a whiff--im certain the
raiders are averse to the use of anything lethal if i
keel over shut the port quick and bung my nose up
against the oxygen tube and leave me to recover that

will be enough if i dont show signs of choking-

  i was taken aback at having to sanction such a pro-
ceeding but there was no time to argue the matter

  youre o c stinks danny i said quietly and
what you say goes is that the order

   sure it is said dan a little breathlessly

  right i said if i didnt think-i pray god

its nothing worse than the usual gas-

  i dont see why they should change their tactics
now said dan if i dont come round try the ether
injections i showed you stand by boys

  he went quickly to a porthole and undid the screw
then swung the cover aside and stuck his head out

  its the ga-gas-allri- he muttered with a funny
little smile then he seemed to crumple and i caught
him as he fell milliken whipped the cover back into
its place and threw in the fastener while i gently laid
my friend down with his fair head against the oxygen
nozzle

  whether it was seeing dan keel over in that fashion
or that milliken and i got a whiff of the gas i cant
attempt to gauge but we both had the symptoms of
being pretty sick i know that when my mechanic
went to fetch a pillow to put under dans head he
reeled and went white while i was as dizzy-headed as
could be dan was breathing quietly and despite our
anxiety there seemed no need to inject ether or try
artificial respiration as he had showed us

  pluck if you like sir milliken muttered and
very gently he lifted dans head and put the pillow
under it that was all we could do for dans shirt
collar was open and his clothing loose we made the
little fellow as comfortable as we could

  we were just rising to our feet milliken and i
when the cabin shook to a distant thud a wispy ball
of smoke was drifting from one of the barbette guns
of the cruiser and as we watched a string of bunting
was broken out on her signal halyard

  look said milliken ttieres a plane up

  sure enough while we had been attending to dan
the cruiser had catapulted one of her machines into
the air and it already was climbing after the airship

  reel out the aerial milliken i said we might
pick up a message or something

  i switched into the open receiver as he let the wire
down then we watched the progress of the fight the
	air wonder stories

aeroplane was climbing steadily and cleverly after the
dirigible which was making no attempt to get away
but as the pink haze still lay about the enemy i saw
that the men in the open machine would be doped
before they could attack i sprang to the radio to
warn them if i could-for the aerial was a bit short
foi sending since we were afloat-but just then a
message came belting across the phone

  his britannic majestys ship brilliant to the damned
pirate surrender i came the voice the games up 

  immediately came the calm reply

  airship ark of the covenant to h m s brilliant
on the contrary the game has not yet begun dont
be absurd brilliant

  a second machine flashed off the cruisers stage and
began to soar after the other i switched into trans-
mission

  u s seaplane merlin to h m s brilliant i
shouted keep your pilots out of the pink haze round
the airship it is the sleep-producing gas 

  thanks merlin came an english voice that
was a jolly good try of yours hope you arent

  dont know yet i said

  up above us the first plane opened fire with a ma-
chine gun we could hear the rat-tat-tat  of it but
as the sound came and we heard the warning go out
from the cruiser we saw the plane enter the fringe
of the haze only for a second after that was it under
control it stalled then got into a spinning nosedive
righting just before it crashed flat into the sea as it
crashed its companion also went out of control on a
sudden though it had not reached the haze then it
righted to go gliding down after its fellow

  that wasnt the gas said a voice behind us
startling us it was some other piece of devilment

  it was danny who stood behind us fully recovered
milliken and i each grasped a hand of his silently
thud-thud  the anti-aircraft guns of the cruiser were
speaking thud-thud

  cease fire you idiots  same the voice from the air-
ship stand by to pick up your airmen unless you
want them to drown we dont want to sink you just
yet

  sink and be damned to you spluttered a british
voice

  tut-tut the calm rejoinder came from the air-
ship dont be so melodramatic you sound like a
penny novelette stand by and pick up your men
the first lot are unconscious or you merlin-you do
it hurry your engine is all right and youll find
your area free of the gas

  certainly the pink haze had gone from our vicinity

  how about it danny i asked

  take their word for it

  milliken had the hatch open on the instant and was
down on the floats without harm i gave him contact
and he swung the propeller the engine picked up as
if there had never been anything wrong with it

  as the mechanic climbed in through the hatch and
we were taxiing along to the rescue of the drowned
airmen we saw the airship assume an angle of forty-
five degrees and mount at incredible speed far out of
range of the now silent guns of the cruiser

  presently she was lost in the upper air apparently
heading for the african coast

  we found the pilot and observer in the first machine
inert and unconscious stretched out in their cockpit
which was filling fast the crash had sprung all their

timbers and we were just in time to drag them out on
our floats before the water-logged plane turned her
nose down to sink with the weight of its engine we
hoisted both men into the cabin of the merlin and put
their heads against the nozzle of the oxygen cylinder
then we went on the second machine a big amphibious
two-engined de hamiville fighter

  here the crew were in better case they had made
a good landing in the sea they were afloat and curs-
ing their engines over which they were clambering in
an endeavor to locate the trouble that had brought them
down we persuaded them to reconnect their leads
and flip over their propellers to their intense sur-
prise the engines acted at once

           chapter xi
           fastening the net

  it a little the cruiser came smashing through the
seas to us and a casual hail invited us to breakfast
with the big fighter the merlin was hoisted up to
the landing-platform and snugged down the air me-
chanics of the ship took charge of milliken and danny
and i were besieged by the commissioned officers the
doped airmen were still unconscious when they were
taken from our cabin and on dannys advice the
surgeon ordered the sick-bay stewards to put the two
to bed to sleep off the effects of the gas

  the cruiser meantime had come alongside the liner
and in an excellent display of seamanship had grappled
her it was the parnassic all over again sleeping
people were huddled about her decks nor could any
efforts of the boarding-party bring them to conscious-
ness it was decided to take the liner in tow to
madeira and the bluejackets quickly bent a cable from
ship to ship by the time dan and i had stepped down
to the wardroom for breakfast the liner was being
dragged astern

  at breakfast we had a long discussion with the sail-
ing and flying officers and we were brought to the con-
clusion that the raiders had in addition to the gas some
secret means of disturbing the engines of planes there
was the evidence of the two machines forced to come
down in the raid on paris these it will be remembered
like the merlin and the big de hamiville showing no
lasting engine trouble dans theory was that the
raiders had a ray which affected the electrical circuits
of the engines

  he also had an idea that the raiders had some way
of controlling their cloud of anesthetizing gas a notion
that was supported by the officers who had been watch-
ing the show from the cruisers fire-control top the
pink haze had moved about from position to position
in too definite a manner to be haphazard and dan and
the officers were of the opinion that the gas had been
purposely swept from the vicinity of the merlin

  dan while the discussion was forward was back at
his old trick of shaking loose change in his cupped
hands but from this demonstration of his interest and
excitement he drifted into a mood of silent cogitation
which deepened the wrinkles above his snub nose and
gave him the air of a thoughtful child

  after breakfast milliken and i went over the merlin
on a general overhaul and found her none the worse
for her straining we took off from the deck of the
cruiser just before nine oclock

  where now asked danny

  mogador said i we owed the raiders a start
for their humanity they certainly play a clean game
the ark of 

it would have been easy for them to have left the
merlin in irons with their gas but were going to
have another cut at them first we must refill our
tanks at mogador and get a message radioed from the
station there to the president and to sir thomas
basildon

  but jimmy dan objected if they can stop
your engines once they can do it again how are you
going to get over that 

  im not quite sure said i i think the notion is
to get well above them then it doesnt matter whether
the engine is stopped or not-a glide will do all thats
required next time im not going to waste ammuni-
tion on the envelope-theyre using some uninflammable
gas-thats plain im going straight for the stern
engines did you notice that the airships steering was
done by them

m  ti

he covenant	

  no

  fact all the same milliken put in the whole
of the stern cabin works on a swivel

   its so dan i said and thats where ill bust
them or bust ourselves in the attempt we might
have the luck too to take them sitting

  how do you get there  dan demanded

   its my notion that the airship we attacked works
from a base at the back of morocco im banking
enough on the idea anyhow to advise sir thomas
basildon to get as many scouts concentrated round the
coast as he can if the airship comes out again we
may be able to crowd so many planes round her that
the ray you imagine will have more to handle than it
is able in any case the place wants going over
thoroughly

chapter i
an international crime

u mean to say that you cant stop the air
robberies on our new york-london route
said frank wallace assistant manager of
the international air line as he looked
across the desk at his visitor they were
in his office on the thirty-sixth floor of the aviation
building in new yoa

  no of course not answered the other i mean
no such thing i merely want to say that its a great
task and one that has to be approached with great
care

  albert riel the speaker was known as the cleverest
detective of scotland yard and had been assigned to
the task of tracking down the daring air raiders that
were preying on the rich passengers and cargoes of
the i a l

  well i suppose you must do it in your own way
replied the air-line official but if we are not free of
these air bandits soon the line will have to cease opera-
tions on that one route why were the talk of the
world our own company detectives cant seem to do
a thing for they don t even know how the ships are
brought down onto the ocean it is a mystery worthy
of the attention of the best detectives on earth the
liner flying at a great height suddenly starts to coast
downward until she is resting on the waves with her
motors idling then mr bandit drops out of the sky
in a little white plane and walks off with whatever
he wants the atlantic police have often sighted the
raider planes-

  plane not planes corrected the sleuth for only
one has been seen so far

  well plane then and as i was saying both the
american and the british police planes have seen the
bandit ship but they never seem to have been able to
get a single shot at it its no wonder that the papers
ridicule the atlantic police forces there has been a
total of one hundred thousand dollars offered to the
party that downs the plane or learns the location of
its headquarters

  last week we sent a police plane along with one
of our air cruisers the ships speed was reduced to
less than half of its usual speed so that the small plane
could keep up but somehow or other the police
plane was lea off on an imaginary chase while the
raiders brought down the liner in the same mysterious
way and got away with
the governments ship-
ment of gold that was
being rushed to france

we had eight armed
guards on board and yet
one solitary unarmed
bandit walks off with the
money i tell you riel
its getting to be an inter-
national affair for if
they can successfully re-
pulse all attempts at cap-
ture and keep up their
work robbing our liners
then what could they do
if they picked on the
whole world in general

suppose they-

suppose you give me

edward e chapmlow

a chance to talk
quietly ait in the
englishman and
we will get started
all the sooner for
time is valuable as
you are well aware
now im here to
advise you to ship
no more valuables
at present until we
are able to stop the
raids

  were carrying
  very few articles of
  great value in fact
  there are few who
  will risk their treas-
  ures or their lives
  either on our ships
  although the bandits have harmed no one yet

  well that is good news the scotland yard repre-
sentative said as he reached for the cigar box on the
desk you think perhaps that i have just been
assigned to this work but as a matter of fact i have
been secretly working on this case since the raids on
your line first began as our master criminal is well
aware therefore i know what we are up against
but first i want to tell you that we are dealing with
the most scientific crook that ever existed but i can-
not discuss the case with you here because we are
exposed to our foes

  what  you cant talk to me privately in my own
office

  you seem to forget already what i just said that
we are probably dealing with the cleverest scientist
living and i have every reason to believe that he
knows as much about what happens in this office as
you do how does he know where to find your liners
when you change schedule without notice sending them
out hours ahead he knows all about your business-
riel stopped suddenly in the middle of the sentence
and gave a slight start as he looked down at his wrist
watch the expression on his face changed to one of
alertness but it was only the fraction of a second before
he recovered his former poise and only a close observer
would have noticed anything unusual however the
incident did not escape wallace

  no i dont know what we can do at present riel

	continued a slight look
of worry passing over
his face were already
using double the normal
number of police planes
among them some of our
swiftest ships to patrol
along the route of your
air cruisers

  frank wallace looked
at him in astonishment
could it be possible that
this great detective had
no idea of how to cope
with the situation he
was about to voice his
indignation when a look
from riel warned him
that something was
wrong he was instantly

 t t ere is as extraordinary a story as has ever
  been our good fortune to read for ad-
 venture science aviation and general hair-raising
 incidents you will have to go far to match it
 it is one of the stories that will draw a great
 deal of comment from our readers on account
 of the daring of the author in portraying the
 trend of our progress in aviation

    yet there is nothing impossible or improb-
 able within the entire story not even the mar-
 velous rays used by the arch-villain

    when it comes to science as applied to avia-
 tion we have not as yet scratched the surface
 and the most marvelous things are as yet in the
 dim recesses of the future therefore the most
 improbable predictions of our present-day
 authors will be commonplace a hundred years
 hence
	air wonder stories

alert straining his ears to detect any sound that would
betray the presence of a third party but only the
usual sounds of city life could be heard the humming
of planes as they passed his window the never-ceas-
ing tread of feet in the corridor beyond his office the
faint sound of the changing plates of the stock market
announcer on the wall but no suspicious sounds could
he hear what had the detective heard was there
really someone spying on him wallace paled a bit
as he thought of it

  it is twelve oclock riel was saying suppose
we take a short walk

an unseen shadow

the air line official made no reply hut rising
reached for his hat he realized that there was
something wrong for he had seen the warning look in
the other mans eyes and he decided that the best
policy was to remain quiet for the present

   sub level three riel informed the elevator attend-
ant as they stepped onto the car and a few moments
later they were walking along the lowest street level

   it was the noon-hour and the towering buildings of
new yorks downtown area were pouring their streams
of humanity onto the three street levels-crowding
them to the limit especially the lower street which
was built for pedestrians only here the wonderful
window displays the bright lights of the theatres the
stores and dining-rooms added their brilliancy to
the countless electrical lights of all colors and patterns
and attracted the crowds from all parts of the great
city it was the white way of the mighty metropolis
the heavy traffic assigned to the second level could
scarcely be heard from below due to the excellent sound
and vibration-proof construction of the streets the
present street system was a great improvement over
the old style of having everything on one level for
now merchandise was delivered to the buildings by
a sub-surface freight railway that connected all of the
main buildings and provided them with an efficient
method of receiving and shipping the constant streams
of material the aerial landings on the roofs of the
buildings also provided speedy means of obtaining serv-
ice for both passengers and freight

   there was little said as the two men made their way
through the crowd for about two blocks and entered
a dining room wallace noticed his companion steal
another look at the wrist watch as they approached a
corner table furthest from the entrance he wondered
what curious contraption that innocent-looking wrist
watch could be and how it could inform the wearer of
the presence of a spy

   we can sit here and talk riel remarked removing
his hat but keep off the robbery subject for we are
not only being watched but overheard as well

   the official gazed uneasily around him at the occu-
pied tables but no one seemed to be paying the least
bit of attention to them he almost decided that his
friend was taking the precautions simply as a measure
of safety and that he had no proof of any one shadow-
ing them but then that mysterious wrist watch must
be serving some purpose and he tried to puzzle out
how a wrist watch could be fixed up to tell of the
presence of a person who is close enough to overhear
them

  what makes you think we are being watched he
asked	-

   i dont think so i know it see this on my wrist
the detective exhibited the watch for inspection its

a wrist watch yes but the second hand is not a second
hand its a small compass needle inside the case be-
sides the works that drive the hour and minute hands
i have a coil of fine wire located so that when it is
energized it will swing the needle to a position pointing
to the figures six and twelve on the face and freeze it
in that position when no energy is passing through
the coil the compass needle will swing free-controlled
faintly by the magnetic lines of the earth now ill
tell you something that i have not told you before the
bandits-

  riels serious expression quickly changed to a smile
and wallace again saw the warning look in his eyes
so for the next few minutes they talked idly remain-
ing off the subject of interest wallace was not slow
in catching on he knew that in some way the watch
indicated the presence of a foe but who or where the
spy was he had no idea

  the detectives arm was resting on the table the
watch almost concealed by his cuff but not enough to
hide the compass needle from view the needle was
pointing straight at the stem of the watch or the figure
twelve with its north pole but another look from the
sleuth caused wallace to take his glance away from
the needle he noticed that his friend looked at it
out of the corner of his eye while he carried on the
conversation suddenly the needle was released and
swung freely around as it sought to align itself with
the magnetic north and south poles of the earth

  i must give you credit riel smiled across the
table you were not slow in catching on

  suppose you let me know what the mystery is
was the reply before that confounded thing swings
around again

  well theyre using a vision ray on us and this de-
tects the ray

  wallaces face paled good god man you dont
mean that they have been watching every move ive
made for months back

  and listening too for the ray picks up sound waves
now before we go any further put this on

  the detective drew a second watch from his pocket
and passed it over the table and when you see the
needle freeze remember that you are being watched as
closely as i am watching you and be careful how
you look at your indicator because while theyre watch-
ing you they may notice you looking at it and its
one thing we dont want them to find out if we can
help it

  i understand replied the other strapping on the
watch and you can depend on my using every
precaution

the air-line station

tt is of no use trying to discuss the case here riel
 continued for we are being watched too closely
with the ray theres only one place where we can
talk in secrecy and that is at my home in london
now you return to your office and make necessary
preparations for a few days stay abroad and meet
me at the air-line station at six a m tomorrow
well take your morning ship across

  the first doesnt leave until ten oclock for weve
cut down to four trips a day business has become
completely dead since the public became frightened

  sh- a hiss from riel and he knew that the
ray was on them again a cautious glance at the
watch verified it

then order a special for six a m the detective
the planets air master	

quietly replied it is my best chance to get some im-
portant papers over to london without the risk of
losing them

  again the ray left them and riels face became
serious listen wallace im going to try and get
some important papers across that our master criminal
is after thats why we want to slip away unnoticed

  then why did you tell me about the plans when the
ray was on  he heard you

  i will explain that later but now i have to leave
you before the ray comes on again i want to lose it
in order to get my papers from the bank vault in secret
that ray can penetrate walls and see beyond them
i will meet you at six in the morning in the upper
waiting-room of the air station

  with that he rose and hurried from the room leav-
ing his friend wondering what the plans were that he
was guarding so well and why the master criminal was
attempting to get them above all he was concerned
with what they had to do with the raids on his air
cruisers

  the international air line had the swiftest trans-
atlantic transportation system in the world connecting
paris london new york and los angeles

  the long distance flights were made at a high alti-
tude-the gigantic triple-deck planes being automatically
guided along magnetic beams at an amazing speed

  the landing stations were built on or rather sus-
pended between four gigantic steel towers forming a
square built near the top of these the station con-
sisted of two runways or landing tracks with a section
of the station rising up on each side of them and a
third projection between the two tracks the three
sections were of equal height and the roofs perfectly
flat and level for the huge wings of the ships passed
over them clearing the flat tops at a close margin
the whole station structure when viewed from above
resembled a huge wide letter e lying on its back
and held up in the air by four long legs the three
station sections running the length of the runways
were each three floors above the tracks and each con-
nected with them by three landing platforms one above
the other the section of the station located between
the tracks was used by the cruisers in both runways
for discharging passengers and baggage while the
outer buildings served to load the liners in their respec-
tive runways

  the upper deck of the liner held the first-class pas-
senger cabins the front end of which consisted of an
observation compartment here large low windows
formed a half circle around the front of the deck
offering an excellent view of things below although
the ships during the long flights usually flew at such
a height that there was little to see during the trip
the entire deck with its luxurious furnishings and
trimmings its comfortable sleeping cabins and faultless
dining service offered all the comforts and accommo-
dations of a first-class hotel connection with the
decks below was established by means of a noiseless
floor selector or elevator while a second elevator con-
nected the dining room with the kitchen on the lower
deck the second or intermediate deck of the air
cruisers held the second-class compartments and was
equipped somewhat similar to the first-class section
above the lower floor contained the baggage rooms
crews quarters operating and control rooms

  the triple-floor station platforms running along both
sides of the two runways served to connect the baggage

and waiting rooms of the station with their respective
liner decks off the two upper platforms the ticket
offices and waiting rooms were located while the
baggage and supply rooms were on the level of the
lower ioading-platforms guide rails passed along the
outer edges of the loading platforms and small rollers
on the ships engaged these rails guiding them through
the station while skids or projecting strips on the bot-
tom of the cruisers slid into slots in the bed of the
runway that were fitted with rollers reducing friction
to a minimum this was of great benefit in starting
out from the station enabling the hydraulic catapult
to give the cruiser the necessary speed to leave the
runway the smooth quick stop of the liners was
accomplished by means of hydraulic brakes placed
along the platform edges just above the guide rails
these brakes when applied against strips of special
material on the sides of the cruisers were capable of
quickly stopping them even when they entered the
station at a high speed but there was little variation
in the landing speed for the ships when approaching
the station were automatically guided in by a magnetic
landing beam these beams similar to the ones used
to guide the liners over their routes were set at a
level with the runways and not only enabled them
to hit the runways accurately but also adjusted the
speed of the ship

  five powerful high-speed electric motors were
mounted on each wing and connected directly to indi-
vidual control panels in the control room therefore
if one motor went out of order during flight it could
be cut out of service by the operator without inter-
fering with the others the power was furnished by
twin generators each driven individually by a gasoline
engine and each set capable of operating the ship inde-
pendently in case the other developed trouble the
complete power system was such that there was very
little chance of a forced landing being caused by engine
trouble

  a group of colored signal-lights was located on
both upper and lower sides of each wing while another
group was attached on the nose or front end all of
these were controlled from the operating room

chapter ii

ready to start

the location of the control or operating room was
in the front part of the lower deck the compli-
cated mass of automatic electrical control equip-
ment was mounted on a number of slate panels forming
an arc which extended from the front of the operator
around on both sides the panels were about two feet
from the floor and about four feet high leaving room
below for the hand and foot levers of the emergency
manual control directly in the center of the panel
board was a number of meters the largest was the
velocity meter controlled by the speed indicator which
was attached to the outside of the ship the velocity
control was operated by the automatic radio control
and its speed setting by the altitude regulator which
was adjusted to operate when the meter reading was at
a certain point this made it possible to keep the altitude
control unit accurately timed which was an important
thing on the right of the meter panel was the auto-
matic radio control consisting chiefly of a large num-
ber of electro-magnets fixed coils and sensitive relays
when the liner entered the field of one of the magnetic
beams the automatic radio control was thrown into
	air wonder stories

action by the beam and automatically kept the craft
in the center or densest part of the beam

  when mr wallace stepped from the elevator after
a rapid ascent to the i a l station and entered the
waiting rooms of the eastbound track he found his
friend waiting

  here so soon was riels greeting well weve
got almost twenty minutes to wait

  no the special should be here soon because i
ordered it for 

  just as he spoke a bell rang and the train announcer
lit up

  special l n y-london o t 
on time added the official looking up at the an-
nouncer it must be coming in on the landing beam
now

  how far out from the station does the landing
beam extend  the sleuth asked

  ten miles our landing beam projectors are lo-
cated below the runways here one beam is thrown
east from the westbound tracks the other extends the
same distance west to guide the eastbound ships in
but when the ships leave the upper beam and drop
down entering the landing beam is this done by
manual or automatic means

  automatic replied wallace we have a beam
crossing the upper one at a certain distance out approxi-
mately thirty miles from here or twenty from the end
of the landing beam when the ship hits this cross
beam the radio control is thrown out of contact which
causes the velocity regulating unit to also throw out
shutting off the motors while the altitude regulator is
thrown into its lower setting which is the height of
the landing beam the liner then glides down at a
comfortable angle until it enters the lower beam here
the altitude regulator rights it and the beam causes
the radio control to operate and throw in the velocity
unit but in a lower speed setting the motors drive
the cruiser along the lower beam at a greatly reduced
speed guided automatically by the radio control
sounds all rights riel answered but what pro-
vision have you made for failure of the ship to strike
the lower beam

  we have the ship equipped with a complete installa-
tion of manual control equipment by which the pilot
can lower the landing wheels and bring the craft to the
emergency landing fields in case the automatic equip-
ment fails and as to missing the lower beam when
coming down that is almost impossible for with the
cruiser going at a definite speed and in a definite direc-
tion and the decline started at a certain point it is
easy to see that it will arrive within a reasonable dis-
tance of the beam area of course the air currents
throw it out some but the pilot can easily make the
slight adjustments necessary by the use of the manual
controls for the area in which the ships strike the
lower beam is well marked by day and plainly illumi-
nated by night the liners also carry a special radio
beam indicating unit used when the weather makes the
guiding lights invisible but suppose we step out on
the platform our ship should be here by now

  the huge cruiser could be seen approaching about
two miles west on a level with the station and it was
scarcely more than two minutes before she entered the
runway sliding in between the guide rails with amaz-
ing accuracy and coming to a quick but smooth stop
in the station

  to one who had never seen the air liners enter and
leave the station it was indeed an interesting sight to

watch the approach of the huge triple-deck cruiser with
its monstrous wings but once inside the station only
a partial view of it could be seen from one place be-
cause of the platforms passing close to the sides of the
ships only one deck could be seen from any one plat-
form or waiting room

  there is no crew on this ship except one operator
the official informed his friend as they stepped into the
upper compartment we are carrying nothing in the
way of baggage and i left even the kitchen crew be-
hind to be sure that we would not be disturbed on the
trip but i have a lunch here in my hand-bag in case
we get hungry before arriving

  your precautions were hardly necessary smiled
the detective but nevertheless it is just as well for we
know who is aboard

  scarcely had they seated themselves than the doors
of the three decks slid shut the hydraulic brakes were
released with a hiss and the huge craft was being
swiftly pushed down the runway by the powerful cata-
pult gaining speed at an amazing pace a moment
later it was cruising free of the landing station as
the ship left the runway a pressure contact on the side
was released automatically throwing the altitude con-
trol unit into operation in its high setting simultane-
ously the velocity regulator was automatically thrown
into contact and the motors were soon pulling the
monster rapidly up towards the higher altitudes

ready for a hold-up

the oxygen distributing system was already in use
throughout the ship relieving the difficulty of
breathing in the thin upper atmosphere the gradual
leveling of the liner indicated its approach to the upper
magnetic beam and as the altitude regulator cut out the
beam caused the automatic radio control to make con-
tact throwing the velocity regulator into its high speed
setting under its control the battery of motors began
to increase speed until the cruiser was heading cast
at the amazing speed of four hundred miles an hour

  did you notice any disturbance on your wrist watch
while we were in the station riel asked as the cruiser
gained speed along the beam

  no for the time being i forgot about it was the
reply do you expect them to stop us this time
yes i do riel shook his head i expect them
to bring us down before we get over it is an ideal
day for them dull and cloudy making it easy for them
to get away

  i doubt it wallace said ive got extra police
on the job to-day just hoping they will make a try
and the pilot has been told to sound the radio alarm
as soon as he finds the ship leaving the beam

  when did you give these instructions when you
ordered the special

  yes i phoned the air sheds from my office and also
gave orders to have the radio alarm inspected care-
fully and the pilot well instructed as to its use

  and how many pilots have set off the alarm during
a robbery

  well-

  quiet hissed riel as he saw the needle of his
sptch freeze stiff ill take the papers from my brief
case he continued in a natural voice and hide them
under my seat in case were held up cant run the
risk of losing them

  a moment later the needle swung freely and the
men were free to talk

what was your idea of talking about hiding the
the planets air master	

papers wallace asked

  just to prove to you that they are able to hear us
as well as see us there is no doubt but what well
be brought down and to prove my words youll find
that the raiders will look under the cushion of my
chair before searching my case although we will not
put the papers under the chair cushions but you
havent answered my last question yet i want to
know how successful your radio alarm is

  so far it hasnt been very successful admitted the
air-line official in fact only two pilots made use of
it at all during robberies and those times were after
the raiders had thoroughly robbed the liners and left
and on another occasion one of your police plane
escorts left the liner and flew off on a false chase of
the raiders while the ship was brought down and
robbed

  yes wallace nodded of course we can hardly
blame the police if they see-a chance to chase the
raiders but there is one instance where the bandits
used two planes one as a decoy to lead the police away
and the other to rob the ship

  no you are wrong wallace for i know that they
are using but one ship

  impossible insisted the official indignantly for
the police chased the raider over one hundred miles
and as soon as they lost sight of it they returned to the
cruiser that plane could not have got back and com-
mitted the robbery before the police returned

  now listen riel bent over towards his companion
id like to tell you all i know about this case and
explain some of these things for you but to do so
would most positively spoil my plans but later you
will know now watch your indicator close and warn
me by a cough if the ray comes on im going to hide
these papers and i dont want you to know where i
put them turn your back this way there now
remember watch that indicator closely

  riel quickly unbuckled the brief case removed the
papers and going to the other end of the room slipped
them behind a safety-first cabinet on the wall and
quickly tetumed to his seat

  what are you up to now his friend inquired
just this i thought when i first took up this case
that the vision ray and the means of detecting voice
waves were the most powerful instruments our raider
had but later i found that he was using some mys-
terious force that we are yet unfamiliar with if i am
right then this wizard is merely playing with your
cruisers perhaps to introduce himself in a mild way
to the world and that he has power enough to whirl
every man of this earth around his thumb unless i
am wrong he can make governments do what he wants
them to do in a few minutes he can start one-half
of the world fighting against the other half and can
make bank presidents bring their loads of gold to his
door without knowing that he exists

  frank was by this time staring at the other in
amazement

  you mean that he can create all this havoc and not
give himself away

  his vision ray might give him away but the other
power will keep anyone from using the clue to trace
him down continued the sleuth im warning you
wallace wer taking a chance for if he ever takes a
notion to-

  were going down wallace exclaimed his voice
shaking with excitement as he felt the nose of the
ship tip downwards

  sit still cautioned his cool friend leave it all
to me and dont talk

  the faint hum of the motors had ceased and the
cruiser was gradually losing altitude and speed de-
scending at about the same angle as when dropping to
the landing beams down through the heavy banks
of clouds it came until with a rocking motion it
settled to a stop on the surface of the ocean

             chapter iii
             a polite visitor

wallace was indignant he-one of the high-
est officials of the international air lines-
robbed on one of his own liners he vividly
imagined the laugh the newspapers would have at his
expense his thoughts were interrupted by the roar
of the wireless announcer built in the ceiling 

  just be patient gentlemen and i will soon be with
you i will also acquaint you with the fact that re-
sistance will only mean your death for i am protected
a side glance at his watch showed that the ray was
on he heard the air being released as the doors of
the lower deck were opened and a moment later the
small elevator was rising to the upper floor

  we may as well give in thought frank as the
elevator door opened a moment later and a well-dressed
intelligent-looking man of about thirty stepped into
view wed better give the man the papers and let
him be gone it wont pay to resist

  riels face was a mystery it was as expressionless
as it could be but as the man advanced down the aisle
his expression changed and showed more interest in
events

  well gentlemen i hope you will not keep me wait-
ing for the papers but to save you the trouble i will
help myself

  he lifted the cushions of the two chairs and a baffled
look stole over his face but he quickly recovered his
former expression and turning toward the english-
man and with all the ease and politeness of a host
remarked

  i trust you will speed my departure by assisting me
in the search for the papers

  ill get them for you the detective replied and
walking over to the hiding place drew the papers out
wallace meanwhile was searching the brief case in a
vain attempt to comply with the request of the caller

  i thank you gentlemen for your assistance the gay
caller addressed them as he put the papers in his pocket
and stepped onto the elevator perhaps i will call
again in the near future and stay longer

  the two men remained standing gazing at the spot
where the elevator had disappeared they heard him
cross the lower deck and riel suddenly returned to
action looked out of the window and saw a small white
plane below close to the baggage room door a moment
later it was cutting across the water and rising swiftly
soon disappeared among the clouds

  well riel regarded his friend with a quiet smile
we gave them the papers but the raid was of more
benefit to us than to them

  but what is his purpose because he hears of us
bringing some papers over he grabs them

  this is something i cannot tell you until we get to
london but now well go down to the operating room
and talk with the pilot

  well our bandit will have a warm time of it this
time wallace commented as they shot down to the
	air wonder stories

lower deck not only were there a dozen police
planes in the neighborhood when we came down but
the pilot would send out the call on the radio alarm
as soon as he started to come down

  your pilot didnt te the radio alarm was the
sleuths quiet reply you will discover that when we
get to the operating room

  as they crossed the lower deck toward the front of
the craft they could fell the huge cruiser begin to
move forward with rapidly increasing speed until it
was tearing through the water at a fast rate and a
moment later was in the air again

  in the operating room they found everything normal
and the pilot on the job

  did you use the radio alarm demanded wallace
as he opened the door leading into the control room

  let me handle this cut in the scotland yard rep-
resentative before the embarrassed pilot could answer
turning to the pilot he asked now young man why
did you bring down the liner

  wallace was amazed at the question but said nothing
well you are right when you say i brought her
down for i did the automatic radio control was not
working right and i intended to try and adjust it
but now when i recollect it was a foolish thing to do
because i could have finished the trip with the manual
controls

  and have you fixed the control 

  i just tested it out and i find that it is now work-
ing all right

  it looks funny fumed wallace that you have
to bring the ship down just at the time the robbers
arrived

  it isnt his fault although he thinks it is riel
quietly informed him i must remind you once more
that we are dealing with a very clever foe meanwhile
we can return to the upper deck

  turning to the operator he added if you get any
calls asking why we descended just say that we were
making tests and deny any statement that the raiders
have been here

a deadly weapon

ti tell i found out what i wanted to riel said
vv as he dropped into his chair a few moments
later our clever friend is the most powerful man in
the world he has us all at his mercy and no doubt
he is a maniac and will sooner or later turn our earth
into a living hell just to demonstrate his power over
his fellow-man i tell you wallace weve got to act
quickly quietly and surely while he is content to play
with small things like this line of yours one thing
we know is that the wizard doesnt know of our wrist
watch indicators yet we have one chance in a thou-
sand of keeping them secret for he already knows
that his ray is traceable the radio instruments of a
plane are affected when the machine passes through it
and the reception of radio messages is disturbed by
the rays magnetic action

  then you know where the beam is coming from
we have a very good idea of its location yes but
the exact spot is not known

  then why dont you trace it down with your planes
if its so easy to follow

  that has been tried yes tried too often before we
discovered the power the man held over the rest of
the world

  you mean that the ray contains some deadly ele-
ment that is fatal to anyone passing through it

  no the vision ray is harmless in itself otherwise
you and i would be dead for we have had it on us
more than once we are able to follow the ray but
few that have tried it have lived to tell of their experi-
ences the first attempt was made by your own gov-
ernment who thought someone was illegally using a
radio beam for wireless signals a plane was sent out
to trace the ray down and it has not been heard from
since

  probably shot down by the raiders when they saw
the plane

  no wallace it wasnt shot down a deadlier
weapon was used on the plane before it got within a
hundred miles of the wizards base the next attempt
to trace the vision ray was made by the new york
detective bureau after the robberies of your liners
started you remember where the wreck of their police
plane was found next day

  but there must be an explanation those ships
wouldnt fall down without a reason surely the wizard
cant do all this with hundreds of miles between him
and his foes

  a little later continued the detective the ray
began to be coupled with the raids on your air cruisers
but it was kept a close secret by the police scotland
yard sent two swift well-armed planes to search for
the ray they picked it up at noon the next day and
followed it southwest they never returned the two
machines suddenly turned on each other and fought a
deadly gun duel to the death one went down in flames
and the other flew a few miles south and suddenly
without warning swooped downward diving straight
down into the ocean with engines roaring at full speed
another time an unofficial adventurer was seen follow-
ing the ray by one of our planes he was cruising
along not over one hundred miles an hour when to the
horror of the observing plane he leaped from his ship
into the ocean below followed closely by his uncon-
trolled plane orders have been given to all ocean
police to allow no one to follow the beam when it
comes on the air

  then the ray must drive its victims mad

  the vision ray itself is harmless but something else
is being used with it possibly another ray now well
drop the subject until we reach london then we will
try and find a way to deal with the situation

  in spite of the fact that he would have liked to learn
more about the case wallace decided that it was best
to remain quiet and wait

riel gives some orders

darkness was settling over the land when they
left the transatlantic beam and coasted gently
down into the area of the landing beam and it was
but a few minutes more before the cruiser came to a
smooth stop in the london station

  well here we are riel remarked rising from his
seat now well probably be trailed by the ray so
be careful what you say

  leaving the ship they stood on the platform a moment
and watched the special leave there were perhaps a
dozen persons standing around most of them waiting
for the paris liner

  well go up to the offices and have a talk with your
london manager the detective said as they passed
through the waiting room i called him from new
york so he will be waiting for us then we will go
out to my place

  a speedy elevator soon brought the two men down
the planet

to the subterranean railway entrance and while they
waited for a train riel glanced around at the crowd
as was his custom taking no special look at any one
but noticing a surprising number of things in each
casual glance there was a large crowd on the plat-
form for it was the evening rush hour when the citys
factories and skyscrapers were pouring their thousands
into the streets a workman in overalls with a dinner
bucket in his hand stood behind the pair he received
a second glance from the detective but whether it was
because he was standing in a place that looked suspi-
cious or whether the sleuth was just checking up to
see if he was following them was hard to say a
woman standing near them also received a brief un-
noticed look from riel he was apparently taking no
chances of being followed a train pulled in and the
mass of humanity started toward the entrance man-
aging to squeeze into the train the two men were
obliged to stand in the aisle the man with the dinner
bucket was near them but riel paid little attention to
him he apparently had satisfied himself with the second
glance on the platform

   is this the kind of transportation you use in your
 travels about the city wallace asked nodding to the
 car packed tight with its human cargo

  no not as a rule was the answer i must
apologize for bringing you on this crowded car but i
did it to prevent being followed we can lose a spotter
easier in a crowd than by using street or air taxis
which can be followed easily i cant afford to have
anyone follow us v-night for i am taking you to
where i have the plans that our criminal wizard is
after and i can not take a chance on being trailed
there those papers are important

   leaving the subway after a twenty-minute ride the
 men walked along the lower street level to the empire
 building taking an elevator to the forty-seventh floor
 where the offices of the london i a l branch was
 located

   it is best that i do the talking riel warned his
 companion as they entered the managers office i
 will explain later

   the detective needed no introduction to edward
 graham manager of the london offices for he had had
 interviews with the official before during his work on
 the present case so witfe little more than a nod to
 the man at the desk he at once approached the subject
 of interest

   i want to take a special liner back to new york
 to-morrow at ten in the morning i will put on a
 disguise and slip onto the liner in the sheds and take
 my place in the control room as an electrical tester if
 you can put some new equipment on the control panels
 of the special it will look more natural

   i think i can arrange it all right providing mr
 wallace offers no objection

   no objection whatever mr graham you are to
 assist mr riel in every possible way

   well then replied the manager turning to the
 sleuth will you be carrying any baggage

   i wish to get a package of valuable papers to new
 york and well have it secreted onto the liner in the
 sheds it is not likely well be stopped this trip for
 they got false plans from us before and theyll think
 this trip is also a bluff even if they do learn of the
 shipment through spies watching the special they will
 only see two men in the control room making a test
  flight

   all right mr riel replied the london i a l

air master	

official ill have the ship ready on time i suppose
you will attend to putting your package on board
yes replied the detective preparing to leave ill
attend to that

  leaving the office the two ascended to the roof and
signalling for an air taxi were soon traveling to the
west

  everything worked eke a charm riel exclaimed
with satisfaction lookingat his watch for signs of the
ray just as i expected the ray was on us all the
time we were in the office and our master criminal will
play into my hands this time but we had better main-
tain silence until we are more secure from the wizard
a single word may spoil all

  it was with difficulty that wallace could keep quiet
for he was bursting with curiosity a score of ques-
tions were burning in his brain why was riel going
to return to america did he really hope to get
across with some valuables to see if it could be done
no there must be more to it than that no doubt he
had made up that talk because the ray was on them
and intended to make a far different move but if he
was intending to make the trip why would he tempt
the criminals to another robbery could he learn any-
thing by it was the package going to contain any-
thing of real value or would it be another fake set of
papers could the ray penetrate the package to see
what was in it and so possibly beat riel at his own
trick

over london

such thoughts ran through the americans brain as
the taxiplane continued west along the city landing
level but he could see plainly that his companion did
not care to discuss the subject so he gave it up deciding
to wait until they had a chance to talk

  the progress of the taxi was slow along the landing
lane for planes were continually coming up or going
down to landing places below building roofs garage
roofs individual landings and the many municipal park-
ing spaces all added their share of craft to the crowded
lower lane but it was not long before the chauffeur
reached an ascent cross-lane which was commonly
called the a lane the a lane signal which was
a huge green and white revolving light mounted on a
steel tower was visible for a long distance from the
air the d lane or descent cross-lane signals were
similar to the others only that a red and white light
was used

  the taxiplane arriving over the a lane signal
ascended to its proper level passing above the second
lane which was assigned to heavy duty craft reach-
ing lane  which was composed of local light traffic
it again resumed its flight to the west once on the
third lane the plane speeded up and cut through the
air at a fast rate

  the heavy traffic of lane  swept past below in a
continuous stream momentarily blotting out partial
views of the illuminated city below as far as the eye
could detect the land was a continuous stretch of lights
millions of them of all imaginable sizes and colors
the extra bright strips stretching for miles across the
black background indicated the main streets the re-
volving cross-lane signals could be seen scattered at
intervals over the city-the traffic signals of the air
traveler the lanes below appeared as an endless
stream of red lights as the heavy traffic of the lower
lanes swept past the red lights on the upper side of
the wings standing out bright and dear against the
	air wonder stories

darker background of the plane it was a remarkable
contrast to the view of the through lane above show-
ing only the green lights of the lower sides of the
wings the sky was cloudless but no moon was visible
to flood with its light the landscape but a plain view
of the land below was not essential to safe air travel
for the altitude indicators told the flier what lane he
was in while the aerial traffic signals which were to be
seen everywhere made it easy to find ones position
the direction signs located near the a and d lane
signals were plainly visible from the highest traffic
lane by day and well illuminated by night

  as the taxiplane continued to the west the sea of
lights in the city below gradually thinned out and soon
they were over the suburbs

  better drop down to the landing level at the next
d lane riel informed the driver through the taxi-
phone

  the d lane signal was not far ahead and they
were soon down on the landing level again here in
the suburbs the traffic in the lower lane was not at all
congested and the taxi proceeded along at a good pace
they had not gone far along the lower lane when
the detective again used the taxiphone

  a half mile to the northeast three white four
green and red in the square south entrance he di-
rected the chauffeur

  the plane was slowed down as it approached the
sleuths landing place which could be seen plainly as
they approached three white lights formed a small
triangle surrounded by a square of four green lights
this was the exact center of the landing space and
the four red lights marked the four corners of the
area approaching from the south the plane slipped
to the ground between the first two red lights and
stopped just beyond the center lights

  you have a nice location wallace remarked step-
ing from the plane and looking the place over that
is what i can make out in the dark looks favorable
what is the long building to the west of the house
that is my garage the host explained i keep
two cars and a plane and have a reserve space for one
of each i have barely enough ground to provide my-
self with air landing privileges its fortunate that
planes can descend slower and stop quicker than they
used to or id need a ten-acre tract for my landing
but even at that everyone cannot afford an individual
landing most of my neighbors use community fields
a group of neighbors maintain one landing field and
air shed which serves them all its a very economical
way and quite efficient too

  the conversation was here interrupted by the ap-
proach of a policeman from the shadows of the house
any orders sir he asked addressing the detective
yes lester i have a little job that you will have
to do carefully riel instructed the man with a side
glance at the wrist indicator i am expecting a visitor
soon and i want you to be sure to get him for it is
important that he doesnt get away is simpson on
the job

  yes sir hes on the other side of the house

  very good then both of you keep in the shadows
until you spot him

  with this the detective approached the illuminated
entrance to the house pausing at the door he turned
around to the police officer

  and its equally important that the ray doesnt catch
you in the act understand lester

  yes sir the job will be done quickly

  since ive been on this case the englishman ex-
plained to his companion as they entered the hall ive
had my house under constant guard with two men on
each shift for i cant be too careful when dealing
with a clever crook as our master criminal undoubt-
edly is

  entering a large room off the hall he invited wallace
in explaining this is my combination room part
library part laboratory and the rest designed for
comfort

             chapter iv
             riels story

the room indeed was a combination room the
american thought as he looked about the thick
carpets and easy chairs with their well-stocked
smoking stands gave an air of comfort to the room
along the wall opposite from the hall entrance stood
a well-filled book-case and to the left at the far end
of the room was a mass of electrical equipment neatly
mounted on mahogany-colored panels forming a
switchboard about six feet high and eight feet long

  my mechanical assistant smiled the host noticing
his guests interest in the apparatus such equipment
is necessary to fight modem crime the scientific
criminal employs all possible scientific methods to ac-
complish his work and to fight them the law must
be equipped with suitable weapons my secret radio
equipment is mounted on that board and also my ray
deflector

  then you have a device that will deflect the vision
ray

  this house is surrounded by a strong magnetic
field which deflects the vision ray and prevents it from
penetrating the walls of the house also the voice
wave detector is rendered useless for the voice pulsa-
tions when picked up are carried on the vision beam
in some manner so inside the house we are free to
talk and move without fear of detection i have a
ray detector outside the house at a safe distance from
the magnetic field similar to the wrist watch indicator

it consists of two large coils of wire with a sensitive
magnetic needle balanced between them when the
ray energizes the coils and swings the needle out of
position a meter on my board registers it and a red 
light at the top of the center panel lights up this is
arranged so that i will know when he has the ray on
my house there have been many attempts to see
through my walls with the ray for i have papers that
the man is after

  opening a wall safe riel drew out a bundle of
papers

  here is the only existing set of plans of the skubic
light wave receiver the papers that i am sure the
criminal is after this device is said to record the
oscillations of light waves and pulsations of a certain
nature contained in these waves can at times be de-
tected on the chart or recording strip a study of
these markings seems to have proven beyond a doubt
that some one of intelligence must have produced them
and that they were not just freaks of nature a ger-
man produced the invention in america and wanted to
return to europe with drawings of it but fearing
that an attempt might be made to rob him he asked
scotland yard for protection and i was sent over i
was working on your case at the time trying to de-
termine how your liners were brought down i had
by then discovered that a vision ray was being used
and had built my protecting field around the house also
the planets air master	

using the compass attachment on my wrist watch

  secretly i called on him carefully disguised fear-
ing the criminal might be after the plans himself and
would be watching the inventor closely with the ray
in that i was right for i detected the ray every few
minutes while i was there taking advantage of a
moment when the ray was off i slipped his plans into
my brief case and substituted some others in their place
then instructing him to take the air liner to london
the next morning i left him and again changing
makeup left new york the same evening on your
eight-thirty cruiser you know the rest how the police
plane that was escorting one of your cruisers was
coaxed away from the ship which was brought down
and only the papers of the inventor were taken

  then why did he jump to his death during the trip
if he knew that the stolen papers were worthless and
that you still had his genuine ones safe

  he didnt jump to his death riel replied quietly
he was murdered

  what the eyes of the air line official opened
with amazement why man there were at least a
dozen passengers that witnessed the act he deliber-
ately swung his window down and jumped out

  listen wallace ive told you before that i am
sure that a power is being used that is many times as
deadly as the vision ray and the voice wave detector
combined it is this power that brings down your
liners the reason why no police are ever on the job
when a robbery occurs the same reason why the police
escort planes leave your cruisers just before they are
brought down and it was due to this deadly power
that the inventor was made to leap from the ship into
the ocean below he was murdered by the wizard who
thinking that he had the only copy of the plans caused
the mans death to prevent him from drawing a dupli-
cate set with the death of the inventor the criminal
would be in possession of the only set of the plans on
earth but there the man made his first mistake for
the papers that he got were worthless and the inventor
being dead there was only one thing that he could do
and that was to obtain the only set that was in ex-
istence just how he discovered that i was in possession
of them i dont know but knowing that i was track-
ing him down it is quite natural that he would
suspect me

  the theft of the vision ray apparatus some time
ago in paris the invention of a young frenchman was
undoubtedly the work of this man probably the
possession of that was the start of his mad career and
he has improved the ray and used it along with some
of his own inventions such as the sound wave detector
to serve him in his lust for power with it he has
probably been able to learn many of the worlds secrets
for there is little that is closed to him the vision ray
inventor however was able to make a duplicate model
of his device which is used universally to-day but as
you know it only has a range of about fifty miles so
you see the stolen one must have been greatly improved
the one our criminal uses has a range of two thou-
sand miles

riel explains

 ut why does he value this light wave receiver

d so high of what use would it be to him 

   it is believed that the signals detected by this device
are coming from another planet and undoubtedly he
believes that possibly he could learn many important
secrets with it once he learned to decipher the mes-

sages it would be dangerous to allow the plans to fall
into his hands for if his clever brain ever did unravel
the messages that the device received the knowledge
that he might learn would be of great assistance to him
in his attempt to become ruler of the earth which i
believe is his sole aim

  but to get back to the subject of importance wal-
lace i will need your help to-morrow in making a
test

  ill do anything i can was the ready reply

  well then in the morning we will both put on dis-
guises i must hide my identity in the future to hide
myself from the ray so i can work in secret now
you are the one that will return to new york on the
special in place of me i will tip off the yards that
it is i however this is to be positive that no one
knows that i remain here you are of my build and
will pass for me in disguise i will give you my iden-
tification disc for some of our men will be at the sheds
to see that no one else gets aboard when you get
to new york you are to take the papers that you will
find in the control room of the cruiser and place them
in a safety vault so that they are safe then keep out
of sight for a day or so and keep away from your old
haunts then when you are sure that the ray isnt
following you return here under a different makeup
however do not come up to this house unless you are
sure that the ray is not watching you or the house
your return must be made secretly

  what i want the wizard to do is to try and take the
papers that you will be carrying i am sending in the
package a complete set of drawings of the light wave
receiver with the exception of a chemical formula
that the drawings are useless without some of the
sheets of the drawings will be laid out on the desk of
my assistant at headquarters while the ray is on so
that the wizard can see for himself that they are the
real ones he will no doubt keep track of them until
they are placed in the control room of the cruiser or
given to you and he will most likely try to bring the
cruiser down to get the papers

  now here is where you come in you are to see
that he does not bring you down thats your job
wallace and unless i am wrong you have a big job
on your hands you will ride in the control room be-
side the pilot who will obey your slightest order no
matter what it is the reason that you are riding as
a switchboard tester is so that you will be close to the
operator all the way over and can prevent any attempt
by him to bring the liner down when you step on
board at the sheds make up your mind that you will not
allow the ship to leave the upper beam from the time
you start until you arrive over new york if in spite
of all you can do the ship is brought down and the
plans are taken away from you we will gain more than
we lose for i will have learned something of great
importance and he will have gained little

  you can depend my doing my best riel replied
wallace but by the way who was the visitor you
referred to when talking to your police officer

  we were trailed on the train by a man in working
clothes carrying a lunch bucket my suspicions were
aroused when i noticed during our wait for the train
that he handled the lunch box as if it was unnaturally
heavy the suspicions were confirmed when i pur-
posely brushed against it in the crowd and felt the
weight of it later he was near us on the car reading
a paper and all the way out to where we got off the
train i noticed that he gazed at the same comer of the
  it was a long spacious room equipped with all kinds of scientific apparatus at the base
  si the center panel a man was kneeling his hay was white and long and a black skull-
  cap covered the top of his head

 
the planet

page which was not likely of a man interested in
reading so i purposely talked of the drawings here
that i was going to show you expecting that he would
hear us and follow us here as an agent of the wizard
he would no doubt try to find the location of the
papers the one thing the ray hasnt yet been able to
do upon our arrival at the office i found that the
ray was on us and i planned the talk of shipping some
valuable papers across the ocean knowing that he
would suspect me of trying to secret the coveted plans
across and hide them in america when we left in the
plane i was glad to see that the ray was not following
us the wizard had undoubtedly thought that there
was little that we would do but plan the trip for to-
morrow so he let us go probably fearing possible
detection of his headquarters by too much use of his
ray the agent though will probably make an attempt
to learn something of the papers and follow us here if
he does my men will get him i want to get him out of
the way so ill be free to act in the next few days
now  call my assistant at the central office
so he can have his part of the job ready the detective
added going over to a desk in front of the control
board

  is there no danger of your message being over-
heard wallace asked

  not in the least for first my wireless system breaks
the message into pieces sending it out on three differ-
ent waves i have a disk that is rotated by a motor
mounted on the rear of the control board this disk
during one rotation makes contact with three different
circuits each radiating waves of a different frequency
now the message pulsations pass through the disk and
are cut up and only every third pulsation is thrown
onto any one circuit then it is easy to regulate the
speed of the disk so that it will break up the message
sufficiently to be unintelligible when received on any one
wave also to make the message extra safe i some-
times use coded words which my assistant and i have
arranged further we keep the combination settings
of the two sets a secret for you know he must set
the receiving instrument at the same wave-lengths as
mine and must also set the speed of his reassembling
disk motor to correspond with the speed of mine to
assemble the messages correctly

final instructions

seating himself at the desk the sleuth lifted his
phone and pressed a button a moment later a
small white light lit up on one of the panels and riel
spoke into the transmitter

  i am returning to new york on a special i a l
at ten in the morning in disguise and i want you to
let the ray see some of the sheets of that duplicate
set of l w plans be sure and have them on board
the cruiser when i arrive i will ride in the control
room with the operator who must be instructed to obey
my every order during the trip regardless of what it
is i will speak to no one at the sheds but will have
my disc for identification the ray will no doubt be
on you in the morning as usual to look over the papers
on your desk and mine

  as he shut off his wireless instrument two police
officers entered the room with a man in custody
wallace recognized the prisoner as the man that he
had seen on the train the man that riel had said was
an agent of the wizard one of the officers carried
the lunch bucket in one hand

good work congratulated the sleuth just take

air master	

him below for the time being but leave the tin bucket
here

  placing the lunch container on the table the two
officers left the room with their prisoner

  i am glad that we have him out of our way riel
remarked as he walked over to the table for i be-
lieve he is the only agent in london now well see
what is in the bucket

  carefully he opened the lid and at the sight of the
contents both men drew closer to it the box con-
tained a sort of radio device neatly packed in place

  that is what i expected riel mused as he ex-
amined the outfit but how-oh here we are two
wires come up to the handle and connect to a vibrator
bar under the handle you see wallace he continued
turning to his guest how he was able to overhear
conversation that was too low for his ears to detect
this device detects the sound waves changes them to
electrical pulsations amplifies them up and through
the wires to the handle over the vibrator bar by
holdings his fingers against the bar our eaves-
dropper received the vibrations which affected his
senses as well as sound waves striking his ear drums
no doubt when we take time to examine this device
we will find that it contains a means for adjustment
to different frequencies of sound waves so that the
conversation of one person can be picked out from
among a crowd

  i would suggest questioning the prisoner wallace
replied we can probably get some important in-
formation from him

  he probably knows nothing riel answered i
expect he is under the influence of the master crim-
inal and probably does not know that the wizard even
exists

  then if our clever foe can press any one into his
service he will soon have another man on the job to
take the place of this one

  he will when he is sure that we have his man but
i intend to give our wizard other things to attract his
attention to-morrow and he will likely be too busy to
pay much attention to the man but i think that we
should have some lunch and get some sleep for we
have work to do in the morning and you especially
must be fully rested to do your part well

chapter v
against their will

at about ten-thirty the next morning wallace
disguised as riel entered the air sheds of the
i a l and showing the doorkeeper his iden-
tification disc was quickly escorted to the special the
pilot was at his post all ready to start

  well leave immediately wallace instructed the
operator as soon as he saw that the package was on
board and you will not need to pass through the
london station just use your manual controls until
you reach the upper beam

  the motors were soon humming with a smooth mu-
sical note and as the huge doors of the sheds rolled
open the special started forward and was soon speed-
ing down the field wallace was climbing into a suit
of overalls as the liner took the air the pilot drew
in the landing gear and having nothing more to do
sat down beside the operator the steady climb soon
brought them to the upper beam and as the cruiser
righted herself the battery of motors began to hurl
her forward with increasing speed the sky was
	air wonder stories

cloudy over the british coast and at times nothing
could be seen but heavy banks of clouds but the craft
kept to the beam and was allowed to continue its
terrific speed tearing blindly along through rolling
banks of fog

  there may be a chance of getting through this trip
if the fog sticks with us until we get a good start
wallace remarked

  i doubt it sir replied the operator ive been
forced down twice and theres something uncanny about
it when they want the ship to drop it drops and
somehow or other a fellow cant prevent it

  im positive said wallace that they are using a
cross-beam similar to our landing cross-beam this
would start the ship downward but at any rate we
will make damn sure that no one brings us down this
trip for if our automatic controls fail us we will use
the manual levers

  as they sped along the atmosphere cleared up for
about a half hour then they ran into an even foggier
area and the heavy rolling fog-banks were sent flying
past the speeding craft on both sides

  i should think wed enjoy the trip better if we
were to drop down a little out of this clouded area
suggested wallace

  his pilot was evidently thinking the same thing for
he asked shall we leave the beam and drop down a
little

  the official readily consented and the pilot using
the manual controls dropped down out of the beam
they had not traveled far before they were below the
clouds with the sea far below in plain view still the
cruiser dropped steadily losing altitude as it continued
to the west the two men had apparently forgot
about the clouds for they were allowing the craft to
steadily drop without interruption they were now
only a thousand feet above the ocean but still they
continued down to every thousand feet that they trav-
eled west they dropped a hundred until the ship bit
the crest of a wave flew on hit the water again and
settled down onto the ocean like a monstrous sea gull

  the pilot half absent-mindedly stopped the ship and
turned to wallace you are supposed to be posing as
a control tester mr riel so here is a good chance to
find out what is the matter with the ship

  wallace realized that he was on board for that pur-
pose and turning to the mass of controls on the dif-
ferent panels decided that he might as well look them
over and see what he could find out about them

  neither of the two men noticed a third enter the
room and stand looking at them with a quiet smile on
his face he was the same person that had taken the
papers from riel on the former trip

  suddenly wallaces head cleared and he took in the
situation he could not recollect how the ship had
been brought down or why he should find himself
crawling among the wiring behind the control panels
but things were now clear to him and he watched the
calm figure of the intruder waiting to see what his
next move would be the pilot was none the less
puzzled and he vainly tried to grasp the situation
here he was again floating on the surface of the sea
after he had made up his mind that he was going to
get through on this trip at all costs

  well riel the bandit addressed wallace you
will come along with me the boss wants to ask you a
few questions and it will be useless for you to resist
because you can do nothing

  im not riel im-

  we know who you are the boss knows more
about your business than you do so come along

  there was nothing else to do so instructing the
pilot to return to london he walked out of the control
room with the bandit following entering the baggage
room he detected through the left door which was
open the little white plane which had so successfully
eluded all police planes in the cabin he was forced
to swallow a small tablet which the captor handed him
and in a few minutes was lost in sleep

meeting the wizard

when wallace opened his eyes he was lying on
a bed in a small room rising to a sitting posi-
tion he pondered over the situation his brain was
slow in clearing up due to the effects of the sleeping
tablet but it was not long before he remembered every-
thing he had been kidnapped as riel apparently
the criminal leader desired to get the sleuth into his
power and hearing the talk in the offices of the i a l
had stopped the liner to get riel and had got him
instead wallace seeing that his disguise was not dis-
turbed walked quietly to the door opening it softly

  the door opened up into the side and near the end
of a large room it was a long spacious room fully
equipped with all types of scientific apparatus along
the wall opposite to his door ran a bench about two-
thirds of the room in length or approximately twenty-
five feet long this was fully equipped with a com-
plete outlay of chemical experimental and testing equip-
ment the rest of the room was filled with the great-
est display of electrical equipment that he had ever
laid eyes on stepping into the room he found that
along the wall near which he was standing was a
second bench running about the same distance down
the room as the other this was constructed of grey
slate and covered with all sorts of electrical instru-
ments and parts wires and partly-assembled devices
many of which he had never seen before much of
the material was connected by loose wiring-probably
for testing above the bench mounted on the wall were
a row of marble panels extending the length of the
bench and fastened so that any one panel could be
taken down with little trouble the different panels
were electrically connected together by a type of spring
switch that could be disconnected by a mere touch of
the hand the mass of equipment on these panels was
too complicated and too unfamiliar for him to even
make a guess as to their use at the far end of the
room about six feet beyond the end of the work
benches was a massive instrument-board reaching from
the floor to about eight feet in height and about two-
thirds the room in width or approximately twenty feet
every panel on the board was literally covered with
dials meters coils and other controls in the center
of the room was a long table with chairs around it
many instruments push-buttons meters and such were
sunk into the polished top of the table leaving the
surface unobstructed and in front of each chair
around the table were squares of frosted glass about
six inches square and supported vertically by an ad-
justable bracket so that it could be tilted into different
positions similar to a mirror on a dresser frank
judged that the heavy ornamental table legs must be
hollow and carried all the wiring from the table con-
trols and instruments for he could see no other outlet
in fact if he was not somewhat familiar with such
work he would have doubted that there were any
the planets air master	

wires around the table for not an inch of wiring could
be seen

  then riel was right he thought this must be the
work room of a clever scientist who was using this
electrical equipment to control the world with a
sound from the direction of the switchboard attracted
his attention and looking in that direction he noticed
for the first time a man kneeling at the base of the
center panel his hair was white and long but his
slightly wrinkled face was clean shaven his bent
shoulders indicated that the work of continually bend-
ing over instruments and drawings was beginning to
tell on him a small black skull-cap covcred the top
of his head and a cord running down from it was con-
nected to the panel he was apparently busy testing
something out for he had not as yet noticed wallace

  this must be the wizard thought frank as he
silently watched his captor as far as i can see from
a side view he doesnt seem to be the devil that i ex-
pected to meet but you cant always tell a man by
his looks

  his thoughts were interrupted by the other rising
and removing his cap you are right he spoke
tuning and advancing toward his visitor with a quiet
but baffling smile you cant tell a man by his looks
my advice is to make sure of him by testing him out

  wallaces mouth opened in amazement as his host
continued you seem surprised mr wallace that i
can read your thoughts i in turn am surprised that
a simple demonstration of mental telepathy should so
astonish you

  mental telepathy such a thing is impossible you
no doubt knew what was on my mind by reading my
face

  then you dont believe it is possible to read an-
other mans thoughts

  of course not it has been tried often but has
never been done and never will such a thing is
impossible

  in a few minutes i will endeavor to change your
mind on the subject but first allow me to introduce
myself as j b jolsen you may as well make your-
self comfortable for your visit will likely be a long
one you may also take off your disguise for  am
sure that you will be more comfortable without it it
was very clever of riel to substitute you in his place
and also very careless of me not to have noticed my mis-
take before i brought you here but any way i may
find a use for you later on but to return to the sub-
ject of mental telepathy you are like the average
man you must see a thing done or else you brand it
as impossible

the wizards power

the wizard seemed to be in his favorite role when
lecturing on science and frank was willing to hear

him

  i have worked a long time on the theory that the
human brain radiates vibrations or waves which by
using a suitable system could be detected

  you mean you can turn a mans thoughts info
speech gasped wallace

  exactly and while working on a ray by which i
could collect and carry the thought waves to my ampli-
fying and transforming device i accidentally found a
way to improve the vision ray that i am now using
greatly increasing its range having developed the
vision ray i used it in my further experiments to pro-
duce the telepathy ray and it is well that i did for

after producing a high frequency wave that would
carry along the vision ray i knew that i had dis-
covered it

  his prisoner was silent he could see the logic of the
mans words he knew now what riel meant by an-
other power he recollected how it was used on them
to reveal the hiding place of the papers during the rob-
bery of the liner which he and riel were taking to
london also the reason why he and the pilot had been
so willing to bring the ship down on the last trip the
wizard was indeed entitled to the name of master of
the earth

  for two persons to exchange thoughts his host con-
tinued it is necessary that their brains be of like
character for the human brain is similar to the wire-
less instruments when one wireless set sends a
message into space the set that receives the message
must be adjusted to a wave length that is the circuit
that receives the message must be adjusted so that it
will be most sensitive to the frequency of the waves
that are carrying the message the human brain works
on the same principle in respect to telepathy two
persons having brains whose characteristics are sim-
ilar will be more successful at mental telepathy than
others but mental telepathy will never be a success
because the thought waves that a man tries to receive
from another are so feeble that his own thoughts
drown them out and it is almost impossible to free the
brain from ones own thoughts sufficiently to make it
sensitive enough to receive the thought waves of an-
other so you can easily see that there is but one
thing to do and that is to build up the thought waves
until they are strong enough to be detected by the
other brain in fact if you build them up strong
enough and pass them through another mans head
they will take possession and control of his brain by
being more powerful than his own thoughts

  you mean that you can force one man to think the
thoughts of another

  exactly i will prove it

  as he spoke the wizard turned to the electrically
equipped bench and commenced to adjust a number
of controls on some of the panels mounted on the wall
while wallace watched him wondering what was about
to happen next

  but in a moment he forgot about the present he
thought about the events of the trip from london he
remembered the trip through the endless banks of
clouds and he wondered if after all it wasnt better to
leave the beam and travel below the clouds in such
cases

  his thoughts were interrupted by the scientist say-
ing well is that proof enough

  i wasnt noticing you admitted the other i was
thinking of-

  you were thinking the same thoughts that occupied
your mind before you brought the liner down yester-
day or i might say the thoughts that i put into
your head to make you bring it down i used again
just now to prove my power over the rest of mankind

  i can read any mans thoughts and learn all his
secrets i can put his thoughts into another mans
brain and not only cause one man to talk anothers
thoughts but as the brain controls the body i can
make him do what i wish i can make him hate love
steal murder or whatever i wish him to do by con-
trol of mans brain i am master of this planet all
men are my servants

  frank was utterly dumbfounded but gradually the
	air wonder stories

full horror of it came to him to think that man was
no longer master of his own brain no longer able to
say what he wanted or remain quiet when he wanted
to he realized the havoc and madness the telepathy
could create in the world people were no longer free
to think without this man knowing all about it hu-
man beings would live in a nightmare afraid to think
for fear of others hearing them even in the secrecy
of their own homes the world would know every
thought flashed through their minds he remembered
how he had imagined the panic that the wizards vision
ray would cause if the public ever knew of its existence
and use but there was a protection against the vision
ray as riel had proved a person had merely to pro-
duce a magnetic field of sufficient strength to ward it
off ones home could then be screened off from it
and ones secrets guarded

  wallace closed his eyes and then more clearly
realized the devilish effects of this thing the vision
ray would at least allow you to think in secret but
now even when one was thinking how was one to know
whether the thoughts were ones own or those of some
one else how could one tell when he talked whether
he was speaking thoughts of his own or those of some
other person it was madness it was hellish a
person was far better off dead

what the wizard revealed

as these thoughts ran madly through franks brain
he had forgotten about the scientist who was stand-
ing near him with an amused smile on his face

  and you intend to use these devilish instruments
against mankind to satisfy your greed for power
wallace demanded finally

  i will use it against any one who stands between
me and my goal was the cool reply i will if neces-
sary turn one-half of the world against the other half
in a war that will completely wreck your civilization
you can accomplish nothing by that for your own
existence is dependent upon civilization

  the scientist shook his head

  during the excitement of war it will be easy for
me to obtain certain papers that your friend riel has in
his possession in fact when the world powers see
that i am able to fulfill my threats there will be no
delay in getting the papers for me i was about to
send word to your detective friend telling him when
to send me the drawings when you entered now if
you will excuse me i will carry out my task and inas-
much as riel uses a triple-circuit wireless in his office
we will send him a message through it i built a
duplicate of his set for this reason i had little diffi-
culty getting the plans from dr forest who invented
the system first we will put the vision ray on his
office and see if anyone is there we must read the
dial setting of his instruments now if you will take
a seat here at the table i will show you the power that
i have in the vision ray alone

  going over to the experimental work bench he re-
turned with two head-riggings and handed one to wal-
lace showing him how to adjust it onto his head and
plug the projecting cord into the table the head gear
consisted of a leather cap that fitted closely over the head
and containing a sort of felt lining a strap ran down
each side of the face from this cap and fastened below
the chin ear units covering the ears were attached
to the strap also a close-fitting mouth unit and a
black mask stretched across the eyes having two pale

blue convex glasses to see through were also attached
to the side straps of the head gearing

  wallace adjusted his mask and adjusted the square
of glass on the table until he could see it best though
at best he could see little through the blue glasses

  when you want to talk the scientists voice sounded
in his ear units use your mouth attachment and turn
dial four in front of you this gives me the signal
and i can connect my head set with yours for when
we are not talking we must keep our ear units con-
nected onto the voice wave amplifier to hear the sounds
that our ray receives

  wallace was mystified at the pleasant mood of his
captor but decided to accept the hospitality and learn
all he could then perhaps a chance would come in
which he could assist his friends on the outside to
overpower the master criminal

  this small wheel here continued the wizard
through the phone circuits and pointing to a control
in front of him controls the ray pointer which is
located on the roof this meter between our chairs
is divisioned off and marked similar to a compass
the thin black pointer which is pointing nne indi-
cates the direction that the ray pointer is turned to
it is now pointing north by northeast which will pass
the ray through london now watch your reflector
plate and i will turn on the ray

  the scientist turned twisted and turned a number
of table controls and presently there was a scraping
sound in the phones the glass plate lit up in a momen-
tary flash and was dark again then again it fluttered
and this time remained dimly illuminated the upper
part of the glass seemed to reflect the light a little
brighter than the lower half but again the light
shifted and the blur began to fade while the sound of
rushing wind could be heard in the ear units gradu-
ally the scene cleared and the upper or brighter half
could be recognized as the sky and the lower part as
water with the clearing of the scene the hearing
device cleared up too and the sound of the wind and
the occasional breaking of a wave could be heard
plainly under the guidance of the masters fingers
the scene swept past the little reflector plate at a fast
rate until the outline of the british coast could be seen
followed quickly by the waterfront of london soon
towering buildings of the city were filling the scene
a moment later a single building had been singled out
by the nimble fingers of the wizard and was quickly
brought to a close-up

a test of power

closer and closer the building approached and
the noises of the city increased steadily now the
scene had focussed on the building itself until only one
small section of the wall was filling the scene it was so
close that the bricks could be counted with little dif-
ficulty another change began to take place and the
bricks of the wall gradually faded as another scene
took its place as it cleared wallace gave a start it
was the office of graham the london manager of the
i a l

  graham was talking to a man that wallace had not
seen before

  but if riel was the only one that went on the liner
then where is mr wallace grahams voice sounded
in their ear units he was last seen in company with
the detective

  there is no need to worry about mr wallace
assured the stranger he is undoubtedly safe but
the planets air master	s

is remaining in hiding for some reason you know that
only riel was on the liner at the time it was held up
so your friend is undoubtedly still in the city
suddenly the scene went dark and looking over
at his host wallace saw him removing his head-set and
followed suit
set and followed suit

  that man is from the offices of scotland yard
ive had reasons to trail him on one or two occasions
before a very clever man but in comparison with
my brain and power he is but a school boy i alone
of all human beings am entitled to the word clever
as i shall presently prove once i have the plans of
the light wave receiver in my hands i will be ruler
of the earth your friend of the detective force shall
bring them to me for i know that he has them
why do you put so much value in the receiver
you may be unable to decipher the code because the
language is unknown to us

  there you are mistaken again his host corrected
for the language is very similar to french which i
can read and speak very well

  you are only guessing for there is no way that
we can find out the language

  i have obtained a recorded strip of pulsations re-
ceived by this device and by changing the pulsations
into electro-magnetic impulses i amplified them then
changing the amplified pulsations into sound waves
through the voice producer i recorded the sound and
have it to study at my leisure

  then you have been able to read the message
yes all but a few words which are somewhat con-
fused but it is not difficult to guess the meaning of
them having transformed the message to french i
translated it then into english so when i get the
light yvave receiver i will be able to connect up my
system so that the message will be automatically re-
ceived changed to electrical impulses amplified and
recorded in french which is the language that is being
used by means of the device i will learn many of
the secrets of the super-intelligent planet that is send-
ing the messages for it is undoubtedly the work of
another planet finally by adding their knowledge to
my own i may not only be ruler of the earth but the
master of the solar system only the possession of
the plans is needed for accomplishing my purpose
but i will get them for what i want i have the power
to get i will sit as ruler of the earth while i pre-
pare for my conquest of the solar system

  tlie eyes of the master mind shone with fierce light
as he warmed up to his talk

  we will now get the combination of riels triple
wave wireless set so that i can send him the message
privately	v

  noticing the surprised look on the face of his pris-
oner the old man continued

  you no doubt are wondering how i can read the
dials of riels wireless set which is protected from my
ray by a magnetic field

  that is what i was wondering about

  then put your mask on again and i will show you
how helpless your friend is against me you will see
how utterly useless it is fo him to hold out and
especially to try to bring about my downfall

  the ray was soon on again and with little trouble
jolsen had focussed the scene on the headquarters of
scotland yard a moment later the scene was ad-
justed so that they were looking into a single room
the details of the room stood out quite plainly with

the exception of one corner that produced a sort of
orange-colored glow but whether it was the fault
of the vision set or was caused by a bright lamp in the
corner of the room wallace was unable to tell there
was no one in the room at the time but the desk was
littered with papers indicating that someone had been
there recently

  do you notice the glowing spot in the comer
jolsen asked through the phone circuit then with-
out waiting for a reply continued that is where the
triple wave wireless receiver is that glow is caused
by the magnetic field deflecting my ray it is a good
barrier at that distance for i cannot produce suf-
ficient pressure to break it down but if that field
was within two hundred miles of me it would be use-
less for i could break through it with ease riels
other protecting field also would be of no use to him
at close range

  then your attempt to read the combination of the
triple circuit receiver is useless wallace said tri-
umphantly

  ignoring him the old man shifted the ray again and
they were soon looking into the basement of the build-
ing the switchboard that controlled the lights and
power of the building appearing before their eyes for
a moment the wizard surveyed the scene and again
changed the ray shifting it around the room until he
brought it to rest in one corner where a workman sat
reading a paper

  this man is the maintenance electrician for the
building hejnformed his guest now you are about
to see how i give orders to the world and how quick
and faithful it does my bidding

  a few more buttons and dials moved beneath the
mans fingers the man in the scene looked up from
his paper and scratched his head in deep thought and
finally deciding something he rose and approached the
switchboard quickly jolsen brought the board up
close in the scene as the man stopped in front of the
panels and looked over the different breakers and
trips again the fingers of jolsen moved a dial and
the next instant the man in the scene tripped the larg-
est circuit-breaker on the board instantly the scene
changed and that of the office was seen again the glow
in the comer was now gone and the cabinet of the
wireless set could be seen on a table and a device that
wallace judged was the recording device was resting
on the receiver another moment and the wizard had
a close view of the set so close that the dials could be
seen and the settings read with ease

  it was but a few seconds until the old man had copied
the dial readings and then suddenly the glow in the
comer returned

chapter vi
a message

after shutting off the ray jolsen removed his
mask and wallace did likewise

 you see i have the combination remarked
the wizard with a smile and it was very little trouble

  you used your telepathy ray asked wallace

  yes you see the power that is used to produce the
field around the wireless set is taken from the lighting
circuits and to remove the field all that i had to do
was to turn off the power that i did by putting
thoughts into the brain of the electrician to that effect
controlled by the thoughts that took possession of
his mind he went over to the board and tripped the
main breaker throwing the power off the whole build-
	air wonder stories

ing this of course removed the power that was
supplying the magnetic field and the result was that
there was no more field of course as soon as i
removed the ray from the man in the basement he
was in command of his own senses and seeing the
breaker was out no doubt he thought that it tripped
out on account of overload so to prevent him from
throwing it back in i could have led him away from
the place or done a dozen other things with him to
keep him away had i wished but i did not want to
leave the power off too long for it would lead them to
investigate riel hearing of it might get suspicious

  then you are going to send the message to his
office

  no to his home the two sets will be adjusted to
the same setting so i can send my message via his
office set to his home

  but you could have taken the reading of the set at
his house as well as at his office wallace said puzzled

  no the protecting field around his house is not sup-
plied from the power lines like the one in the office
he has no doubt a small independent generating plant
in the house and as it is inside the field i cannot find
a way to throw the power

  then your telepathy ray is of no use outside of the
vision beam

  no when the vision beam is deflected the telepathy
ray is also deflected for it is carried on the beam now
i will get the circuit settings changed to correspond
with those of riels set you may stay here at the ray
and use it and if you would like to change the adjust-
ment use these two dials here oh there is no chance
of you learning too much he added noticing the
puzzled look on the others face i will see to that
if you did learn some of my most important secrets i
would have no cause for worry because it is impossible
for you to escape from here this place is located on
an uncharted island

  with these words he disconnected his mask from the
table and took it over to the experimental bench wal-
lace watched the wizard adjust some of the controls
and automatic contactors on the wall panels then
donning the head set again frank pressed the vision
ray contactor button the reflector screen lighted up
at the touch and the office scene was again before his
eyes but now there was someone at the desk he
had no doubt but that the man was riels assistant
and wondered if he was aware that the ray was on
him a closer adjustment of the scene soon satisfied
him for the man wore a wrist watch and wallace
noticed him look at it occasionally could he signal the
man the thought flashed through the officials brain
he knew the international wireless code perhaps by
shutting off the ray and switching it on at long and
short intervals the detective would notice it he would
try nervously his fingers pressed the ray button on
and off as he spelled the word rid twice then
switching on the ray he watched the man closely but
the fellow did not seem to notice for he continued
writing at his desk and seemed absorbed in his work
a moment later however the man leaned back in his
chair and looking up spoke

  all right wallace wish we could help you but dont
lose hope

  his heart beat faster as he heard the words then the
man had read the message and knew that he was a
prisoner he felt greatly relieved that riel would
know that he was alive and in the laboratory of the
wizard he also realized that riel would perhaps look

for help from him in case they attempted to attack
the place

  there was a tap on his shoulder and wallace re-
moved his head set to see his host standing behind
him

  the detective didnt receive your signals by means
of the wrist watch the old man remarked with an
amused smile on his face he has a similar indicator
on his desk that he can watch but i shall have to see
that you send no more signals or keep you from using
the ray

  isnt there anything i can do without you knowing
it asked the disgusted prisoner

  if there was you might do me harm as it is you
are harmless i allowed you to send your message be-
cause you can do yourself little good or me little harm
the world is in my power and your feeble rebellious
attempts will not help you any in fact they might
prove advantageous to me for by reading your thoughts
just now i found that your friends were using a wrist
watch as a ray indicator a thing i did not know before
but i am ready to send them the message put your
mask on again and you will hear it as it is being sent
we will also watch the set at the office to be sure that
it records cortectly

a threat made good

with masks adjusted a few controls were moved
in front of each of the men and a red dial care-
fully turned a scraping sound in the ear pieces gave
way to words

  detective riel will place the drawings of the skubic
light wave receiver on an air liner which will leave
london to-morrow morning at  for new york if
he fails to do this i will create a reign of terror
through england that in horror will be beyond imagina-
tion by order of the planets air master

  the message is now recorded on his oscillograph
the wizard informed his captive now he is going to
switch the announcer into circuit listen

  a moment later their head sets were connected with
the sound wave panel of the vision ray apparatus and
the detective could be heard adjusting the dials as he
stepped to the set to see what message had come in
as he did the announcer spoke out the message to him
the man stood before it a moment or two as if tem-
porarily stunned a deep look of worry came over his
face then slowly shutting off the set he returned to
the desk

  a slight disturbance on one of the meters caused old
jolsen to leave the scene of the office and throw the
ray around the sky sweeping back and forth and at
the same time watching the meter in a few moments
he had the beam on a fleet of six planes that were
approaching

  wallace also saw them and his heart gave an extra
beat as he realized that they were probably following
the beam in an endavor to trace it to its source his
hopes rose further as he recognized the slightly tapered
wings of the burley plane used by the american police
the wizard was quietly watching them as he kept them
in the ray

  this is my opportunity to demonstrate to you my
powers he boasted through the phone circuits as he
began to adjust some more controls and draw the scene
closer ill show you the powers of my telepathy ray
and at the same time illustrate what happens to those
who meddle into my affairs

he busied himself on a few more dials while frank
the planets air master	

wondered what his game was thinking that the wizard
would lead them off the trail

  now the ray is on watch the greatest demonstra-
tion of power ever seen on earth the cool boastful
voice sounded in his ears

  frank needed no invitation to watch he sat tensed
watching to see the effects of this ray suddenly the
fleet of planes broke formation and commenced circling
one another in a strange and disorderly way

  looks like  have to strengthen the ray the
wizard was saying they have picked men with very
strong will-power but ill break them with less than
a kilowatt increase

  more adjustments were made with some of the many
controls under his hands as frank glued his eyes to
the scene then he gave a quick start and his face
paled the planes were now racing around each other
at maximum speed then he heard the rat-tat-tat the
unmistakable sound of a machine gun that added its
noise to the hum of the motors there could be no
doubt that they were shooting at something suddenly
the truth of the situation came to him and a chill of
horror ran through his body under the power of the
telepathy ray they were shooting each other down like
mad-men each one undoubtedly saw himself sur-
rounded by a flock of savage beasts the ray was
filling their brains with a bestial rage and each ship
was pouring shells and gas streams into the rest at every
opportunity

the terror

driven almost insane himself by the slaughter
before his eyes frank savagely tore the rigging
from his head he would smash the ray control panels
or die in the attempt seeing the other was still wear-
ing his mask and watching the scene closely wallace
glanced over at the main control switchboard on which
was mounted most of the control units of the telepathy
ray in one moment he could rip the mess of fine
wires behind the panels and put the ray out of com-
mission thus saving the lives of the men who were
now butchering each other quickly but quietly he
rose from the chair but the moment he left the
cushions se seemed seized with pain and he sank back
unable to move a limb suddenly as the cramp seized
him it left him again

  i was expecting you to do something contrary to
my wishes the wizard had removed his head set
and was regarding his companion with an amused ex-
pression on his face i adjusted the paralyzer ray on
you you set it off when you attempted to leave your
chair but come you are missing a fine scene and
donning the head apparatus again the scientist was soon
gloating over the scene before him on the reflector
plate wallace realizing the uselessness of any further
attempt to destroy the ray put on his own head set
again

  the scene that met his eyes was horrible there
were now only five ships in the air and there were
fighting each other in the most savage and desperate
way possible recklessly spraying streams of bullets
around and about them and using the deadly gas guns
at every opportunity suddenly one broke out in
flames but the two members of the crew stuck to their
posts and the blazing craft tore through the group
firing left and right until it shot down like a flaming
meteor disappearing in a bank of steam as it struck
the water the scientist adjusted the controls until
they were looking into the interior of one of the ships

the man at the gun was sending streams of shells at
every chance while the pilot with cruel set face sent
the ship careening around the battle area the loud
roar of the engines and guns at close range were ring-
ing in their ears so loudly that old jolsen had to re-
duce the sound with the volume regulator one plane
taking a wide circle left the center of battle and in a
moment the wizard had the center of the ray on it
the gunman was looking around desperately for a
plane to shoot at then turning to his pilot he paused
a moment while rage and hate registered on his face
then with a savage oath he sprang on the back of
his companion fighting madly like beasts under the
influence of the damnable ray the two men rolled
clawed and scrambled among the controls while the
unguided craft sped to its doom a few moments
later the tortured minds of the two men were calmed
by death as the sea closed over them

  tearing the mask from his head again wallace
leaned back in his chair weak and pale

  good god he stammered as the other turned to
him if i ever get a chance to make you pay for this
you  pay dear you must have the soul of the devil
for no human could slaughter his fellow man like that

  the wizard merely smiled the same cool maddening
smile what you have seen is but an infinitesimal
part of what is to come if this world forces me to
declare war on it

  frank rose wearily from his chair he was sick
mentally and physically he had received all that he
could stand for one day he wanted to rest and forget
the nightmare entering the little bed-room he flung
himself down on the bed in misery but the mental
strain was too much for him and he soon fell into a
deep sleep

the world obeys

the sun was high in the sky when he awoke the
following morning for a moment he wondered
where he was then the events of the previous day
returned to his mind remembering the threat of the
wizard he was anxious to see if the air cruiser would
have the plans and what the wizard would do if he
failed to get them he had slept all night in his
clothes and wasted no time in stepping out into the
laboratory

  good morning i hope you had a good rest was
old man jolsens greeting from the table where he was
going over some plans frank made no reply and the
old man pressing a button continued his work a
door at the end of the room on wallaces right opened
and a butler appeared

  take care of any of this gentlemans needs the
wizard ordered

  this way sir the butler politely requested him
leading the way out through the door

  frank noticed that the bathroom windows were not
barred or protected in any visible way nor those in the
small luxuriously furnished dining room but he had
no idea of attempting to escape he had no doubt but
that the place was well protected for he knew that a
man like the wizard would take no unnecessary chances
he also realized that with such a calamity as the tele-
pathy ray threatening the world he would be of no use
on the outside while he might be able to accomplish
something from within

  the breakfast that was served was an excellent meal
it was evident that the scientist had no trouble in
	air wonder stories

obtaining any of the worlds delkacies when he needed
them

  when he returned to the laboratory the wizard was
at the table using the vision ray and frank not caring
to miss anything slipped into his chair and donned
his head set and the scene that met his eyes he quickly
recognized as the air line station in london

  they had not long to wait until a westbound cruiser
glided in stopping to receive its load of passengers and
baggage

  the wizard swept the three platforms and the in-
terior of the liner with the ray watching the people
closely but he seemed to detect nothing unusual noth-
ing to lead him to think that the detective organization
was sending the plans out on that liner he then tried
the telepathy ray on some of the officials and the liner
crew but no thoughts could be read indicating any
knowledge of the papers frank connected to the
transforming unit of the telepathy detector could hear
the thought message as well as his host it appeared
as if the police were intending to defy him

  suddenly the wizard straightened up a slight hum
could be heard in the ear units tearing his head set
rigging off he leaped across to the automatic wireless
recorder and switched on the announcer there was
a scraping noise and as it died down a mans voice
sounded clear and distinct in the instrument

  light wave plans leaving on air cruiser  s p

  that was all the instrument became silent

  you see they are beginning to realize the power i
hold exclaimed the master criminal his eyes gleaming
with greedy pleasure

  returning to the vision ray apparatus he swung the
ray to the south and soon had it adjusted on a heavily
wooded island frank gazing through his mask was
unable to determine the location of the island but he
noticed that the trees appeared to resemble those seen
in the tropical regions he therefore decided that the
island must be somewhere in the torrid zone

  as the scene was adjusted to appear closer he de-
tected a small snow-white plane lying in the water
close to the shore partly sheltered by the wide-spread-
ing foliage of the trees he recognized the plane as
the one that made the raid on the air cruiser during the
trip to london with riel and also the same plane that
had carried him from the air liner he could see no
sign of the pilot however nor anyone else in the
island but he was sure that the air man had a hut
in the woods somewhere

  for a moment the scene remained in front of his
eyes then it was shut off and he saw the scientist
removing his head rigging

  just gave my man orders to look over the baggage
room of your airship he informed his prisoner as
the latter removed his head apparatus

  i didnt hear you do any talking replied frank

  i didnt talk i just use my thoughts and put them
on the beam he receives his orders direct from brain
to brain as you noticed he was not even in sight and
i did not increase the pressure of the vision ray suf-
ficiently to look through the trees i merely threw the
telepathy ray across die center of the isle where his
cabin is so i know that he will receive the message
even if he is asleep the thoughts will impress them-
selves on his mind that he will awaken with a clear
remembrance of the message

  again he turned to the table and they were soon
following the ray as it was trained onto the air
cruiser which was now well out at sea speeding

along the upper air beam towards new york the

vision ray was soon adjusted so that the baggage room
was exposed to the eyes of the two men and with little
difficulty they found the package a small wooden box
a little over a foot square plainly marked light wave
receiver there was no address on the box in fact
no other marking except the three words

  it had evidently been placed in the baggage room
after the ray had been taken from the ship as it lay
in the station because the previous search of the bag-
gage room revealed no sign of the box

  the wizard gave a chuckle of satisfaction which pro-
duced an uncanny sound in the ear units

  wallace noticed that there were four men in the
baggage room instead of the usual two the box was
placed conspicuously as though they wanted to make
sure it could be found he suspected that riel was
at the bottom of the movement and that they had a
trap of some sort to spring on the raider when he
made his usual call he wondered if the detective
knew the full power of the telepathy ray and if in
some way he was going to overcome it his thoughts
were disturbed by the sudden shifting of the ray as the
scientist took a look to see if the plane was on the job
but the little white plane was already swiftly cutting
through the clouds occasionally fading from sight as
its color blended with the white background disappear-
ing altogether as it dived into the white masses

chapter vii
new hope

the old man was apparently satisfied with the
progress of the plane for he left it and swept the
sky for signs of any police planes the ray de-
tected a squad of four planes flying west about fifty
miles behind the liner and flying much lower they
were being outdistanced rapidly by the cruiser but the
wizard thought they were too close to be comfortable
and he again switched on the telepathy ray and under
the guidance of his devilish brain the planes were turned
north and led away from the path of the swift air
liner when they were far enough out of the way to
satisfy him the telepathy ray was taken off and the
vision ray switched back to the speeding air cruiser

  this time the control room was placed on the scene
and wallace gripped the arms of his chair as he
realized that he was about to see the manner in which
all the previously raided air cruisers of the i a l had
been brought down for ten minutes the ray was
allowed to follow the cruiser and no attempt was made
to use the second ray the clever wizard was biding
his time he no doubt would bring the liner down at a
certain spot towards which the little white plane was
speeding

  we have a number of hours to wait now the
wizard said turning to wallace i will call you
when something interesting happens

  wallace rose and sauntered through the room rest-
ing for awhile in his own

  finally a man appeared to conduct him back to the
laboratory

  we have the liner now the old man said watch
it wallace put on the head set and saw the interior
of the air-liner

  the pilot was leaning against the window of his room
watching an occasional ship pass on the surface of the
ocean far below occasionally his view would be ob-
the planets air master	

structed by the clouds floating in the air below he
would see only a sea of snow-white clouds reflecting
the bright rays of the sun overhead giving them a
sparkling silver finish an occasional glance at the
cluster of meters was about all the pilot had to do
during the swift time-defying trip across the ocean

  frank glanced over at his captor who was connecting
the telepathy ray onto the vision beam then he turned
once more to the scene before him

  the pilot was looking at the meters on the board a
slight frown came over his face and he rose from his
seat to study the meters closely he seemed to have
trouble in seeing for he brushed his hand across his
eyes and across the polished glass of the petrol supply
meters

  good lord he exclaimed the petrol tanks are
empty well have to drop down and wait until we get
a supply sent to us

  reaching for the altitude meter he turned the adjust-
ment key setting the meter needle at zero or sea level
he then switched the automatic radio control off and
the monster ship tilted slightly forward on a long slow
descent it gradually approached the surface of the
water below there was no call to the control room
from the passenger deck and no excited rush by the
crew to determine the nature of the trouble they all
believed that the fuel tanks were empty for the tele-
pathy ray had everyone on the ship under its control
scarcely had the craft hit the water when the little
white plane dropped down beside it and the baggage
room guards under the influence of the telepathy ray
opened the door on the south side

  frank was watching closely he was positive that there
was something behind the sending of the box on that
cruiser a trap of some sort with excitement shining
in his eyes he watched the man step from his plane
into the baggage room the four guards stood obedi-
ently aside and the visitor quickly spying thef box
picked it up tucked it under his arm and bowed him-
self gracefully out a moment later the plane was
climbing into the air again and was soon lost in the
clouds

  franks hopes sank within him for he had counted
on an attempt of some sort to battle the raider he
feared that riel had planned such an attempt but did
not know the full power of the ray and now with
the plans of the light wave receiver in his power
the wizard was liable to do anything he had obtained
from the world all that he desired and probably would
start his reign of terror to show the multitudes his
power he was even likely to keep his threat of plung-
ing the world into a gigantic struggle of extermination

closing in

wearily frank removed his head set and
turned around to see old jolsen at his test bench
working on a box of electrical equipment he was
examining the wiring in the interior of the cabinet
carefully making adjustments and repairs

  the plans will be here by three oclock he an-
nounced good naturedly looking around at frank i
have a model of the light wave receiver here i
copied it from the inventors first model by the aid of
my vision ray if i had had the other ray at the time
i would have stolen the chemical formula from his
mind that is all i need to complete the receiver the
formula shows how to mix the chemical solution that
is used to filter the waves through

  frank turned once more to the vision ray he knew
how to control it now and his strange host raised no
objection except to keep the controls of the telepathy
ray secret swinging the ray along the sky he soon
succeeded in finding the raider plane it was approach-
ing the island gliding down onto the water the plane
was guided up to its place beneath the low hanging
trees and the man stepped out and disappeared

  not being familiar with the pressure adjustments
frank was unable to penetrate the tree barrier and he
decided to wait until the man came into sight again
he wondered why the plane had come down by the
island instead of speeding to the scientist with the
coveted plans he would have thought that the man
was intending to wait until dark so that there would
be less danger of being detected he discounted that
notion when he remembered that the scientist had said
the papers would arrive during the afternoon further
there was no need for the plane to fear any police
while the ray was able to keep them off he suddenly
noticed something moving in the water coming into
view from behind the trees on the other side of the
island it was a submarine cruising with decks awash
the observation tower only was above the water it
was moving swiftly around the island and was soon
coming towards him and he quickly guessed that the
submarine was a part of the old wizards equipment
used so that his location could be reached with little
chance of detection

  wallace followed the submarine for about an hour
then swung the ray idly through the sky looking for
new scenes of interest his attention was drawn to a
fleet of planes approaching there were eight of them
in the group flying abreast of one another with a
distance of one-half mile between them as he swung
the ray from side to side he looked over the fleet he
could form no idea of their distance from him but
was thrilled to see that they were coming directly
towards him if it was an attempt to locate the base
he decided that he would assist them by letting them
have the ray to follow

  wondering if there were any more craft in the air
approaching he started swinging the ray around in a
circle six more planes were approaching from the
northeast but to the north the sky showed no signs
of any aircraft although in the new york-london air
lane an occasional plane could be seen making the
ocean hop around to the west the ray swung and
here he detected a group of about twenty ships spread
out in the same formation as the fleet in the east

   his heart began beating quickly with the excitement
for there was no doubt of it now they were all police
planes those from the west he recognized as the
american atlantic police he glanced over at the
scientist fearful lest the old man would get suspicious
of something and take a look at the air then he shut
the vision ray off thinking there would be a better
chance of the old man forgetting it

   for over an hour frank sat and watched the master
working on his light wave receiving device and
as the minutes passed he pictured in his mind the semi-
circle of planes that were undoubtedly closing in on
the wizards base how close the planes were he had
no idea but he was determined to do his best to keep
the wizards mind off the vision set as long as possible

   a red light on one of the panels of the main switch-
board lit up and old jolsen fairly leaped for the door
which led to the small dining room disappearing for
a moment and quickly reappearing carrying carefully
	air wonder stories

the box that a few hours ago had been taken from the
cruiser with trembling fingers he tore off the cover
and began removing the papers on top the box still
contained much material for he had picked the drawing
off the very top and soon a square package was uncov-
ered as he drew it out and began to carefully unwrap
it a look of suspicion came into his eyes quickly he
went to the experimental bench and came back with a
square cabinet with two meters on the top carefully
placing the cabinet on the table he turned a knob and
looked at the meters both remained still but as he
turned the knob further one moved over the scale to
the right his face turned white with anger as be
saw the needle move

  they shall pay for this be stormed and springing
to the vision ray quickly adjusted his head set and
swinging the beam across the sky soon spotted the
british police planes

  oh my hearty friends he exclaimed swinging
the ray around it was clever of you to hide the radio
set in the box of plans but now that you have located
me you shall lave another demonstration of my
power

  he soon found the american fleet that were steadily
approaching m the same order the other odd planes
now formed almost a complete circle around them

  we shall witness another aerial combat he said
in a lower voice through the system addressing frank
we shall pitch the british fleet against the american
planes they are well armed and we will be furnished
with real amusement

escaped

frank was frozen with horror he made up his
mind that he would not stand by and see the devil
repeat the massacre he would wait until the wizard
was ready to throw the ray on and he would hurl him-
self on him in one desperate chance to save the fleet
or keep the ray off them until they were overhead

  he thought little of his own danger his main pur-
pose was to prevent the deadly ray from being used
quietly he disconnected his head set from the system
but still kept the mask on and watched the scene dosely
the planes came closer and the wizard reached for
the switch he would wait until the old man threw
in the switch as there would be time then to pounce
on him and throw off the switch before the planes
would meet the switch moved under the finger of
the gloating maniac and with a twist was thrown in

now watch them make a left turn he chuckled

  frank was posed in his chair ready to tear off the
head mask he relaxed a bit and stared into the scene
the planes were still coming ahead the scientist opened
and dosed the switch again the planes still came on
straight towards the ray with an oath he swung the
beam around to the american fleet and the tdepathy
ray was again switched on frank with face set and
heart pounding watched would they defy it were
both fleets protected from the ray

  snap the switch sprung into place and two faces
seemed glued to the vision reflectors franks heart
missed a beat he breathed a silent prayer of thanks-
the planes were coming on with face white and hands
shaking old jolsen threw off his mask and grabbing a
tester from the bench sprang to the board testing dif-
ferent wires and coils and after making a couple of
adjustments returned to his chair the ray was again
trained on the british fleet with no effect like a

group of merciless avengers they approached defying
anything to stop them

  a close-up of one of the planes was quickly pro-
duced by the now nervous sdentist and again the ray
was turned on against them but not even a wink of an
eye caught the glance of the old man he was beaten
his most powerful weapon was usdess and his aveng-
ing foes were tightening the circle around him carry-
ing full bomb racks they would soon be swarming
over the laboratory with him at thdr mercy he pushed
a button and rising from his chair hastily gathered up
the light wave drawings as the butler entered
quick screeched the old man get the submarine
for instant departure the servant with a startled
look on his face quickly disappeared

  the now thoroughly alarmed criminal took time
enough to smash some of his most important secrets
and turned to frank

  come on hurry up out of this door youre coming
with me you know too much to be let loose

  frank was about to resist when two seamen entered
the room

  hurry professor for they will soon be over us
one spoke to the old man

  realizing the folly of resisting such a cold-blooded
man with two allies frank followed the two men out
of the door with the sdentist behind leaving the
house they started down a path between some tall
trees the two men in front broke into a run and were
soon on the edge of the island where a small boat was
beached hie submarine could be seen farther out in
the water frank saw his chance with a sudden twist
he turned and before the surprised criminal had time
to offer resistance he was on him and they went down
to the ground with a thump

  frank heard the shouts of the two men and the
pounding of their feet up the path desperately fight-
ing himself free of the old mans dutches he sprang
into the forest and raced for his life across the island
he knew that his foes time was too precious to spend
it in chasing him looking around he saw the two
sailors struggling with the man down the path to the
boat he saw the boat put out and reach the sub-
marine which without a moments delay submerged
he scanned the sky and detected the small specks of the
american fleet approaching from the west and for-
getful of his own danger leaped around waving his
hands and shouting for joy

  with a deep hum the planes approached overhead
and commenced circling the island a small dark object
dropped from one frank saw it and crouched at the
base of a tree with his head in his arms

  b-o-o-m the island shook from the impact b-o-o-m
a second one burst close to the building with a blinding
flash tearing one side away another one came a
closer hit and fragments of the building in which he
had spent so many hours of mental torture were hurled
in all directions the building became a complete wreck
another blinding flash a deafening stunning roar and
frank suddenly became dizzy he groped for the tree
missed it and fell to the ground

how riel did it

walt aces return to consciousness was accom-
panicd by a headache he felt his head there
was a bandage around it lying still with his eyes
dosed he soon recalled the events of the bombing he
listened but all was quiet then the bombing must
have ceased he thought wearily opening his eyes for a
the planets air master	

second he was forced to close them again because
of the strong light that met his gaze

  how are you feeling old timer

  a shiver of joy ran through him at the sound of
the voice it was riel turning over on his side
towards the familiar voice he opened his eyes again
he was on a bed in a small room and riel was sitting
on the bedside he raised himself up a bit

  what hit me he asked

  fragment of a shell riel replied i was quite
worried about you as we dropped the bombs but
we had to do it we dared not land knowing the
power and cleverness of the man we were dealing with
we had to take the chance and wreck him before he
could turn some other infernal invention against us

  well im out of it so thats that was the smiling
reply then wallace added more seriously but he
got away in the submarine

  yes one of the planes spotted him as he dived
but before we could get him lie had dropped so deep
that we were unable to trace him however the planes
are watching for him and weve a chance to get him
yet

  but tell me riel how did you buck that damned
ray

  well replied the detective i had an idea when i
first met you in new york that a ray was being used
and i found proof enough during our trip to london
on reaching england i commenced to put into effect
a plan that i had been working on prior to my meeting
you this was a plan to make a person proof against
the ray the idea was to use a metal cap constructed
of soft iron which i was sure would absorb the mag-
netic waves of the beam and carry them around the
head and in that way prevent them from passing
through and affecting the brain to make a test of
this cap i ordered that special you thought there
were only two of you on the liner but there were three
for i was on board

  you were

  yes i had my assistant prepare a corner of the
baggage room for me and place a large cylinder of
cast iron in the corner during the night while you
were asleep i went out and had a metal cap made to
fit my requirements and stole on board the liner and
crawled inside the large cylinder that was placed on its
end when the vision ray was put on the ship the
next day only the control room received any attention
from the wizard and i was not seen the metal
cylinder absorbed the ray as i expected of course
if he had used a greater pressure on the vision ray
he could have penetrated through the cylinder but
as it was he didnt for he paid little attention to any
part of the liner outside of the control room when
the telepathy ray was put on you two were effected
but my brain remained clear which was proof that the
cap was able to deflect it being free of the ray and
having the spy under lock i went ahead with my
plans and preparations with little trouble after return-
ing to london i equipped a number of our police
with such hats skillfully covered to resemble the
standard police helmet and had the central office in-
form the united states secret service bureau of our
plans with a suggestion to co-operate and a request to
equip twenty planes and crew to our specifications

  the united states readily took part in our plans
and under my directions equipped a fleet of planes
they also offered use of the light naval cruiser lib-
erty which is the worlds swiftest boat of that class

on which you are riding now on your way back to new
york we then had both governments draw all air
and sea craft from the zone where we had an idea the
criminals base was we were about ready to send
the box of plans which contained a radio set that gave
out the signals when the air tragedy took place which
one of our planes witnessed that incident caused us
to equip a much larger force with protective hats the
extra force to scout the sky and prevent any ship
caught by the ray from doing any harm then men
in our police ships with clear heads would be at an
advantage over any plane under the power of the ray
and would be able to use paralyzer gas bombs on them
putting them out of commission long enough to allow
us to finish the raid

  the box we sent on the liner contained a radio
device that was controlled by a sort of altimeter the
radio set contained a device with a set of codes on a
cylinder which was run by clock-work ten different
messages on this cylinder were each thrown into circuit
at a certain reading of the altimeter that is when
the radio box was on a plane at ten thousand feet the
meter reading at that point would cause the contactor
to slide along the cylinder and send out a certain line
of code at sea level the meter would read zero and
the contactor would shift on the cylinder giving out a
signal that we knew indicated that the box was at sea
level from the moment we placed the box of plans
on the cruiser our planes that were spread out all over
the atlantic between america and england were listen-
ing to it and checking it on their direction and location
indicating instruments

a matter of a tin hat

as the box was carried out by the cruiser and

  x later taken from the plane and speeded away
i sent out the necessary directions to the different
planes telling them what distance to keep from the
signals gradually we closed in the circle i was
about to give the signal to raid when the sea level
signal announced that the plane had come down but i
waited awhile and was surprised to notice it on the
move again and later the submerged signal told me
that they were carrying the box below sea level on a
submarine i waited until the submarine came up and
i heard the surface signal then i took a chance on the
submarine being near the base and gave the signal that
they were all waiting for in a few moments a semi-
circle of planes were closing in on that signal box with
engines at full speed each one anxious to get there
first the cruiser was only fifty miles from the spot
when she got the signal and was there almost as soon
as the planes

  but why didnt you tell me that you knew of the
ray

  it was because i thought the ray would be used
to read your mind on the trip back to new york and
if i had told you you would have had the thoughts in
your mind all the way back again if i had told you
of my plans to use the metal caps to outwit him with
you may have revealed our secret when he read your
thoughts and he would have created a living hell on
this earth before we would have had a chance to put
our plans into effect then again if i had let you
wear a metal hat so that he could not read your
thoughts then he would have probably detected it
before long

  but how did you prevent him from using the ray
to read your mind and learn of your plans he must
	air wonder stories

have known that you were assigned to the job of track-
ing him down

yes the detective answered but i held one win-
ning card the light wave receiver plans to get
them he knew that he had to play a careful game
but he could have made you reveal the place where
the plans were by using the ray on you

  he had tried it on me but was careful to use a
feeble power he knew that if he used sufficient force
to take control over my own thoughts i would notice
the effects and suspect that he was using such a ray
it was important that he keep it a secret at least until
he obtained the plans fromme in other words he
tried to get the plans from me without betraying his
ray however he did use the ray on me with sufficient
force to make me do his bidding and that was when
you and i gave up the papers on the liner coming to
london he was so positive that the plans were in the
bag that he staked all on obtaining them in that
move he lost while i obtained proof that he was using
a telepathy ray when he got the papers and found
them valueless it was too late for we were in my
house in london he doubtless realized then that i
had become suspicious of his ray and fearing that i
knew too much to be at large he held up the cruiser
that you were on thinking that you were i in an
attempt not only to remove me to where id be harm-
less against him he also made one more attempt to
learn from me the location of the papers before letting
the world know of his ray you know the rest you
know how he tried his last trick to get the plans by
trying to terrorize the police organization with his
message and how he thought he had succeeded when
we decided to send the plans and sent a message to that
effect he knew by then that i was aware of his ray
and realized the power of it he thought that i would
give up the plans to prevent him carrying out his word
but your vision screen was it proof against the
telepathy ray

the

   the magnetic field turned his vision ray and the
 telepathy ray left with no conducting path was unable
 to penetrate the walls of the house with sufficient
 strength to be effective

   then he knew that you could stop his telepathy
 ray

   at that range yes but he no doubt knew also that
 i could not have used the field to protect the planes in
 an attack on him for with the ray being used at short
 range it would no doubt have been strong enough to
 break down the protecting fields i thought at first of
 using the field as protection in an attack on him but
 finding that it was not to be depended on at close
 range i was forced to wait and find a better protection
 which i did by use of the metal caps so i believe
 that i did the best i could it all turned out as well
 as we could have hoped for we have broken his
 power and he is being hunted by every power in the
 world

   we have located the position of his second island
 by means of the signals received from the box while
 it was being transferred from plane to submarine and
 a fleet of planes have been sent over to it he wont
 land there and it will be difficult for him to get
 anything to build another base with when he finds the
 eyes of the world watching for him

   the box that he got contained the genuine drawings
 of the light wave receiver but they are valueless for
 i discovered that a radio company in france was mak-
 ing some secret tests on a new kind of wave and some
 experts checking up on the signals received by the
 light wave receiver found that they were those of
 the french station our master criminal was so posi-
 tive of the power of his devilish devices that he over-
 looked the most important thing he forgot that there
 was a possibility of his power being checked by some
 little thing say for instance a little tin hat

   yes came wallaces drowsy reply from the depth
 of the pillow a little tin hat

have to wait until we have observed his condition
before you can see him will you please wait in the
anteroom we will call you after the examination
thats right joan dear i said taking her by the
arm perhaps bob should not be disturbed now let
us wait

  as we walked toward the end of the long ward i
noticed signs of life in the forms laying between the
sheets on the cots nurses here and there were holding
glasses of water to the patients lips and i felt en-
couraged but bob allison had been injured i re-
membered these men i presumed had not that
much out of his favor yet i could not suppress a
feeling that he would live

  for what seemed hours we sat in the anteroom
of the government hospital nestling almost under the
rising dome of point loma joan stared straight
ahead of her in stony silence i toyed apprehensively
with my helmet occasionally the door opened and
nurses entered the room and departed saying nothing
to us presently the knob on the door leading out into
the field opened and i was surprised to see the portly
frame of my dear friend senator allison enter it
with a stride i was at his side gripping his hand
joan sat unmoved

  jim holdon  my friend said surprised wheres

bob jim dont tell me he is- have you

seen him jim

  well frank i said i cannot say joan and i
are waiting until he has been examined but i have
a feeling that hell get along

  youve seen him jim he asked staring at me
questioningly

  y-y-yes frank i answered evading his eyes i-
i-have seen him

  is that joan sitting over there jim he asked
suddenly

  it is frank i answered shes taking things
pretty hard bob stopped to see us in denver just
before the annihilator took off and was drawn into
the up-draft

  i turned to joan and nodded she came forward
falteringly

  joan dear i said placing an arm around her
waist this is bobs father you remember him
dont you

  im pleased to see you senator allison she said
and i am very glad you are here i was wondering
if youd come

  i came as soon as i could he said youve
grown to be a beautiful woman joan you were just
a little child when i saw you last back in washington
thank you senator she said hanging her head
modestly im getting impatient waiting for them to
tell me that we can see robert cant you do some-
thing this suspense is terrible

  i	winked at senator allison his brows went up in
understanding surprise

  i want to see him too joanie he smiled anxiously
but i think it best to wait until they call me

  i think so too joan i put in

  well alright ill have to-

  before joan could finish her resigned sentence the
door opening from the ward swung wide and a nurse
stepped in smiling we stared at her questioningly
her smile made my hopes race high

  lieutenant allison is doing nicely she said you
may see him now she beckoned us to follow her

  not knowing what to expect we walked tensely
through the door and into the ward the cots were
filled with sitting and reclining men some smoking and
chatting with their friends how quickly they had cast
off the death-like embrace of unconsciousness i
thought as we walked between the rows of cots

  finally the nurse halted in front of a door beyond
the ward and stood by while we entered i held joan
back just inside the room while senator allison walked
noiselessly to his sons bedside bob lay motionless
and pale and i was suddenly filled with fear joan
sobbed softly senator allison bent over and kissed
his sons white forehead sudden tears streaming down
his cheeks a lump rose in my throat and i looked
away

  i	felt tempted to take joan by the arm and hustle
her from the doorway it would be very hard to look
upon the death mask that i felt had closed bobs eyes
forever and in reverence i wanted to depart and leave
his father alone with him i lifted my hanging head
and looked out into the hallway for an instant and
then joan tugged at my arm i turned there was
a movement under the bed coverings as bob lifted a
hand out of their confines his eyes opened and closed
weakly as his hand met his fathers shaking palm
dad he said weakly youve come

  yes son his father whispered i flew here as
fast as i could how do you fee bob

  oh ill get along alright dad he managed to
smile my chest pains a little but thats to be ex-
pected have you seen joan holdon

  i have son senator allison replied with a happy
grin shes here waiting to see you

  joan flew from my arms to the bedside and kneeled
down beside it sobbing

  joan bob cried softly ive been hoping you
would come

  oh robert she sobbed you dont know what

ive gone through-with you hurt and beyond my

reach its been so terrible

  everything is alright now joan he whispered
placing a hand on her head and lifting her face up to
him i think it was rude of me to get hurt after
asking to take you to a dance with me perhaps you

will dance with me later joan-will you

senator allison motioned me to follow him out of
the room we stepped out as joan kneeled closer
yes robert she said blushing ill dance with

you-all through life if you will hurry and get

well

  i cant help but get well now joan dear bob
smiled happily

oil airplane engine reduces
flying cost

the details of the diesel airplane engine
developed by the packard motor company
reveal that the cost of fuel shows a consider-
able reduction from that of the ordinary air-
plane engine on a test flight from detroit
to langley field va tbo fuel used was 
worth of crude oil against an ordinary gasoline
cost of  eighty gallons of crude oil would
carrr a plane equipped with the new motor
as far as  gallons of gasoline the crude
however weighs about a pound to the nllon
more than does a high-grade gasoline large
scale production of the motor at the packard
company plant is cow in progress

safety devices aviations
greatest need

devices that will increase the safety of
planes and prevent the spins that cause
so many accidents are declared by professor
edward p warner former assistant secretary
of the navy for aeronautics to be aviation s
greatest need professor warner was speaking
at the yearly gathering of aviation executives
and scientists at langley field virginia re-
search work is already progressing in an at-
tempt to promote air safety another need
expressed is that of instruments which should
warn a plane of the nearness of another this
will become increasingly important as the num-
ber of planes in the air increases studies of
the effect of ice formation on planes were also
made and the effect of air velocity on pro-
peller efficiency was studied in a gigantic wind
tunnel where a plane was mounted in a twenty-
foot air stream travelling  miles per hour

folding wings found advan-
tageous to flyers

as a result of a survey made by the fair-
child aviation corporation planes having
folding wing are shown to be much more ad-
vantageous to flyers than those not similarly
equipped the crowded condition of many
hangars makes the possibility of an itinerant
flyer finding space for his craft very unlikely
but of the flyers who have reported in the sur-
vey many have been able to get parking
space with folded wings when other flyers
have been turned away furthermore since
most airports have a storage charge depending
on the wing spread a great saving in rent is
afforded those having folding wing planes in
many instances the reduction has been as much
as fifty per cent

airplane engines are
inexpensive

any popular opinion to the contrary the
factory cost ot airplane engines per horse-
power is considerably less than that of marine
engines and approximately on a par with that
of railroad locomotives asserted george j
mead of the pratt  whitney aircraft co
in a paper delivered by e a ryder of the
same company before the milwaukee section of
the society of automotive engineers

the usual cost of  per horsepower for
airplane engines is much lower than tor marine
steam and diesel engines which mr ryder

gigantic bombing planes for
next war

a nine-ton automatic plane carrying
bombs which will have attached to it a
smaller plane containing the pilot is pictured
for the next war according to an article in
air travel news the monster would weigh

	pounds in all and hold  pounds of
high explosives already tests have been made
on tbe control of planes from the ground and
the proposal made by lester bartow is for the
giant ship there would be two separate planes
tho one for explosives and the small ship for
the pilot tbe smaller is carried under the
latter in the undercarriage after the pilot has
launched the larger in tbe air set the auto-
matic controls on its destructive path he can
be released and jly back the author of the
article pictures hundreds of such machines fly-
ing over enemy territory and at a prede-
termined point dropping their terrible bombs
over an enemy city or territory such craft
would have a range of  miles

babson sees auto-plane in
future

the day of the small plane is approaching
says roger babson business expert accord-
ing to air travel news its coming will in-
fluence considerably our national life the
plane be visions will rise and descend vertically
will have folding wings will be able to land
on water and run through tbe streets like an
auto in the future the chief means of travel
on land air and water will be the airplane
because of the increase in air traffic all wires
and smokestacks will be removed and so tbe
campaign for smoke prevention and better-
looking cities will be aided

army tests propellers in
bomb-proof shelter

tn a ts phut dedicated to aeronautical
 research tbe army air corps will begin 
series of tests to promote grester safety for
commercial aviation the first tests will be of
propellers in a bomb-proof shelter capable of
withstanding the impact of a -inch shell
here on three giant stands three specially de-
signed motors ot  to  horsepower will
whirl their propellers at from  to 
revolutions per minute until the propellers ex-
plode by this means the stresses exerted on
propellers and their ability to withstand them
will be determined an exploding propeller is a
bad source of danger in accidents for tbe pro-
peller with the force of a -inch shell might
cut through tbe fuselage very easily every
phase of aeronautics win be investigated tbe
design of planes structures wing structures etc

three miles a minute for
future planes

that with tbe increasing science applied to
airplane design the plane of to-day will seem
quite antiouated ten years hence is tbe belief
of john k northrop chief engineer of avion
corporation writing m tbe new york americon
with the decrease in weight of planes by tbe
use of new strong alloys such as duralumin
other alloys and beryllium the drag on the
planes has been reduced by the introduction
of enclosed motors of the in-line type the
parasitic resistance of exposed motors will be
done away with three miles a minute should
be the cruising speed of planes of tbe future

with an altitude of  to  feet above

sea level at this level the resistance is less
and greater power can be developed



foolproof plane successfully
tested

a plane which can neither stall nor go
into a tailspin has been successfully tested
at tbe holmes airport by the gates aircraft
corporation which has the american rights for
it tbe plane is a belgian and is known as
tbe r s v it has interchangeable wings and
can be used as either a monoplane or a biplane
it has been used for four years by tbe belgian
air force as a training plane without a single
mishap during the tests the pilot put the
plane through every conceivable stunt to try
to make it stall or spin but it refused he
even throttled it at the peak of a steep climb
but the plane recovered and went into a glide
operated as a biplane it has a very slow land-
ing speed so that it can be landed hands off
then it can be operated as a speedy monoplane

new high speed boeing plane

production will soon begin on a large
scale of a new plane by boeing built on
the type used by captain baker on bis
panama-united states dusk to dawn flight
in this flight capt eaker obtained from it
a speed of  miles per hour the new
plane will be a alngle seater with an over-
all wing span of  feet it is quite similar
in design to the large number of boeing
pursuit planes used in army maneuvers it
will weigh  pounds completely fueled
and is powered with a so horsepower pratt
and whitney wasp motor it will have a
black fuselage red tall and cream wings
struts and landing gear

airplanes smaller and larger

two definite trends in airplane desifn
toward smallor and toward larger units
are perceptible to bnea boaal president of
the american aeronautloal corporation aa
reported in aero digest the flrat tendency
toward small planes is aimed for the use as
sport and individual flying these planes
according to mr boss will hav a power
of from b to  horsepower they will be
light swift and inexpensive the second
tendency toward the heavy powerful craft
is for use in commercial and mail service
these planea are being built with power
planta of  horsepower or more they
are however more efficient per pound of
plane than the smaller units the build-
inr of the powerful plane la particularly
necessary for seaplane service where the
rough water will often hinder the take-off
unless sufficient power is developed

new monster of air to come

as a result of the air maneuvers of the army
air corps a new monster fighting plane
of the air is likely to evolv which will make
warfare a more terrible thing than ever it
will be a great armored bomber carrying a
heavy load ot destructive bombs and yet equipped
with plenty of machine guns to protect itself
against light enemy aircraft it was found
in tbe last war that the heavy moving bombers
were easy prey to the light pursuit plsnes of
the enemy and tbe bomber could be destroyed
before its protecting planes could get into ac-
tion now the bomber will be its own pro-
tector and invincible against all ordinary air-
craft it will sweep over enemy territory with
its great bombs released on the way then
there will be in the new scheme a fast bomber
carrying lighter bombs a speedy pursuit plane
and high altitude planes tor malting observa-
tions tactics and strategy of tbe air with
mass movements will be tbe feature of tbe next
war instead of individual feats of mastery

operation



landings atop buildings
being tested

the feasibility of undint and making  take-

x off of airplanes from the tops of large build-
ings in congested areas of large cities is being
tested by the american air transport asso-
ciation the importance of such tests is equal
to that of the end to be gained-the long awaited
solution of the air traffic problem- the device
being used in the test is a platform  feet
long and  feet wide it would revolve allow-
ing a pilot to take off with the wind it would
also be inclined  degrees allowing him to
start his take-off at the top of the incline and
be aided by the force of gravity to land the
plane he would land at the foot of the incline
and be gradually stooped by a series of spring
cable reurdets a huge reversible fan would
also be used to create a suction to keep the
plane from bounding off after landing

motorless flight with gliders

dr wolfgang klemperer bo is

mainly credited with the great development
of interest in gliding and soaring in germany
and is now in this country promoting glider
activities and assisting the goody ear-zeppelin
corp stated at the recent aeronautical meeting
of the society of automotive engineers in

mail not passengers profitable
says zeppelin director

even at  a head as fare to carry
passengers across the atlantic passengers
are not as profitable as mail declared director
colsman of the graf zeppelin organization as
reported by wythe williams to the new york
times for the space that he occupies for his
weight and the weight of the food kitchen
equipment and other necessities of his comfort
the passenger decidedly takes second rank as
against mail or even freight dr  colsman
estimates that on the average an airship making
continent-to-continent service would be only half
filled thereby reducing the average fare to
 on a south american tnp the fare
per passenger would be only  for this
the passenger with all his accessories takes up
 pounds fifteen passengers as an aver-
age therefore would net the company 
tor the  pounds they take up if the
ship were to carry  letters however
which would take up only  pounds the
company would receive at twenty-five cents per
letter  from a standpoint of ftrict
economics therefore passenger business is not
profitable

plane to meet ships  miles
at sea

aship-to-shore service will be estab-
lished shortly on the united states lines
inc which operate the leviathan the plane
will meet the ship  miles at sea swoop
down and pick np mail without stopping by
this method a whole day is expected to be cut
from trans-atlantic mail time further a plane
can leave the newark airport which will be
the eastern base and carry mail to the ship
fifteen hours after it has sailed from new york
with a ship like tho leviathan  miles out
the plane travelling at  miles an hour woulu
pick up mail from the ship and return to its
base all within four hours a huge burinedi
plane one of the largest built in this country
will be used to inaugurate the service and
will have a cruising radius of  miles it
is also believed that the plane will deliver and
take off passengers from the ships thus allow-
ing a late arrival to catch the ship long after
it has sailed or to be landed in  new york
hours ahead of the ship if be is in a hurry

war games prove value of
planes

the results of the ohio aerial war-game
have proved beyond question the ability of
planes to perform what is required of them
this battle fought according to major gen-
eral nolan for the higher tactical instruction
of general officers has yielded many interesting
conclusions the bombing of new york was
carried out by lieutenant moon despite many
difficulties his refueling plane by which be
was to be refueled in the air forced down by
bad weather as well as his radio plane be
was still enabled to accomplish his mission
the result anvway was to prove the value of
navigation and radio in plane maneuvers the
lessons found bv the warfare are three first
that it is feasible to concentrate aircraft from
all parts of the country at a central point de-
spite adverse weather conditions second that
it is possible for craft to carry on operations
in weather far from favorable third that the
equipment of the air force is quite satisfactory
for the maneuvers practically all the available
fighting force of the countrys aircraft was con-
centrated at fairfield air depot and norton
field columbus ohio

is also valuable for gaining experience in land-
ing the glider always takes off to make an
emergency landing tailless and tandemwing
planes and slotted wings were used in gliding
before they became practical on power planes

   the principle of static flight is stank cur-
rents ot air on the windward side of a bill
along the seashore or at the edge of a wood rise
faster than the glider descends by force of
gravity by skirting along the edges of a
range of hills and making figure s the pilot
can soar sometimes for hours and cover con-
siderable distances

   the duration record is now over  hours
the distance record over  miles and the maxi-
mum speed between  and  miles per hour
mostly laterally to the wind there are places
in america said doctor klemperer where it
is feasible to make a glider flight of  miles
and be believes it is possible to make a flight
from los angeles to san francisco

    aviation news of the

  portrays in plain yet concise lan-
  guage every important aviation
  advance during the month no-
  where can the average reader get
  such a wealth ol accurate and vital
  information condensed into such a
  small volume some  aviation
  magazines and newspapers are
  utilized by oor editors in the com-
  pilation of this department the

safe flying lies in better
instruments is belief

in order to test whether the safety in flying
will be increased by the use of better instru-
ments lieut alfred f hegenberger has been
assiped to wright field dayton ohio to
conduct a series ot experiments says air travel
news lieut hegenberger was the navigator
of the first plane to fly from america to
hawaii and is an exponent of the better in-
struments idea he believes that the mag-
netism of the earth can be used to hold planes
to their course and that by devices attached to
the earth inductor compass a large part of the
human element can be avoided planes equipped
with the earth inductor compass will merely
set the compass for their route and the device
on the compass will correct the plane if it
goes off the route

new parachute can support
plane

anew parachute  feet in diameter has
been designed bv major e l hoffmann
of the anny air corps which is capable of
supporting an airplane in the air and letting it
down gently says air travel news a recent
test was made of it by hanging on to it a
-pound bomb from an altitude of several
thousand feet the parachute let the bomb
down to the ground gently but then much
trouble was had in getting the chute to re-
lease the bomb there was a tendency to drag
it over the field despite all the efforts of the
attendants the air corps is now at work on
a device which will automatically release the
weight on reaching the ground otherwise due
to the tendencv of the chute to race across
the ground with its weight and its unwilling-
ness to deflate it will be useless

flat spin to be studied

studies of the peculiarities of the flat
spin which occurs to planes often with
serious results are being undertaken by tho
national advisory committee for aeronautics
at the langley field laboratory says a despatch
in the new york times a vertical tunnel
will be constructed at a cost of  to aid

in the laboratory tests it is believed that
study of the flat spin might lead to a method
of utilizing it for better landing of planes
means have been found to eliminate the spin
where it is desired but the possibility of put-
ting it to beneficial use animates the experts
it has been found very often in military
maneuvers that planes which cannot spin are at
a disadvantage for many an aviator has been
able by a spin to work himself out of a tight
place

albany-new york in half time
now

an illustration of how quickly the speed
of our best trains is becoming antiquated
came with the test of an air liner plying
from albany to new york with the twenti-
eth century limited tho plane left new
york arrived in albany exchanged greet-
ings with the mayor and returned to new
york in s minutes the time consumed
by the twentieth century is  minutes
from new york to albany the plane is
one of seven which will begin a regular
new york-albany service to run on a sched-
uled time of seventy-five minutes between
the two cities

four day service to hawaii
now

air mail freight and passenger service be-
tween san francisco and honolulu on a
thirty-six hour schedule is the plan of the
goodyear-zeppelin company with new york
now only  hours away from san francisco
the company officials expect that a -hour
service from the west coast to honolulu will
put hawaii within four days travel of new
york the company is at work on two lighter-
than-air ships with which they expect to in-
augurate the service these ships are being
constructed simultaneously with two gigantic
navy dirigibles at akron ohio akron it is
expected mav be the eastern terminus of the
air line the first ship will be launched in
the spring of  to be followed  months
later by the second the dirigibles will be al-
most twice the size of the graf zeppelin having
therefore a capacity of about  cubic
feet they will be filled with helium instead
of hydrogen the united states has already
enough helium to fill our airship needs and
in fact our supply of it will make us the world
center to fill the needs of the rest of the world
the company is negotiating for a contract to
carry government mail across the pacific if
the line proves successful it might be extended
to the orient and australia thus with the
english air lines that have been established to
india travel across three-quarters of the globe
by air will be possible

radio sky road hoped for
aviation

phe construction of a road in the sky for

   aircraft by means of radio is the plan on
which aeronautical and electrical engineers are
working in the recent war games where a
bomber made his way to new york through
adverse weather the communication by radio
informing the bomber of his position and the
weather ahead at all times proved its worth
the army bomber used non-directiona radio
but what the engineers hope to do is to build
directional beams in the sky by which an avi-
ator can tell at all times whether he is on the
right path direction beams have failed in the
past because they had a tendency to dip into
the ground when they approached ore deposits

pilots flew blind with the aid of directional
beams one of the pilots traveling from the
cleveland airport to hadley field n j
landed at bellefont pa where he was informed
that the weather was almost impossible to see
through the pilot however went on through
the fog where beacon lights were bidden and he
was guided only by the radio beam broadcast
by the department of commerce the pilot
concentrated only on the dots and dashes com-
ing from the receivers clamped to his ears
these dots and dashes told him on what side
of his path be was he traveled safely through
the fog and landed at hadley field

favors aviation course

editor air wonder stories

i have just received the first copy of alt
wok dm stobies so i have not had a chance
to read it as vet i have a suggestion to
make which i think would please many of the
readers of this magazine

why not use a page or so from month to
month and give the readers a course in aviation
so that the ones that arc not up to the minute
in aviation would understand just what happens
when a plane flies also it would be a good
start to anrone who intended to take up avia-
tion as a business or career and would make
the thinkers think a little more deeply on the
subject

i am very much interested in aviation myself
and hope you will be able to do this

the idea of putting the authors pictures with
their stories both in science wonder stories
and air wonder stories is a good one it
gives the readers a chance to be almot per-
sonally acquainted with the writer of the stories

wishing the magazine success

         anthony samartino

philadelphia pa

as mr samartino will notice beginning next
month there will be an aviation forum in
which any reader mar have answered any ques-
tion on aviation wo believe in this way that
the educational value will be given according
to his idea later on there may be the pos-
sibility of extending this department never-
theless we appreciate mr samartinos sugges-
tion- editor

questions men with wings

editor air wonder stories-

i have just finished reading the first issue of
air wonder stories and while they are fresh
in mv mind will render my opinion i must
say that you have an unusual magazine-i be-
lieve there is nothing like it on the market and
it was a new experience for me i see that
you are publishers also of science wonder
stories which i intend to buy i dont know
which i will like better

now as to the stories the ark of the
covenant is a cracker jack ive got my own
theories about the robberies which i dont want
toa give way yet but that man macclure cer-
tainly keeps one guessing you editors must
be cruel to make a whole month pass by before
i can go on with it

islands in the air was also very good as
well as novel it was very well written any-
way the beacon of airport seven kept
me guessing up until almost the very end and
say that beacon was the roost eerie thing i
would like to sec more from mr sykes

prom what i see in the newspapers the
bloodless war isnt so far fetched in fact
i think that with congressional indolence that
what mr or i see it is t doctor  keller pic-
tures may happen certainly a rich country
like ours is an inviting morsel and how can
we be attacked these days except through the

 now i come to men with wings although
i liked the story as a story i can t just realize
the science of it just think putting wings on
men its a little too much i think that miss
stone was piling it on too thick there for
even if it were possible at all which i doubt
it would take thousands of years to do

well the aviation news was very good
give us some more of it also i would like
to see a questions and answers column for we
fledglings in aviation ive got a lot of things
i want to find out    

i guess ive rambled quite a bit but i
want to say to conclusion that i like your maga-
zine despite the punk science in men with

wlg	harvey britt

new london conn

mr britts vhd comments are quite wel-
come regarding the ark of the covenant
the editor founf themele rereading thu won-
derful story with utc as much interest as tho

first time before going into men with
wings it might be well to call mr britts
attention to the notice regarding a department
for questions and answers snch as he speaks of

the editors liked men with winas and
believe that the science of it while idealistic
is still sound the knowledge that we have of
our bodies is still of the most rudimentary
nature we are just beginning to become ac-
quainted with the all-important glands we are
still dimly conscious of the actual process of
our evolution we are in brief still ignorant
of what we are and what we can become

but we still know that gland secretions affect
our lives vitally they govern our height and
very often our mental capacity and now comes
a case in england in whifh through abnormal
gland secretions a woman began to show mas-
culine characteristics it is therefore not at all
far-fetcbed that a great scientist studying birds
shall experiment with their gland secretions and
discover which glands regulate the size of
wings then he can obtain the secretions and
experiment with map mbs stone we believe
was very scientific in her picture she showed
the evolution as a gradual one with all the
alternations of hope and fear that accompany
actual experiments and it was only after sev-
eral generations that the olated appear if
men wish wings and want them badly enough
we believe that it is probable that he shall
have them-editor

gravity repulsion seem
fantastic

editor air wonder stories

it is one thing to deal with possibilities of
the future but it is quite another to attempt
to palm off on readers fantastic absurdities
concocted in the feverish brains of over-
imaginative writers

i picked up your ant wonder stories
mildly interested to see what the new week
had brought to the newsstands you know
there is a weekly crop of magazines that like
the barnstorming tours come to make a one-
night stand i thought your magazine was one
of them

i found some stories that were fair some
good and a third mighty good-namely the
ark of the covenant but my digestive
faculties rebelled at the assimilation of islands
in the airand men with wings i must
therefore voice my rebellion

one of the most fundamental laws of the
universe is that of gravity the attraction be-
tween two bodies being proortionate to the
product of the masses and inversely as the
squares of the distances there are no ifs
ands or buts it is a rigid inflexible law
gravity does not depend on any medium for
its transmission and therefore it cannot be
shielded it strikes me therefore that mr
morrow must have had a pipe dream

as for men with wings well words fail
me remember i dont criticise tbe story
it was well written and worked out nicely but
i thought that the growing of wings was a
relic  the days of mythology i am open to
reason on the subject in fact if there is
any store where they are sold i might be in-
clined to buy a pair myself or invest a few
hundred in wings inc common but seri-
ously it seems like recreated mythology nothing
more

i am intensely interested in the magazine
however the aviation news was very well
done

              george willner
                     bronx n y

the criticism of men with wings has
been answered in our comment on mr britts
letter regarding the analysis of islands in the
air we call attention to the latest theory of
einstein gravity einstein says is magnetism
and therefore as such is susceptible to the
same laws in a recent demonstration cobalt-
steel was shown to have the faculty of acting
as a gravitational shield the exact limit of
the power of cobalt-steel has not been de-
termined we do not suggest that gravitational

repulsion will come through tbe use of cobalt-
steel as a shield nor in exactly the manner that
mr morrow suggests but we do state em-
phatically our belief that man will eventually
learn enough about gravitation to control it for
our uses in a manner outlined by mr morrow
with the cumulative effect of our scientifio
knowledge perhaps we shall have an einstein
in every generation and with each one starting
with the knowledge of the other and adding to
it his own genius the mysterious laws that
govern our universe are surely goins to be
stripped of their cloud of darkness and be un-
veiled to tbe light-editor

voices heartfelt appreciation

editor air wonder stories

   penmt me to voice ray heartfelt appreciation
for the opportunity to read your most stimu-
lating first issue of air wonder stories

   i was especially interested in men with
wings i believe that your author has pre-
sented a picture which should strike home to
everyone i take it that miss stone meant the
story to have not only a literal but also
figurative meaning the latter being the neces-
sity of the wings of aspiration to make our
otherwise commonplace life worth while she
drew a masterly picture of the group of ideal-
istic people endowed with the wings to soar
above the earthly aspiration of their neighbors
wallace me kg han
chicago iii

   we appreciate mr meeghans nice words
they are wry stimulating we are in entire
concurrence with his views on men with
wings he has seen deeply into the heart of
tbe story we believe that if aviation will do
no other thing it will give man a new mental
stimulation to a degree that he has never had
before rising unto the air and viewing bis
civilization from the height of   or

	feet he cannot help but come to a new
perspective of it and a new evaluation and
the effect of it will be surely to help him along
the road to material and spiritual progress-
editor

air wonder stories a huge
success

editor air wonder stories
congratulations - your first issue of ant
wonder stories is certainly a huge success
it contains the best collection of air stories that
i have ever seen gathered together in one
magazine in trying to determine the best
story i think that it is a close race between
the ark of the covenant and men with
wings  the story men with wings does
not contain so very much science but it is an
excellent story

   i think that dr d h keller is one of your
best writers whenever i see a story by him i
know that i am in for a treat i do not know
if h h simmons author of tbe hicks in-
ventions with a kick stories writes air
stories or not if so i think that one of his
stories once in a while would put an extra kick
into the magazine

   i am a subscriber to air wokdrr stories
science wonder storirs and science won-
der quarterly i would like very much to
know if you are going to put out a quarterly
semi-annual or annual to tbe air wonder
storirs

  hoping you great success for all tbeso
magazines

   mr taylors letter is typical of so many
that we have received complimenting us on
the first issue of air wonder stories the
reception that the first issue received was very
encouraging it looks as though air wonder
stories will become one of the potent forces
in aviation in this country pointing the road
toward future developments an announcement
regarding a possible quarterly or annual to
air wonder stories wih probably be made in
the near future-editor

how a plane operates

 editor air wonder stories

    aia won die bio its is alright victor
  macclure morrow sykes keller and stone
  are all in my opinion first-class authors i
  enjoyed each of the stories immensely even
  though i knew very little about aviation

    in your stories i felt as though i were up
  in the clouds flying with the characters and
  could look down and see tbe landscapes spread-
  ing out for miles around me then i would
  say to myself well here i am ive realized
  my ambition to fly but how does tbe darned
  thing work

    since you have been a beacon of enlighten
  mcnt on scientific things for many years i
  u a few questions
     jrolane

    	what is it that makes the thing go

    	since the plane is heavier than air what
  keeps it in the air

    	what is it that steers the plane what
  makes it go up or down or turns it left or
  right

    if you can find space in your columns 
  would appreciate very much an answer to these
  ouestiona as i know there are a great many
  like myself who are anxious to learn

              benjamin jenkins

los angeles calif

    we might say that we have anticipated the
  requests ox men like mr jenkins who are
  eager to learn tbe why and wherefores of avia-
  tion and are beginning with the september
  issue a department called aviation forum
  in which all question on aviation will bo an
  swered for this purpose we have gathered
  about us a staff of aeronautical experts to
  assist us in conducting the department

    the answers to mr jenkins questions are
  as follows

    	tbe propelling force of a plane is of
  course an engine which rotates a propeller
  the propeller in cutting tbe air at a great
  speed like a screw works columns of air back-
  ward and draws the plane

    	the sustaining force for the plane is the
  air pressure under the wings in other words
  the velocity of the plane through the air creates
  a pressure of air which acting against the
  wings sustains the plane since the air
  pressure is dependent on the velocity of the
  plane and since there is a minimum air pressure
  necessary to sustain the plane there is a mini-
  mum velocity at which the plane will remain
  in the air

    	at tbe tail of the plane is a vertical mov-
  able vane called the rudder if the foot-bar
  in the cockpit is depressed with the right foot
  tbe vane ta swung toward the right that
  creates an added pressure against the right lide
  of the vane which swings the tail around to
  the left and therefore turns the plane around
  to the right the opposite would be true in
  depressing the left foot-bar

    at the tail of the plane is a borizontsl mov-
  able vane when the pilot moves his control
  stick forward the vane is lowered therefore
  there is an upward pressure on the vane which
  tends to lift the tail this turns the nose of the
  plane down and thereby sends it toward tbe
  earth tbe oppose would be true by pulling
  the control slide back

    for banking the plane that is turning the
  thing on its side which ia necessary when
  changing direction at a high velocity there are
  the ailerons one located in the rear of each
  wing by moving the control stick to the
  right the right aileron is lifted and the left
  one lowered this creates a downward pressure
  on the right aileron and an upward on tbe left
  one thus tbe plane banks to the right to
  bank to tbe left the control stick is moved to
  tbe left--editor

refueling in air opens new
possibilities

by the establishment this year of two new
endurance records for planes made possible
by refueling in the air the possibilities of im-
proved service of commercial planet have been
opened aviation executives are becoming in-
terested in the ides and also in the tests that
have been made to allow a plane to make a
pickup of payload or fuel from the ground
while in motion competition between air-lines
is becoming keen and the difference of an hour
that represents the time for refueling on the
ground may well represent the success or failure
of an air-line

complete weather reports for
air-rail route

when the transcontinental air transport
company begins its forty-eight hour air-
rail service between new york and the pacific
coast it will have a complete weather determin-
ing bureau all its own there will be teu regu-
lar meteorological stations between the terminals
at columbus ohio and los angeles and seventy-
two additional observation stations along the
route and on off-line points to the north and
south so that no unexpected change may come
each of the main stations will be manned by
a trained meteorologist who will forward com-
plete weather reports of his particular area to
other points along the line and to pilots before
they leave for the next landing field a com-
plete radio system will inform pilots and other
stations of any unexpected change four ques-
tions will be answered by the weather service
what weather conditions prevail at the desti-
nation what conditions will be encountered
along the route what and where changes will
occur and at what altitude most favorable
flying conditions will be found

air train seen as possible now

with experiments going forward in ger-
many with the towing of gliders by motored
planes the prospects of having air trains
seem to become opened in the german tests
two or three gliders were attached in a string
after the motored plane which supplied the
power what has been visioned is that such
a train each plane loaded with freight and
having no pilot except in the motored plane
might set out across country and each of the
gliders be unhitched at its destination to
glide automatically to a landing field recent
successful tests of the pilotless airplane have
been made by the national air transport ac-
cording to reginald m cleveland in the new
york timex a plane was operated for thirty
minutes continuously withont assistance from
the pilot except occasional pressure on the
rudder bar a vane is supported on the upper
wing in the automatic device and points into
the wind a pendulum extending from the
interior of the fuselage and the vane is con-
nected to two motors one controlling the
ailerons and the other the elevators a longi-
tudinal or lateral motion of the plane causes
a similar motion of the vane and pendulum
which actuates the motors and restores the
stability

human element causes most
accidents

a survey by the department of commerce
of the causes of accidents to aircraft dur-
ing the latter half of  revealed that very
few accidents are caused by structural failure
of the plane la fact during that period no
such structural failure occurred only  per
cent of the accidents were caused by motor
failure while the failure of the human equation
accounted for more than half of the accidents
the figures seem to indicate that stricter rules
are necessary for pilots better training and
rigid enforcement of all rules pertaining to
the pilots the weather and airnort hazards
also showed a gratifying decrease from the last
period studied

inclined runway for plane

a device to enable a plane to takeoff from
an inclined  runway has been made by
c francis jenkins noted television inventor
believing that planes are capable of sustaining
in tbe air a greater weight than they can take-
off with he has constructed the chute at the
top of which the plane stands when ready for
the take-off it slides down the chute and when
it reaches the end it has a speed far greater
than that necessary for the take-off this in
the inventors opinion will eliminate tbe neces-
sity for large fields to suj
space for the usual take-off
therefore will not have to 

sity for large fields to supply the necessary

off aii

 i to go 

centers of population to find such a field

  irport operators
  so far from tbe

jenkins is also the inventor of a method of
reversing tbe motion of tbe propeller to that
a plane may have a braking effect exerted on
it after reaching tbe grounu thereby reducing
the space necessary for landing

mitchell denounces coolidge
air policy

a thorough denouncing of the air policy
of the coolidge administration is contained
in aeronautics in an article by general william
mitchell former commander of the air force
of the a e f and director military aero-
nautics u s army general mitchells in-
dictment is directly chiefly against the policy of
having the development of aviation in toe coun-
try divided among the commerce navy and

aviations past and future

mrphe strongest and most important organi-

  jl ration in america dealing with aviation is
tbe society of automotive engineers and it
it not unlikely that aeronautical engineering
may in the future become the major activity
of the society according to prof j h
parkin who is in charge of aeronautic and
research work in the faculty of applied science
and engineering of tbe umveraity of toronto

  profettor parkin recently reviewed tbe prog-
ress made by aviation during the last  years
in an oddrett before the canadian section of
the society he reminded his audience of
bleriott flight across the english channel 
yean ago in a tmall monoplane powered by a
three-cylinder -horsepower engine during
the same year the first international aviation
meet wat held at rheims france at which tbe
following recordt were established speed cur-
tiss  miles per hour altitude latham 
feet and distance farman  miles in 
hours corresponding records today are 
miles per hour  feet and  miles

army departments instead of centralised under
an aeronautics department we are entering
an aeronautics era says mitchell with air-
planes constantly attaining new records for
oeight speed endurance tbe supremacy of
aircraft in time of war has been  established
from the lessons of tests made in  on
battleships he believes that no ship can live
on the surface of the water in the face of
aircraft and in land warfare their supremacy
is also unquestioned three or four -ton

soaring bird invention ridi-
culed  years ago

ft the sessions of the august american asso-
ciation for the advancement of science 
years ago a professor lancaster presented a
paper proving that man might fly by nse of a
mechanical contrivance the professor brought
before the society a number of diagrams show-
ing that flight was possible providing tbe power
plant necessary could be obtained physicist
and mathematicians laughed at tbe old man
when he came before the convention again
his paper was censored and when be attempted
to read it he waa ordered to leave the rostrum

  the lesoon of this should sink deeply we
sophisticated modems today scoff too easily at
proposed inventions that seem revolutionary-

man has always desired to
fly says historian

the desire to fly bis not been  recent
x acquisition of nun conclude dr berthoid
laufer who his iuit written the prehiitory
of aviation which hu been published br the
field museum of natural history of chicago
or laufer traces back through mans known
history the influence of the desire to be in the
air and he finds that manv mythical heroes
have been endowed with the ability to fly
our airplanes be says can trace their
pedigree back to the kites which originated in
china our modern progress with aviation has
its background in the gradual evolution of ideas
and the experiments triumphs and failures of
manv ares an imperial flrer he savs opened
up the history of china and a royal flyer opens
up the first chapter of britains history there
are tales about aerial cars floated by copper
globes holding a vacuum and propelled by sails
and oars from india there comes the story
of early attempts at tbe construction of a
dirigible man it seems has always been en
vious of the birds

future airports to be triangular
says expert

ikof the necessity of having airports so
jl shaped that planes may land in them from
any direction the future airport will probably
be shaped as an equilateral triangle said gaven
hadden at the first annual meeting of the
airport section of the aeronautical chamber
of commerce for with  triangle a greater
amount of landing possibilities are afforded
with the minimum of area required he men
tioned also that the increased capacities of
landing fields necessary to take care of in-
creasing number of planes would tax the fields
soon not only adequate lengths of fields are
necessary but also adequate widths f c
hingsburg of the department of commerce
stated that weather service over the secondary
air network of the country would be available
on july i three hundred airports would
gather weather data on a three-hour basis for-
ward it to weather bureau stations wher
maps would be made and the data broadcast over
the radio any airport located near an airway
radio station then may tune it to receive reports
on weather visibility ceiling etc

strict flying rules now
suggested

the dances of wddents at irports where
a number of machines may wish to take-off
or land at tbe same time are very great unless
strict flying rules are effected and enforced
according to the department of commerce tak-
ing a lesson from the great european airports
tempelhof at berlin le bourget at pans and
croydon at london the commerce department
has suggested  number of rules which should

cromote safety one is that no plane shall
 fueled while tbe engine is running another
is that no plane shall taxi at faster than five
miles per hour blocks should always be placed
in front of the wheels before starting the
engine the engine shall not be started unlcs
a competent person is in the cockpit or at the
controls safe distances must always be main-
tained between aircraft landing or taking off
at the same time lighting of the ports for
night-flying shall be only in accordance with
methods approved by the department of com-
merce landing and take-off shall be made when
practical into tbe wind many other regula-
tions have been suggested regarding the method
and time of take-off and methods of rising
and of landing

new seaplane record in
germany

in a recent teat the seaplane speed record was
 topped by  miles per hour when chief
pilot starke of tbe heinkel airplane works
flying a heinkel seaplane and carrying 
pounds of extra weight nude a speed of 
miles per hour successful experiments in
germany with tbe catapulting of planes from
battleships have also been made and are
claimed to give better results than the american
method compressed air is used instead of
powder tbe plane rests on a sleigh and is
put in front of the mouth of a cylinder con-
taining compressed air at a signal tbe air
is released and the sleigh and plane are shot
in two-thirds of a second over a bridge on
rails greased with oil at the end of it the
plane bas enough momentum to rise immedi-
ately six experiments were made and were
all successful

gine by charles h chatfield and
c fayette taylor  pages illus-
trated xj inches stiff buckram
cover published by mcgraw-hill book
co inc new york city price 
up to the present time books on aeronautical
subjects have been divided into two classes-
those that are written for tbe interest of tbe
multitude and those prepared for the engineer
or technically trained persons

  to fill the gap that was evident the authors
of tbe airplane and its engine have pre-
sented a book which is especially recommended
to that great majority of readers who are more
than mildly interested in the science and prac-
tice of aviation

  several chapters in this book are devoted to
the fundamentals of airplane design the
presentation of tbe factors governing design
with tbe absence of complicated formulae can-
not but help to inform the seriously interested
reader of the importance of a thorough knowl-
edge of aerodynamics so vital to the success of
an airplane design

  the writers give complete discussion of pres-
ent day aircraft engines tbe discussion covers
not only general principles of the internal com-
bustion engine but goes further in disclosing
certain features of great importance that are
required in the adaption of a power plant in
aircraft

  additional chapters of tbe book rive the
reader a full understanding of tbe modern air-
plane and types of construction that have
proven themselves to be practical in dosing
this work presents  a complete description ot
modern navigation instruments

  this book like the a b c of aviation is a
book for beginners in fact most of tbe ma-
terial is the same as well as the illustrations
but major page has interestingly arranged the
book in the form of some  questions and
answers so that one gets his knowledge in a
sense conversationally

  the book is recommended as a desk or library
reference for it provides an easy manner of
tooking up some moot or disputed point on
aviation or its history

  an index in the back allows one to find in a
moment the subject of interest there is also
in the back a compendium of the various worlds
records in aviation for various types of craft
one who is used to hearing in a confused way
of new t records being broken every week finds
it explained when he discovers tbe fineness with
which the various craft are classified

  price 

  for one who knows next to nothing about
aircraft and wants to see whether he is innately
air-minded this book is recommended al-
though major page writes in a more-or-less
matter of face manner concerning tbe early de-
velopment of aircraft and later  successes one
gets a cumulative thrill from bis pages the
book is as simply written as is possible yet it
is never dry or uninteresting and the pro-
fusion of illustrations composing well over a
third of the space of the book gives tbe reader
pictorially what the writer gives verbally

   the book is naturally divided into a discussion
of tbe lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air ma-
chines each is gone into thoroughly showing
tbe dynamic principles upon which they operate
their cruising possibilities and then the details
of construction much that the reader has
glimpsed vaguely through the newspaper col-
umns will now become matters of actuality
once the principles of the feats the newspapers
acclaim become understood

   discussing tbe heavier-than-air craft tbe
writer analyzes each part of the machine show-
ing just what each contributes to the opera-
tion and tbe details of construction to one
thoroughly unversed in dynamics or even in
mathematics so necessary to the aeronautical
engineer the principles of aviation become clear

   the book then is one that whets the appe-
tite through the absorption of major pages
hearty enthusiasm for aviation one becomes
imperceptibly a convert his curiosity breeds
knowledge and his knowledge breeds confidence
aviation no longer is the sport of tbe dangerous
and reckless but a new thrilling and on tbe
whole safe	of transportation

 new york city price 

  this is another one of the good elementary
books on aviation that has come to our desk
it difters somewhat from the others reviewed
in this issue in that the author devotes quite a
bit of space to tbe making of models of planes
and the construction of little flying devices in
fact for one who wishes to learn about aviation
practically and at first hand the construction
of such models will serve as a practical eco-
nomical and interesting experience the writer
gives not only the dimensions necessary for
each part but also the cost of each element

  the historv of aviation ha great development
during the world war and the present status
of the industry are all treated liberally by the
author he bas also nrch material about tbe
application of varimu instruments to aircraft
notably tbe wirelesland also the elements gov-
erning the construction and operation of air-
ports and airwavs

  tbe uses of airplanes also receive the authors
attention with some fairly detailed material on
tbe passenger airways that have been developed
and the extension of existing air routes

  regarding tbe question that must be upper-
most in tbe minds of the average air enthusiast
when will individual flying become general
the author bas a very interesting statement
piloting ones own airplane he says is
not likely to become a popular mode of travel
either for business or pleasure until some
scheme for automatically stabilizing the plane
